I was wondering when it would be a good time for a 2021 graduate to apply to a position like this because I still have a majority of my CS electives to take this upcoming year. I also haven't finished my internship for this summer.

Should I wait until I take some of the classes, or does that not matter much?

I thought I was going to be set to go, since my biggest struggle has been picking which offer I wanted to take. Things are a wee bit different now...

I'm weirdly lucky to have gotten laid off from my part-time job, because I ended up qualifying for unemployment while still in college. The problem now is that the pandemic assistance ends on July 26th, which will leave me with barely enough money to pay rent even though I have four roommates.

I dreamed of moving to NYC and starting my post-grad life there, but after filling out about 500 applications over the course of three months, I've barely gotten a nibble. A few leads, a few interviews, no follow through. The only people that seem to be hiring, in NYC and locally, are looking for candidates with a bunch of experience, which is literally impossible for me. I'm INSANELY lucky to have 2.5 years of experience as a recent grad, but if I don't get a job in the next month, I'm screwed.

I am going to get a part time job at, like, Starbucks or something if I don't have a job by the end of July, but I gotta say, I'm really discouraged. I've spent the last five years of my life getting ready to enter the job force, and COVID has completely screwed over my chances of getting even a mediocre job.

My gross income is 38k. I have over 3 years of IT support experience. I have suffered from depression and anxiety my whole life, but I am a very goal oriented and motivated guy.

I have been with them for a year and 8 months now and to be quite honest, I hate it. I hated the job before I even started the role. This role primary is answering phone calls relating to anything IT such as password resets, email issues, remoting issues, etc. Most of my days are spent answering 60-70+ phone calls back to back. Between each call, we get 50 seconds to complete our ticket until we answer the next call. We are extremely short staffed and we are all burnt out.

I graduated from the Year Up program doing IT support back in January of 2018 and although it's an amazing program, I had such a hard time finding full time employment after graduation.

During the program, I was fortunate enough to had secure an internship with an insurance company for 9 months doing desktop support (which I loved) and was sad once the internship was over. 

After my internship and graduation, I was lucky to have several small contract jobs doing upgrades and refreshes, but couldn't secure a full time job with PTO, vacation and benefits which I seek for most.

So I applied to several IT entry level positions. which was  IT help desk or desktop support. I mostly applied to desktop support positions because I enjoyed it so much, but was not lucky in securing an interview for that role. I decided to step back and take on a Help desk role instead. After several interviews and rejections, I was hired as a help desk analyst in November 2018, 9 months after graduation. When I was offered the job, I wasn't really excited for it. I only accepted the position because of full time benefits and employment. I knew then I didn't want to be stuck at a call center environment, but here I am now in June 2020 with a global pandemic crisis.

Since then, I have been applying to several desktop support related roles and did secure 6 interviews so far and several other phone interviews (that didn't go beyond anything). I 100% hate my current position in help desk so every day I look for positions to move on to.

I've been rejected 6 times after interviewing with different companies. At this point I am very discouraged and feel like nothing will ever go my way. Especially since I suffer from depression and anxiety. I just don't want to be rejected again. It takes so much energy from me to prepare for interview and to fight my inner battles.

I'm so confused right now. I don't know what to do. I hate my job and dread being there everyday. I dream of the day when I can officially leave in peace to a better position. I don't know where to go or what to do anymore.

I'm trying to move onto the next phase of my adulthood to finally move out and get my own apartment, finance a used car but I can't because I'm stuck not making enough. I'm 25 and can't seem to progress in life.

What else can I do? Just continue the job search? It's so hard looking for a job especially since there is a pandemic. I feel hopeless. Tell me what to do."

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:**

LOR - only needed one for UK unis so took it from my math teacher. think it was pretty good cuz I read another student's LOR who performed the same as me in general and it was positive. also pretty sure he just took a template from the internet and substituted my name in it cuz the words seemed extremely generalised

UCAS essay for UK unis took me a day or two to write. made a few drafts and was pretty happy with the final one. Was kinda busy with exams and extracurriculars so almost forgot to submit my application and submitted on the last day like 6 hours before the deadline lol

Imperial College London interview was good. Entirely technical based, interviewer didnt even read my essay until the interview had started (and just skimmed through it). Questions increased in difficulty as interview went on and last one took a lot of time (even though it was pretty easy tbh). interviewer gave me the look ""yeah you're way off mate"" as I was finishing the last answer and gave up hope by then lmao

University of Toronto had a bunch of essays and video interviews. Worst part was each program applied to had a separate supplementary application so had to spend a lot of time on comp sci and comp eng supplementary applications, also submitted like a day before the deadline

University of Waterloo also had supplementary for comp sci and engineering. comp sci supplementary wasn't too hard but engineering's was. took a lot of time cuz they only gave us 200 characters to write what we want to accomplish at Waterloo. video interview for eng was ok i guess? also submitted on the day of the deadline

University of British Columbia (UBC) - didnt take too much time, were pretty long but more relevant to my experiences, felt good submitting the essays tbh. also submitted on the day of the deadline

**Additional Information:**

I'm still waiting on local unis in Singapore cuz they only release acceptances in mid july-august but pretty happy with my experience lol. If you're normal and not like me wherein you thrive in submitting applications at the last minute, I seriously envy you lol. Most of my apps were submitted at the last minute and it was exhausting but tbh very surprising based on the acceptances. Tbh I was aiming to come to the States in junior year (hence took SAT twice) but after evaluating the cost for uni and living expenses, it seemed unreasonable to spend like 70-80k a year for undergrad so focused mainly on Canada and UK"

I graduated last summer. I'm currently doing an internship at a bank as a software developer. I initially applied for their graduate programme, but since I didn't study CS, they gave me an internship and said that they wanted to roll me onto the graduate scheme right after. I'm very grateful for this opportunity, however, it's been rather overwhelming so far because I've spent most of the internship working from home with less support and guidance than I'd hoped.

Because of corona, my internship was extended from 3 months to 6 months. Last I spoke to my manager, he said they still wanted me for the gradaute scheme, which would now begin in September for me. I haven't signed anything yet and I'm worried that with everything going on, that the future is uncertain and I might not be given a return offer for the grad scheme.

I currently have a graduate scheme offer for an organisation working in financial regulation. It's completely different to the work I've been doing as a dev. They sent me a contract last week for a start in October, so I really  need to make a decision soon.

Should I stick it out with the software dev job and hope they do keep me on for the grad scheme, or accept the other offer and work in a different field? Should I speak to my manager again and ask about the dev grad scheme? I'm worried that if I reject the other offer, that the software dev scheme might not want me in August/September and I'll be left with nothing.

I'm also starting to worry that I'm no good as a developer, because it's all been overwhelming so far. Learning so much and trying to keep on top of things has been a struggle in this role. Is this a normal feeling? I'm hoping that the steep learning curve will go away with experience? But to let go of this role and to pursue the other one in financial regulation is equally daunting because I don't know what to expect with that, I haven't had an internship there, and what if it limits my opportunities in the future? I think software development would open up so many more opportunities for me. I feel like I'm at an impasse. I've asked my family and they don't know what the best course of action is.

Thank you if you've read this far and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. &lt;3"

In the  1st-2nd year of my uni life I was focused on competitive programming (as I came first in  a programming contest among the first year students my seniors pushed me towards it) I went to ACM ICPC regional stage during my 2nd year but did pretty mediocre results for this I was heavily demotivated and did not practice any more competitive programming since . After that  I started  learning some basic stuff  like basic Python, JS, JAVA ( I did ACM with c/cpp ) . I was not that much forward thinking and as all of my class mates did not actually do anything so I never noticed the how the time went by. But when I  started to think about my future plans like what should I do  I was stuck. I love learning about computers . But as like a lot of CS students I do not have a specific  sector that I love most , I regularly shift from one thing to another like the other day I heard about rust and was thinking about learning it 

so now you know at least  some context about me. I really want to get into the big tech companies like facebook google etc but as no one form my university has ever went to those big tech companies, I can't really follow someones footsteps or have some guidelines. I tried to find some information about getting to google  then I realized I needed a specific skills to apply for a job  no one would hire a generic CS student with no particular specialty . And doing internship isn't popular in my country . All of the students do mostly research or a project .  Now what should I do . It really frustrates me   every day."

I didn’t hear back from most of the companies and for those I got a chance to interview with, I got rejected even though I was able to solve the questions (which is so frustrating coz I’ve been grinding leectcode for ~1 year and working hard to maintain HD WAM in a top uni and build side projects). 

So I wonder how people landed their first internship without much experience and what I can do rn to improve myself to get an internship. Is it still possible to find an internship rn? 

I will graduate next year around December so I also want to know how I can increase my chance to get a grad job without internship experience (if I can’t get an internship in the worst case)

Thanks :)"

So for those who managed to get their first internship offer, would you mind sharing how you geared up yourself and what you did to successfully land an internship?

Thank you :)

1) Thanks for all the comments, I really appreciate it! And an apology to having you to hear me grumble
2) I do have side projects (from simple hello world program to desktop apps and website) on my github"
hjdoxy,45,2020-07-01,Is it really this hard to find a entry level software engineer job?,pinkycatmeow,SoftwareEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/hjdoxy/is_it_really_this_hard_to_find_a_entry_level/,"My husband has been looking for an entry level software engineer position since December 2019 without any luck. Yesterday, he once again told me that he’s got a rejection email from a company where he thought he had a great interview at. 

Back story: My husband and I are in our mid 30s living in NYC and we’ve been married for 7 years. 4 years ago he was working in sales and marketing, he wasn’t thriving and got tired of his job. He started to learn coding by himself and decided that coding is something he would be enjoy doing as a job. After some thinking, he and I both agreed that he should quit his job and go to a 3 month coding boot camp to see if this can turn into something he would be love doing. 

3 month past, after several failed attempts for the boot camp entry exams, he then decided that he wanted to get a bachelor’s degree for computer science since he realized that boot camps are not legit. He already has a bachelors degree in marketing and business. I struggled to agree with that since that would take him 3-4 more years to finish. Even though I have a pretty decent job and salary(I am not a software engineer), I still think that’s a lot burdens on my shoulder which I am not ready for. He had always make less than me before he quit his job, but I would never thought that I will have to pay for all expenses while he’s in school for 3-4 years. It’s expensive living in NYC. I disagreed at first but he insisted and got his parents involved. They begged me to let him go to school and just suck up for 4 years. they said they will help as much as possible. I looked at him and knowing that he hates his old job and I agreed. 

Luckily he was able to get his bachelors degree in computer science in 3.5 years and during this time, not only I was working full time to financially support him and myself, I was also the one that cleans and cooks since he was always busy studying. His parents did not help much as they said they would. but I was looking forward for him to finish so he can finally have a job. Because if this, I did not buy anything  nice or go to vacations for 4 years. Thinking about us finally can enjoy our lives a little bit kept me going during these 4 years. 

Little did I know, 7 month after he graduated, he still did not get an offer. He applied numerous job applications since December and got a few interviews. Right before the lockdown started for Covid, he was interviewing at 3 different companies. He said he was doing great. When covid started, 2 of the companies paused hiring. The last company had 3 technical interviews with him, on his final interview, they had 5 software engineers on the zoom call asking him technical questions and he said he aced it. We were excited and thought that this was going to be his big break. But after 2 month and several follow up emails, he got a rejection email during the lock down. Covid and the economy definitely does not help with his job searching. Finally he got an interview at a big company last week, he answered all the technical questions correctly during the interview(he asked the interviewer at the end), still a rejection....

I am emotionally and financially drained from his situation. Every time I think about his situation, I just fall into a depression episode. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel... Sorry about the ramble. But can anybody who has the experience tell me if it is true that it’s this difficult to find a entry level software developer job? Is it because he’s unlucky or is he not good enough? 

here is his programming skills he listed on his resume:

• JavaScript, jQuery, Java, PHP
• C++, Node.js, Express.js, Heroku, React and Redux, Angular
• MongoDB, mySQL, SQL
• HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS

He doesn’t know that I am posting this on Reddit. I needed some advice and insight from someone else other than him. Thanks for any feedback..


Edit: I forgot to mention that he did have 2 internships during his school years. He also is searching everywhere not limited to NYC.


Edit: thank you all for your valuable feedback. I feel a little less sad and a little more encouraged now. I wish I can help him as much as I can but my knowledge to this industry is so limited. At this point he has no choice but keep at it with your advices. Thankfully he has not been discouraged at all with the rejections and he’s been studying harder and harder. Hopefully he will get more technical interviews so that he can be more motivated. 🙏🏼"

UofT is Torin and UW is Wallace.

~

Torin sat in a study room on the 9th floor of Robarts with his friends, trying to take advantage of the extra study time provided by Reading Week. While they intended to finish their upcoming assignments and prepare for their remaining midterms, they spent their time talking about the upcoming party their frat was throwing that night.

While Torin didn't enjoy frat parties as much as going to a club, he did like that it was significantly easier to pick up girls there and that most of them were just looking for something quick. On top of that, the free alcohol was always an added plus.

After almost two hours, there was a knock on the study room door. A few of his friends groaned and rolled their eyes as one of them opened the door to reveal a group of annoyed girls.

""We have the study room booked for this time,"" one of the girls said stiffly while glaring at the group. 

The boys stuffed their unopened books back into their bags and brushed past the girls crowding around the entrance to the room. As Torin made his way out, one of the girls smiled at him and he returned a wink, causing her face to go warm. 

Once they got into the elevator, Rye hit Torin hard on the back. ""Didn't feel like getting that girl's number, Tor?"" he smirked. ""Or are you just saving yourself for something better at the party?""

Torin gave Rye a shove and they made their way towards the brown food truck for some poutine. After they all got their food, they began heading towards College Street, making the occasional joke about the bikers or a remark about an attractive girl they passed.

While checking out a girl wearing a cropped UofT rugby shirt, someone caught Torin's eye who he thought looked inexplicably out of place. He had thick-rimmed glasses, messy dark hair, and was wearing a black sweatshirt with a yellow and red crest. 

As they got closer to the boy, he stepped out onto St. George Street, his eyes focused on his phone. A biker began to ring his bell at the boy, while still going full speed, in an attempt to get him to move. Torin ran towards the boy and pulled him back to the curb by his collar, narrowly missing the biker and knocking the boy back into his arms and his poutine onto the ground.

For what felt like forever, neither of the boys moved from their position. Torin felt his heart begin to race and pushed the boy out of his arms when he realized what was happening. Now that he was close enough to him he was able to see that his sweater was from UWaterloo.

“Watch where you're going, Waterloo. You're lucky Torin wasn't too busy checking out girls to save you,"" Rye snickered from behind him. ""Guess you don't need to know how to cross a street for your Cali internship.""

The boy gave a shy laugh and rubbed the back of his neck, apologizing for what just happened. ""Come by our frat tonight, Waterloo. You’ll finally get to see what a real party looks like,"" Torin said, his heart still racing. 

""S-sure,"" the boy smiled, reaching for the flyer one of the guys held out to him.

——

It was just past 10:30 pm and the house was beginning to fill up. Torin squeezed through each room, keeping an eye out for the boy. He didn't know why, but something inside him was disappointed that he hadn't seen him yet. By now Torin usually would've been flirting with at least a couple of girls, but not this time. This time, the only thing he could think of was the UWaterloo boy. 

When he made his way into the dining room, he stopped and watched one of his friends take a few beer-pong shots before agreeing to play a quick game himself, hoping to take his mind off the boy. Once the game was over, he went outside with one of his friends to smoke a joint. He watched as more people came inside the house and had some quick conversations with a few people he knew. 

After almost deciding to roll another joint, Torin noticed what looked like the same small figure in a black sweatshirt from earlier walk up the path to the house. He dismissed himself from his friend and moved closer to the front door.

""Ten dollars,"" the bouncer said plainly. The Waterloo boy looked panicked as he fumbled with his pockets to find his wallet. ""He's with me,"" Torin said coolly, wrapping his arm around his shoulder.

The boy gave a half-smile and they made their way inside. ""What's your name again?"" Torin asked him over the music. ""Wallace,"" the boy yelled back.

He stood there while Torin seemed to think for a moment, noticing a few girls glancing at the tall, handsome boy in front of him. ""What are you doing at UofT?""

""I'm visiting my family this weekend and thought I'd take a walk around downtown,"" he replied, not wanting to show his regret for choosing UWaterloo over UofT.

Torin nodded and put his arm around Wallace to lead him around the party. Wallace blushed as Torin did this, relieved that his red face was masked by the dark room. As Wallace was shown around, he was introduced to each of Torin's friends that they ran into. Wallace couldn't even begin to imagine being friends with that many people.

After they finished going around each room, Torin smirked at Wallace and brought him to a staircase guarded by a group of frat boys who all somehow looked the same. ""Up here is where the party really starts,"" he said to Wallace before clearing a path for them to make their way up. None of them seemed to care that Torin was bringing a boy up with him instead of his usual girl. That, or they were too drunk to notice. 

The hallway upstairs was cooler than downstairs but just as dark. Wallace followed Torin down the hallway to a door near the end, trying to ignore the occasional noises coming from the rooms around them. Wallace only now noticed Torin's muscular build and how tall he really was. Just as he began to fall into a trance, he was snapped out of it by Torin suddenly stopping and looking back at him.

""I have better alcohol in here,"" Torin said quietly, letting them into what looked like his room.

Wallace's heart dropped slightly at this comment while Torin's raced faster. Once Torin and Wallace were both in the room Torin closed the door behind them and locked it. He moved closer to Wallace and looked him up and down once again, slower this time. He seemed to move closer to Wallace before walking across the room and grabbing a bottle of vodka. He twisted off the cap before taking a large swig and held it out to the dark-haired boy.

Wallace took the bottle and held it up to his mouth, coughing as the liquid burned down his throat. ""Don't drink much, do you?"" Torin laughed, taking the bottle from him and putting it down on the nearest surface.

Torin came close to Wallace and grabbed his chin, pulling it upwards towards him and kissing him gently on the lips. Torin pulled away quickly as if unsure of what he just did before grabbing him and kissing him again, harder this time. Wallace's glasses were knocked off his face but they didn't stop. Wallace kissed back, hoping he wasn't too bad at this from his lack of experience.

Soon enough Wallace found himself pushed up against a wall, one of Torin's hands around his neck and the other keeping balance against the wall. Torin moved his hand from his neck down his arm and onto his lower back, pushing his waist closer to his. Wallace lightly made a noise into Torin's mouth and ran his hand through his hair, pulling lightly as Torin bit his lip.

Wallace thought that Torin tasted like vodka and smoke, but he didn't hate it. If anything, Wallace didn't want it to stop and only found himself taking a breath when he felt lightheaded. At his next breath, Torin stopped for a moment to look at the boy against the wall, realizing he'd have to leave Toronto soon.

He kissed Wallace softly on his neck a few times before looking at him once more. Wallace looked back at him, his face blurry from his missing glasses. 

""When do you leave?"" Asked Torin quietly. ""Tomorrow,"" he replied after a short pause.

""Then we'll just have to make this night last,"" Torin said, kissing Wallace again as he led him to his bed.

TL;DR: Torin saves Wallace from getting run over by a biker and invites him to his frat party. Wallace eventually arrives to the party after Torin anxiously waited for him and they go upstairs and make out."

hjeyfl,1,2020-07-01,I can't live like this anymore,vitoremidio,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/hjeyfl/i_cant_live_like_this_anymore/,"Honestly, living with my family is just messing up my mental health. 

Before the quarantine started, I'd just come home to shower and sleep, and stay out most of the day  at college or at my work or climbing. However, having spent more than 100 days without going outside (and probably many more, since the covid-19 situation in my country doesn't look like it's going away any time soon), the little things that they do that get under my skin is just accumulating. 

Now that both my parents are at the hospital with covid-19, things are even worse. Living with just my brother is a nightmare. Like, he won't even clean the dishes when he eats, let alone clean the rest of the house. And yesterday when I swept the floor kind of half-assedly (because this week I have so much more to do, and haven't got the time or motivation to clean anything properly) he has the guts to come to me to complain about that. When I said to him that he's a useless bag of crap, he replied ""well, I cook you lunch"", like it was a chore and not something that he does (and has been doing since before quarantine) as a hobby... 

The worst of all is that I can't even move somewhere else, since my job (it's not even legally a job, despite I having to work even more than an intern in any company) pays less than half minimum wage, so I wouldn't be able to even pay my monthly bus fare, let alone 

Also, I always feel like an entitled prick when I think about talking to my friends about that, since lots of them are in much worse situations than someone as privileged as I am. Guess that's not really helpful for my mental health either, but that's life right."

I'll try to be brief.  
I've been studying coding as Python, SQL, Pandas, a bit of HTML/CSS, a bit of Kivy, a bit of GIT, some WebScraping and some Logic and Computational thinking for about 6 months.

Today I work as a Graphic Designer, but my goal was to get a Data Science job or anything in the related areas, so I could go deeper in my studies and knowledge full time. I know it takes time.  
And to speed it up, I also started this semester my Masters in Data Science.

So last week I put some of my certificates on LinkedIn, updated my profile and applied to a job as an Intern in Data Science in a Startup just to give it a try. And, believe it or not, after the interviews I did get the job!!!  
Now, when I look ahead, it looks that I know nothing.   
Specially on the more engineering and statistical parts.  
I pretty much focused all my time in the Logic and Python part.  
But when I look back, I know how much I learned.

The company knows that I know only the pretty basics. And they told me that I'll be the first employee in the company to start working with Data, before me the CEO was the one that was doing it has a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science. It's a small startup with 35 employees.

Today all his data is in a PostgreSQL database.   
He asked me to focus my studies in SQL and to think ways of creating a data pipeline. I'll be starting in the 27th of July. So knowing all this, I have almost 30 days to focus my studies in some specific subjects and to get there on that day, to work and improve their needs.

Any advices?   
Specially on the data pipeline, because I'll be the only one working with this, so I can build it from the ground up in the best possible way.  
After some time I probably want to go to Machine Learning, but I know this will be an amazing opportunity to start, so I'll work my way up.

Thanks in advance!"

Applying for jobs and stuff is like my personal hell; writing difficult letters, asking people to do something for you while they didn’t ask for that, having to ‘sell’ yourself and look good and be better than others, its all just not my thing.

In my letter I put a paragraph about my ADHD diagnosis this spring and how it might make me struggle. People told me to take it out of the letter because I wouldn’t be invited for an interview if I made myself out to be a burden. So i took it out.

I got an interview and decided to just tell them all about my struggles and how I am trying to deal with it and figure out what works for me and what I need. I told them I didn’t want to give a good impression only to get accepted and then disappoint them later.

I was one out of three candidates to be chosen to interview. AND THEY CHOOSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am so happy to have this thing taken care of and to have told them everything and super exited to get started.

&amp;#x200B;

So why am I still so scare to fail? To disappoint? To not be good enough? to just straight up suck at it?

I got this, they choose me, I can do this and I will do this. And so will you. You got this, you can do the thing and you will do the thing. You will enjoy it, and so will I!"
hjh6ym,4,2020-07-01,Going back to school vs. pursuing an internship next semester,eval7,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hjh6ym/going_back_to_school_vs_pursuing_an_internship/,"Hi, new to this sub and need some advice. Due to corona complications, I'm having some trouble deciding whether I should return to college in the fall or take quite a risk and continue with my internship at Disney. As of right now, the program has not been cancelled and I'm leaning slightly towards the internship option, but definitely unsure.

Pros: 

* I only have one semester of college left and if I do the program I'll be able to return to college next year and graduate with my friends in the spring. If I went back to school, I'd graduate in the fall.
* It would give me a lot of great skills and experience to use in a future career, something substantial on a resume, etc.
* It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I'll probably never be able to get again.

Cons:

* Obviously corona is a huge con for me. The cases in FL are still going up and I don't want to potentially get sick or infect others.
* The program could get abruptly cancelled, which would leave me with no backup plan/nothing to do for the remainder of the semester. This is what happened to a lot of interns a couple months ago when corona hit.

Right now I'm still holding onto a bit of hope that I can still do the internship, but I'm heavily rethinking because things are somewhat unsafe in Florida. I also don't want to act too late, because school starts about 2 weeks earlier than the program and I'll have to adjust accordingly with the administration if I decide to go through with the program.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"
hjinwb,1,2020-07-01,I am an intern about being promoted at a medium-size bank as software developer. I have a good intern offer by an Asset Management Company. Should I take the offer?,AstridPeth_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hjinwb/i_am_an_intern_about_being_promoted_at_a/,"I am 21, currently the last year of my Applied Mathematics Major with a full scholarship. I am also kind of minoring in economics. I will graduate next semester. I am not from a rich family, in spite of not being required to help financially my parents, I think I'll be called on the next five-ten years to do. Today I live with my girlfriend in a different city than my parents.

Currently, I work on a small-sized bank as software developer. I have a very nice reputation there. A coworker of mine who decided to quite some months ago received only an ""ok, it was nice to have you here."" I just received the fourth call in two days from them asking me to stay. They even said that I would be promoted on the following days and that my performance on Evaluation Committee (they held it last week) was one of the best (if I stay, get a pretty nice bonus for an intern). They want me to stay and they'll bet on me, fast-tracking my career. They're also open to me asking the change of position, being able to go to a more business one, if I want.

On the other side, I was suggested by a friend of mine to this Asset. They hold a really nice return on the last 12M (above 60%). They are very small, I would be their first internee and second employee. This can be nice because I could be an early-adopter and get nice compensations in the future if things go well. They say that with the profits they earned until now, they can run the Asset for at least 2 years. They invest globally on tech-firms and one of my duties would be to research these investment opportunities. I would also have to code the small things they need. The last duty would be helping then with financial engineering. I think the work there will be harder, working more hours each day. At the bank, I have some 9-5 possibilities.

In the long run, I would like to be some kind of tech executive, in a CTO-like role. I would like to get to my 30's with this in mind. I define my self as some kind of knowledge-bitch because I can enjoy many things: math, data science, software engineering, economics, stock market, entrepreneurship. 

I also plan to pursue an MSc. degree in Applied Mathematics in the near future. I think I can manage to work and study. My application already has been accepted, so I think the worst case for me would be full-dedication to the Master.

**What would you do?** I am particularly in doubt about this question: **what does bring more experience? Working with others and with senior staff or being left to its own lucky**?

Fell free to ask me more questions."

hjn73j,1,2020-07-01,I lack ambition,queentigerH,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/hjn73j/i_lack_ambition/,"Just to preface I don't live in the USA but in a central European country.

I'm currently studying to become an engineer because every teacher, professor, relative and friend always told me to go to uni because I had very good grades in school. Now I'm 3 years in, 2 to go and I'm hating it so much. My classmates seem really interested in everything and are doing engineering stuff outside school, while I don't put much effort in anything other than passing exams. I think it's because I don't really have a goal to be a successful engineer and work at a big company. I don't want to move from where I live now, it's beautiful, I have friends here and a house where I can live in the future. I hate the idea of moving somewhere else, especially for a job I don't like.

Last summer I had an internship and hated working in the office. I always knew I would hate it but hoped this would go away as I got more mature. It didn't and I still dream about being a firefighter. The problem is that in my country firefighters are not paid that much, not enough for the kind of work and especially in the town where I live they are seen as somewhat lazy as they are called maybe once a day. I would still make enough money to live comfortably, I'd make the average salary maybe a bit more but still 20-30% less than an engineer (but not where I live now, here they are around the same). On the other hand I'd have so much free time to be able to do other side hustles like using my engineering knowledge to design tools like I did during the internship.

The dilemma now is, do I try to be a firefighter and live a quiet lazy life just as I want it to be atleast for now or do I force myself to do something I know I will hate and risk not advancing in my career because my lack of ambition? The other thing is, I'm afraid I'll be jealous of my uni friends making more money than me, yet they could make more even if I was an engineer.

I've been thinking about this for a month now and I still don't know what I should do. Does anyone have any advice?"

It so happens that I did an 18-month full stack development internship at my University building a product for them. Wrote the backend in Django on my own, wrote parts of the Frontend in React, pretty much designed the database, wrote the models to create those tables, and wrote API endpoints for the frontend. 

I liked it enough to want to do it full-time. I look for web development jobs and bam! Apparently I need to know C# and .NET really well. I know that the concepts remain the same, they only differ in syntax and tools, so I like try to read some of it. But bam! Apparently every role I come across wants to do Java and Spring. 

In the meanwhile, I created and deployed to Heroku two MERN personal projects. Wrote every single line of the Frontend and backend. I picked MERN because I had to have some experience in it for an interview. 

I suck balls at Leetcode style questions. I realised I don't have the aptitude for it, and as someone on a visa with money running out, I can't be wasting time grinding them out and not actually applying to jobs.

So my hope is companies who will actually take a look at my work and decide to give me an interview or even any shot. But yeah, after 800 applications, and constantly receiving an email that says they found a candidate who closely aligns with their needs better, I'm dead inside. 

I interviewed at a few places, ended with hiring freezes or role cancellations or just got ghosted.

I did one internship in software development during my MS.  I eventually found work as an ML engineer and data scientist due to my coursework and internship experience in my program.  I now have a couple of years of full time experience.




Can I apply for PhD programs with purely industry research, as my team is considered more R&amp;D oriented?  Additionally, the only research experience I have in academics is unrelated biochemistry research.



Furthermore, is a PhD program even right for me?  Although I graduated with good grades from my MS (about a 3.6-3.7), I felt like the way my program awarded grades was very competitive and stressful; not putting in the usual amount of work for one test could easily result in a C or below in the class.  In fact, I have come close many times to getting C's in classes and by luck was able to get a B/B+ in the course.  Is that same kind of stress also present in PhD programs, or is it unique to my university or MS programs in general?  The focus of a PhD program is research, and I don't want to be kicked out for bad grades.




Also, since I consider myself more interested in industry R&amp;D than academic research, are advisors in computer science generally ok with their students taking the summer off to do internships at big companies?



Lastly, I want to work a couple of more years before applying just because I consider having work experience really important for me.  I don't mind graduating with a PhD in my mid-30s."

hjzno1,17,2020-07-02,My Town Forgot How to Dream,Deeify,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hjzno1/my_town_forgot_how_to_dream/,"# ""I don't sleep.  I hate those little slices of death"" -Walter Reisch

As I stood, frozen in place, thoughts dwelling in my mind about the inevitable choice I had to make, I knew, that choice had to be made soon.  With my right hand gently grasping my chin in thought, I knew my next decision was going to impact the next few minutes of my life in a way I could not explain to someone who wouldn't understand.  I looked up slowly.  My choice was made.

""You know what?  Let's go ahead and throw both on there"" -I said with a grin.

""Both mayo AND mustard sir?"" -the sandwich shop employee inquired.

""Yeah,  my doctor says I need to bring my cholesterol down but...that sandwich is looking pretty sexy"" -I replied as I winked at the cute girl making  my sandwich.

She shook her head with a smile and resumed her work on my order.  I collected my meal and found the most remote corner I could to resume my studies.  A recent spike in mental illness cases brought me back to my small home town I was raised in.  At the age of 20, I received an offer for an internship  that was far too good to pass up.  I quickly accepted and made my way to New York City where I would become the lead practitioner in the field of Oneirology over the proceeding two decades.

An Oneirologist is, to give a basic explanation, a ""Dream Doctor"".  I work  in a branch of neuropsychology that specifically studies REM sleep and  its correlation between dreams and the functions of the brain.  My theories on casual dreams, nightmares, and even sleep paralysis have  been studied worldwide and as a result, the head of the local college requested me specifically.  Normally, I would not take a case like this and send one of my interns to research but it was a chance to reconnect with my old town and what family I had left here.

You may be asking yourself, why would a ""Dream Doctor"" be sent to investigate a surge of mental illness?  Without going into too many long medical terms or scientific details, a recent discovery by a local doctor discovered strange activity in the hippocampus signifying the patients dreams may have something to do with their psychosis.  His findings were what ultimately prompted me to make my journey back home as dreams and nightmares have a significant effect on the human psyche.

""Mind if I join you?"" -a voice said from above me.

I lifted my head out of the stack of files I was studying, case by case, for the last several hours.

""Please do!"" -I replied, noticing it was the college chancellor.  ""I could use a distraction.  I've been staring at these papers for so long I feel like my eyes are going to melt out of their sockets"".

""Well, we can't have that!  In truth, all we really need is your brain though"" -The chancellor said jokingly.

I smiled and as if instinctual, I began skimming the case I was currently trying to wrap my head around, forgetting about my need for that little  ""distraction"".

""Any luck?"" -he asked with a more stern tone.

I  shook my head and let out an irritated exhale.  ""None. I can't find a single commonality in any of these cases aside from the symptoms themselves.  We may actually have a brand new, undocumented form of psychosis on our hands"" -I replied rubbing my forehead in frustration.

""Well,  I might have something for you, and someone you might want to talk to""  -the chancellor offered with the same sternness in his voice.

""Yeah?"" -I said, this time with an equally irritating inhale.

""It's a bit of an unlikely source but a young upstarting freshman may have found one commonality you might be interested in"" -he said.

""What would that be?"" -I said as I began organizing the mess of papers into their folders.

""I'll let him explain it to you...not exactly my area of expertise and I'm pretty sure I'd explain it wrong"" -he explained in a more giggly voice.

I  nodded and finished packing up my research along with the half eaten sandwich I'd all but forgotten about thanks to my studies.

As we approached the school campus, an unusual scene caught our eyes. The chancellor hurriedly parked the car and ran to a group of college students who had gathered in a large group.  I trailed behind him slightly as we began to see...and hear, what was going on.

""Get them away!  Get them away!  The eyes!  They won't stop staring!  I can't...!  NO!"" -a frightened student yelled as she frantically flailed on the ground.

""Young lady!  Young lady!  What's wrong?"" -the chancellor yelled grabbing both her arms to stop her violent outburst.

It was then I noticed campus police running over to assist.  The chancellor had managed to stop the student from flailing as she fell silent, tears rolling down her face.

""The eyes, they're everywhere...I can't...no..."" -she said in a whimper as she clutched the chancellors arms, burying her face into his shoulder.

He looked up at me with a look of shock.  The most common symptom of what was happening in this town was...hallucinations.  It seemed we had another case.  Campus police and EMTs were able to bring her to the adequate medical facility to help her...or at least attempt to.

After the frightening scene was well in hand, we made our way to our destination.  Now that I had a chance to walk among other people instead of wrapped up in my studies...I noticed something...concerning.  The  majority of students, teachers, and school personnel seemed...unwell.   Many of them were equipped with baggy eyelids as they seemed to lazily lurch forward to their next class.  Several of the students looked pale as if they hadn't seen the sun in months.  All, with frumpy postures as if they...either just woke up or...never slept at all.  If there wasn't a mental health concern going around, I would have just blamed it on late night studies for exams.  I took a mental note of what I was seeing as we approached the computer lab.

Twin computer screens looked back at me in the reflection of his thick glasses.  The young man was intently gazed forward into his research.   If he moved any closer to the screen, he probably would have knocked his monitor to the floor.

""Son, this is the scientist I told you about"" -the chancellor said attempting to get the young man's attention.

""Ya huh..."" -he replied with his eyes darting back and forth at the webpage in front of him.

I looked at the chancellor annoyed at the apathy this ""kid"" was showing.   He shot back a grin as if he was expecting that response and amused by the look I was giving him.

""Would you care to explain to him what you told me?"" -he said, not removing the grin.

An awkward silence filled the room for several seconds followed by a quick, nasally retort.

""This is not indicative of all reported cases but I did find common grounds in a cluster of reported illnesses"" -he blurted in one hurried breath.   ""Some, not all, have reported vicious nightmares"".

""That...doesn't seem to be a commonality if only some have nightmares.  It sounds pretty normal, to be honest"" -I replied about ready to give up on this  kid.

He didn't respond.  He continued typing and hastily clicking the mouse.

""Son...tell him the important part"" -the chancellor demanded.

The young man halted the movement of his mouse and slowly met his eyes with mine.

""They're...all having the same nightmare...to the letter"" -he said, almost as if he was telling a spooky campfire story.

I looked towards the chancellor in confusion.  His eyebrows lifted as he nodded his head.  I opened my mouth to question the kid further.  I was interrupted by a loud scream emanating from the school hallway.  The two of us ran towards the sound with the young man gazing over the top of the monitor, still not moving from his seat.

As we exited the classroom more screams were heard with students all gazing in the same direction.  We did the same.  A young lady was running down the hallway towards us.  Her screams echoed through the corridor as she ran.  We moved to intercept but were met with another sight.  The silhouette of a male student appeared at the end of the sun glistened hallway.  He was running towards the poor girl in a sprint holding, what appeared to be a stick or pole over his head as he  charged.  A clunk was heard as the female student tripped and landed hard on the ground, immediately turning around and frantically sliding back in terror.  A group of students and teachers, including ourselves,  moved to stop the male student.

""I'm going to kill you!  Damnit!  Damnit!  You're dead!  You're dead!"" -he  screamed in rage as we tried desperately to subdue him.

Campus  police were quick to the scene and yelled for the group to clear away as they wrestled the student down.  A loud snapping noise was heard followed by sounds of electricity.  They had tased the enraged young man.  The taser...had zero effect.  With the police backed away to make room for the taser, the student began jabbing the weapon at every angle.   His face was blood red with rage as he grit his teeth.  His hands gripped the weapon, which seemed to be a broken broom handle he  sharpened to a point.  With the sounds of electricity still echoing in the air, the enraged man was tackled from behind by an officer.  They finally subdued him as two teachers escorted the frightened young girl from the scene.

""What the hell is going on here!"" -the chancellor yelped as he ran his hand through his hair.

I  slowly looked around at the crowd that had gathered.  Sluggish, tired looking faces lazily watched as the police hauled off the would-be attacker.  As they left, the group dispersed in silence as they  continued their day, almost unaffected by what just happened.  I know the term ""zombie"" is thrown around a lot to describe someone who is overworked and exhausted but...that term could not be more accurate here.

I had to get to the bottom of this.  This was no normal psychosis.  My thoughts were filled with  speculations as I drove to my next destination.  The 10 minute drive seemed like 10 hours as thoughts of the horrifying cases I was studying occupied my entire thought process.  EVERY case had reported  hallucinations.  What was causing them and...why is everyone affected,  all within a small window of time?

As I approached my destination, my thoughts were quickly interrupted.  A tight grasp was felt around my neck.  I gasped for air as I attempted to keep control of the vehicle.  The grip sent an intense pain through the muscles in my neck as I tried to fight off the attacker.  In a fright, I glared towards the rear view mirror at who was choking me.  It was...the chancellor.  A devious grin glared back at me as I lost  control of the wheel.  The car broke into a spin as I was now using both hands to attempt to pull his increasingly strong grip from my throat.  He wouldn't budge.  The strength displayed was impossible.

As  I wretched in pain and slowly accepted my defeat, the car came to a halt with the sound of screeching tires coming to an end.  An empty quietness filled the air as I opened my clenched eyes.  As I rubbed away the tears, I jumped forward and turned to the back seat.  No one.  The empty backseat was all I could stare at as I rubbed my neck...no longer in pain.

""Oh my God..."" -I uttered under my breath at what I just realized.

I  am not immune to what's happening here.  Did I just have my own hallucination?  My own psychosis?  I turned to peer out of my  windshield.  I was facing the wrong direction into oncoming traffic.   Luckily...an empty road was in front of me.  I slowly pressed the gas peddle to complete my trip.  As I parked I gazed into my mirror once again to an empty back seat.  As I stared I caught a glimpse of two baggy eyes paired with a pale complexion.  I stared in disbelief as I  realized I was succumbing to the same illness as the rest of the town.

As I walked through the hospital hallways, I was met with more unusual sights and sounds.  Screaming was heard in one room with hospital staff restraining a patient.  One particular receptionist was angrily typing on her keyboard between yanks of her hair.  I passed by a team of doctors who were consoling a patient who was sitting in the hallway...crying.  I passed by another room and as I peered into the small window I could see a man in a hospital robe...walking into a wall.  What I mean is...he would slam front first into the wall...back up...and repeat...over and over again.  Now that I'm seeing where these cases are being treated...I realized the severity of what was happening to these people...and possibly...myself.

""It's SO good to see you sir!"" -the lead doctor said while hastily shaking my hand.

""Thank you, this is far more dire than I first realized doctor.  What do you have for me?"" -I stated, wanting to skip the usual formalities.

""Next to nothing, I'm afraid"" -his glazed eyes looked to me in exhaustion.  ""I'm nearly working with a skeleton crew due to sick staff and more and more cases keep filling my plate"".

As he spoke he pointed towards a glass window that showed us another room.  A patient was sleeping soundly in her hospital bed, health monitors and sensors were attached to her forehead and temples.

""It's as if everyone in town is suffering from sleep deprivation but...all reported cases have shown the patients are receiving adequate amount of sleep"" -the doctor continued his report.

""I've noticed the same thing around town...and in myself"" -I said, not wanting to admit the latter portion.

The doctor turned his gaze towards me.  ""I'd do have to admit...I haven't been feeling like myself lately.  This isn't something that's spurred by any one event, it's not passed on from person to person, and it's not something that's just in the air.  This...is...a legitimate phenomena"".

""Do you have a live read of her brain functions?"" -I asked attempting to break the tone.

With a spin of his chair, the doctor stood up and tapped two separate monitors.  The left monitor had a familiar sight with statistics on brain activity  The right hand monitor showed a visual representation of the patients brain, separate colors differentiating each activity produced.

After a quick glimpse of the monitor and brain activity, I snapped my head to the direction of the patient who was soundly sleeping.  An equally quick snap back to the monitor was followed.

""How long has she been asleep, doc?"" -I said in a worried tone.

""Roughly 3 hours now"" -he answered.  ""Don't worry, no sedation.  It's 100% natural sl..."".

""This isn't right"" -I interrupted.  ""The amount of brain activity shown here is way too low for someone this deep into sleep"".

""I'm...I'm afraid I'm not too well versed on brain activity during sleep, sir.  Shouldn't the brain shut down while sleeping?"" -he said with an innocent yet naive tone.

""Quite the opposite"" -I replied not taking my gaze away from the screen.  ""Brain activity is the MOST active when we sleep.  This chart should be lit up!""

""What's your hypothesis?"" -the doctor asked confused.

With my hand on my chin, I paced the room for several seconds.  I HAD to piece this puzzle together.  I stopped in my tracks as I looked up.

""Doctor, it's not sleep deprivation that's affecting the town...it's dream deprivation"" -I said confidently.

""Sir?"" -the doctor said confused but intent on my words.

""People ARE showing signs for lack of sleep but...the inherent issue of that is...lack of dreaming...reaching REM sleep TO dream"" -I said, once again pacing the room.  I continued, ""Fatigue, irritability...hallucinations, are all signs of dream deprivation.  But, what's causing it?""

The doctor neglected to answer.  Instead turning his head to look at his sleeping patient with a worried scowl.

""Wait...there were nightmares reported too...how can that be if we're all suffering from..."" -I stopped my words at realizing what the real important questions was.

""Doctor!"" -I barked as he snapped his head towards me at the sudden surprise.  ""It was reported the patients who are having nightmares all had the same...dream.  Is this correct?""

Without a word he nodded and motioned me to follow him.  More and more odd sights and sounds were present as we made our way to his office.  A poor old man was yelling at staff members to ""get down!"" and ""cover fire!"".

""PTSD?"" \_ asked the doctor.

He shook his head, ""Not until last week"".

We arrived at his office and he immediately moved to open his filing cabinet.  He handed me a file with several pieces of crumpled sheets of paper...all with drawings on them.

""These are illustrations each patient drew representing their nightmares"" -he said in the most confident tone I'd heard from him yet.

I studied the...artwork presented in front of me.  They were all different yet...similar.  Crudely drawn images of walls and corridors.  The scenes in each picture seemed...oddly familiar.  Each drawing was so sloppily done, it was difficult to make anything out but that same theme was consistent in each.

One drawing stood out.  This one was MUCH neater and understandable.  It was almost artistic in its work.  More dark corridors and decrepit walls filled the page with one addition, a set of tracks and an old, broken train.  I recognized the logo on the top of the train.  This was the old subway system that was abandoned during its construction when I was a child.  I remember it so vividly because news broke out of an accident at the station.  5 workers were killed and lawsuits put construction on hold...and inevitably...the project was stopped.

Had they reopened the subway during my absence?  A quick internet search proved this was not the case.  How could all of these disturbed people have such a strong recollection of a place so old, and from the looks of the drawings, forgotten.  The stranger part being...why the few people who were dreaming...were having only nightmares.

""Doctor!"" -I yelled, continuing to stare at the drawing.  ""Is there anything you could tell me about these patients?  How they might be different from the others who aren't dreaming?""

The doctor put his head down to think.  A pondering look filled his face as he looked back up at me.

""Yes, sir.  It wasn't a concern until you mentioned the dream deprivation.  EVERY one of these patients suffer from postdormital paralysis""

""Sleep paralysis?"" -I said with an aura of enlightenment behind my words.

He nodded his head slowly.  ""What could that mean?""

I didn't answer immediately as I slowly reached for the door.  I paused briefly to gaze back at the doctor over my shoulder.

""Keep doing what you can...I'm going to look into something"" -I said as I opened the door.

The day was ending fast and I wasn't sure how much longer these poor people could last.  More and more dull eyes were seen while I walked as doctors, nurses, and patients alike showed a depressing lump of what used to be a human.  More than once, I saw someone bump into a doorway entering a room, slamming headfirst into a bare wall, and more terrified, frightened people lined the hallway in their rooms.  The screams and slams coming from the echoed hallways were becoming unbearable.

I stopped, almost falling forward at a new sight of terror.  A pair of high heels were kicking from underneath a pile of police officers.  They were attempting to restrain her as I pressed my back against the wall, attempting to slide around the mess in front of me.  I gasped at what I saw next.  Without a thought, I cupped my mouth with both hands at the sight of a dead patient, in hospital robes, lying dead on the cold floor.  A pen jutting out of his neck.  His throat was mangled...it clearly wasn't one stab.  It was a vicious attack.  More shock arrived as I saw the assailant the police were trying to control.  It was the irritable receptionist I saw when I arrived.  She wasn't screaming or yelling...she was...growling...as if possessed by some sort of wild animal.  I made my way around the scene and left...awkwardly slamming my shoulder into the door frame.

I stood in my hotel room, peering out of my window not knowing what to do for my town.  My request for a ""great view"" when I checked in turned out to be nothing I ended up wanting.  Many people were seen wandering the streets.  Some talking to themselves, some yanking their hair, some hurdled down in fright.  Despite the almost apocalyptic mess that was displayed in front of me, I felt a sense of safety being in my room at the top floor.  I gazed down towards the immaculate drawing I had managed to ""borrow"" from the inept doctor.

The longer I looked, the more I recognized from my childhood.  This was TOO accurate.  I don't know why these people were dreaming of this place and why I had such a vivid recollection of that childhood memory but...I had to find out.

A creaking sound was heard from behind me.  I snapped around quickly feeling the presence of someone in my room.  I walked through my hotel room checking every corner for what I just head.  Every time I checked one spot, more creaking was heard in another.  I KNEW someone was there...I could feel it.  I resigned my efforts to locate the source of the sound.

I set the patient's drawing on my nightstand and began to undo my tie.  More creaking...this time...in all four corners of the room.  It was becoming louder.  What was happening?!  Suddenly, all four walls began...moving towards me.  I panicked, screaming out loud as I watched four bare walls slowly creek towards me.  One wall wasn't as bare, however.  The window I had felt so safe from may be my only way out.  I slammed my body against the window in a panic and began feeling for the lock.  There was none.  My panicked cries were quickly stopped as I looked outside.  Dozens...and dozens of the townspeople were...staring at me.  The pale gazes sent a fright through me I had no clue could be felt.

""What do you want?!"" I screamed as the window pane echoed my cry back to me.  ""Go away!  Damnit!  Go away!"".

I cowered to the ground and covered my ears as the creaking walls became unbearably loud.  Quietness.  I slowly pulled my hands from my ears and scanned the room.  Everything was normal.  Pictures on the wall, furniture in place...and no collapsing walls.  My attention darted out of the window.  The town was no longer staring at me.  They were back to their disturbing behavior...which, is funny to say, was a relief.

I looked down at my end table.  The drawing looked back at me in an almost beckoning way.  I quickly grabbed the picture and ran out the door.  I knew what I had to do.

""Frozen in fear"" is more real to me, now more than ever, as I stood staring at it.  The entrance to the old abandoned subway system.  Boarded up with several notes warning about making entry.  I wasn't planning on heeding those warnings.

I began pulling on the large slab of wood covering the entrance, only managing to pull a piece off at a time.  This was going to take a while but I could feel myself slipping into madness as I swore I heard voices and footsteps behind me.  Glimpsing back there was of course, nothing.

I stopped my demolition project as I noticed something at the far end of the building.  A glimmer of a solid metal surface was emanating with the reflection of moonlight.  I approached it slowly.  Down a very short flight of stairs was...a door.  It was a maintenance door.  I didn't know what to expect as I reached for the doorknob but...I opened it.  It wasn't locked!

As I walked through the dark passageways and into the darkness in the depths of this place, I felt a sense of dread as if I was unwelcome here.  I lit up the hallways with the light on my cell phone and peered into room after room I passed.  Most were empty, some cluttered with junk.

""Damn!"" -I exclaimed as I approached it.

An old, beat up tram was slightly tilted off the track as I entered the large subway station.  The entire place was colored in a rusty tan color with dirt and cobwebs strewn all over.  Am I the first to visit this place since the incident?

I walked the room for several minutes, gazing at the wonders in front of my.  The darkness of the room was interrupted by a flicker of red.  I saw it from the corner of my eye as I quickly turned to look.  Flickers of red lined the walls inside of what appeared to be a sewer grate.  I turned off my phone's light and moved towards the sewer entrance.

I couldn't see a thing as I moved my head at different angles peering down the small passageway.  I came all this way, should I go further?  My adrenaline was at an all time high and possibly the only reason for doing what I did.  I grasped either side of the grate and pulled.  It was remarkably easy to remove.  It was almost impossible to move as I squeezed myself further and further into the small sewer entrance.

After, what seemed like and eternity, I finally made it to an open area.  Another grate met me as if I was in a cage.  This cage, though, led to a larger area.  Flickers of a fire lit up the walls as I came to realize...someone was down here.  Possibly a homeless person?  I pulled myself slightly further to look into the room.

There he sat, crouched down by the fire.  The light from the flames only gave me a silhouette of a man in what appeared to be a long coat...or possibly robes.  He stayed, crouched at the fire, quiet.  Eerily quiet.  After a couple of minutes, he began to speak.  Very low and nearly inaudible.  I tried to listen closely but was disappointed that...he wasn't speaking English.  I had no clue what language it was but his words became louder and louder as he continued.  His inflections almost became a chant.  

I backed up in fright as he quickly extended his right arm out.  He was holding a curved knife.  He stopped chanting.  Did he hear me?  Slowly, his left arm extended outwards.  A small tree branch was all I could make out in the silhouette.  He slowly placed the branch on the fire.  I was almost mesmerized by, what seemed to be a ritual.  The man began standing up as he lifted both hands in the air.  I winced in disgust as he sliced the palm of his own hand.  He proceeded to let the blood drip onto the fire.

Slowly, with head down, he walked away.  I waited several minutes minutes until I could no longer hear the crunching of his footsteps.  I grasped my hand on the bars in front of me.  They wiggled loose just as easily.  I dropped to the floor much louder than expected as I ducked instinctively.  He was gone.  I placed the grate on the ground and began examining my surroundings.  The fire was still lit as I could see the branch, covered in berries, burning in the flames.

Further into the room, I saw something...a statue.  It was small, about the size of a small dog.  This was not man's best friend.  The statue seemed to have a cat like body and claws, tusks and a snout similar to an elephant, fur covering it's body and seemingly engulfed in golden flames.  Coins and jewelry were underneath the statue in a small bowl.  There was writing engraved on a place underneath it.  It was an Asian language.  Now I wish I hadn't wasted all that time failing Spanish class.

A sharp pain struck me fast as the side of my neck burned in pain.  I grabbed my neck quickly and spun around.  The dark form tackled me to the ground.  He began yelling in the unknown language in rage as I tried fighting him off.  He was MUCH stronger than me.  I could barely resist.  For some reason, during the struggle, even though I didn't understand him, he kept repeating the same words.  ""Fukushu"" and ""Raku"" were the only two I could easily make out as his rants continued.

As I felt myself being more and more overpowered, a dizziness began to set in as I slowly blacked out.  The last thing I remember is the face...an angry face of an Asian man, red flickers from the flames lit him up almost as if...I was in hell.

I remember the dream I had vividly.  I don't usually remember dreams at all but this one...will be with me forever.  The empty, old train in the station was directly in front of me.  I looked down at my feet to notice I was off the ground.  A quick look above me saw a rusty chain, hanging from the wall.  I felt my neck where the man had hurt me...chains.  The chain was around my neck and I was hanging.  No pain, no death.  I was not alone.  I looked around at dozens upon dozens more people, all in the same predicament.  Some were crying.  I could almost hear their teardrops hit the ground as the silence was deafening.

A growling was heard from the darkness down the train tunnel.  No one moved.  They continued their sobs.  Two large blue lights appeared in the black tunnel.  They sat for several seconds.  They moved closer.  A misty form began to appear.  Faster than I could keep up with, it jolted into the room towards a grouping of people.  It was large, bigger than the train itself.  It flew, defying gravity with it's blue, almost silky looking vapor.  It's tail whipped back and forth as I witness it's claw grab a victims head.  This poor person's head completely disappeared in it's grasp.  A white substance began emitting from almost every poor of this victim.  This demon began consuming it through its large elephant like trunk.

I recognized it.  It was the statue from the hidden room.  I watched for a seemingly endless amount of time as it went from person to person, darting back and forth randomly, feeding.  It was my turn.  Its face was larger than ever as it stared at me.  It grasped my head as I began to feel myself once again pass out.

I awoke in a dark room.  A soft red hue lit the bottom part of the walls.  I was flat on my back.  I lifted my head up to see the smoldering flames.  It was the same fire from before.  Confusion set in as I lifted my hand.  I was holding a small branch with berries growing from it.  I was reminded of the ritual I had witnessed earlier.  My confusion turned to fright as I realized who was laying next to me.  I jumped to my feet to see a young Asian man, peacefully laying on his back as well...a dagger deep in his chest.

Police were notified and an investigation was done.  I told them my whole story top to bottom...except for the dream.  You are officially the first to hear that as I kept it to myself for SO long.  The detectives were able to identify the man who attacked me.  He was the child of a Japanese worker who had died in the accident all those decades ago.  They thought his attack on me may have been revenge for his father or, possibly, the same psychosis everyone in town was experiencing.  My conclusions fall down a different path.

Do you remember the words he yelled to me?  ""Fukushu"" and ""Raku""?  They were also inscribed on that little shrine he had.  Fukushu means ""Revenge"".  Raku...that's a far different meaning.  Raku is an ancient Japanese demon, who is benevolent in nature and devours nightmares when you call on it.  I believe the old folklore was incorrect...and so did this young man.  It wasn't after our nightmares...it was after our dreams...and that's exactly what it got."

I currently have over a year of experience (Might be 2 years, if I stay over the next 2 semesters) as a Systems Administrator/Technical Aide intern at a relatively well known defense contractor in the DC area. As much as I enjoy this, its definitely not where my passion lies. 

When it comes to applying out of college, I worry that this could result in me being pigeonholed into sys admin related positions. Does anybody have any similar experiences? I am super young (18, as of now), so I'm not sure if it'd be as likely as somebody with 15-20 years in the industry trying to pivot. 

I've started leetcode/contributing to open source projects, so I'm hoping that assists with making my resume more relevant during applications next year. Anything else I can do?"
hk1gbd,3,2020-07-02,Considering taking the semester off; What should I do?,M477M4NN,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/hk1gbd/considering_taking_the_semester_off_what_should_i/,"My university just updated the status of most classes, and 3.5 of my 5 classes are online, the only ones not online or partially online are my minor classes. I've not been a fan of online college classes in general and this is making me strongly consider taking the semester off. I'm not really sure what to do.

I'm going into my 3rd year, and this won't push back my expected graduation time as I already intended on taking 5 years, but I was hoping to have a fall or spring semester open to taking an internship sometime in the next couple of years. 

One of my biggest concerns is that I am already a semester behind where I should be (reason: was rejected from major then accepted after a late curve in a class, but it was too late to get into any of my CS classes); I haven't taken an Operating Systems course yet (I only have 3 actual major classes done). I was hoping to get an internship in Summer 2021, but I worry that pushing my major progression back another semester would hurt my ability to get an internship (would love to get one at a big tech company if it were possible).

I've thought about looking into possible internships for this fall, but I don't know how realistic that is at this point. Wouldn't need to be anything fancy, just a startup or something would be better than nothing. I'm also not prepared at all for interviews or anything of the sort. I don't have any personal projects to speak of (I've been trying to do some over the summer but I've been working and taking Calc 3 and Stats and its taking up a lot of my time).

If I couldn't get an internship, I would probably take one of my last required math classes online through a community college and try to work on some personal project stuff.

What should I do? I don't want to waste the semester if I decide to take it off, but I feel like if I couldn't get an internship for the fall, I would just be hurting my chances at getting anything for next summer."

Occasionally it will then connect back to the internet on its own after about 30 seconds, and other times I have to unplug it and plug it back in again for it to reconnect to the internet.

This was never a huge problem in the past, but I started a remote internship this summer and I frequently get disconnected from video conferences, etc., because I lose connection to the internet. 

When I AM connected to the internet, the signal is always strong and the connection is always fast; it’s just that I periodically lose the connection completely. This also occurs across multiple devices, and the router will start to blink/or turn red when it disconnects, so I know it’s a problem with the modem/router/ISP and not my device.

I live in an apartment complex with a fair number of people in it, so it seems plausible that there is too much traffic on each channel and this is what’s causing me to frequently disconnect. However, I have my router set up to automatically choose the channel with the least amount of traffic, so this shouldn’t be an issue. Moreover, when I do try to see which channels have the most traffic by running the following command on the terminal of my Windows device: “sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep \(Channel”, the system doesn’t recognize the iwlist command. (I got this idea from this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.howtogeek.com/197268/how-to-find-the-best-wi-fi-channel-for-your-router-on-any-operating-system/amp/)

hk42r6,4,2020-07-02,Should I quit my job as a cashier?,mariontommo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hk42r6/should_i_quit_my_job_as_a_cashier/,"Hello Reddit, please bear with me as this is my first ever post c: (I've posted this on r/MomForAMinute)

TL;DR at the bottom

I'm 21, F, Malaysia

I started working as a cashier (basically squidward), at a shisha/hookah cafe for almost 2 weeks now, for 7hrs, 6 days a week. I am currently at war with myself.

Some background:

See, the only reason I took this job is because I didnt want to go back to my hometown. I really dislike being around my narc mother and I thought by having a job and putting myself out there was a good reason to stay on where I am. At first, she was bothered by it but eventually gave the green light.

I applied for internships and decided to try out this place nearby as they had an opening. My boyfriend and I (I'm temporarily living with him), both applied but I ended up getting it because its a sausage fest up in there (well, this is just an assumption as my bf had more experience than me but they still opted for me at the end of the day). Well, this cafe got back to me faster than the internships, so I said, why not?

My first week was hard. They usually communicated in either Arabic or English. I can't purposely ask them to switch just for me as I don't speak a word of Arabic. However, I was more than willing to try and learn along the way.  Anyways, as I didn't have any prior experiences working in this field, it was hard getting a hang of it. I've only held a job once, as an English teacher. This job was definitely much different from my first.

Here's the problem:

1. I was told by one of my Bangladeshi coworkers that some of the guys at work will take the tips for their own. Like,  because of this, the amount distributed among the entire floor staff won't be equal.
2. Next, I have this one coworker who messes up all the time. He sometimes gives me wrong table numbers and food orders. It's exhausting having to come around and double check every single thing he does.
3. The same coworker (from point 2) casually makes a surprised pikachu face when he messes up. He never take ownership of his messes. Instead, he likes to stand in front of the register, point at me and complain to a nearby coworker/supervisor in Arabic about how it was MY fault. Worst part is? I can't defend myself because I don't understand a thing. This happened more than once and at one point, I came home crying.

In the first week itself, I feel extremely anxious. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack just from getting ready and going to work. It also affect my sleep. I get so caught up in problems after work that I can't sleep. In short, the highs are high but the lows hit the hardest.

I have other coworkers who are equally amazing but as I'm coming into the second week and I'm getting a hang of things, some things aren't really working out. For example, today there was a shortage of money in the register when I closed it. I kid you not, I have no idea how that happened and I was so confident that I did not mess up at. all.

There's ALWAYS a problem every day. It either a customer doesn't pay, an extra order that was not fulfilled, shortage of money in the register. Whatever it is, it's exhausting because it has to be sorted out. So the past few times this has happened, my coworker and I, decided to take money out of the tips to cover for the losses.

For today's problem, the boss steps in. He says that if there was a problem like this starting tomorrow onward, its coming out of my paycheck. He is also getting a supervisor to watch me the next 3 days to see if the mistakes will occur again. Either way, it makes me look like I am incompetent even though I know I'm doing my job right. If i do well the next 3 days, it makes me look like I didn't do my job properly previously. If I mess up, it still makes me look bad. I'm never at the winning end. I always have to deal with the brunt end. Chances are, when I was away from my break to eat, someone must've gave the the wrong change back. Therefore, a loss in the register.

Now I'm considering to quit because I'm both mentally and physically exhausted. I come home tired all the time and even on my day off, I'm still tired. The other part of me still wants to prove myself that I can make out of this alive.

Should I quit?

TL;DR: I took a job because I don't wanna go home to be with my narc mom. I'm currently entering into my 2nd week of work. First week of work was great but I always had problems with coworkers and my own mental health, sleep. I am always tired physically and mentally. I always take the brunt end of everything. I do want to prove myself that i can make it but I also want to quit. What should I do?"
hk43lc,492,2020-07-02,Don’t ever play the mirror game called “Billy the Bouncing Butcher”.,Verastahl,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hk43lc/dont_ever_play_the_mirror_game_called_billy_the/,"

I heard about it through a guy at work.  I worked as a college intern at a medium-sized brokerage firm at the time, and one of the junior executives—Tommy—had taken me under his wing as a gopher and goof-off buddy when he wanted to take a break and blow off steam.  One day we were talking about stupid games we’d played as a kid.  

I’d told him about playing Mercy and Rock Duel (which was basically Mercy with thrown rocks).  He told me about a game his cousins had gotten him to try one time when he was staying with them.  It was called Billy the Bouncing Butcher.  He said it involved mirrors and saying some chant until something “scary” happened.  When I pointed out that it sounded like a rip-off of Bloody Mary, he’d just shrugged and gave a weird laugh.  He told me he wasn’t sure, but he didn’t think it was like that.  You weren’t supposed to see a ghost or anything.  It was something worse.

When I asked him what was supposed to happen then, he looked embarrassed. That was weird.  Tommy was a nice-enough guy, but he was a super Type-A, man’s man type, or at least that’s the image he wanted to present.  This was the first time I’d seen him be anything other than serious or sarcastically goofy, and seeing his carefully-crafted mask slip for a minute to show uncertainty and shame…well, it got my attention.  

After a moment of contemplative silence, he’d shrugged again.  “To be honest, I really don’t know.  I was with them when we set everything up, but as soon as they started saying the words, I got scared and ran out of the room.  They were laughing at me, but I guess they were committed after all that work, because they stayed in and finished it.  They weren’t laughing when they got done.  I was pissed and embarrassed, but I was curious too.  I asked them that night what had happened, but they wouldn’t say.  Tried to joke that I didn’t get to know when I was too chicken to stay.  But they seemed weird.  Scared even.”  He shook his head.  “I went back home the next day, and I never found out if anything really happened or if it was just bullshit.”

I almost laughed and told him I had the answer—it was bullshit.  But I didn’t want to hurt his feelings or piss him off, so instead I silently nodded as a new idea crept into my head.  My girlfriend Carla simultaneously hated and loved creepy things.  And I thought I remembered her saying once that’d she’d never played Bloody Mary as a kid because it spooked her so much.  I knew it was a gamble, as she might just get pissed or refuse to play, but if I could get her to try out Tommy’s weird knock-off game, we might have fun or at least get a good laugh out of it.

So I pressed Tommy for details.  He shifted uncomfortably in his chair, and for a second I thought he was going to refuse or say he didn’t remember, but then he shrugged again and told me what they had done.

**** 

It takes at least eight mirrors.  That’s probably one reason you don’t hear more about it, right?  Who the fuck has eight mirrors?  Well, my aunt did.  She had a big house, and almost every room was filled with all kinds of shit.  It only took us like an hour to find eight good-sized mirrors and sneak them all into one of the back rooms that had been emptied for recarpeting or something the next week.  We’d gotten the mirrors in the room and shut the door without anyone seeing, but that was the easy part.  The hard part was getting the mirrors set up right.

You kind of make a circle with the mirrors, but they have to be angled so that each mirror reflects at least two other mirrors and at least part of the center of the circle, because that’s where we were supposed to be.  The idea is, if you get it right, you can see your reflections in the mirrors and the reflections of those reflections and so on, stretching out farther than you can see.  When we were satisfied with that, we went into the middle and stood back to back, facing out toward the mirrors.  Then they said we had to say this rhyme together until something changed.

****

Trying to get every detail, I asked him did he remember the phrase.  Frowning at me, he shook his head.  “Shit, Cody.  That was like thirty years ago.  It was something spooky-sounding to a ten-year old I guess.”  His gaze had shifted away from mine, and I suddenly felt sure he was lying about not remembering.  I was going to let it go, but he went on.  “I don’t know.   It was something like…”  His eyes snapped back to mine.  “Come to me.  Come to me.  You are invited by word and deed.  Come to me.  Come to me.  By this offering will you be freed.  Come to me.  Come to me. Wards are mist and chains are rust, for there is only one of us.”

I burst out laughing.  “Dude, that’s fucking awesome!  You really had me going.  Very creepy.  My girl is going to shit her p…”  But Tommy was already standing up with a frown.

“Got to go, man.  I…I have a phone conference in ten.  Check you later.”  And then he was hustling down the hall toward his office.

I should have thought it was stranger than I did.  But I was young and dumb, and I assumed Tommy was just playing it up, being dramatic, because that’s the kind of shit he did.  Anything for a laugh or to look cool.  And it *was* cool.  I hadn’t been lying.  Carla was going to lose her shit.

**** 

I didn’t mention it to her that night or the next.  By the weekend, I’d already bought four mirrors for fifty bucks from a pawn shop downtown and borrowed three more from my sister’s store.  With the one I had hanging on my closet, I had just enough.  Setting them up was a giant pain in the ass—it was hard to get the angles just right.  But by the time Carla came over for what she thought was dinner and a movie, everything was ready.  

To my surprise, she was gung ho from the beginning.  I could tell she was a bit nervous about it, but I think she thought it was really sweet that I’d gone to so much trouble to set it up, and like I’ve said, she really liked creepy stuff, even when it freaked her out a bit.  I told her Tommy’s story, including the phrase I’d written down as soon as he’d left the breakroom that day.  I’d written it down on a slip of paper for both of us so we wouldn’t mess it up.  I told myself my attention to detail was just because it was all cool and creepy as it was, and if I changed it, I would just fuck it up.

Because it was all made up.  Kids’ game bullshit.  The words were just spooky nonsense.  I didn’t really think anything would happen, so I wasn’t seriously worried about making sure I got it right.

Right?

We stood back to back in the circle of mirrors.  Initially I was going to just have candles burning for extra creep factor, but it was too dark.  Candles don’t brighten up the dark like they do in movies, and I finally decided to turn on a corner lamp to give us enough light to read our papers and see into the shadowy mirrors.

Our reflected selves stretched on forever.  Despite being pressed against her back, I could see Carla’s excited expression doubled and redoubled just like I could see my own.  Focusing on one of my faces, I asked her if she was ready to start.  Letting out a nervous laugh, she said she was.  So we began.

“Come to me.  Come to me.  You are invited by word and deed.  Come to me.  Come to me.  By this offering will you be freed.  Come to me.  Come to me. Wards are mist and chains are rust, for there is only one of us.”  We stumbled over the words this first time, the phrases a discordant jumble as we both shifted speed trying to match the other.

“Come to me.  Come to me.  You are invited by word and deed.  Come to me.  Come to me.  By this offering will you be freed.  Come to me.  Come to me. Wards are mist and chains are rust, for there is only one of us.”  We were in unison now, and I focused on the paper to make sure I didn’t make a mistake to throw us off again.

“Come to me.  Come to me.  You are invited by word and deed.  Come to me.  Come to me.  By this offering will you be freed.  Come to me.  Come to me. Wards are mist and chains are rust, for there is only one of us.”  We were in the rhythm now, and while I didn’t have the words fully memorized, I felt comfortable enough that I lifted my eyes back to one of my reflections.  The one I’d focused on before.  The one where I could see my face and behind that, the back of Carla’s head.

Except there were two faces staring at me now.

In that reflection, Carla’s face was turned to face the same direction.  I had a moment of unreality where I assumed she must have turned around even though I could still feel her back pressed against mine.  But then my gaze wandered to the other reflections, and all of them were the same as they had been.  I should have stepped away then, or at the very least stopped or stumbled over the words, but somehow I didn’t.  The chant kept flowing from me as if pulled from my core on an invisible string, and as I looked back at the wrong reflection, I saw that the mirror Carla was smiling at me.  Smiling at me as she started to shake and shudder, bounce and twist, despite the fact I could feel Carla’s stillness behind me as we continued to chant.

And then, as the thing in the mirror’s smile widened further and its up and down motions sped to a blur, it was suddenly gone.  

It was as though a spell had been broken.  The reflections looked normal again, and this time when I tried to stop speaking, it worked.  I turned to Carla and found her looking at me with a combination of amusement and disappointment.  

“Getting bored already?”

I smiled at her, almost blurting out what I saw, or what I thought I’d saw.  But that was stupid, right?  It had all happened fast, and if it had been real, wouldn’t she have seen something too?  I knew she loved me, but we hadn’t been dating so long that I wanted to risk making her think I was a nutjob over something that couldn’t have possibly happened in the first place.  Or that I was so spineless that I actually got scared by a kids’ game.

So I just nodded and returned her smile.  “Yeah, sorry.  It’s kind of lame.  You cool with us giving up?”

She leaned forward and kissed me.  “Sure.  And it wasn’t lame.  It was cool.”  She laughed.  “And a little spooky.  For a second, I thought I saw something move and it freaked me out.  Weird how the mind works.”

I grinned, feeling relief.  “Yeah, me too.  I guess we just spooked ourselves.”

Two weeks later, Carla was dead.

She lived in a nice condo on the north side of town—one of those places with two pools and security guards at the gate.  The police claimed they talked to everyone, reviewed all the security footage.  They said they had no idea how someone had gotten into her locked apartment, disabled her alarm, and butchered her in her own bed.

I’m not saying they didn’t do a good investigation.  Maybe they did, I don’t know.  What I *do* know is that they questioned me three times, and each time it felt more and more like I was a suspect rather than a grieving boyfriend.  Then the interviews suddenly stopped.  Two weeks went by without any word.  Finally I called the main detective, a woman named Everly, and asked her if they’d made any progress.

I could hear her reluctance to talk to me over the phone, and at first I figured it was because they still suspected me.  But then she was apologizing.  Told me she knew they’d been hard on me, but it was because they didn’t have many leads, and the one lead they did have had pointed towards me.  That they’d finally managed to get my phone’s GPS records and then confirmed through my office’s security that I’d been working late with Tommy on the night Carla was killed.  That was why they hadn’t been in touch any more after that last interview, though she was sorry to say there were no new leads so far.   Stomach clenching, I asked her what about the lead they already had?  What had made them suspect me in the first place?

She said that the alarm in Carla’s condo had been disabled with the code, and that based on their investigation, aside from Carla, I was the only other person who knew the code, at least locally.  Since there were no signs of a struggle and it appeared that Carla had been murdered in her sleep, it seemed unlikely that she had disabled the alarm herself to let the killer in.  That meant that someone else that knew the code had gotten into her apartment, disabled the alarm, and then crept back to her bedroom where they murdered her.

I was confused by the logic.  I pointed out that maybe she never set the alarm in the first place, or she’d let someone in earlier, gone to bed, and then they had killed her.  I didn’t want to think that she’d cheat on me, but what if she’d been seeing someone else and they’d decided to kill her while she slept.  Maybe she was breaking it off with them because she really loved…

Det. Everly broke in, explaining that while the killer might be some jilted lover, they knew when the alarm had been turned on and turned back off.  The system was in every condo, and they were all linked to a secure server that was monitored and controlled by an alarm company in Arizona.  They had logs of every key press, as well as every time Carla’s system had been armed or turned off.  On that night, Everly said, the alarm had been set just after ten o’clock and had been turned back off less than half an hour later.   Around the same time, she added, they could put me walking to my car from the office some twenty miles away.

“Again, I’m sorry.  I know you probably think we were just being assholes.  But so often its someone the victim knows, and you were the only one with access—not even the condo manager has the code.  So unless someone from the security company decided to drive a thousand miles to murder a random stranger, which we actually looked into, by the way, we don’t know how the alarm got turned back off.”

I could feel my palm sweating against the back of the phone.  It had been over a month since I got the call that Carla had been murdered, and talking or thinking about it still sent me spiraling toward either a panic attack or a teary breakdown.  But I wanted to understand, to help *them* understand if it could help catch her killer.  “But maybe you’re wrong about her being asleep.  Maybe she let them in.  It could be someone she knew.”

The detective was quiet a moment before letting out a small sigh.  “Maybe, yeah.  We can’t say for sure.  But it still seems weird to me.”

“Weird that she wasn’t asleep?  I mean how can…”

“No, not that.  The code.  The security company, the records they sent, they show that when the alarm was disabled, there was one invalid attempt before the right code was put in.  That by itself isn’t that big a deal, but it was how the code was entered that stands out to me.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, when someone knows a code and they misenter it, they usually either hit one wrong button, swap two numbers, or put in something entirely different—putting in your PIN number instead of the alarm code, something like that.  I’ve looked through all the alarm code entries for Carla’s apartment going back six months, which is as far as they keep that kind of thing.  There were a couple of times where the wrong code was entered, but it was just one digit that was wrong.  The same digit every time.  I figured out what that probably was.  Her alarm code was 1681, and the last four digits of her social were 1651.  But other than that, the right code was always entered every time until the night she was murdered.”

I felt myself twisting tighter and tighter with tension as she spoke, some unknown dread blooming in my belly like a dark and toxic flower that was nourished by her words.  “Please, just tell me.  What was special about the wrong code then?”

She gave a short bark of a laugh.  “Sorry, I get lost in it sometimes.  No, all I meant was that the code, the wrong code that was entered before the right one, was different than the others or what I’d expect to see.  Because it was the right code.  In reverse.  Instead of 1681, someone put in 1861.  Then ten seconds later, just before the alarm would have started going, they put it in right.”  Everly let out a longer sigh.  “I’m sorry I don’t have better news or more to tell you.  But trust me, I’m going to keep working on it until we get whoever did this to her.”

**** 

They never did.  And eight years later, I had largely moved on.  There was still a hole in me from where I’d lost Carla—not only as I knew her, but as I imagined our lives might be if we’d stayed together long-term.  But if time doesn’t heal, it at least gives you scars.  Patches of unfeeling callous that make it easier to not dwell on the pieces you’ve lost along the way.  I still miss Carla, and while I occasionally date, its always half-hearted.  My sister says I sabotage any chance I have of finding anyone, of really being happy.  That I have to stop blaming myself for something terrible that happened that wasn’t my fault.   Maybe she’s right.

But I’m not so sure.

Because yesterday, I got into an elevator at my company’s brand-new building in London.  The same company where I’d worked with Tommy some four thousand miles away and at least one lifetime ago.  I haven’t heard from him in years, and when I tried to find him in the company directory yesterday afternoon, he’s no longer listed.  But that was after the elevator, and even if I found him, I don’t know that it would make any difference.

Because as I stepped into the new elevator for the first time, I realized that I was in a box made of mirrors—highly polished chrome framed mirrors along each wall of the elevator car as well as the closing doors themselves.  Immediately my mind flashed back to the night with Carla, back pressed up against her as I stared at my doubled and re-doubled reflection stretching away toward some unknown destination.  Just like that night, I could see an infinite number of selves all connected to each other and to me.  All of them terrible in their similarities and slight variations of appearance and angle.

All except one.

Among them all, I could see one reflection that moved when I did not.  That was occupied by not only my own staring figure, but a second one as well.  A dark shape that cradled the face that wasn’t my face and whispered in my ear that was not my own.

It was Carla.  Or something with her shape.  The sight of her made me gasp, and I would have turned to try and find her if I wasn’t frozen to the spot.  She looked the same as I remembered her…at least mostly.  Her face and chest were speckled with black and maroon flecks of dirt or blood, and the hand that stroked the cheek of my other had ragged, yellow nails that scraped at his skin.  He didn’t seem to notice or mind.  His focus was as intent on me as I was on him.  I would have said it was just reflecting my gaze, except he was nodding his head at her silent words.

She broke off to look at me as they both began to smile.  I glanced at the floor number above the doors—two more to go and then I could get out of there.  Looking back at them, I saw they had begun twisting and jumping, their images bouncing more and more as they…

And then they were gone.

I had just a moment to stare into the empty place my reflection should have been and then the doors slid open.  Gasping for air, I stumbled to my office and locked the door, hiding in there most of the day before taking the stairs back down to my car.

I’m getting on a plane in twenty minutes to fly back home, if I make it that far.  The planning and the motion of running, of trying to hide or fight, it makes me feel a bit better, or at least distracts me.  I’m staying in crowds, hoping that whatever is hunting me can’t or won’t attack me in public.

But I have no illusions of winning or really getting away.  I don’t understand what this is or how to fight it, if it even can be fought.  So I write this down more as a warning for others, and maybe an epitaph for myself.  So I’ll end with this:

Don’t play this game or anything similar.  You may think it sounds like a fun dare, but its not.  You may think its all a joke, but its not.  I can’t make you believe me, and I understand by telling about it, I risk making it worse, but this didn’t start with me, so I have no reason to think it would stop whether I write this or not.  So take this for what it is.  An earnest warning from a dead man.

And if you don’t listen to it?

hk6dzc,447,2020-07-02,"I attended a M7 Class of 2016, all on debt, here's my networth and career progress",financecorpstrategy1,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/hk6dzc/i_attended_a_m7_class_of_2016_all_on_debt_heres/,"Networth and career progression here:

[https://imgur.com/a/NHUTfTo](https://imgur.com/a/NHUTfTo)

I won't mention my exact school or roles, but I went to a M7 school, worked at a top consulting firm doing growth strategy type of project, which I left shortly after making engagement manager, and then joined corporate strategy in a financial services institution.

I was moderately frugal, and lived with my fiancee and now wife. I lived in HCOL areas, but my contribution to rent was $1200 when I started my post-mba job, and is $2400 now (we've upgraded). Consulting helped a lot with expenses too, since food was free four days a week, and vacations were mostly free due to points. That said, I ate out pretty much every meal, went on plenty of vacations, and never said No to a social activity for money reasons. I didn't buy any luxury items (e.g., watches) though.

Averaging $100k saved per year (this has been pretty steady, expenses have gone up a bit as my income has increased). This is a mix of 401k and after tax savings.

**Some key learnings**:

\- A majority of net worth gains are from one-time events...year end bonuses, signing bonuses, payouts when you quit, etc. Even if bonuses are only 20-30% of your comp, they end up being 50%+ of your increases in networth. A bad year, or leaving a job before you get your bonus, can really set you back.

\- MBA was expensive, but you can pay it off extremely quickly if you want to. I paid off my loans in 2.5 years (and closer to 2 year since I had started to work, since my start date was 3-4 months after graduation).

\- MBA costs a bit less than you expect since you get $30k or so from internships (which are largely untaxed given your low income) and $25-50k in signing bonuses.

\- Comp increases mostly come from switching jobs or getting promoted. I'm at the point of career where my comp can be pretty flat for a while (senior enough that promotions are slow, not super easy to job hop anymore). Consulting and banking, if you stay in them, does continue to give significant year or year raises though, even in non-promo years.

\- Consulting fucking sucks, but it pays well, and opens up great job opportunities. It was killing me and my relationships, but if I stayed an extra year I think I could've gotten a more senior level position when I left.

\- Even though my income is high and savings are high, I do feel a bit behind now. I wish I was 2-3 years younger. I'm  behind in retirement savings despite maxing it out since I graduated (and now getting strong matches...I way under-saved prior to MBA tho), and have around $120k in IRA/401k. I have about $80k in non-retirement cash accounts. We are going to have a kid soon, so we need a bigger place (and my wife will likely need to work less, we'll need to pay for daycare, 529 plans, etc), but we don't have enough down payment for a house in this area yet ($1M prices or so). Likely will need to keep renting when kid is here (and rent a bigger place!), but our ability to save will be much less.

\- Some MBA friends are not frugal at all, and are buying rolexes, teslas, multiple $3k handbags, flying first class on vacations, etc. I am on the more disciplined side, but there are people more disciplined than me (e.g., they actually cook instead of eating out every meal). A shit ton of kids with rich parents though, so tough to really know what their financial situation is. I have friends who were investment bankers making $350k a year and their parents were still helping out on rent...

\- I'm just now getting to the point where stock market returns impact my change in networth more than monthly savings.

\- Even on months I went on vacation, or had a large purchase, I was able to prevent my networth from decreasing, primarily due to my high savings rate.

Happy to answer any questions."
hk6sv1,1,2020-07-02,What path to take?,BojackSanchez11,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/hk6sv1/what_path_to_take/,"Hi good people of learnProgramming,

I learnt python, the basic syntax, (not too much of OOP though) and I am planning to get some kind of internship by the end of August, can be paid or unpaid, just to get some experience (nothing fancy, anything entry level).

I asked a friend of mine and he said that I should focus on learning algorithms, codechef questions, Data Structure and stuff like that. While another friend of mine said that I should focus more on learning relevant modules. What wait should I give to each of these things?

My second question is, which field to choose? My major options are web development or Data science. I like Data science more personally because it has more implementation of maths. I have made project of my own which gets stock data everyday, then added indicators to it, compile it into a particular time frame. But I have heard from everyone that it takes almost 2 years to become somewhat good at Data Science and implementing Learning models. But I really need a job right now so which one gets that first.

If career == Web development:
    What all do you need to know for back end using just python? I am planning to learn Django, MySQL, RestAPI for beginning, as most of the internships require at least these three, rn my knowledge about them is next to nothing. And what else should I learn?

I have learnt python for not much time but I know Pandas, I made one project for that, I made 2 GUI interfaces."

I am a rising senior and the idea of applying to colleges in a few months is daunting. I’m not sure why the thought scares me since I’ve completed my common application, know which schools I want to apply to, and slowly working on my essays. 

 My background is African(American). I was born in Kenya and raised in Minnesota (United States)My parents are from Kenya. I was the only one of my siblings born there in Kenya too (all my siblings were born in the U.S). I come from a lower income single-parent  household and both my parents haven’t gone to college. My grandmother is illiterate and so is my late grandfather. My older brother is going to be a freshman in college this fall, and I’m really proud of him. My siblings and I are going to be first generation students. 

I haven’t been the most proud of my academics because I never really felt like I was good enough. My mother told me to always compare myself against the state, not my classmates. The thing is I have a 4.4(ish) gpa weighted and a 4.0 unweighted. Most of that are from the college classes I’ve been taking at the university’s Minnesota (dual credit/PSEO). I only took one AP class (literature) my sophomore year and got a 2. I was going through a lot of stress at home a week prior to my AP lit test and did worse than I should. My class rank is 1/65, I know that means I’m the top but my year (and school) is super small. I’m not sure how colleges will look at that small number. 


The one thing that’s kinda stressing me is my ACT score. I have amazing grades and I know my letters of recommendations will be pretty good but my ACT score wasn’t what I hoped it would be. I got a 25 composite: M29 S23 E25 R24 W8. All the schools I want to go to have averages from 28-32, I’m currently studying once more to take it a second time. Last time I just took practice tests without going over my mistakes and I didn’t improve. Now I’ll actually be reviewing my old tests. I’m currently working on perfecting my English section since that will be the easiest one to do first and then moving on to reading+science sections. 

I feel like my extracurricular are good but not great. I work at the science museum in the equity and inclusion sector and address STEM+ social justice inequalities and issues through projects and workshops. I’m also the Vice President of my schools NHS. I have a second part time job where I work in costumer service. I mostly help my youngest brother with his school work when I have time in between my busy schedule. Currently working on a COVID-19 project where I interview my grandparents about how their lives have been affected by this pandemic. I’ve done two internships that both have lasted a full summer each. One as an assistant tennis coach and the other as a trades intern at the school district. I love to work on home projects and paint whenever I feel inspired to. 

I plan on applying to small liberal arts colleges since the financial aid will be great for me and that it will be more comfortable with me coming from small schools. My school I currently go to has about 400 students 5-12th grade. Anyway this is getting pretty long, I would like to see what my chances are going to these schools in descending order :

1. Carleton college (dream school No.1)
2. Occidental college (dream school No.2)
3. Colorado college
4. Pomona college 
5. Colgate university 
6. Lafayette college 
7. Lehigh university
8. University of Minnesota"

hkbabf,5,2020-07-02,"Genuinely don't know what to do about my major anymore, but I'm thinking about ECE?",Visible_Night_8517,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/hkbabf/genuinely_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_major/,"Posting this on a throwaway account, but basically I changed last spring from a biomedical engineering degree into civil and wow I can't tell whether it's due to online learning and the extra-condensed curriculum, but I have never been more miserable than I've been in these past two semesters. Right now I'm in a mini-term taking mechanics of materials and the content. Is. Rough.

I initially wanted to switch into this major because I've been confused for the past year about what I wanted to do so I latched onto civil because I thought it had the most overlap with fields I **used** to be interested in like urban planning and architecture. But now I've reached a point where I'm beginning to realized that these interests were super ephemeral and I haven't realistically thought about them since I was a teen. I've never taken any nitty-gritty engineering courses besides statics and dynamics, the rest were the most general higher maths (classes I enjoyed the most), physics, a bunch of useless chem courses that I was never passionate about because I started out in PREMED, as well as some engineering orientation classes. I'm especially disappointed that I never got to try circuits given my recent interest in electronics. Shame, considering it was even part of my BME track.

I have not learned a single tangible skill that I can use besides some basic excel, autoCAD, and mathCAD programming. It's usually these classes that I've enjoyed the most. In terms of the theoretical stuff, statics was alright, dynamics IMO was more fun to learn. Certain classes have been absolute hell though– being taught a surveying class online is somehow more frustrating than anything i've done these past three years.

I know I sound super naive but I ideally want to amass as many employable skills as possible, and take a more interdisciplinary approach to my career, which I want to be anywhere between applied mathematics, pure tech and pure engineering. Only thing I'm not sure about is what industry I want to apply these skills in, and my infatuation with civil is starting to wane more and more with each passing day.

I'm starting to realize that it probably would have been ideal for me to have stayed in either BME or just switched into EE. The reason for this is that I would have had more freedom in choosing my electives and concentration compared with civil. I also would have had WAY less excess credits with either major, and probably would have figured myself better/ what it was I really liked about those paths. Instead I (rather impulsively) latched onto old passions I never had the drive to pursue to begin with and just expected everything to click. Now I'm stuck wishing I had done something differently like maybe not having taken all those dumb chem courses when I was in premed or maybe not having had switched into civil.

If I could really go back in time I would disregard anything related to pre-health and just start experimenting more with math, programming, and other EE courses, but I don't even have the luxury to do that **now**. I've already exceeded the credit threshold to change my major and I don't know what to do. I went into this expecting clarity, but now I just feel even more confused. Nothing feels tangible or transmissible. I don't feel desirable as a potential employee due to lack of experience and with most places stuck in a hiring freeze, there isn't any avenue for me to attain crucial experience or strengthen my current ""skills"" other than to pursue at-home projects which.... what can I do at home that would be seen as relevant to my field?

Right now, the only thing I have going for me is my high GPA. My advisor told me I should just focus on finishing my degree and try to stretch it to any possible direction that interests me given enough time, education (masters) or experience. Her advice seemed more thoughtful compared to the other people I've talked to.

**However,** given the next couple weeks, I was thinking about teaching myself basic circuits, programming, and maybe even signing up for a remote internship to see if EE is something I would be interested doing a career in. If it turns out that I 'm still interested by the time I start fall, I'll just take a bunch of courses and see how it plays out.

hkd395,2,2020-07-03,I need help on my career path. What can I do with a BSc. in Economics and absolutely no job experience?,david_jose_hod,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hkd395/i_need_help_on_my_career_path_what_can_i_do_with/,"Disclaimer: If according to the rules, this is not a place for petty sobing and rants and there is another r/reddit to post this kind of question, please let me know. Sorry for the trouble.

I would like to know from someone that works on the economics field or has worked on an economics related field (or anyone for that matter, since the economics thing is not exclusive, as I am just looking for good and sounding advice from more experienced people), what should I do with my career path from your point of view and wisdom. First, some context:
-I have not graduated yet, I am at the beggining of my senior year and haven't done an internship yet.

-University completely traumatized me, I wanted to go on and get a Masters degree right after getting my Undergraduate degree, but now I am not sure that is a good idea, since, at least on paper, I pretty much suck at academics (I do study quite hard since I enjoy learning).

-After realizing that I suck on paper, I have decided to try to get a full-time job as soon as possible, since getting into a decent Master's programm will be quite hard (and not to mention extremely expensive).

-I have not gotten an Internship, because in the country I live and the system that rules such country, companies usually look for senior years or pre-graduates to do Internships, so I have not even had the 'internship experience' yet in order to perhaps be able to tell what I may want to do in the future.

-Lately, I have focused mostly on developing my technical skills in extent summarized by practicing relevant software use that I have seen is quite demanded for the interships I would like to get, despite I have never been taught such softwares besides in some courses where I have been introduced and gotten acquainted with the very basics. (Softwares that I am learning on my own: mainly MS Excel, Stata, RStudio, Mathematica and MATLAB, while also trying to brush up my programming skills by re-learning C++ and learning and trying to apply Python to my 'area of expertise').

-If you kept reading, thank you very much as I shall write the last thing worthy of mention.
I recently have come to HATE economics after really bad experiences with people that work in that area. That realization outwardly diminished my interest and passion for the field. As a result I have become more akin with areas that DO demand knowledge accountability to some extent, those are in my case: Finance and Operations Research.

With everything I have stablished as my current situation, I need to add some pointers and then proceed to ask for punctual advice.

Pointers: 

-Doing undergrad econ research is not an option, since I do not get along with any of the Faculty of Economics professors (talking about recommendation letters am I right?)

-I wanted to ask someone that knows the econ field, or any professional field, on what should I aim for, since my very classmates seem to be so inept and incompetent, I cannot but wonder: How do they get jobs? What do they do at the jobs they get? Looking at their profficiency as professionals I ask myself if I have wasted more than 4 years to get a job I could have done right out of High School?

Questions:

-Should I keep bothering in keeping on learning to get that internship and eventually that relished job?

-What kind of job will be waiting for me if I just go with the flow and do nothing but get my undergrad degree?

-Should I not give the entire posgrad education up, even when academically I reek on paper?

-In a fashion of 'victory at all costs', should I involve in ethically reprehensible behaviour such as cheating, plagiarizing, and sucking up to get the last bit of my on-paper self look better and thus have the chance to go further into my studies and get a decent job at a 'top' company?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

1) how does the workload/difficulty compare to before in a similar number of techs? I’m taking software engineering type stuff, 170/162/188/186 in future 2 semesters before I graduate, and 161 this summer. I found 61C harder than the other courses and this early unit of 161 is definitely the 61C focused portion so it’s also challenging for me but not impossible with a lot of effort.

2) Did you feel any big jumps in skill / mastery preparation for work after any upper division courses? I am a bit uncertain about my preparedness for CS jobs and am just dipping my toes into LeetCode but not as accomplished as many of my classmates with internships as mine for this summer was cancelled.

3) did you enjoy the overall experience of lower or upper div more?

------------------------

Post anything related to recruitment advice, company / group research, or general insecurity in here. 

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)

c) geography


d) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.

Misusing or trolling the sticky will result in an immediate ban.

**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target program (school + degree where a consulting firm focuses it's recruiting efforts), join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target program undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of strong pedigree, in-demand experience, and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants. 

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the application / interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Time to hear back can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires to never at all.  Asking in this thread will not help.

Long time lurker, first time posting. I recently completed all my electrical engineering coursework and I am set to graduate this December after wrapping up some non-engineering credits. Over the last four years, I have focused on studying large scale power systems since it's my goal to work in a utility. Now I had finally secured my first internship at a great local utility for this summer but due to COVID, the internship was canceled which is understandable. Then, all my other promising/backup power system related internships were also canceled. So now I'm set to graduate with no internship, which makes me pretty nervous. I'm worried I won't be competitive enough compared to others with internships when it comes to hiring. 

So now I am considering staying in school for an extra quarter and hope that internships will open back up by March 2021. I just got a state grant that would cover those tuition costs, so I wouldn't be adding to my debt. 

So what do you guys think? Should I stay in school for the extra three months and continue networking and my internship hunt. Or should I graduate in December and work on applying for jobs without any internship experience?"

1. Just telling NewCo's CEO outright that my current company is considering reviewing my pay upward and if it doesn't work out i would be happy to join his team but until then if he is willing i could work with the team as a consultant on a part time basis. ( I really miss being an engineer)

hkmdpe,123,2020-07-03,CBS-At The Center of Disappointment,CBSdiss,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/hkmdpe/cbsat_the_center_of_disappointment/,"Half a year ago, I strongly believed that I had made the right decision by applying only to the Columbia Business School. This decision has turned out to be the most disappointing and regretful decision I ever made.

As an international student, one of the biggest appeals of Columbia is the vast amount of job opportunities the students enjoy, both because of Columbia's unique physical location and of its long-lasting connection to the business world. The school also prides itself on having a diversified student body and being sensitive to the needs of students from various backgrounds. The last few months regrettably has called all these into question. The school has made clear that they will neither offer a full year deferral nor support students to gain summer internship eligibility (since we might not be able to receive F-1 visa in time due to the suspension of US embassies globally caused by COVID-19). As an international student who      believed in what Columbia stood for, like many of my classmates, I feel disappointed, anxious, and angry. We feel that at this critical time, Columbia has betrayed the international students that it claims to pride on. 

Currently, CBS only offers a deferral option to the J-term, which is totally useless and undesirable for international students who want to find a summer internship in the U.S... Needless to say how critical a summer internship is for finding a full-time job. CBS proudly claims a workaround that no one finds unacceptable. Since the Fall term is split into Fall A/B (Fall B, beginning 26. Oct), a student can miss Fall A and add a Summer A (Summer A: 3 May-18 June) to satisfy the CPT requirement. But this implies that the student must arrive in the      U.S before 26 Oct so that he/she can start the internship after June 18, which is highly questionable and likely doesn't fit into many corporations’ internship schedule. CBS officials have claimed that nothing else can be done. If one arrives later than 26 Oct, then one should basically say goodbye to any job opportunities in the US. 

If this is a universal policy across all the U.S. business schools, then it might be easier to swallow; however, both Harvard and Stanford offer the option to defer a full year; MIT, Booth, and Kellogg made summer internships a compulsory part of the MBA program, and hence allowing the students to be CPT eligible regardless of arrival time; Wharton has both! What do CBS students have? Best wishes and good luck! I now understand why CBS has been dropping in the rankings, not only now ranking bottom of M7 but even below programs outside of the M7!!! CBS is clearly not thinking for our best interest, and this is perhaps symptoms of a bigger problem. CBS, the world-renowned business school, does not care about its students! 

The officials are only good at pushing aside blames, self-congratulating, and dodging hard questions with” we don’t know yet” and “we can’t do this”. From April to July, only 3 informational Webinar sessions have been held, and none allowed live Q&amp;A. No questions answered and no insights offered. In contrast, peer schools held multiple LIVE SESSIONS to answer student questions and concerns, so that the school and students can work together and find a way to maintain the MBA experience. CBS on the other hand is busy congratulating itself for the 70 inches TV it bought to classrooms, “so you can randomly see your classmate’s face on that big screen”!!! I'm sure that's everybody's number one concern and priority!!! Can’t wait to brag about these ""achievements"" through a 1000 words email with 990 of the words full of BS.

For the prospective MBA applicants out there, especially international students, be prudent when selecting business schools. One of the most important attributes is whether the name you have to carry for a lifetime really cares about supporting you, and helping you achieve your full potential under this unprecedented environment. I am in pain to say that CBS should not be on the list."

I am glad I found this subreddit as it seems like there are a lot of very useful comments and suggestions so maybe someone would advise how I could get a job in data science. Similar to many others I have been sending my resumes and cover letters unsuccessfully to mostly data science positions. The thing is I don't have coding experience in a traditional sense because most of it was only Python and science-related: f.e. making plots, calculations, models etc. 

My qualifications: 3.5 GPA from the UIUC in physics and astronomy, the soon-to-be-published paper where I am a co-author, and did most of my work in Python making plots and calculations. Only had one internship experience at an observatory where I built them a simple Python program to download coordinates for observations. Anyway, I have been sending so many resumes, cover letters, networking with people in the companies, and I still see no results and not a single response. I have recently started taking an SQL class on Codecademy as it seemed like something that most Data Science jobs required. Anything else I should be doing in terms of learning new skills and move my experience more towards the industry? I have seen people here suggesting to take on some simple projects and contribute to some open source projects. Any specific suggestions? Or should I just keep applying with my experience and stuff?

hknyct,1,2020-07-03,How to get the coding challenge for the software engineering internship at Hubspot? Does connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn and sending them emails catalyze the process?,ikhurana,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hknyct/how_to_get_the_coding_challenge_for_the_software/,"Hey guys

I'm a rising junior at UMass Amherst pursuing computer science. I have an SWE internship rn and am working primarily on Java and salesforce apex. I know Angular and nodeJS as well and have done a bunch of projects involving those 2 languages and are up on my github repo. I'm highly fixated on hubspot for the next summers and was wondering if anyone knows how the interview process looks like? I'm aware that it's usually a 3 hours coding challenge -&gt; phone screening -&gt; final interview at the HQs but does everyone get the coding challenge or is there a resume screening before that? Does getting referrals and connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn help? Also, do they hire international students?

Thanks"

I’ve been browsing other programs in other schools but I’d really like to come back to UF. Could those who are currently in the program or finished it answer some questions?

- how competitive is it to get in? I was browsing others asking this and it appears to be pretty open. My gpa wasn’t the hottest but it’s still over 3.0. Also I scored a 310 on my GRE.

- the highest math my major required was Calc 1, would I be at an disadvantage if I didn’t do calc 2-3, differential equations, and linear algebra? Also it’s been a long time since I took stats, do they give a refresher in the courses or they assume you have it all down and ready to go? 

- they said you don’t need any programming experience. What are the typical languages the program deals with? I’m currently learning python, but would like to know the major ones they deal with for a head start.

- I saw the program has a 100% job placement. Does the program and business school help a lot in obtaining internships (apologies if this is a silly question). 

- finally I saw they split the semester into 2 mini semesters. Is it extremely intensive and did you find it to be overwhelming, or they more covered the main concepts and ideas that you need to know to for a job in the field?

Thanks for the help Gators!"

I'm currently hired as a virtual Software Engineer Intern at a Fortune 500 company. I wasn't really the one who applied in the company but an HR Recruiter found me on LinkedIn and we got connected there. I had an interview, they tested my skills, etc. So 3 days ago, I started my internship and then today, I met my manager and buddy after 2 days of orientation and training.

After seeing the code and diagrams of what my team works on, I feel like I never really learned programming(I learned it since I was 11) and software engineering. I feel like they rushed into hiring me because they probably can't hire anyone else and chatting with my fellow interns, I feel like they're all better than me. Is this feeling normal? And as I can't really talk to them in person, it doesn't help that I don't know much about them.

Sorry for my English as I'm Asian."
hkol02,1,2020-07-03,Duration unclear and stipend overdue for internship. What should I do?,kinetic87,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/hkol02/duration_unclear_and_stipend_overdue_for/,"I recently took up a web dev internship with a small startup. The process began in April and after  several rounds of interviews, I finally started there in May. It is a small company that takes up projects from clients. Due to COVID-19, I work from home (the company does not have a physical office anyway).

The thing is, that in my offer letter, it said that my internship would end two months after the start date which it has. The project that I'm working on, started quite late and is midway through and has about a month of work left, in the best case. So I'm already working a little more than the agreed duration.

When I finally passed all the interviews, and received the offer letter, it had no clear mentions about the stipend and it vaguely mentioned *emoluments* and *compensation* for my time at the company. But so far I've been working for free for them, with no clear amount ever mentioned or brought up. I took it up as internships were rare due to the virus. I feel like it was almost a rash decision.

So far I haven't brought either the duration or the pay with the founder (its a small company) because I started working on the project a month ago. I now feel like I should have cleared up the amount with him, before taking it up, but again I made a rash decision.

I got to know about the vacancy from personal contacts and there's two more developers working with me. Not sure how much they're paid, but they've been there quite some time. We only ever discuss work related stuff.

***I do not want this to turn into an unpaid internship, and I know its my fault for not speaking up.***

What should be the next logical step?

&amp;#x200B;

\[UPDATE\] 

I talked to them about it and cleared things out. Thank you guys for your advice!"

hkqp0z,0,2020-07-03,Are you guys really submitting hundreds of job applications?,Reeshaki,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hkqp0z/are_you_guys_really_submitting_hundreds_of_job/,"I've been a member of this subreddit for a little while now. Haven't taken part in too many conversations but have been reading posts. I can't help but notice the number of posts from new grads stating they submit hundreds of app only to get a dozen responses, handful of interviews, and 1 or 2 job offers. Majority of the posts talk about doing leetcode and having side projects as well. 

I know everyone's experience is different but I didn't do any of these. I majored in Computer Engineering and got an internship sophomore year developing web applications.  Received a fulltime job offer from them that I took when I graduated. Recruiters started reaching out a couple years later and got my next job through them. Realizing that changing companies is truly the best way to increase your salary, I started to actively look the next time I wanted to change jobs. I had applied to a little over a dozen jobs, some on my own and some through recruiters. Had 5 interviews and 3 offers. I recently started looking again, applied to maybe a dozen jobs, most of them full-remote, got 2 interviews. One I applied to directly and another through a recruiter. I am told the job brought to me by the recruiter is pretty much guaranteed to me. The other I went through their technical interview and completed their take home assessment and am now waiting to hear back.

Again, I don't have side projects and I have maybe spent 6 hours studying leetcode throughout my career. Yet here I am having nearly doubled my salary since I started my fulltime career 4 years ago. 

Before anyone says I got lucky with having an internship, nearly everyone in the group I was in got an internship throughout their college career. Even the guy we thought wasn't going to be able to finish the program got an internship. Some did their internships in networking, majority in software, some were working at the university in their IT group, others working with professors on their research. There were several that went to other states for their internship. Our program is not exactly a well known program. Heck, some of the companies here don't even know about the program we graduated from. 

It surprises me that so many people have issues finding a job. Are they only applying in major cities that are tech hubs? I just don't get it."
hkqzl6,0,2020-07-03,At what point can you confidently enter the CS workforce,robml,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hkqzl6/at_what_point_can_you_confidently_enter_the_cs/,"So I am a Data Science student with a focus in AI. The past few years have been interesting for me as I've shifted from a primarily finance oriented career track to completely reshaping my life to be more CS driven. This past interview season #quarantineEdition has also taught me a lot, namely not all companies have equal requirements.

I get for most internships you only really need to know how to a) code (well), b) Data Structures and Algo, c) have general logic/math problem solving skills. However with uncertainty in the labor market for junior developers AND work visa barriers, I am trying to prep for a worst case scenario where I am essentially unemployed and must work towards a developer position.

I have gone back and hit the books these past few months, and am laying my math foundation again (as college classes rushed thru it and this came to bite me in the ass numerous times), and have been taking time every day to work on LeetCode and other small problem solving questions. Ofc most of the time has gone to math so far but I expect that to change.

However for employment purposes I see all these skills required: Full Stack Web Developers or Dev Ops, ML Engineering requirements. Each of them are different in focus but from what I've seen available listings wise require a similar skillset of knowledge on how to deploy AI models (and the importance is I want to do this well since it's my core field) along with web techs (i.e. Express Stack, Django Stack) and devops (Docker, Kubernetes, configuring an AWS server, etc).

Frankly this all seems like a daunting load of work, not to mention that I do want to be able to write my own programs in depth (which for purposes of efficiency is usually in C++ altho this isn't my main problem, rather learning distributed computing and the nuances of threading will be).

My question as someone who is not well versed in all of this besides a foundation in Python, some C/C++, and some light web tech (Django stack basics), are there any core areas I can focus on to be able to deploy Minimum Viable Products/Projects to showcase skills, and if so, what are they specifically (I get lost from vague lists apologies in advance). My goal, at least in the beginning, is to be able to deploy ML oriented micro web services. Since I have some free time thanks to summer I don't want to learn the surface level that will require me to come back later, but I want to learn it well so I come back only when necessary.

Thanks again.

PS: do you guys know an estimated timeline for the given work as well? E.g. number of hours?"

New to this thread. Not sure if this will be considered a good post to post here but we shall see I guess. I thought I'd post in here to maybe get some helpful suggestions and/or to see what everyone else is experiencing right now. I am currently going into my senior year of my Bachelor's in ChemE at the University of Pittsburgh. 

I'm a little bit of a weird case. After high school I took a year off, and then went to a community college near where my parents lived. Finished my two years, got my electives done, received my associate's degree, and then transferred out to Pitt. I had some weird gaps in my class loads because of this (and also because Pitt uses a pillar system for their ChemE program) and was directed towards trying to get a co-op to help fill these gaps. My plan was to co-op last fall, this summer, and next spring.

I surprisingly found one last minute in Pittsburgh with a process engineering group for manufacturing (more along the lines of industrial engineering but I couldnt complain it was engineering experience and it was in Pittsburgh). I worked with them throughout the fall, through my winter break, and then thankfully enough I was able to continue to work for them as a temp during this past spring semester. That is until COVID hit which then finally lead to me being laid off on April 1 ( I know I asked my manager if it was some sick April Fool's joke). My manager hoped to bring me back later in the summer or in the fall to finish my co-op or to work as a temp again. Well basically long story short the company has been very slow and a lot of employees have been put on long term furlough, so doesnt seem I will be able to go back there even by the fall. It makes me very sad that I lost this position because I absolutely loved my manager, coworkers, and the atmosphere there. I could not complain about one thing. It was an amazing experience especially for my first job in industry and I felt like I was actually making a difference with the projects I worked on. I saw a future there and was so excited that I was working there now as a student because my manager made it clear that he planned for me to become a full-time employee there after I graduated. 

After that I began to apply to new co-op positions to hopefully get one for this summer and finish my last two rotations I still planned to do. I also applied to a few internships as well. As the time went on (almost 60+ applications later) I barely heard back from any places and the ones I have heard from said they're exploring other options. 

The later it got into the summer the more it seemed I wouldn't get a rotation for this summer. This got me thinking. If I continue my rotation program I would end up being pushed back an extra semester or even two. Talking with everyone close to me and looking over my options it seemed like the best thing would be to drop the co-op program, finish up my last two semesters, and graduate May 2021.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else is or has experienced anything like this? I imagine there are many students who have not been able to land new co-ops? Am I making the right decision in not finishing my co-op rotations? Or would it be better to finish my year of experience before I graduate? Should I still at least try for a internship for this fall since my class load is small (less than 12 credits so not even full-time) so that I get the experience I need, and also have a job and make some money during the semester? Has anyone heard of something like that? Or should I just finish my schooling, get a part-time job, and hope to find a full-tine job next summer? Hell my previous co-op employer might even be able to hire me as a full-time employee then too.

My biggest thing is that I really don't want to have to go back and work for less than $12/hour in addition to not working in my field again (like I did before my co-op I worked in retail). 

Any and all suggestions and experiences greatly appreciated!"

I was wondering if there are any users here who completed the Bioengineering MEng program and if you were willing to provide some insight/advice. I am used to the semester system during my undergrad, so I am a bit wary of the course load and what I should do with my (hopefully) one year at UCSD. With the vastness of the field of bioengineering I would like to make the most of my time there.

1. What are your fields of interests/concentrations (regenerative medicine, genetic engineering, etc...)?
2. What courses did you ultimately choose from all of the options of the [curriculum](http://be.ucsd.edu/master-engineering-curriculum) and how well do you think you managed them?
3. What kind of other activities were you involved in, whether it be campus clubs, research labs, part time jobs, or internships (doesn't have to be bioeng related)?  I understand COVID-19 can be kind of a inhibitor of these activities but I would like to know nonetheless.
4. If you were given a chance to redo anything during your time with the program, what would you change?

I guess as more questions arise I shall add more.

However, it is very difficult to find any job that doesn’t require being fluent In Japanese (I’m a beginner) that isn’t an English teacher for children. Although I would prefer not to work with children I would take a job doing it if it meant getting out, but when I had an interview with one company I didn’t get it. I feel like no teaching company would hire me due to lack of experience in that area, and again, it’s definitely not my preferred career. I have no idea where to go from here. I’m working on an application for Fullbright Germany 2021-2022, but I don’t want to work at Walmart for a year in the meantime.

However, I wouldn't mind doing SWE for a few years if I see there's a way to get out and go to a Data Science route. My questions are:

3.)So far on my resume, I have relatively little SWE experience, would it be possible to get an internship at FANG for SWE given this little experience? Or would I get ruled out because of that?

So I’ve made two sample students (A &amp; B) and both are applying to the same college in the same year. Let’s say this college has a low acceptance rate. Which of these two students is likely to get in? Why?

*STUDENT A*
* ORM
* Legacy
* 4.2 GPA weighted
* 1550+ on the SAT
* Good but average EC’s (NHS, sports, dance, music, volunteering, etc)
* Good recommendation letters from teacher
* Fantastic essay
* Parents are loaded. We’re talking doctors, business folk, rich capitalists, etc

*STUDENT B:*
* URM
* Not a legacy, first-gen, first to go to college
* 4.0 GPA weighted
* 1400+ on the SAT
* EC’s are great (internships, job, leadership positions, volunteering, etc)
* Unstable housing, poverty, traumatic event, multilingual, or something else to boost chances idk
* Average teacher recs but a pretty great &amp; touching essay

hkwzh5,1,2020-07-03,Civil Engineering and IT opportunities in Germany,tabosa,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/hkwzh5/civil_engineering_and_it_opportunities_in_germany/,"I am a graduate in Civil Engineering from Brazil and I'm applying for a Masters in Digital Engineering (a course that mixes computer science and civil engineering through modelling, data science, etc.) in Weinar, Germany. It's the only course I've seen that directly relate these two fields, anywhere, so if anybody knows some similar course please tell.  


Anyway, my main question is: how is the market in Germany for recent masters graduates in such a field? How hard is it to get a job in civil engineering or IT areas after you graduate (or something that relates the two, like BIM and IoT)? Or even how hard would it be to get a internship?

The situation in Brazil for civil engineers is really bad and there is no focus on innovation and technology on the area, so I got really discouraged because that is what I like. The software development opportunities are somewhat better, though.  


Thanks for any information you can give!

hkxh8c,7,2020-07-04,Should I delay Undergrad Graduation to better prepare for Graduate school Admissions?,AirBendingNopon,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/hkxh8c/should_i_delay_undergrad_graduation_to_better/,"Currently I am a student in the UC System as a Mechanical Engineering major with a minor in Biomedical Engineering with a future goal of securing a Masters Degree in Biomedical Engineering.

I am about to go into my 4th year and just got accepted to do voluntary research in a lab desiging assistive tech. Eventually I would like to continue doing this research and get involved in either a Mems or Neuroscience/BCI lab ive been looking into. Unfortunately, I kinda screwed up my first 3 years and literally have nothing to show off (no internships, no senior projects, nada) so I am considering taking an extra year by completing the minor, take classes not needed, or take the bare minimum units for financial aid in order to give myself more time for these experiences i have in mind as well as increase my GPA a little bit. My school offers a spring research program i am planning on applying to as well depending on what the projects are.

I am researching various schools to go to, mainly the UC's again, Purdue,  and various out of states including NorthWestern University and Univeristy of Michigan Ann Arbor (these would be a dream come true also trying to look into safety schools) These are my current stats

**GPA**: 3.51

**GRE**: Plan to take 

**Research Experience: Cu**rrently doing summer research for a rehabilitation device lab with a graduate student and plan to continue during the school year. Plan to get involved in another lab listed above for units later on.

**Work Experience:**     Various on campus leadership positions in clubs and paid positions but no related internships as of now but am proactively planning on securing an internship next summer 2021 

**LOR:** I would assume I would have at least one recommendation from the graduate student assuming that goes well as well as a past employer in a department withing my school (completely unrelated to engineering but that have helped me in the past to secure a different non-engineering job) 

I feel like with my current stats, it will be nearly impossible to get into any of these schools which is why i am willing to delay my graduation to secure more opportunities related to my major. Thank you for any advice you are able to offer me and feel free to recommend safety schools I should look into as well :)"
hkxo7b,26,2020-07-04,Passed Security+ (804/900),[deleted],CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hkxo7b/passed_security_804900/,"I passed the Security+ exam earlier this week with a score of 804/900! I had been studying on-and-off since the start of the year, then scheduled my exam for July 1st at the end of May to give myself one full month to focus on studying.

**My background**

I graduated with a Bachelor's in MIS in May. I worked for a couple of years as an IT help desk student employee for a department on my university's campus. Last summer I worked full-time as an intern for a large telecommunications company in an IT analyst/project management type role. I've been working part-time for the same company since the conclusion of my internship. I've been interested in getting into information security so I took a few security-focused classes my senior year, which were mainly helpful for the business/risk management aspects of this exam. This was my first time taking a certification exam of any kind.

**Study materials and practice**

* McGraw-Hill CompTIA Security+ All-in-One Exam Guide by Conklin and White
   * I bought this book about a year ago. I thought it was decent, but I couldn't make myself read all the way through it. Most of the questions at the end of the chapters are pretty solid, but I wouldn't recommend relying on these questions as the only form of practice.
* Professor Messer Security+ Video Playlist and Practice Exams
   * I watched all of the videos, and thought that they were a solid resource and were relatively easy to understand. For me, the most beneficial moments were when he would show a diagram or visualization of a network environment and demonstrate/describe how data would move across the network in a certain situation. It was also great when he would show examples of how the command line tools could be used. The Technologies &amp; Tools objective of this exam was probably the area I had the least experience in, so that was super helpful.
   * **\*\*\*\*His practice exams were definitely the most comparable to the actual exam of any resource I used\*\*\*\*.** I can't recommend these enough. The first time I took them, I scored a percentage of 74/84/85. I scored in the 90s the second time.
* Jason Dion Practice Exams on Udemy
   * These were pretty solid as well. First take: 64/71/72/78/74/80. 90s on the second taking.
* Mike Meyers Course and Practice Exams on Udemy
   * I ended up not really using the course videos, as it seemed he would often go off on tangents not relevant to the exam.
   * Similarly, the tests were not very similar to the actual exam. I scored 88/83/86 on these. I don't personally recommend using these materials.
* Darril Gibson Security+ Prep iOS App
   * These questions were really good, most seemed to be more complicated than the real exam. It was great to be able to do practice questions on my phone whenever I wanted. This was a great resource.
* Exam Compass
   * I did a few of these tests too, and overall these were decent for a free resource.

**Pearson Vue and Exam experience**

* I took the test at home. I ran through the system test on my 2015 Macbook Pro the day before and everything was fine. I completely cleared my desk of everything outside of my laptop, keyboard and mouse. I unplugged my external monitor, as well as a TV in my room, and moved them to the back corner of my room where they were out of sight. The proctor still chimed in and had me move some books in the lower shelf of my desk.
* After that, he said he would release the test and I could get started. This is where some pretty serious problems started. It was frozen on a black screen for about 10-15 minutes. I got up to get my phone, and they called me. They had me restart my machine and then it ended up working fine. Luckily I had logged in 30 minutes before my exam time, but it was certainly not great to have that added stress before starting the test.
* Once I got started, OnVue worked decently overall, but the drag and drop aspect of the PBQs was definitely very clunky.
* I had 81 questions including 5 PBQs. I skipped the PBQs and worked through the multiple choice. I was fully prepared to feel like I was failing the whole time, but overall I felt pretty comfortable. I would say about half of the questions seemed pretty obvious right off the bat, while the other half were quite challenging. The PBQs were difficult. I flagged probably 10-15 questions for review, but ended up not changing any of them. I definitely wasn't completely sure if I had passed when I submitted. The survey at the end was painful, and I really wish they made us do that at the beginning, haha.

**Overall**

It was a great and relieving feeling to see that passing score. I had a goal of scoring over 800, so I'm glad to have hit that.

It wasn't the hardest test I've ever seen, but it certainly wasn't a cakewalk either. Overall, it's definitely doable with just a bit of dedication!

Next up, I'm going to relax for a bit and then eventually try to get the CySA+. I enjoyed reading people's experiences with the test on this sub, so I hope my story can help as well! Thanks for reading."
hkzgws,24,2020-07-04,"Aspiring DE, but completely lost on where to begin",Aegyx,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/hkzgws/aspiring_de_but_completely_lost_on_where_to_begin/,"Hi, I’m a rising undergrad senior and have recently become more interested in pursuing a job as a DE after graduating. I’m a CS major with a slightly more SWE-related background, but I have recently taken classes regarding database design, distributed computing, and business intelligence (pipelining, data warehousing, etc.). After reading through posts on this sub and searching on Google, I think I have a broad picture of what a DE generally does, although I understand it can vary wildly from company to company. 

Despite being a CS student, I really have nothing going for me at the moment besides the fact that I go to a top ~12 undergrad school. My SWE internship this summer got cancelled, so I’ve been looking to create some side projects to build my understanding on DE concepts and technologies (and to also increase my chances of actually being considered for a DE job), but I’m having a lot of trouble conceptualizing how exactly I should go about doing this.

For data science projects, you can just generally start off with a problem that you’re interested in and collect data / do some exploratory data analysis / apply some ML models to the data / explain whatever insights you gained from your results and bang! you have a decent data science project. However, I don’t see how I can do the same for DE, especially considering that any project I’d want to work on would be on such a small scale that it would be kind of funny or weird to use technology or software that is specialized for big data purposes. Besides this, I’m also not exactly sure how one actually goes about formulating a DE project. It’s just much harder for me to think about the utility or feasibility of a personal side project for DE than it is for DS, most likely because my understanding of DE is still very limited.

One more problem is that there are just so many things for me to learn. I don't know what kind of theoretical knowledge / technologies I should have under my belt in order to have a chance at getting a junior data engineering role out of undergrad. I feel like I'd need more than the average candidate especially because I don't have any internship experience. 

I would really appreciate some pointers or resources to guide me. Thanks!"

hl10ne,0,2020-07-04,Your school does matter.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hl10ne/your_school_does_matter/,"I took the liberty, due to lockdown induced boredom, to trawl through LinkedIn for stats on current SWE interns from 3 different clusters of schools. 

The first cluster being the typical generically top schools / top CS schools, second cluster being above average schools / above average CS schools and the last cluster being relatively average / easier schools to get into. Each cluster is ranked from top to bottom based on gross (non-scaled) intern output with a minimum cut-off mark of 60 interns.

I focused on interns because they are probably the greatest signal for how much campus priority and access to opportunities students at these schools get from employers. Whereas focusing on currently employed SWEs decouples the relationship between campus and career a bit - though based on these findings, certain clusters *ahem* will almost certainly have a premium over others even after graduating.

The clusters are as follows:

Cluster 1: 
Berkeley, Georgia Tech, UIUC, CMU, USC, UCSD, UMich, UT-Austin, UWash, UCLA, Stanford, Cornell, MIT, Columbia, Duke, UPenn, UVA, NYU, Brown, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Rice, WUSTL, Tufts, UChicago, CalTech, JHU, Notre Dame, Dartmouth

Cluster 2:
UMD-CP, UC Irvine, Northeastern, Purdue, Wisconsin, RIT, OSU, TAMU, NCSU, Florida, UCF, Cal Poly SLO, Stony Brook, Penn State, Rutgers, SCU, UC Davis, WPI, BYU, UCSB, RPI, Pittsburgh, Stevens

Cluster 3:
SJSU, ASU, Iowa State, Virginia Tech, Colorado Boulder, Michigan State, UC Riverside

For each cluster, I took a slice for groups of n number of schools (typically 10 but not always) in descending order to get total interns for that group then averaged them across the number of schools in that group.

Cluster 1:

- First 10: 600 interns on average

- Next 10: 290 interns on average

- Next 10: 110 interns on average

- Next 2: 75 interns on average

**Total interns in cluster**: 10.15k

Cluster 2:

- First 10: 280 interns on average

- Next 10: 130 interns on average

- Next 2: 90 interns on average

**Total number of interns in cluster**: 4.28k

Cluster 3

- First 7: 171 interns on average 

**Total number of interns in cluster**: 1.2k

This is bearing mind that a lot of schools with a hefty number of interns (Stanford, Duke, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Northwestern etc) have **more interns** than some schools that are 10x their size in the lower clusters.

Notably, cluster 1 has a **65%** share of all current interns. Further, the top 20 schools by number of interns have a **60%** share of all interns. By far the leader of all schools was Berkeley with ca. **1000** SWE interns. If I had more time I would analyse the percentage of ""top tech"" vs non-top tech but anecdotally the proportion for cluster 1 schools was also far, far higher than cluster 2 and cluster 3. 

Now you can argue whether this is a case of egg vs chicken but the numbers don't lie. Tech is very much just as complicit in sourcing its talent disproportionately from better schools as other top fields."
hl1msn,78,2020-07-04,[Poly] Engineering Science at NP: COURSE REVIEW 👏👏,nullawrence,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hl1msn/poly_engineering_science_at_np_course_review/,"Hi! I'm a graduate from NP Engineering Science (ES) and I thought I'd share my experience here. (Ngl I was inspired by a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hiogbx/uni_the_truth_about_nturep/) lol.) Hopefully we can start a trend where graduated seniors share their unbiased thoughts and experiences on their courses.

This post is intended for prospective students/juniors as a guide on what to expect from the course, beyond what the marketing materials will tell you. I'll try my best to be unbiased in my account and speak more of the experience of everyone generally, but of course, your mileage may still vary. Furthermore, there's been some changes to the programme since my cohort so take things here with a grain of salt.

**Setting expectations**

I regularly joke about how the course will not land you a job, but will land you a spot in uni. There's truth to that. The course broadly touches on mechanical, electrical, electronic engineering and programming, but it's all not enough for the real world despite graduating with a specialisation (though I heard those have been removed).

*""But doesn't that just make it a 3-year JC?""*

Ok if you put it that bluntly then yes. Everyone in the course qualifies for JC too. But the reasons for choosing ES range from having more hands-on projects to a more vibrant student life compared to mugging like O-levels all over again. Don't get me wrong, you'll still have exams, but not as much, and it's very manageable. Plus, go poly dunnid take Chinese mah.

**Academics**

ES focuses on research, evident from the research and development immersion project in year 2 and the final year project in year 3. You'll have a broad range of options for those, from in-house projects conducted in NP to attachment projects with NUS, NTU, or an industry partner.

Regarding the instruction and pedagogy, I don't think it varies that much from any other course. You'll have a mix of good lecturers and those you just can't understand, just like everyone else. ES does have its own exclusive modules, though, and they are very lenient. A couple of times they even changed the assessment weightages because we did so poorly for a test lol.

Grades-wise, maintaining A's with a few B's here and there is very manageable. In my batch, about half carried a GPA 3.8 or higher, and you don't need to mug too hard to achieve that. Those grades will land you a spot in most local uni engineering programmes. I suggest taking the time to join competitions, CCA's, hopefully take up a leadership position to boost your scholarship prospects. But of course, don't neglect your grades too much la hor.

**Scholarships**

The brochures gladly boast that ES has a higher percentage of students receiving scholarships from NP but I think that can be attributed to many of the students having single-digit O-levels. From my experience, I've seen that number shrink from 33% when I first came in, to 25%, now 18%.  But don't worry if you don't get those. Keep your eyes peeled for external scholarships offered by A\*Star, DSO, Singtel, M1 which often have better offers.

**Atmosphere/Student Life**

ES students are really tight-knit compared to other other courses because of its small batch size and dedicated project and study rooms just for us. You'll largely stick with the same class throughout your 3 years too.

You may have the impression that it's a competitive course, but which course isn't? ES just has more nerds in it. Despite that, I never sensed any crab mentality in the course so you shouldn't really worry about it. Everyone has the same goal of uni anyway.

Outside of ES, people tend to have vibrant student lives too, participating actively in CCAs. I count 3 club presidents in my class alone, and it's not uncommon for people to hold EXCO roles.

**Overseas trips**

My batch was a lucky one. We went on the last 3D2N orientation programme conducted in a Bintan resort, fully paid-for (not kidding). We also had a 2-week study trip in Japan, though that we had to pay for and we didn't clear any modules, pretty much everyone went there to have fun. The cohort after me had a longer immersion programme in China, though. I can't speak for that but they did clear a module or two.

**Changes**

Since my batch, there's been a quite a few changes to the programme. Other than those I've mentioned, new batches now have a data AI/machine learning module (which I wish I had), and now students have the option of going for internship instead of doing a final year project.

**Prospects**

Like I said, this course pretty much just primes you for uni, and alums end up in a diverse range of engineering programmes. But what's interesting is the sheer number of people opting to go to SUTD. I count 7 out of my 60 batchmates, and that's only the ones I know. Not bad for a new uni.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I rate this course 8.5/10. Short of a perfect score because my batch had some modules of questionable relevance and we didn't proper overseas exchange programme, though I think those have been addressed for future batches. Generally, I believe my peers are satisfied with the course too."

english teacher/advisor: had him in jr yr but he's been my academic advisor for 3 yrs and he's very outgoing/easy to talk to

counselor: i only talked to her a few times bc tbh i didn't want her holding my hand in the college app process but she seemed to like me and seemed rly interested in the schools i was applying to smh... just bc they're ranked higher than some of the schools most of the girls in my school applied to and even though i go to a private school, we're not that well known for sending girls off to ""prestigious"" colleges lol

**Interviews**

one for Georgetown... honestly didn't prepare much lol and when she asked what I was involved in somehow I only mentioned about 3 of the 10 things on my list so uh yeah mess up on my end

its ok i wasnt expecting to get into there anyway

part of the reason why i applied was bc my dad made me bc it's the ""only prestigious university that's an hr away from home""

**Essays**

i thought my essay was decent...?  i wrote about my skating fundraiser and how i received very few donations but was still proud of my will to act on my interests and passions - long story short, my mom, brother, and i went to a shelter once so i wanted to give back to a shelter too

I got a PhD in math (probability theory) around 8 years ago, and I quit academia afterwards to pursue a career in a totally different domain (i got an artistic job in the animation film industry). Right now with covid, things are drying up a bit in this industry and I am considering my options.

What would be a viable path for me to get into a CS career ? I am mid 30s, I have very good skills in math/stats, Some knoweledge in algorithms/data structures, but only light experience with python (and some personal arduino projects for fun). So its not like i cannot code at all, but i have zero professional experience In what it takes to build an actual project with a team.

I’d love to know how you think I could make myself hireable within a timeframe of 1/2 years : pursue a degree in cs for example, look for an internship, attend a bootcamp/online certification ? Optimally Id like to look for things available in france where I am based or online.

Thanks for any advice and opinions you might have !"
hl6x8d,1,2020-07-04,Me (30M) had a fight with my friend (26F) and need advice on how to release my anger.,dominus_selenos,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hl6x8d/me_30m_had_a_fight_with_my_friend_26f_and_need/," Hello All,

As described in the title me and my friend, we had a falling out. It begin with me starting to lately notice that she had been telling me that she is sick more often and she is depressed more often or her roommates are having bad times etc and she needed my help. I felt this is was happening too often but I didn't mind and kept doing stuff for her like her assignments, homework and even her internship job assignments. But last month accidentally I came to know from her roommate that all these times she has been lying to me and instead she is spending time with a guy who she had told me that she had broke up with. She is just using these sickness and depression lies to manipulate me into doing her work because she spends nearly the almost entire day and late nights with him and she has no time left to do the important career related work.

A little bit of background about this guy she is with, he has substance abuse problem and is also a real charmer. I had told her that if she is serious about this guy, she should pursue the relationship but there is a chance she might get hurt due to his substance abuse problems, after few days she told me she has broken up with him at this time, she would like to focus on career and university work. This was about few months before I came to know that this was a lie.

So when I came to know that not only she is still spending time with him but also using me to do her academic and job work under the guise of being sick and depressed, I felt manipulated and used.

So when I confronted her about it, she initially denied ever being in touch with him, then turned it around and accused me of controlling her and telling her what to do and what not to do and finally called me a fake and negative person. I always told her go ahead if you are really serious about the guy, I never told her break up with him. I tried to get answers what negative/controlling actions I have done, she stopped communicating after this.

At this time, I realize I was used by her for her professional growth and I have made peace with it. But I have this simmering anger that she called me all those colorful adjectives when I have been nothing but kind, generous and giving in my nature to her. At times, I feel like cornering her and let out all the thoughts in my mind but my rational mind says that nothing good will come out of it. I will not get the peace I am looking for.

I am looking for any advice on how to let my anger go and reclaim my peace of mind.

PS - I have a healthy workout regimen to channel my angry emotions into physical workout and I have a busy schedule to keep me distracted. But when I am alone with myself like right before sleep or during commute or just alone thinking, this anger comes out of nowhere and I don't know what to do about it."

hl8xiu,24,2020-07-04,"Recent College Grad, Junior Position, What Questions to Ask?",ang13r0fth3w3st,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/hl8xiu/recent_college_grad_junior_position_what/,"I am a recent college graduate with about a year of industry experience via an internship. I have been interviewing with a company for a junior cloud engineer position and it seems likely I will be extended an offer. However, I have other offers lined up and I want to make sure this will be a good opportunity and not a total nightmare. 

I have been reading through posts on here about questions interviewees should ask potential employers with regard to SRE, software systems engineering and cloud engineer positions. Some of the suggestions I like include:

*  a variation of ""what prompted you to post this position?"" 
*  ""what projects do you hope to complete within the next year and what are the potential challenges that would obstruct them?""

Essentially, this is a relatively small company (&lt; 200 people) which was recently acquired by a much larger company, and they are looking to introduce DevOps principles into their infrastructure, culture and practices. In keeping with this, they are hiring a bunch of SDETs, developers and cloud engineers to facilitate the transition. 

I tried to ask revealing questions to get a sense of whether this will be a good opportunity, but having very limited experience I do not know exactly how to differentiate between a 'red-flag, must avoid' situation and an opportunity for really good experience with bringing a company up to speed. Here are some things I know about the company:

* Deployments tend to take a matter of hours under current conditions
* Presently almost no automated testing is conducted
* No CI/CD tools or processes are in place; the guy I was interviewing with is has been with the company for less than a year and admitted to me this is a source of concern that he wants to address as soon as possible
* An entirely new development tool suite is being pursued but not yet in place (a legacy internal Git repo system is being replaced, work tracking tool being identified, etc)
* Certain AWS services are in place and further movements into the AWS ecosystem are planned
* Python is looking to be the root of automation scripting
* There would be on-call duties associated with the position I am seeking but because a NOC handles less challenging production faults, I would only be called on in serious 'emergencies' (when asking for context, my interviewer claimed that outside the situation with deployments, he has not yet had to work off-hours due to issues in the production environment)

As a recent college graduate, what are some questions I could ask to really verify whether this company is serious about moving in the right direction? And again, on the flip side, what would be some red flags that they have no intention of doing anything but sticking the word 'DevOps' on everything to be trendy? This cloud engineering team is new to the company, and I would likely be the first junior level member hired to this team. I will be interviewing with the senior members of this team this next week. Is there anything in particular I should ask them?

There have been some good posts on here about questions to ask employers but some of them assumed a certain level of prior industry experience. I think it would be great to have a thread covering the subject for junior-level/ recent college-grad applicants.  Thank you for your time and contributions! Please let me know if any additional details would be useful."
hl936a,2,2020-07-04,"Move to a bigger city without a job offer, remain underemployed, or change careers: What is the safest decision?",user1_007,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hl936a/move_to_a_bigger_city_without_a_job_offer_remain/,"Hello fellow Redditors, I'm currently at a crossroads in my career. I'm am worried that making the ""wrong"" decision will ruin my career prospects. Since I want to provide as much information as possible, this will be a long post. I've attached a TL;DR below.

***Background:***

I had graduated in 2017 with a business degree. My coursework focused on HR &amp; marketing, and I completed a few internships. My 22 year-old brain decided to take a ""break"" before starting my career by teaching English overseas for two years. When I came back home to my small city last summer, I was lucky enough to find a job with an educational institution. I thought it would be a perfect fit as it would allow me to combine my business and teaching experience. Unfortunately, the environment in my department was very toxic. Due to administrative shakeups and budget changes, I was laid-off in January. I immediately started applying to other positions; however, once the lockdown was imposed in February/March, all the jobs I had received interviews for were canceled. 

I have moved back in with my parents and have been working in the meantime for a third-party security firm doing temperature screenings. Unfortunately, I was once again laid-off after the company decided to use internal employees instead. My home city was already economically depressed before COVID. Now, full-time entry-level job opportunities in my field are extremely hard to come by. 

The way I see it, I have 3 options. I'd like to chose the option that would maximize my changes of building my career over the long-term. 

***Option 1: Move to the closest big city and sublet a place while looking for work:***

Pros: 

* Much more opportunities
* Having a local address will make me more attractive to employers. (I've been applying for postings across the country, but I feel that not being local is hurting my chances.)
* More opportunities to network and expand my long-term career prospects
* It's close enough that I could still apply to jobs in my home city simultaneously and travel back (about 4 hours) for interviews.

Cons:

* It may be hard to find an entry-level position that pays enough to cover the cost of living.
* The only professional connections I have in the city are people I haven't spoken to in years.
* If I'm not successful in finding a position, I will have wasted a lot of time and money.

***Option 2: Take a customer service or part-time admin job in my home city***

Pros: 

* These are the only positions somewhat related to my major that seem to be hiring right now and would provide me with some flexibility to wait for better opportunities.
* I could save money by staying with my parents.

Cons:

* Remaining underemployed, staking a step-down in my career, and potentially not looking as competitive to employers down the road
* I miss the big city lifestyle I had overseas and would eventually want to move.

***Option 3: Take another teaching position overseas (and potentially transition into a teaching career)***

Pros: 

* I already know that I enjoy teaching, opportunities are plentiful, and I would be a competitive applicant with two years of experience.
* It would allow me to save money as I decide what to do with my future.

Cons:

* It would pretty much kill any chances of using my business degree.
* While I do like teaching, I don't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. (Although I would be open to using it as a stepping stone to advance into educational administration or curriculum development.)
* If I were to transition into teaching, I'd almost certainly have to remain overseas or move to another part of the country. Teaching jobs in my home province are extremely hard to come by.

***Tl;DR:*** 

I graduated in 2017 with a business degree, taught overseas for two years, and moved back to my small home city which has very limited job opportunities. I see 3 options for myself: 

1. Move to a bigger city and hope I find a better job that will cover the cost of living
2. Continue looking for jobs in my current city that would be a step down for me
3. Teach overseas again while saving to pursue a career change in the future

I'd like to choose the option that would minimize risk while allowing me the best chance to build my career over the long term.

Thanks in advance for your input."

I interned at a company last summer before I graduated in December 2019 and did not receive a return offer. I didn't even realize that my manager didn't recommend me, but in hindsight, I should've known better when my manager didn't mention me returning as a FTE. I thought it would've been fine to reapply the Fall after my internship, but after the initial call, the recruiter wouldn't let me through because I was not recommended by my manager even though my team members were satisfied and willing to be references. There were no specifics as to why I did not get a return offer, but I did realize that a couple other interns also did not get return offers that year especially for that location. I was able to get an offer by a different company, but was laid-off recently because of Covid. So, now, my dilemma is should I reapply to the same technology program for new grads in the 2020/2021 cycle or would I get auto-rejected again after an initial call because of my past record?

hle36g,0,2020-07-04,Which CS discipline is most procedural?,HenesysMSEast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hle36g/which_cs_discipline_is_most_procedural/,"Hi everyone. I’ve gotten a BS in computer science with a minor in mathematics and I’ve been working as a mostly front end engineer for 2 years professionally now, mostly with Angular and some Nodejs. A few things have got me thinking of where I want to take my career:

1. I feel like early on in my career is the best time for me to broaden my skill set. If I continue down my path, I can quickly see myself getting siloed into a specific area of computer science my whole career. I’m not opposed to specializing someday, but as someone who has some level of interest in most of the different fields/disciplines of computer science, I don’t want to become specialized on something just because it’s what I got an internship doing in college. I feel I’ve never truly gotten to experience the world of data science, for example, even though I hold a data science certificate from my university for completing a specific set of courses on the way to my Bachelors. If not early in my career, when else will I truly get to experience some of these fields? 

2. I started thinking about how I think I’d prefer, for a job, something more procedural in the computer science realm, at least more procedural than development. My reasoning for this is actually work/life balance. I know that every company is different, but where I currently develop, I work on a small development team. If I encounter a roadblock, there’s often immediate pressure to work 10-12 hour days until it’s resolved. There’s a lot I could speak on with regards to my small teams attempt at agile methodology, but that’s not really the point of the post. I was thinking that maybe, on average, jobs in cs that are a bit more procedural might be a little more forgiving in the realm of technical roadblocks/implementation roadblocks, but maybe I’m mistaken. What is your experience? And what’re your thoughts on this? 

Any insights about these two thoughts are greatly appreciated!"

I have recently applied to the program for this upcoming Winter Quarter (2021) and have come across a dilemma. 

I will be graduating from my initial degree this fall (2020) in Business - Info Sys and have job offers for the summer of 2021 (1 FT Offer &amp; 1 Internship Offer).

As of now, I'm not sure which one I'll be taking but I'm 100% set in getting this post-bacc program to fully shift from a Business/IT background to set myself up for a SWE role. 

As my future is  unclear, all I know is I have a gap to take classes FT with no obligations (not entirely adulting just yet) until the  beginning of summer.

**Meat of the Question:**

Is it possible/recommended (if able) to take 3 courses per quarter?  I have only come across the 2-class per  quarter road map on the website and  have only found previous posts of individuals going for  1/2/or 4 classes a quarter.  

That being said, what classes would one recommended to take for their first 2 quarters?

Term 1 (Winter)

* CS 161 Intro to Computer Science I
* CS 225 Discrete Structures in Computer Science
* ???

Term 2 (Spring)

* CS 162 Intro to Computer Science II
* CS 261 Data Structures
* CS 271 Computer Architecture &amp; Assembly Language

Term 3 (Summer) 

* CS 290 Web Development
* IT Advisory Internship (trying to go from a consultant role --&gt; Technical Position within the company). 

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for my ignorance,  have been trying to do my own due diligence and will continue to do so but figured I'd directly ask the individuals who are currently in the program or have already graduated.

It's like being in an abusive relationship with myself.

I recently landed a job. More of a long-term internship(co-op) for the next 6 months. I'm in grad school full time but I'll be working for the next semester instead of going to classes. 

Many of my classmates were struggling to land internships even pre-COVID, including me. Come COVID, most of them gave up applying because every company was sending them the ""We've cancelled our internship program due to COVID"" email. The point is, on paper, it's supposed to be a ""good"" accomplishment that I landed this job given how competitive the environment is. However, me being me, I've told myself that I shouldn't have gotten the job, that this wasn't a difficult interview and that I was just lucky, that I should have gotten something better. That I don't deserve it. 

I want to now try and con myself into believing that I do deserve this job, and I want to do it by celebrating. Having not been happy in a very long time, I don't know how to treat myself. I thought I'd buy a bottle of whiskey to enjoy, but then I'm not a big drinker. I've gotten drunk with my friends in the past, but in those occasions I enjoyed the company and not the actual drink itself. I don't even like whiskey that much. 

Do you have any idea on how I should find something that makes me happy?"

Currently I am in a very confused situation.  Right now I am interning at a StartUp in India which will turn into a full time offer once I get my degree.

The problem is our university has put our degree on hold due to CoronaVirus. However, once I get my degree, I will have to sign up for a 1 year service agreement at my current company which means I can shift to London after one year.

My degree will come around Sept-Oct 2020, which means I can leave India in Oct 2021.  Plus, due to Covid19, my current company has shifted us from Developer Position to SRE position.  In our company, the SRE position only requires operational work and no coding so this position does not really interest me.  But due to Covid I am stuck to this position.

My main question is it worth leaving India and shifting to Uk a good idea,  amidst the pandemic or should I wait for one year?  Since my degree has been delayed, my internship has been extended and I am currently having an experience of 10 months.  Is this experience enough to get a job in Uk, if I shift now.

I am currently a rising junior studying computer science with a finance minor. I am really interested in eventually working in the tech industry, but honestly I'm not great at coding. I do well in classes, but I feel like I just know enough to do well in these classes, and cannot be considered ""competitively good"" compared to my peers if that makes sense. This last week, I was offered an internship at Ernst &amp; Young (EY) for summer 2021. The position is for the TAP Program (Technology Advisory Program). Basically, it is more or less of a consulting internship with a concentration on leveraging technology for the clients. I was really excited about this position, and super proud of myself for getting it. Once the excitement died down though, I became to have second thoughts. I'm not sure if this makes sense or makes me sound ungrateful, but I feel like I could do more with myself beyond consulting. I was never specifically interested in consulting, but I just sort of applied to the position without fully realizing how much it was related. There are lots of people who get into consulting with a comp sci degree, and I feel like since I'm working so hard to get that cs degree I should use it in a more applicable field (on top of the fact that I don't have that huge interest in consulting in the first place). I hope I don't sound ungrateful - I definitely am so thankful for the EY opportunity and recognize that I'm very lucky but I Just don't want to have any regrets.

Basically, what I'm thinking about is the idea that if I were to do the internship my junior year summer, I would be ""stuck"" doing consulting full time the following year(s) since EY is known to give full time return offers for most interns if you do fine (not sure if COVID will affect this though). The problem is that I want to go into a role more like product management. The timing is tricky because I don't think I would have the time to do another internship but I do want to try to get into product if that is a possibility. My summer 2021 EY offer is ""at-will"" so either parties (me or EY) can terminate at any time. Should I look into another internship for summer 2021 that better aligns with my interests or should I Just take the EY offer? If I were to apply to other internships that summer, is there any way I can leverage the EY offer or is that frowned upon? Really not sure how any of this works so hopefully you guys can help me out with any advice."

And then there's other filler clubs and stuff, but they don't really matter.

Essays/LORS

I've been working on my college essays. I don't think I'm in a position to say if they're good or not, but I'm fairly certain they'll be grammatically correct.

LORS - speech and debate teacher (we're tight and spent a lot of time with them)  calc teacher (two years together and we're alright. I don't know if it will be out of the park like debate teachers). I could also get one from the CEO of the company I have an internship at because she's also my director.

I'm considering collegiate debate, but who knows. Mainly my concern is that I don't do a whole bunch of things (like i haven't started multiple companies, podcasts, had internships that relate to their career choices) just because debate is such an important and foundational part of my life and I love the activity a whole bunch. it just doesn't really have to do a lot with the career I want to pursue.

Hello Everyone!

About me: 22 yo male fresh computer science graduate from Lebanon. I want to get out to Europe and ideally Sweden, since my brother have the Sweden citizenship if that's worth mentioning.

Can my brother help me in any way on moving out? Maybe finding a job or an intern there or maybe pursing a masters degree since I'm having really hard times getting a job or even an internship since there's no job opportunities as we're having an economic crisis and hyperinflation rate for our currency and life is just getting worse everyday.

I can't even pursue a Masters degree in my country because of my tight financial status so is there any options to consider guys? any help or advice would be appreciated!

Thank You for reading this."
hlqoui,2,2020-07-05,"Entry-level candidate at a career crossroads: How do I make the ""right'"" decision?",user1_007,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/hlqoui/entrylevel_candidate_at_a_career_crossroads_how/,"Hello fellow Redditors, I'm currently at a crossroads in my career. I'm am worried that making the ""wrong"" decision will ruin my career prospects. Since I want to provide as much information as possible, this will be a long post. I've attached a TL;DR below.

***Background:***

I had graduated in 2017 with a business degree. My coursework focused on HR &amp; marketing, and I completed a few internships. My 22 year-old brain decided to take a ""break"" before starting my career by teaching English overseas for two years. When I came back home to my small city last summer, I was lucky enough to find an administrative job with an educational institution. I thought it would be a perfect fit as it would allow me to combine my business and teaching experience. Unfortunately, the environment in my department was very toxic. Due to administrative shakeups and budget changes, I was laid-off in January. I immediately started applying to other positions; however, once the lockdown was imposed in February/March, all the jobs I had received interviews for were canceled.

I have moved back in with my parents and have been working in the meantime for a third-party security firm doing temperature screenings. Unfortunately, I was once again laid-off after the company decided to use internal employees instead. My home city was already economically depressed before COVID. Now, there are almost no full-time entry-level jobs in my field in my city. 

The way I see it, I have 3 options. I'd like to chose the option that would maximize my changes of building my career over the long-term.

***Option 1: Move to the closest big city and sublet a place while looking for work:***

Pros:

* Much more job opportunities
* Having a local address will make me more attractive to employers. (I've been applying for postings across the country, but I feel that not being local is hurting my chances.)
* More opportunities to network and expand my long-term career prospects
* It's close enough that I could still apply to jobs in my home city simultaneously and travel back (about 4 hours) for interviews.

Cons:

* It will be hard to find an entry-level position that pays enough to cover the cost of living (one of the most expensive cities in North America).
* The only professional connections I have in the city are people I haven't spoken to in years.
* If I'm not successful in finding a position, I will have wasted a lot of time and money.

***Option 2: Take a customer service or part-time admin job in my home city***

Pros:

* These are the only positions somewhat related to my major that seem to be hiring right now and would provide me with some flexibility to wait for better opportunities.
* I could save money by staying with my parents.

Cons:

* Remaining underemployed, staking a step-down in my career, and potentially not looking as competitive to employers down the road
* I miss the big city lifestyle I had overseas and would eventually want to move.
* My field-related university internships are already starting to look outdated on my resume. Not finding field-related experience will only make the problem worse.

***Option 3: Take another teaching position overseas (and potentially transition into a teaching career)***

Pros:

* I already know that I enjoy teaching, opportunities are plentiful, and I would be a competitive applicant with two years of experience.
* It would allow me to save money as I decide what to do with my future.

Cons:

* It would pretty much kill any chances of using my business degree.
* While I do like teaching, I don't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. (Although I would be open to using it as a stepping stone to advance into educational administration or curriculum development.)
* If I were to transition into teaching, I'd almost certainly have to remain overseas or move to another part of the country. Teaching jobs in my home province are extremely hard to come by.

***Tl;DR:***

I graduated in 2017 with a business degree, taught overseas for two years, and moved back to my small home city which has very limited job opportunities. I see 3 options for myself:

1. Move to a bigger city and hope I find a better job that will cover the cost of living
2. Continue looking for jobs in my current city that would be a step down for me
3. Teach overseas again while saving to pursue a career change in the future

I'd like to choose the option that would minimize risk while allowing me the best chance to build my career over the long term.

Thanks in advance for your input."

hltcld,78,2020-07-05,In Response to that Caltech Quora Guy,trayahow,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hltcld/in_response_to_that_caltech_quora_guy/,"Seriously? How much time do you have?

Because there is no one at Caltech who thinks as highly of that school as this dude*.* And don’t stop reading till you get to the end of this one, I sincerely mean it for once. (jk skip to the tl;dr if you want idc)

Enough with copying his formatting. While this guy is WAY too obsessed with the school, and I'm about to point out what he's missing, I am still very glad to be a part of the Caltech community. No school is perfect, and these first few paragraphs are rather negative, but I wouldn't trade the Caltech experience for anything. I do not represent the Caltech community as a whole, but after reading some of the comments on [that post](https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hkvjvi/found_this_gem_of_a_post_on_quora/), I decided to write this. If you're from Caltech and want to tear me apart in the comments, go right ahead (within rotation rules ofc).

The only point our Quora Friend really missed is donating money. Caltech does not need your money. Small donations to the school just kinda go into the 3 Billion Dollar endowment, and large donations build buildings that we don't need. Beyond that, this endowment is hardly ever spent on undergrads  (Although they spent $100,000 repainting a building because it was apparently too reflective and a prof didn't want to close his blinds in the morning). As is true at most schools, there has been constant anger and mistrust between the student body and administration. A proposal to use the new Bechtel Residence as all-freshmen housing, ending rotation, was reversed after massive protests. On top of this, the school alcohol policy is encourages unhealthy and dangerous drinking habits. (The policy essentially is you can only drink behind a closed/lockable door). 

Even though he may have missed the everyday frustrations of undergrads at Tech, our friend over on Quora has some good points. As I read, I generally felt like we were finally getting the recognition we deserve. Due to the lack of affirmative action, not a single student is (academically) dumb. Obviously impostor syndrome exists everywhere, but nearly everyone at Caltech feels it. That's where the community comes in. Because everyone belongs, everyone suffers, and everyone has to work together. You cannot survive without working 50+ hours some weeks, spending over 10 hours on some problem sets, and asking anyone and everyone for help, constantly. 

Additionally, due to the lack of affirmative action, we don't have to deal with comments like ""you're only here because you're \_race\_"". Obviously, there will always be racist members of a community, but the fact that Every Single Person Was Admitted For Their Academic Qualifications gets rid of any affirmative action based racism. HOWEVER, there is one negative side to this, missed by our Quora friend. The campus is politically dead. Being in Pasadena, many students don't vote because they don't feel their vote matters. Many students are just too busy to care about movements like BLM, as it doesn't directly effect them. There are absolutely exceptions, as graduate students are currently raising awareness regarding Robert Millikan's involvement in eugenics (See Ollie Stephenson's twitter), and Dabney Hovse was disowned circa 1970 by the Dabney family for protesting Richard Nixon. 

Another admissions-related point worth mentioning is the gender ratio. Many top engineering schools either have an extremely skewed gender ratio (74/26 in the UCB College of Engineering), while others have massive gaps in admissions ratio (Harvey Mudd admits 23% of women and 10% of men). Caltech has neither. Although admissions is **not** gender-blind (we actively admit a 50/50 class), the admissions rate is about 5% of men and 6% for women, negligible especially after you take self-selection into account. 

Why do most undergrads still love Caltech so much? First and foremost, it's the community. Caltech's housing system is unique in that every hallway (""alley"") of every hovse (printing presses can't print u's, and we don't call them dorms) is coed and has members from every class. If you're stuck on a math or physics problem, there is a math or physics major next door who will happily sit down and explain the concept to you for a half hour. The hovses have family-style dinners every night, which range from calm, ""normal"" dinners, to sending dinner messages (like a banana, scooped out and filled with milk) to a random person across the dining hall, bread fights, rant nights, and pretty much everything else you can imagine. Another great part of the community is the professor-student relations. Professors often take students out to lunch at the Athenaeum, a Caltech-owned country club with *really* good food. Kip Thorne hosted a viewing of interstellar, where he took questions before and after, Katie Bouman teaches CS classes, Mike Brown leaves his office door open and is always happy to rant about Pluto, etc. Even when Caltech gets hard, the other ""Pure and simple *intellectual chops*"" are there for you, either to help you with your sets, cuddle in a massive pile of blankets in the lounge, or set of sparklers in the courtyard. 

Finally, here's my answer to the original Quora question. ""Does Caltech hold the same respect as an Ivy League College?"" 

To the general public, even in Pasadena, absolutely not. Within the academic community, our friend on Quora is probably right that it's respected more than some Ivys. I know of countless undergrads who were told ""You did *this* at Caltech, you must have insane time management, you're hired"". Every year, MULTIPLE meche's intern at SpaceX, dozens of frosh do research at JPL, and many seniors are admitted to nearly every grad school (Stanford, UCLA, MIT) they apply to. The average starting salary after Caltech is over $100,000, and some CS majors have starting salaries exceeding $400k. As Quora Guy points out, those who know Caltech *know Caltech*. 

If you're one of the commenters on that previous post who turned down Caltech for an Ivy, you didn't make the wrong choice. Caltech, Penn, Harvard, Yale, etc. are all amazing schools. There's a reason Caltech's yield is only about 50%, a community so academically driven and intensely collaborative isn't for everyone. That being said, if you're a high school senior passionate about STEM, willing to put 12+ hours into your supplemental essays, who wants to collaborate for the next 4 years, definitely apply to Caltech. You'll fit right in.

tl;dr Caltech is a great school, but (like any school) it has flaws that an outsider on Quora might be missing. As you look at schools next spring, make sure you talk to students and decide where to go based on how well you fit in."

hlvbcb,2,2020-07-05,Part-time sysadmin work?,SgtLionHeart,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hlvbcb/parttime_sysadmin_work/,"Shortly before the pandemic hit hard, I had resolved to quit my desktop support job and go back to school to finish my Bachelor's. I had some savings, and I still live at home, so my expenses aren't very high. Still, it would be nice to generate some income and work 10-20 hours a week while I'm in school. 

Another reason I want to work is that my coursework is largely theory-based, with almost no hands-on training. I've only ever worked desktop support, and don't want to return to that after I graduate. I feel that I need some experience with Windows Server, Linux, monitoring tools, and networking. So a stipulation for any position I look at is that I can get exposure to these technologies and consistently be expanding my expertise. 

Do employers have any interest in having a position like that? Now that I've written out what I'm looking for, it sounds like a paid internship. I assume most interns are younger folks with little to no experience, who would be happy to be on helpdesk, and that's very much not what I'm looking for. I did 5 years of desktop support, and hated most of it. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what kind of company might want a position like this, or where I might begin looking? I feel like my best bet is writing some sort of proposition letter and distributing it to companies I'm interested in working for."

I’m in the process of looking into internships for the coming summer (Dec - Feb). I had an internship for a smaller company last summer and since then I have been working for them remotely while studying.

2 weeks prior to starting this internship, which was iOS development, the iOS developer for this company had left, leaving a lot of extra work for me to try take on. I learned a lot super quickly and started working on a new app for a new product of this company. Fast forward to now about 8 months since I started my internship and about 80% of the app has been developed by me and the rest by the replacement for the full time developer.

This has provided me with a lot of good experience and knowledge and I have felt super lucky with how things turned out. I am now wondering if I should do a second internship with this same company over next summer - which would look like me continuing the work I’m already doing now remotely. 

The alternative view I had from a friend who is also looking for an internship is that I should try to make it into one of the big tech companies and extend my network and connections. I do see some validity in this argument however I’m not 100% convinced that this is the only way to go about it - not to mention that now with coronavirus, most stuff overseas is probably out of the immediate picture which for me includes the US.

The scheduled release date for this new product that I have been making the app for would be part way into the next internship if I were to take it. The way I see this working out for me is that I would then have an app on the App Store made for a real business with real users that was started and majority developed by me. Not only that but after release would come further maintenance and new features. I believe all of this would give me a huge advantage in the more distant future when looking around for other jobs.

So now I am tossing up what route I should take:
- Stay with a smaller company for a second internship. Release the app I’ve been working on for so long to the market. Have experience with the full product lifecycle alongside a real business’s app to put on my CV
- Move to a larger company. Probably more competitive which speaks for itself. Perks of extending my network and connections. I would also experience different methods of development at a different company in order to widen my abilities.

I would greatly appreciate any advice!

Thanks so much"

I am hoping to get some advice pertaining to typical first year consulting recruiting. I am aware that consulting recruiting begins very early, and I’m hoping to hit the ground running and ready to go. I am planning on attending a hybrid in-person fall, but all OCR will be fully virtual.

Do you have any advice on things to do or resources to review to become more informed and prepared for a possible at-home-recruiting season?

I am admittedly not the most knowledgeable as to the specifics and intricacies of the consulting recruiting process, and had been assuming I’d have ample opportunity to “ask the stupid questions” and learn the ins and outs once I’m on campus in the fall and surrounded by peers in the same boat.

Now that the fall seems to be anything but ordinary, and there is still a possibility of being 100% virtual, I’m looking to proactively become more informed to the process so that I have a better shot at securing an internship, even if I am at home for my full first semester.

Any direction would be appreciated.

I am a recent college graduate, and took an internship back in January at a very large corporation. I would say I have picked up on our technology stack very fast compared to others. Our team is growing fast and skills are getting pretty diversified.

With that said as the intern that recently converted over to a full time position I’m actively learning on the side have side projects, working on certifications and what not, always trying to actively learn.

I have found my team leads are pretty stuck in there ways of x and x is not possible or this and this is better even tho it has been proven the other way is better or there is other teams doing what “is not possible”.

I understand the importance of being able to bring ideas forward in difficult situations and convince others but I feel you can only bring it up so many times before it comes annoying to an extend.

I hate to say I have grown my skills out of the team as just a level 1 engineer but I certainly feel that way. I can keep side projects going but like to actively pursue similar things in a work place since I enjoy the challenge personally.

Do I just keep trying to convince my leads to research or try this and bug them about it, just deal with it, switch teams (going to guess similar problem since technology like AWS is so new to them), change company’s, or any advice is appreciated!

But I’m general I feel stating and dealing with it is holding me back from further developing my skills as a developer.

However I was somewhat curious about whether or not it could be a different culture thing where the “signs” are different, specially because I know in general germans tend to be more direct. 

The “good” signs I saw were basically that:
1. I replied well to the technical questions and they seemed happy with that. 
2. They showed me some of the stuff i’d be doing in pretty good detail and we discussed the overall project a bit.
3. They brought up the salary and they other more specific things about the job
4. They asked me the dates in which I would be available to start and for how long I could do the Internship.

It was my first ever job interview so i don’t really know a lot in general, so all of this could very well be perfectly normal or simply a cultural difference. Thanks in advance"

hm79hf,16,2020-07-06,Need some advice,buttking,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hm79hf/need_some_advice/,"So, I was hired by an MSP as an IT Intern in January of 2019. Everyone liked me, and I was apparently capable of handling things most interns for some reason were too incompetent to handle, so when my internship was up they offered me a part-time help desk job with the only stipulation being that I couldn't work more than 32 hours a week, so they didn't have to give me those pesky benefits. I more or less finished school this year(still have a final to take.) So the MSP offered me full-time, $34,000/year, benefits, all that good stuff.

Well, while all this has been happening, MSP was purchased by Bigger MSP. Now the thing is becoming final and MSP is essentially rebranding as Bigger MSP. Well, When Bigger MSP took over payroll, I was informed that they don't do full-time for my position. So I'm being forced back to hourly. I was assured that I would make the same money. I doubt that's the case. There are two reasons to make someone hourly in my mind: Cut their hours, and after you do that, deny them any kind of benefits.

I'm pretty pissed. For the first time in my adult life I felt like I had some financial stability, and appreciated that MSP was treating me like a real-life gosh darn human. Now I feel like I've been kicked in the gut and I want to walk away from it all.

I have a bunch of MS vouchers from school, and honestly at this point I feel like if I quit now, start busting my ass and get my MCSE, I'll be in a much better position than I am now. As it is, I find it hard to study working 40 hours a week. I don't feel like I can study much during work because I can't focus knowing I can get a call at any minute and can't just ignore it. When I'm done with work I have stuff around the house to do, and need to sleep.

Should I quit? Wait until I have my MCSE and another job offer? Something else?

Thanks"

Little about me: I graduated in May 2020 and have a Bachelor's in Software Engineering. I have been emailing and messaging recruiters on Linkedin while also applying if I see any job posting. But mainly I am emailing or messaging recruiters on Linkedin cuz there aren't many job posting available right now. I am mainly interested in getting into FAANG.

This is what I have been writing in my emails when I email recruiters, please advise me if I need to add or remove anything from my email. Please note, English is not my first language and I suck at writing.

    Hey RECRUITERS NAME, I hope you are doing well and safe and sound.
    
    I recently graduated (May 2020) from XXXXX University with Bachelors's in Software Engineering. The reason why I am reaching out to you is that I am currently looking for New Graduate Software Engineering positions and require your assistance. If you can please look at my resume and offer me a chance for an interview with COMPANY NAME, it would help me a lot.
    
    In terms of my background, I have done two internships over my academic career, one at COMPANY NAME for 4 months as a Developer and one at COMPANY NAME for 12 months as a DevOps/Software Engineer. I have also done various side projects and I am currently working on developing a Machine Learning Model that detects Caries in X-Rays as a side project while learning everything by myself with the help of online resources.
    
    I have attached my resume where you can find more detailed information regarding my background. Hoping to hear from you soon. 
    
    Sincerely,
MY NAME   

If anyone here can refer me or advise me in terms of what else I should do to land a job before September. I will really appreciate it. Thank you!!"

Should I continue with tech degree or go to beauty/hair school?,soured_peach,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hm8pq4/ontario_should_i_continue_with_tech_degree_or_go/,"I'm just feeling really confused and frustrated. If I go into tech, it will be college offering a degree for 4 years. There's a lot of mandatory internships throughout and I live in a very tech booming city in demand for programmers. I will also have to grind without break to finish in about 2.5 years taking summer school as well as internships while in class. I'm rushing to finish because I don't want to wait that long to graduate and restart my career again. I just don't know if or why I'm going into this other than money, being introverted and working with a small team or by myself, and building things. 

If I go into beauty school, I can run a salon in my home. I have a separate area that can be replaced and work at home, my own schedule but I probably will have unstable income and deal with having no clients at first. 

What do you think? I would really like some insight on what others think. I just want to live a simple life to be honest."
hm8x2y,5,2020-07-06,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (7/6/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/hm8x2y/weekly_job_qa_thread_762020/,"Hi all,

Here is the nineteenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer? That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

This week is week 4 but I found a full-time job offer that I've accepted. The full-time job starts as soon as my internship ends. I want to quit my internship to have that free time to myself.

I graduated from college recently and started the internship as soon as I graduated. It would be nice to have a small break before jumping to the full-time job scene. Would you guys advise I stay at my internship or quit and spend time on my hobbies instead

&amp;#x200B;

As for my internship, I honestly haven't done any coding at all for the past 3 weeks due to codebase issues on my pc. I'm worried having employment that only lasted 3 weeks will affect my employment history as well and I won't be able to explain any impact I've made.

What would you guys do? Any advice on how I would approach quitting an internship?"

Problem: Our employee software outputs data for employees in Administrative cost centers incorrectly in column P. Accounting/HR/Management Cost Centers that start with 926, 927, or 928 are considered Administrative. The current formula I have in Column P fixes the output for the Administrative Cost Centers. Anything that the current formula does will need to be kept, like changing Interns to SG&amp;A Non-Employee - Temp/Intern and contingent workers to Contingent Worker in column P.


The full set of data includes employees that aren't in an Administrative Cost Center, though, and the output for them in Column P without the formula is already correct.


I essentially need to make a formula that changes Administrative Cost Center worker output to be correct (like it does now) but can be applied to the entire column so that it leaves non-Administrative Cost Center worker output alone.



Any ideas on how I could re-create this formula to do this? Maybe move the formula over into Column Q?



I am willing to Venmo you for a quick answer on this. I am very new to excel and have a lot of deadlines that I'm trying to juggle.


Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I'll venmo/zelle $15 to the person who can help me out with this and I can post proof as well (let me know if this is against rules and I will edit this part out --if someone wants to work something out DM me)"

hmbex4,0,2020-07-06,Can I become a Software Engineer in 2 years?,gerkiiier,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hmbex4/can_i_become_a_software_engineer_in_2_years/,"Hello all as the title says is it possible? Most likely yes but let me give you some background for my situation.

Currently laid off from work (thanks corona) with a decent severance package. I studied mechanical engineering in college but my job didn't really apply to my major....like at all. Everything I knew to do my job was learned at work. Losing my job though has opened my eyes that I didn't really enjoy my work, I was using Revit, something I learned on the job, and had to deal with clients and meetings. 

I've always been iffy on pursuing a CS degree and a CS career but I've always been fascinated by what you can do with code and the benefits of working at a FAANG company are a compelling motivator. I started watching CS50 on youtube and the first episode hooked me. The summer class is currently going and I'm going to try and follow along with their problem sets. This way I can truly see if this is for me or not.

Now here are a few of my options.

1. Eventually, spring 2021 most likely, go back to my alma mater and pursue a BS in CS which would take me probably 2 years. Being a student again I feel would be beneficial to pursuing internships and having a better support system with faculty/clubs/peers etc. But still, that's 2 years of non-work and school again, being older I feel like my focus would be 120% on school and finding a job.
2. Find a CS Bootcamp that is right for me. I've read and watched a lot of videos on boot camps and I'm not sure I'm 100% sold on them yet. IF I did go with one what would be the optimal time? 12 weeks? 6 months? 9  months? Are they even worth such a high cost? I've seen some say they will defer payments until you find a job but reading the fine print the min salary requirements are only $40k, where I live that's poverty levels.
3. Finish the CS50 course and try to do self-teaching (the HARDEST route) or find out that coding really isn't for me.

I'm going through something I never saw coming, thankfully I have been frugal enough to have money saved up and not have any more debt so my life currently feels like I'm on a fork in the road with hundreds of different paths to take. I'm wondering if CS is the right path, I've always envisioned myself working at a FAANG company, specifically google. So ya, thanks for reading and I hope you can help me out with my situation, thank you!"

The problem is I absolutely despise what I'm doing. It's pure web dev and release management and the team I work on seems like they all hate what they do and are just lifeless. I would love to be doing embedded work because that is what I have expertise and interest in due to my academia. 

I have my eyes set on taking the offer and just reneging if I get a better offer, but I'm seriously considering outright declining the offer. I've spoken to a few of my peers about this and they have all said that I'm insane to just give up an opportunity/safety net like that but my reasoning is that I don't want to get complacent. 

Last year when I got this internship offer I knew it wasn't the best I could do but I just got lazy and complacent with the job search and now I'm doing bullshit IT support instead of real engineering.

Just looking for some school recommendations based on my profile as I am applying to a Ph.D. in CS. Let me know what schools I should apply to based on my profile and which schools are safe and reach etc.

My main research interests are NLP, Computer Vision, and Databases, in that order.

I go to a top 40 CS school and I will be graduating Honors in CS with a GPA of 3.7 and a Senior Honors Research Project. I have conducted research in NLP and Computer Vision for about 3 semesters with three different professors at the school and I am currently working as a Computer Vision Research Intern in a research lab. I also took two graduate courses in CS, one in Scientific Programming and the other in Parallel Computing.

Other than my classwork and research experience, I have worked for a year as a CS+Math Tutor and I was a TA for 3 semesters for 300-level CS courses at my school. I love teaching so I started a small mentorship program for the local high school as well. I was also involved in many mentorship programs throughout college as well. 

With this profile, which schools should I apply to so I can maximize my chances to go study for a Ph.D. .in CS? The school really does not matter to me, I just want to be able to pursue research, so going into any school would be wonderful."

Warning: Incoming wall of text!

I just need to get this out of my system. I thought it would be better for me to write down my story and feelings as I've been down for the past couple of days. This topic might seem as a confusing read as it's been written while a lot of emotions are running through my system. 

If you're reading this, I want to thank you for your time. 
--------//-------//--------//-------//

Today I'm quite saddened. Saddened, disappointed and frustrated that my 6 month internship at ""Company X"" is nearly over. It has been 6 frustrating months with ups and downs and with long intervals between experience of success. 

I'm an automation engineer student graduating in September 2020 and Company X was my dream company and first priority when hunting for an internship. It's a renowned international company and a market leader in their field and the competition to get a spot was quite fierce. Dozens of my fellow classmates from our university alone had applied and they had only room for two interns. After a pleasant interview I got one of the spots and was told that I was their first pick. The thing is, once you're ""in"" in Company X, you're most likely secured a job if you do well. Statistically, 7 out of 10 interns gets a full time position after their internship.

So you can imagine how happy I was! I was almost in tears of joy. :-D

Fast forward to today and I'm feeling like crap. Not only didn't I get a position after my newly job interview at Company X but the internship was nothing like I had imagined. Nowhere near it.

I would like to state that we landed amidst a big reorganization as a handful of key individuals had left the company. I would also like to state that it is my impression that Company X wanted the best for us. They had an overseas trip to a site and different quality courses planned for us but then Covid-19 hit. But even prior to Covid-19 we felt that the management in our specific department was severely lacking. I got the impression that this wasn't the case in the company's other branches (they also had interns).

A long story short: At first, we were given two assignments:

Project A): An in-house project. We had to build a machine almost from scratch. It was a leftover project that was stranded on a desk (ours) as the guy in charge of the project had left the company two weeks prior to our first day at the office. None of us interns had any knowledge about mechanical engineering but there was an engineer assigned as our project leader. However, it quickly turned out that he didn't have the time or ressources to help us out - and he wasn't a mechanical engineer either. We were alone and this assignment quickly got shelved/put on hold by the manager. We ""wasted 4 weeks"". Alright, moving on to the next plan.

Project B): This was also an in-house project with a higher priority but with no strict deadline. Now, this assignment was very exciting but also highly complex as we had to dig deep into a system that has taken 3 years and hundreds of man hours to develop. A mentor was assigned to us, the system architect, highly knowledgeable person with years of experience and very likeable - however he was very busy and was only available sporadically. He also left the company midway. Again, we were stranded with no mentor and no real plan. Halfway through my internship my companion also decided to leave as he assessed that he wouldn't gain anything valuable from it any longer. He terminated his contract and decided to do his own project. 

I went to HR to tell them the situation. Before all of this, me and my companion had meetings with our (former) manager and told him that we needed weekly meetings and 1-on-1 once per week or every other week. Nothing really happened. My former manager is a very likable individual but he is a little too loose and distractedly. 

So, I went to HR with a written report that stated what we have experienced as interns, what we liked and what we've missed. HR took it very well and were actually pretty surprised how lacking our division has been in taking care of us. So, I got another manager, he's cool, we got 1-on-1 meetings every two weeks and a stand-up meeting every week. But he doesn't know much about my assignment, no one really does, as I'm still trying to decipher lines and lines of code that was written within a ""black box solution"". 

So, why am I still there? Well, I wanted more experience so I stayed and even prolonged the period by a month. HR and my manager welcomed it and I also hoped that it would give me better chances to land a job at Company X. Weeks went by and suddenly there was an open position.

So, I applied for an open position in my division. However, due to Covid-19 crisis they had to put that open position on hold. My application was still in the pool and two weeks later I'm called in for an interview as there was an open position in another division. 

Even though I was an intern in the company and most of them already knew me, I still had to undergo personality and logical tests along with a case. I felt the interview went fine. Actually, very fine. My only fear was that I didn't really click with the manager from the other division - even prior to the interview. We are very different - he's very outgoing, some would even say loud and I'm the opposite. I'm very social but I'm also low key, if that makes sense?

Well, a week ago I was told that I wasn't fit for the position. He (the manager) liked my profile, I didn't say anything wrong but I didn't have the experience required and they didn't have the time to get me aligned with the rest of the team. I nodded, said I'm sorry for their decision but thanked them for the opportunity. 

I was devastated. I've never been late, no sick days, been proactive and kept my spirit high at all times. Coming in early and one of the last ones to leave. I gave it my all 

To be honest, I thought it was BS. They've screened my CV. They knew how experienced I was. Also, my perspective is that they were the ones who should have given me the necessary experience. 
My guess is that the manager just didn't see me fitting in. The funny thing is that I have very good chemistry with the rest of the team. They were surprised I didn't get the position. 
To make matters worse, I recently learned that a classmate of mine has been called in for an interview. For the exact same position. He is, in my humble opinion, in no way more experienced than me or as qualified. I wish him the best but I just don't buy their reason for the rejection.

I asked HR for feedback on my interview immediately after I was rejected. What I could have done differently. If I said anything wrong or didn't sell myself well enough.
HR said my application, CV and interview was flawless. I did nothing wrong. I'm very transparent, open and likeable. I said to myself, ""then wtf didn't get the job?!""...

I'm confused. Confused, sad, disappointed, frustrated and mad. Not at anyone particular - just the situation. 

This was my chance to get my foot inside the circle. Now, I'm just a soon to be graduate with not enough experience in the bag.

So I just recently joined this sub-reddit and was going through a lot of posts to see what the feel is like in the community, seems pretty intense but worthwhile when you put in the work! As previously stated, I'm going to begin college this fall and I'm just trying to do anything I can to gain experience and get ahead of the curb now rather than later. 

In reference to my experience, I'm more so able to BUILD things rather than code, mostly around the topic of Arduino. I've made basic things like automatic watering systems for gardens up to basically making a drone from scratch. My actual building knowledge I think is adequate considering where I'm at education wise, but my coding feels **super** lack-luster.

I'm going through a series of online courses to familiarize myself with computer science more and coding as well, (online free lectures by duke, mit, hardvard, etc).

My question is just what I should be wary of going into comp sci as a major, internships, expectations, etc. I seriously want to try to do the best I can EARLY on so that my life isn't a living hell down the line. If there's any websites like leetcode I should go to to work on my coding, I'd appreciate that immensely as well. Any advice is appreciated!!!

Thank you so much for reading this needlessly long ask for help."

I was struggling with PTSD, other mental health issues, substance abuse and was suicidal. All of which was unaddressed up until then. I Had to take 2 years off to seek treatment. I’m much better now and wondering what my options are for continuing my degree in INFO. I have about 2.5 years left because of Running Start in High School.

Like the title reads I was given direct admission into INFO in 2018. But up until this point I had been dealing with some heavy mental health issues stemming from my previously diagnosed PTSD from when I was violently robbed and car-jacked at gun-point when I was 16 years old. This led to substance abuse/self-medication and led me to become suicidal. I was in no way shape or form in the right mind frame to function not only in school but as a normal human being.

I barely completed my first quarter (Fall 2019) and failed one class, other than that I passed but was holding on by a thread because of my mental health. Not to mention I spent parts of the summer before fall quarter in psych wards and rehabs that didn’t work out. In the first week of Winter quarter I was in a very dark place after a bad breakup which put me in an even worse place. With me becoming more suicidal I began to realize this was a life or death situation. With  the help of family I decided that it was vital that I seek treatment and get the professional help that I desperately needed. I no choice but to prioritize my well-being or else things could have gone way worse..

Long story short I entered a 12 month recovery program on Jan 29th 2019 in a treatment facility in Portland. I ended up flunking out Winter quarter since I was in treatment and unable to attend school. I had my counselor help me apply for a hardship withdrawal. I’ve since completed this program (In Feb 2020) and was offered a paid 12 month internship opportunity to stick around and also volunteer within the organization, room and board free of charge. I’m working in the IT department in the regional office of our organization and volunteering within the organization 7 days a week.

I determined that committing to another 12 months within this organization where I can continue to strengthen my recovery/sobriety and help others who come into our program broken and without hope will put me in the best possible place moving forward. My mental health has never been better and I’ve been stone cold sober for about 18 months now (longest time I’ve ever been sober for a long time). 

I’ve been at this internship for about 4 months now and complete in March of 2021. I would love to finish what I started at UW and complete my degree in INFO but don’t know what that would look like now given I’ve been MIA for 2 years despite me applying for a hardship withdrawal right after I left..

The main reason I came to this sub is because I’m curious, what are my options in regards to continuing to seek my education and finish my degree in INFO given the fact that I was given direct admission when I first entered UW?  Will I have to re-apply to INFO? Will I have to transfer from a CC? Is there a way I can explain my situation and be let back into INFO? If it makes a different I did Running Start in High School and would have a little over 2 years left for my Bachelors in Informatics.

This has been something I’ve struggled with for a LONG time and is a big deal to me. For anyone who took the time to read this all, thank you it means a lot. And for those of you who struggle with mental health, or substance abuse or know anyone who does just know that there IS hope. 2 years ago I no longer wanted to live and had already tried to take my own life. Now, I’m in a place where I’m tired of allowing my fear of failure to control my destiny and I want to strive to become the best version of myself. (Feel free to PM me if you just need someone to chat with if you’re struggling yourself or know someone personally who needs help)

Any guidance, advice, or support would be greatly appreciated!"

My dad didn’t start teaching me driving until I was 18. I didn’t get my license until I was 20. I’m 22 now, and I haven’t driven alone since I’ve gotten my license because my parents never trusted me and they didn’t trust me to practice on my own. I can’t even properly drive now since I don’t know how to drive on highways and I can’t hire a driving school because of my parents COVID fears. To them, “getting into Good school and getting good job” was way more important than learning how to properly drive on highways, which is essential where I live. They really restricted my freedom. And it’s even worse with this COVID pandemic. They don’t allow me to go anywhere at all, and I can’t move out yet because of the pandemic because my parents are concerned about safety and the state I live in (Texas) is a major hotspot. 

By contrast, all my white friends got their license as soon as they turned 16. They all had their own cars in high school. They could go wherever they wanted to after 16 with no questions asked. Even now during COVID I know a bunch of teens are getting their licenses so they can drive uninhibited. I never ever even received a car from my parents because they still don’t trust me as a grown ass adult. They also took all my internship  income away for “safekeeping”, for all those wondering why I just don’t buy a car. 

It’s so fucking frustrating how asian parents treat us like pets in a cage and never allow us to grow up. I hate how this pandemic exacerbated that. I literally have not left my house in months, ever since fucking March because of COVID.  I find myself extremely jealous of people with white parents all the time and I have so much resentment toward my parents."

What were your insights? How did it go? I’ve talked to a couple of CSE (CoE) takers but none from CSC (CLAS). A lot of them say it’s similar but not entirely sure because they don’t know much about those taking CSC (CLAS).

I’m fine with either one because I don’t mind the foreign language requirement. I plan to take the beginning Japanese classes and heard how great the program was so I look forward to it! But at the same time, if I took CSE I could focus more on engineering technical courses and learn the language on my own time as a hobby instead of an academic class. In CSC however, I have a more flexible schedule allowing me to choose fewer technical electives which are also similar to those from CSE and at the same time give me more time to focus on internship programs and stuff.

Also, is it true that people look down on CSC graduates because they ‘avoid the hard classes’? 

I also heard how ENC 3246 and IDS 1161 sucks and are ‘deal with it’ type of classes, which can be avoided in CLAS replacing ENC 3246 with ENC 2210 and hopefully another class for IDS 1161 (yes the good life class).

Open to any suggestions, tips, ideas, whatever you can think of. I am in need of help to decide which one.

Thank you."

I don’t know how to proceed.",thrownaway_confusion,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hmm4xv/my_f19_coworkercrush_m21_basically_told_me_that/,"Some context first: We work in a restaurant - I am an intern of a few months, him a part time worker of 2 years. We only met about 3-4 weeks ago though because the restaurant got rid of part time workers for a while due to the pandemic.

We hit it off almost immediately after being put in the same team twice. We started being a lot closer within the next two weeks despite not directly working together again - always talking during work whenever we see each other. I felt like we started being really flirty and eventually things escalated to playful physical contact. And its obvious he’s being extra nice and caring about me and vice versa. I feel like its quite obvious that I have a crush on him and him on me, though no one is outright admitting anything.

So our friendship progresses, until yesterday. I felt like he seemed off the entire day so I asked him about it and he kept hesitating and being like “this is so hard to get out” and all that and I started being really worried as I didn’t know what it was about. He said he’ll tell me after work but it’s something really bad and he thinks its going to change how I view him.

After work, he told me that he just got together with a girl the night before. I manage to get out: “Isn’t that a good thing?” And he said that it was not because he feels like he likes two people at once. From my understanding, it seems that he was close/flirty with the other girl for a while as well (and they’ve known each other slightly longer than I know him) and so she asked him where they stood in terms of relationships. The feeling was mutual so they decided to date, but I’m not sure how official they are. He did refer to her as his gf though. He said he was conflicted because he feels like his personality matches more with his not-gf crush but not in terms of background/lifestyle (parents are super strict about hanging out with people, etc. Like I sort of have a curfew and that sort of stuff).

I kind of tried to give some generic advice about how he should really reflect on what both people mean to him and all that. But the thing is he basically somehow confessed to me without saying it - it was obvious the other person was me due to his descriptions. He also kept staring at me and into my eyes during this conversation and was being kind of quiet. Also he was like I think you know who the girl is but in the end I decided to pretend I didn’t know as I thought saying it would make things awkward and more complicated. I tried to ask him who but he wouldn’t tell me (obviously) so yeah.

So… I don’t know how to proceed. I felt like I was put in the a difficult position because I didn’t want to give bad advice for my own personal gain. I ended up telling my best friend and mom about this (separately) and they both said that what he did was really shitty because he put me in an unfair position and because he’s like trying to play us both or something. But the thing is neither of them have met him and I genuinely think he’s just really at loss of what to do and because I care a lot about him and was pushing him to tell me what was wrong, he told me. Like maybe it wasn’t the greatest idea but I feel like he wasn’t trying to manipulate me or anything.

But yeah, I want to emphasise that from what I’ve seen during work and how he interacts with people, as well as what people say about him, he really is a nice person. But I can’t tell if I’m blinded because I have feelings for him. Like is he actually a bad person (was the conversation somehow borderline emotional cheating or something)? We haven’t had work since the conversation so I don’t know if he will continue to be flirty but that day I felt like he was a little bit. Though he definitely felt different/off than normal. At the end (of the conversation) he did say that he feels like he should work on his new relationship and forget about the other girl, but today when texting me he still seemed very unsure of his decision, despite claiming that he understands what he wants better. He also repeated that he thinks I know who the not-gf girl is but I kinda dodged it again, though I did say I sort of have a guess.

I’ve been extremely flirty with him before this and I feel like now that I know he’s dating someone I should back off as it feels wrong to try and sway him or something, but I also don’t want him to notice the behavioural change because… well I lied about not knowing who it was so if I change my behavior its obvious I knew/lied and also probably obvious that I actually do like him - I don’t think he necessarily knows this for sure right now, even if I think its obvious. I think it is obvious I know who he’s talking about and is just lying though, not sure how much he believes me there.

So what should I do? How should I act around him now? I was thinking to maybe hint/state that I do like him too, is that a terrible idea? Should I just continue to act like I don’t know who we’re talking about if it comes up again? (as friends, its not that weird to talk about life stuff and give advice, so it might come up again especially if we are both acting like I don’t know who it is)

If he decides that things don’t work out with his new gf (he said he wanted to try and make it work but he didn’t know her super well as they’ve only met for a month as well), how long should I wait before trying anything?

**TLDR: coworker/crush likes me and another girl at the same time. He got together with the other girl recently but seems unsure and unhappy of his decision. He didn’t tell me the not-gf girl was me but it was as obvious as could be. I don’t know how to act around him now.**"

I’ve figured out one issue with my resume I never put on there my associates degree, so I’m applying for associate degree jobs with my resume and there’s no associate degree on my resume! I had just my occupational skills awards leading up to the Associates but not the associates. That is changed now. 

Recent grad with associates degree. Plenty of job postings in a 75mile radius of my house looking for associates degrees in IT related field. 

I have no internship. Just wasn’t possible. Couldn’t afford any certs, I went to school thru a non profit so no financial aid, but after I graduate they’d pay for A+ and Network+. I want to skip A+. I’m focusing on Net+ as I want to work with networks. 

I’ve applied to way too many jobs to still not have one. Will gaining net+ help me get past the no experience? I’ve taken the equivalent to CCENT/CCNA classes again no money to cert myself. Has been a few semesters and haven’t kept up with it so I’ve forgotten some. But I have CCNA books and will begin studying CCNA as soon as I get done with Net+. I’d stick with CCNA but I can’t afford the cert and the non profit won’t foot the bill. But they will Net+ so...

I just bought the CompTIA approved hardback book and the simulations thru Pearson that goes with the book. I just got it yesterday working midway they ch2 tonight. Hoping to test in August. But that’s of course if the non profit can get this wfh going and their new systems so it’s kind of confusing for them right now. Idk that’s what I was told. And to contact again mid July see how it’s going. 

How much will this add to my resume?"
hmm8wt,1,2020-07-06,I started a job and hate it. I have no idea what to do.,No_Consideration3910,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hmm8wt/i_started_a_job_and_hate_it_i_have_no_idea_what/,"I'm using a throwaway so my friends and family don't see this. I apologize in advance for the length.

So anyways, I am a senior in college graduating in December. Because of the pandemic going on, the job hunt has been bad. It also doesn't help that I am an average student. My grades aren't horrible or anything, but they are nothing to write home about. I have had a hard time finding an internship because of this. 

One of my relative's friends runs an accounting firm in my hometown and they offered me a full time job for the rest of the summer. They hired me with the intention of me going part time during the semester, and then going back to full time right after graduation. I graciously took the offer because I know how bad the job market is. My college is over an hour away, so I have to drive there and back everyday. I leave my house at 6:30 and don't make it back until 6:30 in the evening. The commute is killing me.

I hate the job. Everyone there is nice, but I am the youngest person there by far, by at least 30-40 years. It's difficult not having someone close to my age to talk to, so I mainly sit in my cubicle by myself for hours. I think what I hate most about the job is that everything can be done remotely, but they still make everyone show up to the office and work 8-5. There is literally no reason to show up to the office everyday. 

Like I said, I hate it. my parents think the pay is good for the area, but I really do not want to move back to my hometown after graduation. I feel like if I do that, I'll just be stuck there for the rest of my life. It is a rural area, with not much around other than small towns. I would hate to be stuck there. My fear is that once I go back, it'll be really difficult to get out.  Getting a job in my current location is almost impossible, because it is a college town and most of the jobs here are retail or food service. 

I need some unbiased advice. Most of my friends/girlfriend are telling me to suck it up and keep the job because the market is horrible right now. My parents are telling me to keep it because they thinke the money is great for the area (it isn't) and they want me to move back home. I'm conflicted because I would feel guilty leaving this place because of how nice they have been to me. The work itself is not bad, it's just really boring. That's not why I hate the job, I hate the environment because no one there is anywhere near my age and it's unbearable.

Is this feasible / has any one done this before?,Gingarius,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hmn73u/my_internship_is_potentially_ending_and_i_want_to/,"Hello everyone!

So as said in the title, I’m currently in a great internship that I’ve been at for a year and three months this August. Sadly though, I may not get an extension due to the economy and pandemic and I need to keep a job to pay for school and life. I really don’t want to go back to fast food or retail and I feel like I’ve gained a good amount of knowledge and experience to attempt an entry level position. 

I will be doing 12 credit hours in the fall and 3 in the spring so my schedule will be extremely open. Is it possible to find a job right now that would accept a college student who has experience? 

I’m very eager to stay in the field and would appreciate any guidance or tips to applying to first time jobs. 

Thanks to anyone and everyone with any advice!"

Right now I have mainly done stuff with data analytics and web scraping. What I want to be able to do is create a program, not one you have to run from the terminal but one that actually has an interface on your screen like a software you would download. I did some research and it seems like Tkinter can be used for this, however it seems like it is only good for really really basic programs. So the question is this: would Tkinter be a good place to start and if not, where? Another python module? Or should I branch out and learn a whole new language and if so, I'd love any recommendations on what it would be and how to get started."

The advice has to do with taking a leap of faith to start a professional career post-grad. Before I ask for advice I would like to mention two things. One, that I have just smoked (excuse the rambling) and two, that this is my first ever post on Reddit (so excuse any rookie mistakes).

If this is not the best subreddit for a post like this, please let me know! This is the first place I'm posting after Google-ing ""best subreddits for advice"" haha.

&amp;#x200B;

I have wound up living in my parents house after graduating college and honestly I just think COVID-19 is a convenient excuse of a reason why. Each day I feel as though I'm spiraling, careening between waves of ignorant bliss, and rampant anxiety. I don't know if this is just the way the real world works and I've just been too sheltered my whole life -- this would make the answer a ""pull myself up from my bootstraps' sorta deal. Or if it is the result of psychological issues I have, and need to get figured out for my own good sooner rather than later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok here's my story. I'll make it as detailed as necessary, I'm so scared to say all this right now my hands are shaking so I want to keep my anonymity.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a fortunate person. I grew up in a safe part of the country with a wealthy extended family I was very close with. I am lucky, my parents set aside enough money for me to go to a private university debt-free. I am a straight white male and I understand all the privilege that comes with being just that (although I don't approve of it). 

I have always gotten good grades without having to try particularly hard and without ever cheating. Even in college I double majored across two colleges of my university (communications and history degrees) and achieved a cumulative GPA around 3.25. I achieved all of this while doing all the things professors told you not to (cramming before tests, starting projects a mere week in advance, working until seconds from the online deadline, drinking excessively). I do admit that I probably had too much fun in college, opting to work at the campus bar and spend my time in campus extra-curriculars instead of experience-building internships. The latter is what it seemed like most of my peers did, and internships were readily available to me. The issue was that whenever I even thought to apply for one anxiety always overcame me. I knew how much I **should** get one to have an advantage going into the work force but I never could bring myself to actually take the first step. I always thought, ""There's still time for me to fit it in before graduation."" That time never came.

A few months before graduation I was anxiety-ridden with need for a job that I was sure I wasn't prepared for. Because of this I went with a flashy sales job that hired me 1 week after interviewing me and promised great benefits and pay -- as long as you made the sales, instead of a job in Public Relations which is the field I actually am passionate about. In my naivety I took the job without even knowing what I was selling. In fact, I just told you about everything I knew regarding the company and job I took when I accepted it. Everything besides the figures of the payment &amp; exact benefits. I graduated from my well-renowned private university in 2019 and started my job a week after.

Turned out the company was a total flop. They threw me out into the field after 1 job shadow and 2 days of training. 1 JOBSHADOW AND 2 DAYS OF TRAINING. The job was selling a quite overpriced, moderately-useful business SEO (Search Engine Optimization) product as a third party provider. They taught me no data to back up my bold claims made in the 2:30 speech they had me memorize. I said the speech (word-for-word preferred) to each small locally-owned businessman and woman in my couple of zip codes -- zip codes that I quickly was convinced had already been picked over by similar salespeople. Leaving only the most calloused and rude potential clients. Like a picked-clean Water Buffalo on the Sahara with nothing left that anything larger than a beetle can eat.

After 2 weeks doing everything they taught me to do, reading and rereading the handbook they gave me and putting what I read into practice, I had no sales on the books. I was promptly and emotionlessly let go, having only met 3 of my co-workers in the company. I got the feeling this happens a lot. Additionally, the company had a policy where I wasn't allowed to have a letter of recommendation written for me from an employee of theirs. I was completely congenial, high-energy, and polite in all my dealings with my supervisor irl and online. I was even calm and composed during my firing when I wanted to shout back ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Even that was all for nothing. Now the obvious thing to point out here is that I must've been a lousy salesmen. No talent for the job. But that's not true! I've been a very charismatic, confident, and comfortable person to speak to my entire life. I was the kid in high school who MC'd the pep rallies and always aced my speeches in college. 

This really took the wind out of my sales but I promised to myself that I would get back in the saddle and start heavily applying to positions in my original preferred field, public relations. I applied to a few positions but that lack of confidence and experience due to lack of an internship came through and I never made it past a first interview. I realized I needed to get an internship now as a post-grad and the old anxiety came back. I felt like I was moving backwards while all my peers were skating along. I made half-assed applications to a couple openings.

In July after my May graduation, I took a bartending job and became fully committed to it as well as working out. I was able to pay the bills with occasional help from my parents who were always willing and understanding of my situation. My life before COVID was spent bartending and working out nearly every day and maybe sending a resume out every two weeks. A couple times I got really close to landing internships, too. And when I was so close I was super excited. I knew that that's what I truly wanted. I just never quite got the offer on my few attempts. And the excitement from nearly getting offers didn't come close to the anxiety of applying for them in the first place.

Now that COVID hit I feel more like an out of work bartender than a recent college grad looking for a job in his field which terrifies me because I know I want to try my hand in public relations. Feelings of disgrace, self-disappointment, and inability to change especially hit when the class of 2020 virtually threw their hats in the air. I have spent my days during COVID living back in my parents house earning no money and feeling terrible. I go to my apartment once a week to see my girlfriend (who is honestly the highlight of my life at this point) and just to get a change of scenery.

Another amplifier is the close-knit extended family I mentioned much earlier. I am the youngest of a large extended Irish-Catholic family (I stopped practicing Catholicism a long time ago - veeeeery atheist now). I have around 20 older cousins who all seemed to land right on their feet out of university (many going to the same university as me and majoring in more 'practical' fields). Growing up, I always looked up to them in near-adoration. Now I feel patronized, verbally abused (and I'm a bartender so that's saying something), and anxiety-ridden anytime I have to see them. I desperately want to love them again.

Now I have been a weed user since probably my sophomore year of college. Using marijuana has enabled me to have many of the introspective thoughts I've written about in this post. But could the marijuana have caused all the problems in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

One funny thing is I am sure I am not the only one like this. I'm sure there are thousands of people just like me every year who are in my position, and many more that have made it through a similar situation in the past. Either ending up a failed degree-holder, or a successful one depending on how you eventually dealt with your circumstances. **That's why I'm very hopeful for this reddit post!**

&amp;#x200B;

What is my issue? What do I need to understand/How do I need to change my behavior to get over this biggest issue in my life so far?

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm looking for is not just a small piece of advice but major guidance and I therefore understand that I may not get what I really need just from one Reddit post. Because of this I would love recommendations of organizations, pieces of literature, mentorship programs, or anything else!

&amp;#x200B;

I was originally interested in taking up the scholarship due to the internship opportunities and job security it can provide but now I am having second guesses mainly because I am quite afraid of the possibility that how work would be like in the company would be very different from how they've described it to be so far. I've also read certain posts on this subreddit about how scholars serving their bonds have been put in dead-end job positions but I've also read that that's more likely to happen in public sector scholarships. Currently, my family would have no issues paying for my tuitions fees (though the coverage from the scholarship would certainly help quite a lot) and the main attraction from the scholarship for me would be the promised job opportunity upon graduation, as well as the internships and mentorships I would be promised along the way. 

With that, I would like to ask if anyone here has experiences being under a scholarship and what it has been like so far, and whether anyone has experiences breaking a scholarship bond too. What advice do you guys have for me? SgIS related experiences would be best but any advice would be super greatly appreciated as this is a really large commitment for me. Thanks guys!"

At first, I studied only the python rules and modules like a high school student preparing for his maths exam.

It's funny how a human forgets little things:

Some programmer friend suggested me to learn PHP so that he can hire me as an intern. I tried PHP and made market research. Sadly I don't want to be a Web Developer (and PHP was hard for me to comprehend). I find joy with Python. Maybe I can do similar things with PHP ( and make some bucks alongside) but I spend 1 year to learn Python (and Computer Science mostly) and only now I can think in Python. A new language for a career pathway that I don't like would be a waste of my precious efforts (and I have really few of them (thx ADD(not blaming btw ))).

Or should a PHP written project -here Web Page- could translate to a Django project? ( a wild thought, maybe not)

Are you agree with me? I care about your opinions. You guys helped me a lot at the beginning of my sacred path of Python."

hmqgfi,1,2020-07-07,Choosing a career \ University degree,Ak171,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hmqgfi/choosing_a_career_university_degree/,"Hello, 

I'm (21M) nearing the age of having to decide what I want to learn in university, and what field I would like to work in, and I'm lost. I honestly have no idea what career path I would like to take, I have no idea what I want to do for a living, everyday I choose something else, and I never manage to stick to one decision for more than a week.  

My current dilemma is between two fields: 

1. Law: I have a natural way with words (especially in my mother tongue), I understand the logical concepts behind laws quite well, the field is quite interesting in itself, I think that judges are really impressive people, and I think that all in all I would be OK working in this field. I could also probably get into the best institution in my country for law, get the best grades, and therefore get the top internships. The problem is: there are way too many lawyers in my country, they don't pay that well, I will be limited to my local market (which really isn't that big). 
2. Engineering\\CS: I did Ok in math at school.  I mean I did the hardest test in math my country has to offer, I got 92% out of 100, but it came with a lot of hard work, and wasn't nearly as easy as some other subjects. It was enjoyable solving mathematical problems, but wasn't intuitive, it's not where my comfort zone is. For example in my country's GPA we have a big test that involves a test in my Mother tongue, in English and in Math. The mother tongue part is the easiest part by far, maths is the hardest, it's not that i'm bad at math it's that im just not as good as other subjects. Same with computer studies I did in High School. I did some programming on my own and it wasn't bad just not loving it. Anyway, the pay for CS or engineering degrees is double than law, there is a crazy demand for developers and engineers, it's an international job, I can be an engineer anywhere in the world, and I would like being at the front of the technological development. 

Everyday I lean towards a different career. Anyone got any good advice?"

Im going into my senior year in high school and im taking my steps towards a business career much more seriously. I am pursuing a relatively high tier business job not just an average accountant, but also not a CFO or CEO as I dont think im a good enough leader for those roles. While im not set on a career I am more of leaning towards portfolio manager or high net worth financial manager. I am going to got to my local Junior College then transfer to a 4 year, as from what I have heard is that employers dont really care much about the name of the college past getting your first job where they will care much more about job experience and I figured I would save myself the headache of 30-50k in student loans and network and get job experience in college and come out in the same spot. I have heard differing opinions on that but from what I have gathered that is what I perceive as true/best option for me. I have been interested in learning finance and have been set on this career path since I was 13/14 and have been actively investing my money from my part time job for the last year now and have already become somewhat knowledgeable on balance sheets, income statements 10ks/10qs and overall evaluation of companies the same goes for personal finance. Im by no means an expert but I do feel as if I have an above average knowledge on these subjects especially in my age bracket (hate saying it like that but im just trying to give a gauge on everything ive learned so far)

Here are some of my questions

1. Once I complete High School what job do I get while in college and where do I look for it? An internship would likely have to be paid as I will still have expenses unless its low hours and idk where to look for an entry level job that provides networking and job experience. The only idea I have is a bank teller as that is entry level ""finance"" job and has contact with financial advisors although if I were to be one I would like to work for the high end clients not the average person (sounds pretentious but idk how else to put it).
2. What do I do now? Do I continue learning and investing or should I actively seek out and network with people if so how do I go about that? Im not 18 yet so I doubt anybody will hire me and I wont be 18 until after high school so I have to wait to legally not be considered a minor for working until next summer.
3. How am I doing for my age (almost 17) for achieving my career goals do you think im on track? Ahead behind? dont be afraid to give criticism I can take it.
4. What specific jobs would you recommend, please leave the reasoning as well, pros/cons. My ideas so far are analyst, portfolio manager, and financial advisor (maybe investment banker but that might be to far out of reach and for people much smarter than I am as well as too high stress to continue for decades). I dont like jobs like a CPA or accountant as I like the investing aspect of the jobs and while im totally willing to work long days and weeks I would prefer to enjoy doing it to not burnout in my 20s/30s.

Anyways thanks for any help or advice you could give I truly appreciate it."
hmquu2,2,2020-07-07,What should I wear to the wedding of a girl that said I destroyed her life?,Lelelila,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hmquu2/what_should_i_wear_to_the_wedding_of_a_girl_that/,"[W,22]First of all sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I have dyslexia.

So now to the story. I went to a boarding school for 3 years when I was 16. It was a really small school, were you learned cooking and more. In my year were only 4 other girls,
E who I later got friends with
J the youngest 
P the one that never talked
And v the main person of this story.


One of our chaperones told v she should be ""leader "" of our group, because she is the oldest. Even our teachers tried to bring this dynamic there
But that didn't happen, because j became it and v really didn't like it.  We had double rooms and p and v were in one and e and j stayed in one. I was alone. Exactly like this the groups formed, with me in the middle to get them to cooperate.
But then j dropped out and v thought now it was the time to get her ""rightful place "". Didn't happen. E became the ""leader "". 
Because we both were alone, we spent more time together and I somehow became her ""guard ""(I have to tell that E always was a bit insecure behind her strong front and always way to kind and forgiving for her own good. While I tend to be more cold and logical about things. So I looked out for everyone that could hurt her, while she helped me to open up)
You can imagine v didn't like it at all.

V was also not as good as E and me in the school, she had problems with both practical and theory, what leaded to her getting more angry with us.
E is also really pretty, while v is not that much. I have the luck to have a good metabolism and can wear almost everything,  while she always said she needs to lose weight and her fashion sense is really really old fashioned. 
Then there was this situation at her birthday, were her crush only talked to me. She did ask me beforehand to find out if he also liked her, so I talked with him, but made I clear that I wasn't interested in him, but he didn't take the hint and wanted to stay the whole day near me. At one point I hit at the bathroom, because I didn't want to talk to him more. 
I really didn't give him any signs of interest, but I think  she misunderstood the situation, because after this she didn't really talk to me and after I tried to talk to her about it, she said she believes me. But she was still weird after it.
This is important, because after some month, we had a intern at the time, who stayed with me, she run crying to this 15 year old intern and told her she just tried to kill herself with her headphones. And it was because of E and me. We weren't there at the time, but when I came back and found the shocked intern in my room, I got mad. We had enough chaperones that were all trained for such situations, why did she go to a 15 year old girl, that she knew for not even a week?
I tried to talk to v about it, but she just said that everything was our fault. Sadly E heard it and the person she is, she believed it. I decided that this was enough and told everything our main chaperone.
They decided we needed to talk about it with sb and made us do a group chat.
V told only lies at this group chats. She said we would exclude her, while she was the one that always said no when we asked( for her and p) and even left e, p, and me alone in the city one time. 
She also said that we always make her feel bad about herself, with our good grades. In my life I never cared for grades, because I know that some things you are good at and some just not( dyslexia shows that very good). And E was way to kind to say anything about grades to her. Maybe our classmates in the public school said something about this to her, but I'm not sure.

Because there was no solution for this whole situation, we just decided to keep our distance and wait till we graduated.

But then v dropped out, after her grades were to bad to get through the midterm exams.
I wasn't there when she she had her goodbye party, because I was send to help in a different home of our school, but nobody said anything grand happened. So I thought this was over.

But like a month later we got an angry and quite mean message that we destroyed her life and she would hate us!
We were shocked. E was really hurt and searched for the fault by herself. She was depressed for at least a month and as soon as somebody said v name she got really quiet.
It didn't helped that in our last year we got an girl that looked exactly like v. It took e really long to even let her near her.

Then out of nowhere she wrote us a letter, were she said God showed her she should write us. Like wth.
I burned the letter, maybe not the best way to handle it, but I was so angry. Not even for myself,  I'm not really hurt by such things,  but for e.
Since then we didn't really had contact, I saw her at some official events of our school, but I always stayed away. I know e talked small talk with her at one of this, but I knew it wouldn't end good if I talked to her.

So now E told me that v wrote her, over one of the girls and that she wants us at her wedding ceremony. 
I'm not so sure what to think honestly. Why did she even invite us? 
E wants to go, because of the old times and I don't want her to go alone.
And if I go what is appropriate to wear? I don't really know how she looks now and if I go I really don't want to outshine her in any way,  because it's her wedding day."

Going into college, I wasn't 100% sure of what career path I wanted to pursue. At first, I was thinking of going pre-med and my original major was in Bioengineering. However, after taking some of the introductory courses, I lost interest and knew it wasn't something I wanted to pursue. I switched to a double major in Economics and Statistics, and I like what I'm learning in my classes. I find it practical, intriguing, and intellectually challenging especially once you get to the higher-level mathematical topics. 

Unfortunately, after countless applications, interviews, and hours spent into trying to land a summer internship, I failed. I worked my ass off trying to secure one. I went to career fairs, networked with recruiters, made it to the final-round interviews. But all of it was in vain. That crushed me because it seems like everyone around me is doing well in life. Several of my friends are going off to med school, earning their professional credentials, or working for big and successful companies. Meanwhile, I'm two semesters away from graduating with essentially zero experience. I feel lost, defeated, and behind everyone else. I know it's not a race, but I can't help but feel like I'm stuck in this bubble, where everyone is moving forward and all I can do is watch.

Add on my long-term shitty mental health issues, pressure from my family, and low confidence, and you get the picture. One thing I recently tried was to pick up some technical skills during quarantine since I have the time to try and make myself into a more competitive applicant. For the past few weeks, I've been self-learning web development and back-end programming. Despite this, I still feel like I won't be good enough. I really want to make something of myself and find my purpose, but it's so hard. 

Have you ever felt this way? If so, how did you dig yourself out of this hole? It honestly feels like the world is against me, and for once in my life, I just want something to go my way. Just once."

I started my job hunt around last December after taking several months off to travel and relax a bit. The covid pandemic really shut down some final round interviews I had for some Financial Analyst and Credit Analyst jobs I was in the running for here in Las Vegas where I live in February and March this year.

A lot of those job positions have closed and dried up and whatever new jobs are being posted has 4 to 5 times the number of usual applicants so the competition has become more cutthroat than ever.

I am now in the second round interview for a Trust Specialist job at a trust and retirement savings company here in town. The job does **NOT** require my Bachelors degree, only a high school degree. I was told during the first interview that the position was looking at an hourly rate around $15-$16. I was expecting my first job out of college to be starting at around $20-$22 an hour. I've only had one internship 5 summers ago at an engineering firm which paid me $15 an hour.

With the intention of still aiming for more challenging jobs in data and finance in the future once the economy starts to recover, ***would this Trust Specialist position be beneficial for me moving forward?*** Considering the lower than expected pay and lower requirements for entry? Would working this a year or two hurt my chances at future analyst roles?

TL:DR; I have my bachelors in Finance. This job I'm interviewing for doesn't need my degree and it pays low. Will working this kind of job make me look bad to future anaylst roles?"

I was looking for an apprenticeship (work-study) the last few months, I applied for some internships (I didn't find many apprenticeships) in northern France and Paris, but I got no positive response, I'm getting a little worried about the advancement of my career in this field -since my final year is starting in September- and of course I have no intention to work in any other field, 

I started a self study program 3 years ago, I always followed this sub (really helpful and the community is amazing) , I've read &amp; worked a lot with the C programming language, took many courses related to embedded (Data structures, FreeRTOS, Git, KiCad, etc.) and I am currently developing drivers for AVR and STM32 microcontrollers, 

I took care of my CV to contain all my projects, skills etc, and kept it updated, I think that it's really a good CV for an embdded student who wants to go farther, but the lack of offers here and continuously getting no positive reply is really stressing me out, and I sometime think of moving elsewhere, so I would like to ask the embedded people who work in embedded in France to tell me if it's been always like this or it's one of consequences of the Covid-19, (or the problem maybe is in my dossier),

THANKS A LOT!"

I am wondering how much should I know in order to get an internship as a Data Analyst. I really do not have a perception of the real responsibilities of an intern, and due to that, I don’t know if my knowledge is enough.

I’ve been learning for a few months now via data camp, udemy, and youtube.

In SQL I know how to select and filter rows, aggregate functions, sorting and grouping, joins(inner, outer, cross), set theory clauses(unions, intersect, except), and subqueries (inside where, select and from clauses).

In Phyton I went over: loading, transforming, aggregating, slicing and indexing data in pandas, plotting data with matplotlib, creating different types of plots, Boolean logic, control flow and filtering, loops.

I also took ""Intro Power BI"", ""Data Analysis in Excel"" courses.

Do you guys think that this is enough to finally start applying for internships? I have this anxiety following me, thinking that recruiters will laugh at me during the interview.

I appreciate any info or advice, thanks!"

When i went to college for the architecture degree i was totally into it. i wasnt like top class but i was really enjoying it most of the time and i really thought that what i will be doing for life but when i graduated and after like 1-2 years it became very obvious that its not what i thought it would be. the work experience was totally different that college studies. i am not sure the error is from the places i worked at (but seems all of them are same) or even the error from Egypt style of work or that architects are not same here as rest of the world. 

After that my job became very boring and i became very systematic doing it. and at first i switched companies but still the same. so its been a while searching for another career path i can go in to find my passion and to love what i am doing.

Since i love drawings and games and due to architecture i have some background in 3d programs and some other staff. and also that all my life i have been a gamer and my dream was to participate in making games  or be a part of its cycle.

I think (not sure yet) that a game artist or game tester would be good for me. but as i want it to be a job and not to hate games too so i think an artist would be better for me.

Now the harder part is ... thats not a part of culture here in Egypt and there is no where you can study for it here also no companies to hire you if you can do that locally so you either study and work online or get a scholarship or something similar then work abroad. but i am really lost on how to do it or what to do.

should i pay for a degree online or search for an internship and pay for it or do self study so not to waste money? money is hard to come by here so the risk of traveling to study and pay for it is really rough thats why i search for scholarship. 

TL.DR: want to shift career from architect to game artist if someone has anywhere to direct me to or sites or colleges i could apply on please feel free to post. or general advice for shifting career overall what to do and what dont."

Sorry if this has been asked before, but I did go through the FAQ and search bar and couldn't find anything. I'm moving to Germany (from a european country) for a Masters and would like to work something like 10/15 hours a week to make some extra money, preferrably as a student assistant or in a lab. I'm aware that some of these positions are advertised in portals from the universities, but I'm under the (possibly misguided) impression that it's possible to apply spontaneously to a lab or department and ask if they may have an opening.

My question is if this impression is correct and what the etiquette would be when inquiring about such positions. Is it ok to e-mail a lab saying I'd be interested in a (paid) position with my CV/motivations attached?

I'm asking because where I'm from this would not sit well with any department. Students are encouraged to ask for internship positions but we should not expect to be paid to do this work. Yet from what I've read I'm under the impression that this is not the case in Germany.

If the information is relevant: I'm going for a very good Masters in STEM and am well qualified for lab work/have very solid coding skills, with previous experience working in research. I'm moving to Munich.

Any help/correction is appreciated :)"

Is this how I should calculate my GPA to go on my resume, or is it normal to go with the GPA my school lists me as having right now? Should I make a note about the retaken class?

I started a remote internship at a med-tech startup in an EE role yesterday and am feeling lost. I would be grateful for advice from those of you who are professional EEs.

My first project, per my supervisor's instructions, involves designing and testing a 2nd gen communication interface for our product. I'm supposed to familiarize myself with the existing architecture of the platform, research some relevant technology, evaluate potential replacements and create a design document, test plan and report.

The challenge for me is: I don't know where to start. I've been provided with a number of schematics related to the platform but no instructions from my supervisor. I'm just out of undergrad, where I graduated with a different engineering degree, and though I have relevant background I haven't tackled an EE project before. I want to show that I'm proactive and qualified for the position, so I'm hesitant to ask my supervisor for direction (though that could very well be the best course of action.)

For those of you in industry, especially startups, how do you approach projects like this? I'd appreciate any help you can give, from resources to personal advice.

Thank you!"

I’m having major issues at work right now and am contemplating quitting. I currently work in an IT office at a school in PA with one other person, my supervisor. We both report to the head of Finance. I started at this company a year ago as an intern out of college, and was hired full time in February.

My supervisor, I’ll refer to him as J, despises his job. With the state of things before COVID being in complete disarray, the panic afterwards has put immense pressure on him. Many emails are sent out complaining of IT’s lack of speed, however we are juggling many projects. I understand how that can be frustrating, especially when your sole coworker (me) is fairly new and lacks a lot of training.

However, I’m very tired of coming into work daily to rants about those in the company “throwing stones”, how stupid and “retarded” those in other departments are, how J cannot wait to quit in 2 years when he has the money, and so on. These frequent outbursts lead to me feeling very tense at all times given how quickly he can get angry and emotional. I’ve been snapped at multiple times, which has made asking questions and retaining info to learn very difficult. I’ve come home and had panic attacks early on, but now each day I typically feel relieved the day is over and nervous about the next, since in all likelihood, J is just going to be fed up, housing a negative attitude, and talking down everyone else while continually either not focusing on the tasks at hand or giving me vague instructions and snapping when I ask questions, sometimes flat out interrupting me and not allowing me to explain or ask any questions.

Should I go above his head and report this behavior to our boss? I’m not comfortable confronting him on how uncomfortable I am on our environment, and I’m very likely leaving soon either way when I can find another job. I don’t want to leave this job on a bad note but I feel as though, soon enough, I’m just going to get fed up and quit on the spot.

TL;DR: Supervisor and sole coworker hates his job and is perpetually angry on the job. Makes learning and asking questions impossible, as well as just doing general work very difficult. Should I report this? Will it negatively affect my work environment further?

Thank you"

I am now 28 and I gave up all my goals. My childhood self would spit on me. I’m the loneliest and the most boring person in the world. 
I grew in the suburban area of a big city, I always wanted to do a year abroad, I studied hard and never got a scholarship. My family didn’t have the money for anything for me, because they had a way older (already adult) foster kid that was always in financial trouble and they had to help her out with huge amounts of money that they never got back. They had me when my mom was almost 40. I barely spent time with my parents in my childhood. They don’t know me. They always worked all day long and on the weekends they never had the energy to do anything with me. But if her former child came spontaneously the world stopped for them, suddenly everything was possible. All my fellow kids in school went on great vacations. The only thing My parents ever did was a daily trip to the beach. Once. All my other trips were school trips. I always felt unwanted and replaceable. And this continues through my whole life.
My first big love was mad bipolar, but this is something I found out later in life, when I got more woke and mature. We started dating as very young teenagers and I felt alive for the first time in my life when I was around him. I still think of him every day and miss all the sweet little moments we shared. When we were only 21 he committed suicide and I felt left alone. I tried to date other guys a couple of years later, I tried to be my best self, I tried to be lovely, caring and representable. But every time I felt like things are getting serious, I was just replaced quickly by another girl. Now I live on the other side of the country, I’m here all alone. I don’t have friends here. I only visit my parents on holidays, because I can’t stand them for more than a couple of days. There’s just too much pain. Today they joked about the young new neighbors that help them with groceries that they are now their new children. It cut open so many old wounds in me, that I cried for hours. 
I wanted to work in media, since I was a kid I was super duper passionate about television. But after my three years of being a trainee with the best grades you can get, I was replaced in my company by an unpaid intern. When I had my first job after that at an agency I was fired after not even three months. I was so fed up by this broken industry, that I reorientated. Now I work in finance, did get a new degree, was in my year the best student. But I don’t feel fulfilled in this job. Nothing brings me joy anymore. I don’t feel happy for my success and my achievements. I feel more like I’ve given up on my dreams, like a complete failure. 
The best thing that could happen to me right now would be falling asleep and never waking up again. I don’t have any purpose. My family doesn’t need me, the only person that ever loved me is forever gone, I will never have my own family because people always replace me for something better, something more exciting. I am just unnecessary for this world. I need to leave."

* Administrative Experience: 8 years
* MBA- Cyber Security and Management
* BA- Management w/ concentration in HR
* CompTIA Certifications
   * Security+
   * Network+
   * A+

Secondly, Though none of my degrees are in History, both my MA's have focused on it considerably, including in the research element as well as taking modules in it - I have a solid knowledge of historiography too

About me:

***Masters in Philosophy '20*** *(focusing on Comparative, Chinese Philosophy and Culture - thesis topic was related to intellectual history of modern China)*

* Equivalent of 3.9 GPA (US terms)
* From #1 ranked university for Philosophy in China, #2 in Asia overall and top #15 in the world for Academic Reputation 
* Received full tuition coverage and living allowance as ""International Excellence Scholar"" for two consecutive years.
* Research Assistant in Final Year
* Presented at International Conference &amp; Highest Graded Thesis in Year

***Masters in Pacific Asian Studies '18*** *(mainly history and politics but with law and economics modules too - took extended dissertation option and topic was political/intellectual history in same country as my proposed PhD focus)* 

* Equivalent of 3.9 GPA (US terms)
* For my subfield it's probably top 3-5 in the world. But overall it's Top 20 in the World for Politics and Top 50 for History (higher for academic reputation - like Top 5 for politics and top 35 for history) 
* Dissertation Supervisor is probably in top 3 experts in field and will write very strong reference. 

***Bachelors in Law '16***

* not very well known UK university 
* 3.0 US GPA equivalent (though I got an A equivalent for my dissertation) 
* mitigating circumstances due to health/disability issues (which are now under control as hopefully demonstrated by better grades in postgrad study) 

**Publications** \- 3 Book Reviews    - one in a pretty big journal in my subfield 

**Conferences** \- 1 International Conference Presentation

**Languages** For my PhD I'll need three which are:

* English (native)
* Chinese (high intermediate/third to fourth year equivalent by the time I start) 
* Burmese (taken two intensive courses but it's Beginners level) 

**Scholarships** 

* fully funded language year (tuition and living costs) at University used by US State Department for Critical Languages Programe in Chinese 
* fully funded language year (tuition and living costs) for Indonesian (postponed due to COVID) 
* 2 consecutive years of ""International Excellence Scholarship"" (tuition and living costs) 
* Summer School Scholarship in Chinese Philosophy and History 
* Semester Abroad Scholarship (fees only - didn't accept due to personal emergency) 
* Pro Bono Law Scholarship (funding for flights and four months living costs to work on pro bono law cases) 
* Vice Chancellors Scholarship (tuition fees for any postgraduate law course at my law school) 

**Other things (*****not sure if relevant*****)** 

* 1 year of Research Assistant Role 
* 5 years as ambassador/youth patron involved in promoting, lobbying, policy ideas for a national charity related to disabilities 
* Summer Internship in Human Rights Law in Cambodia 
* Summer Internship in UK Civil Service (Disability Policy section) 
* Mentee of the Solicitor General for 5 years (like second highest ranking lawyer/also a politician in the UK - and is now Minister for Justice) 

As I say I basically want to know how high I can aim in the US and how strong my profile would be to admissions panels? Apart from getting published (working on that) how else can I strengthen my application? 

Many thanks in advance!"

I made sure my CLs had good descriptions and were very verbose. However, each CL was fairly large. Also, we didn't have that many conversations... it was a suggestion by my host, then I either agreed and fixed it or commented why I disagreed and let it stay the same. Since I finished my first project quickly, my manager wants me to pick up a second project.

My question is, are large CL's looked upon poorly by the intern team? And are 5 verbose, well documented CL's good enough?"

Graduated college a year ago with an engineering technology degree. Feel like I didn't learn anything from major and I didn't get any internships before and getting any internships after was hard and all I got were rejections and no call backs. It's also unfortunate that I found out during my senior year that I did not enjoy my major but I persisted and graduated because, in my head, it was better than not finishing the degree. 

I got a job as a Help Desk IT technician in January of this year. I started as an intern, getting paid like 12 dollars an hour. Just recently they hired me as a part-time employee (around 30 hours a week) and my salary to 15 dollars on hour. 

I live in NYC, this job is almost more than half an hour away from me and I'm probably losing 25-30 dollars a day for just gas and toll fees to get to work. 

The work isn't so great. It's Help Desk, I get a lot of vague statements and issues from clients. What's even more upsetting is when I started the job, most of the time, the higher ups would usually tell me to just ""Google"" client problems when I have to escalate an issue. 

I'm glad I have a job right now, I think I was just desperate when I couldn't find one after graduating from college. But I don't exactly love what I'm doing right now, especially when the pay is low AND I'm paying a good amount of money everyday just to travel. 

Anyone felt like this or any advice regarding my situation? I'm a bit lost in my life right now. I'm only staying at my current job because I need some sort of income but I don't really want to continue any longer. 

Have you ever quit a job just because you couldn't bear with all the cons that it has or did you tolerate it? Should I stay at my current job a bit longer despite the cons? Or should I look for a temporary job that pays a bit higher and is closer to my home until I figure out what I want to do with life? Honestly I'm just so lost right now. I've fell into depression a few times already because of this. I feel like a failure with no goals."
hn9epi,1,2020-07-07,Recent Grad Thinking About It,ad_sleeper,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hn9epi/recent_grad_thinking_about_it/,"Hello everyone,

I won’t deny it. I am considering doing it. The reason for this is quite simple: I am a recent college graduate with no experience in his field (engineering) and cannot get a job of ANY kind that can support me moving out.

I had been unsuccessful in getting internships during college and have had no luck in my job search before and after COVID. I’ve been living in the shithole of a house my parents own (my family is poor) and have had to relinquish any and all autonomy in order to keep living here.

It really also doesn’t help that by being here, I don’t feel motivated to do anything. I live in a corner in the wall kind of room. It’s big enough for a bed and desk, but not much else. All I do every day now is wake up, eat, sit all day on my computer either watching tutorials on coding, watching YouTube videos, or playing old video games from the early 2000s. After that, I sleep from 5 pm to 5 am, and my day starts over. I don’t have any hobbies, nor am I interested in socializing with my family. My hygiene has taken a hit. I now shower once every other day and don’t brush my teeth regularly anymore. It’s a small house. I don’t want anyone to see me.

The restraints I have would seem to all be psychological. I don’t have anyone telling me I cannot move out on my own, however, I don’t have funding, and my parents can’t afford to give me any assistance. Taking out a loan now would also be a moot point.

I also have student loans I have to pay off in 6 months. I could get a minimum wage of $8 an hour to try and pay them off before the grace period is over, but that is quite an awful way to live. I am not getting unemployment benefits because I did not qualify with low wages as a college student.

Now, I have been applying for jobs anywhere in the USA since the start of my senior year last year. I have obviously been unsuccessful in my search. I have tried for the past months after graduation with no luck. I have tried to learn coding in an effort to expand my skill set and yet still have had no luck. I am giving up, and I don’t know where to turn.

I have now decided to potentially end my life. I believe there is no reason to live as a leech, especially now when people need money the most. It would be one less burden for my family.

I am looking for someone to talk sense into me or tell me I’m wrong. Maybe I am wrong. Otherwise, I may just end up doing it."

I've spent the past year placing my entire self worth on my ability to land a FAANG position. I worked myself to the bone outside of an already crazy curriculum at an Ivy-league level university and cursed my inability to learn fast and get on everyone else's level. I finally landed an internship, but it all came crashing down because it got cancelled by COVID-19 and I found myself in an even darker place.

You are not a machine. Maybe you didn't learn to code when you were 12 and can't call yourself a full-stack developer before you even graduate uni because you only started a few months ago and barely have one, let alone a portfolio of personal projects together. Maybe you've been through countless rejections and see no hope on the horizon because the job market has only gotten worse since you applied.

*You are still valid.*

We all start at different points and it's not a race, even though the competitiveness in this industry makes us feel otherwise.

And if you truly enjoy the work here, and continue to work hard out of passion, there is a place for you in this industry. It may not be with FAANG, but we all know that the hiring process is far from perfect and **the position you land for yourself is not a reflection of your worth as a human being.**

It's okay if you feel burnt out or if you can't get yourself to write that juicy feature that you were thinking of taking on. Drink some water. Practice gratitude. Exercise. Write a little easy feature that lets you celebrate the small victories.

&amp;#x200B;

This has mostly been a letter to myself, but I hope it helps someone else out there. If anyone is interested, I would love to discuss the little things I've been doing that really have helped me hold on to my sanity and get out of bed in the morning. I'd love to be a listening ear for anyone willing to share their struggles too!"

Hi all,

I’m going to be “graduating” (online no doubt because of rona) in September and I think that the next few years is my main chance to live abroad again before I move home to settle. I have lived (studied) in Jamaica and the Netherlands before and loved living abroad and want to enjoy that experience again for a couple years before I have to grow up for real. 

Destination-wise I’m open to a lot of places, I like sun and beaches and metropolitan cities with multicultural populations and plenty to do. I’m used to a high cost of living having grown up in London but wouldn’t want to move anywhere where the cost of living is significantly higher if the wages are not at least proportionally higher. I only speak English fluently so that’s a limiting factor. When I lived in the Netherlands I barely spoke very basic Dutch but I was fine in my international student and young expat enclave to be honest so I’d be fine living in a city where English is commonly/frequently spoken within a country where it isn’t again. At one point I hoped to move back to Jamaica but I’m reluctant to do this as I would like to drive myself and I found the roads and driving culture in Jamaica quite scary. I would LOVE to consider other islands in the Caribbean though (cost of living is a significant factor here, islands like Barbados would not be an option). I think it’s also important to note that I’m a Black woman so places that are super racist/anti black or misogynistic are just a no to me, this isn’t meant to be controversial and shouldn’t be so please don’t troll or sealion on this point especially. Obviously the world is the world but I’m not trying to move somewhere I will be frequently mocked, stared at, propositioned, etc or somewhere where single women cannot live freely (as in travel solo safely, love independently, etc). To summarise the most important factors for me in destination are warm weather, access to beaches, metropolitan cities, moderate cost of living and not super backwards socially. 

I’m really curious to know if there are schemes like the Youth Mobility Visa in other countries because I think that’s the kind of things I’m looking for. I’m not really planning to make a permanent, life long move (unless I get married or have insane career success) as I’m very close to my family and have always imagined raising my family in London.

I will be a history and political science (bachelors) graduate from a Russell Group uni (not saying this because I’m a uni elitist but because I think my uni has a recognisable name and reputation and hope this may help) and I’ve done internships in policy research, policy comms, digital marketing and comms and I’ve worked a variety of different administrative and customer facing roles. I have years of admin experience and probably 5 months combined policy experience and 7/8 months of comms. I’m also qualifying to teach yoga and have informally taught pole fitness, I would love to pursue these on the side as I just love them tbh. I have also done digital marketing and social media freelance so I could continue to do this. I’m quite open to many fields (policy, management consulting, change management consulting, marketing/external comms) but I’m aware that outside of the UK it’s more common for graduate roles to require a degree specifically related to the role so my options may be more limited abroad. I’m willing to delay moving to become more established in a career here before moving if this is the best way to have a decent life abroad as I want to be able to enjoy life.

Please tell me about destinations and visa schemes that could work for me! Thanks so much in advance :)4"

Current Georgia Tech student here.

° I want to become a front end developer.

Becoming a “full stack” engineer sounds cool but honestly, I still don’t REALLY know what it means to be one.

(I’m thinking it means being able to do both front end and back end work.)

If that ^ is what it means, then I would love to become a full stack developer!

But If you can, please let me know what it means exactly. 

-

° To all my front ends &amp; full stacks, I have questions for you:


1) What’s your position &amp; what coding languages are the most important to your role?

2) What do you believe would make you more efficient as a developer?

3) - What are the most marketable languages to know (as a front end or full stack)?

4) - Would you recommend that I leave Atlanta, GA (after graduation) for a job in places like 
the Bay Area, Seattle, Austin, etc., for experience? 
- Then eventually return to Georgia to settle down? 
- Or would it be better to stay here after graduation and grow my grass here?

5) - Any general tips and advice? (or anything you want to state).

6) - Recommend courses? Should I make an app or website to prove my value? Advice on getting internships?

My family essentially thinks he using me for money and sex, but thats because their mind is stuck on if a man wants to be with you he'll provide for you and do whatever it takes to do this and that. 


I've always been independent and have been taking the lead for a long time like im the man and I like it,  but its caused alot of commentary of whether my boyfriend can provide for me in the future. My family won't stop taking jabs on alot of issues like personal hygiene where I don't smell anything, money problems which has changed since he gets paid and buys things now, seeing each other too much and too little, my learning to cook is a problem because its not for me but my boyfriend, learning to drive,  me wanting to buy a house (or rent a house) because I can't see my bf the way I want. Its neverending but the only reason I live at my moms is because she is disabled but doesn't want him around over disagreements on what is and isn't allowed in the house. I finally snapped at my sister because not too long ago what seemed like a walk turned into an intervention where everyone was suggesting i break up with him because our relationship is all about me bettering myself for him and he's not doing his part ( he is but i dont say anything anymore)and that maybe i should have an affair. Even though im doing my part to blossom into the 24yo im supposed to be my mindset is underdeveloped and its like im still a teenager. 

Their words are constantly hurting my feelings so I back away and come back when im ready to be ""normal"". Their defense is that theyre joking, its just a joke, and we didn't mean it like that. I was going to have a one on one with all my family members but i got angry at my sidter because dhe insinuated i have a crush on an employee at my job when i don't so i snapped and said everything i meant to say in person in dms and now everyone pretty much says im in the wrong because they all took jabs at me but no one believes i wanted to talk to everyone about the situation.  Im hurt but im considering a cordial salute relationship and thats it. I don't think i want to be a present family member anymore. 

I dont know what to do but my dad says i should have a one on one talk with with a mediator to make sure everything is calm.

I wanted to pursue graduate studies in ML (which was my goal after graduation), and we are usually given one or two semesters to find an academic supervisor. For these reasons, in-person interaction with professors is considered a very important opportunity to ""get to know each other"", but I'm afraid that this will unlikely to happen due to COVID (online class).

During one project a few years ago, it was probably close to 6 months straight that I was working until at least 7 every night (normal hours are 8-5) and probably came in on a Saturday once or twice every month. During my yearly review, there was a section for dependability and commitment to show up to work and get things done and I was given a 4/5, so I take that as they expected even more from me. 

Another time, there was even a misunderstanding between me and my boss where he expected some work to get done over the weekend and I understood it as needing to be completed at the start of the week. He sent me an email Monday morning saying that insubordination was grounds for termination. It may seem like I'm hiding details here, like there was a big fight between us and I lashed out and that's why he sent that email, but it really was just a misunderstanding. I was pretty shocked at seeing that. This is right after 3 weeks of me working until at least 8 every night for a project that I was PM on and wanted to run smoothly.

There was a document I needed to send out but I needed my boss to review it first. After he reviewed it, there were other documents I needed to make based on the first one that was checked. I sent it to him sometime around noon and reminded him about it again at the end of the day. He got back to me at 9:00pm with feedback and told me to send it out that same night. So I was expected to drop everything I was doing to make sure it got out that night.

These are just some examples. The point I'm trying to make is in general, I am expected to work very late and I feel like there's no appreciation for it. Extra PTO is never given to us to offset how many extra hours we put in, we aren't allowed to leave early during the quiet times, etc. On top of that, I have not received my yearly salary increase or bonus in 2 years because the company has not been doing well.

So my question is: How typical is this kind of work environment? I expected that engineers may have late hours, but this is just exhausting here. Do any of you work a low stress 9-5 job where you just show up, put in as much effort as you can, and then leave when you're supposed to? How often are you expected to work late at your job or your previous jobs?"

hnltb6,5,2020-07-08,Advice for pivoting from Business Analyst to SWE?,srpsycho,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hnltb6/advice_for_pivoting_from_business_analyst_to_swe/,"Seeking advice on getting a SWE role, given my background.

Graduated in 2019 from a state school in NYC with a BA in Mathematics + CS Minor + took a bunch of business/finance electives.

**My coursework was focused on:**

* Discrete Math: Combinatorics + some elements of Graph Theory, Number Theory
* Probability: Probability Theory, Statistical Inference, Data Analysis (Regression/Time Series Analysis)
* CS: Data Structures/Algos, Scientific Computing. I'm comfortable in both C++ and Java.
* Business: Macro/microecon, intro accounting, intro finance

**My work experience:**

Currently a Jr. Business Analyst for the Corporate Finance dept at a mid-sized company in Publishing/Media (we are #1 in the industry). Started here as an intern in early 2019 then joined full-time one year ago. Previous experience was interning at a small, financial research firm.

My role is more on the business intelligence/analytics side of finance.

* Lots of dashboarding and coming up with data analyses/visualizations in Power BI + writing DAX. Very front-end clicky-clicky type work, but it gets a lot of praise since it reaches C-level, down to the analyst level. Sometimes I do ad-hoc analysis using R as well.
* Automating Excel reports into Power BI, or automating some data gathering process with Python. 
* Most of my time is spent going back and forth between the needs of the business and communicating that to the data architects who handle the back-end (ETL, security, data warehouse processes, etc.) and vice versa. 

I find myself more excited by the development process rather than glossing over the results. Additionally, I find more joy and fun in writing code/problem solving, rather than acting as a liaison between the business/tech stakeholders of projects.

 In all honesty, the business side has trouble understanding technological constraints and sometimes even tries to fight it (""why can't we just do this in Excel?"") and it's really frustrating at times. Ideally, I want my next role to be surrounded by devs and potentially have a mentor to learn from. My colleagues in the Finance dept all have a finance/accounting background. 

TL;DR: Business ain't it.

With all the downtime during this pandemic, I've been spending time on refining my programming skills (working through a Python book right now to fully get comfortable with the libraries and syntax), and doing a refresher on my previous coursework. Then I eventually plan to get through the EPI Python book. 

I also plan to refine my GitHub (at the moment its all academic coursework) and I am keeping an open eye on job positions/monitoring my network on LinkedIn. 

Wondering if anyone can suggest other things that would help, or that I can do better? Thanks!"

I am currently an incoming senior in Computer Engineering, so I am beginning to gear up to find a job, or at least do the preliminary research and start applying as the new grad positions start to open up. My original plan before COVID was to only look in other places, such as Boston, Dallas/Houston, DC area, maybe Phoenix (I have lived in NC all of my life, and because I’m Jewish, I’m trying to look for a bigger community where I move.) Now, with COVID, I am beginning to reconsider these plans for several reasons. 

1. I am currently working at a company as an intern that seems to emphasize that as long as you do good work, you’ll get a full time offer, even with COVID. I also love what I’m doing here and think it would be a great first job if I was to get a full time offer. I am also potentially going to be working for them part time in the fall/spring if the situation allows. 

2. COVID has eliminated a lot of the job market for the time being, I know it will recover, but I’m not sure if it would be in enough time for me to secure a job in one of those locations by mid 2021. 

3. Even though I have had 5 internships, the bulk of the jobs I am seeing in these places have a couple of years experience in order to be considered, this makes my options potentially more limited unless internships would count towards those years of experience. 

4. I would want to make sure it would be safe for me to go out and make new friends, and I don’t know if I am being realistic with the timeframe anymore on when things will pick back up because of how badly the US is dealing with the pandemic. 

Any guidance or advice. on what to do in this situation?"

I was the best on my Highschool sports team in my particular event, I got an athletic scholarship. I had friends, I flirted with some of my female friends (I'm a guy btw) even though I never took it further than that. I always tried to be friendly to the point where I'd even come off as a bit silly sometimes. Basically I had an actual social life. Then I went to college and things went to shit. In my view I got bullied by my teamates and I let things get to me and it affected my school work, and sports. I also got injured which was a blow to my confidence since my athleticism was a big part of my identity. I drank a little too much alcohol during that time and I pretty much stayed in my room for those 4 years. I had no social life to speakoff.  I graduated a year ago and since I didn't get any internships I haven't landed a full time job and have been working part time. Now I would consider myself a gloomy person. I just spoke to my friend and she wants to reconnect now but...what am I going to talk to her about?? I already told her that I was doing well (which is a bit of a lie). Am I just going to tell her that for the past 6 years I've just degenerated as a person and now I'm just in my room all day? This is why I always fear getting back in touch with my old friends.

hnslh6,30,2020-07-08,FAQ on new ICE policy for international students,caleb_journalist,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/hnslh6/faq_on_new_ice_policy_for_international_students/,"I’ve noticed a lot of the same questions and misunderstandings cropping up around the new ICE policy. I thought I would address some of them. Please note: I am not an immigration attorney. I’m a journalist with experience reporting on higher education and immigration. I’m also familiar with the immigration system through personal experience. I wrote [an article](https://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ice-says-international-students-must-take-in-person-classes-or-leave-the-country/) about the ICE policy as it applies to UC Davis, which might also answer some questions.

If you’re an international student with questions about your specific status, I encourage you to get in touch with UCD Services for International Students and Scholars. SISS is [hosting a webinar](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN__SfISjeJS0qUW2ILvKu4cw) on July 16 at 11 a.m. with immigration attorneys who will be answering student questions.

**Why is this policy coming from ICE and not from Trump or another agency?**

While ICE is better known for street-level immigration arrests, it also maintains the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), an electronic database that tracks visiting students’ academic status to ensure they are in compliance with visa regulations. The final rule will be published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE.

**Does ICE/DHS really have the authority to do this?**

They might. As we’ve seen with the Muslim Ban, DACA, asylum restrictions, public charge rules, and COVID-19-related immigration and travel bans, this administration’s approach to immigration policy is to make sweeping changes, which it might later tweak to comply with a judge’s order.

**Could a judge block the policy?**

Yes, a judge could block — or allow — the policy to stand. Harvard and MIT [filed a lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/07/08/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-international-students.html) today, which seeks to prevent immigration authorities from enforcing the new rules. It is likely that other universities will also sue.

**Can’t universities just enroll every international student in a massive one-credit class that meets outdoors in a huge field once per quarter? What about signing everyone up for in-person internship credits?**

It’s great that people are brainstorming solutions in case the rule isn’t blocked (I would not assume that it will be). However, some of these workarounds make me nervous. There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of different visa types (most students are on F-1 visas, which is the one subject to the new rules). Each visa comes with strict requirements. Clever attempts to circumvent or stretch the rules can get you deported, charged with visa fraud and barred from the US for a decade. Those types of consequences can be very hard to appeal — especially from outside the country — even if US policies or administrations change. Immigration enforcement is no joke.

**How many in-person credits must a student take to satisfy the new visa requirements?**

The language in the ICE announcement is unclear. Previous (pre-COVID) regulations limited international students to taking one online class per quarter/semester, which it defined as three credit hours. Emergency exemptions announced in March eliminated all restrictions regarding online/in-person classes. Now, the new rules require that a student “is not taking an entirely online course load.” Technically, a one-credit course would seem to satisfy that. If it were me, I would take a full three-credit course in-person just to be safe (well, safe from ICE; staying safe from the coronavirus is obviously a whole separate issue.)

The finalized rule from DHS should provide more detail and address some of the contradictions and gray areas in the ICE announcement.

**How does the new rule apply to grad students who have finished their coursework and are just doing research?**

This will be another thing to look for in the finalized rule from DHS. As of now, ICE has not clarified how its policy will be applied to grad students who aren’t taking classes. The normal pre-COVID regulations state that if a grad student's research requires their presence in the US, that is enough to satisfy their visa requirements. If that remains unchanged, it's possible those grad students would avoid the worst of this.

**Is there anything I’m missing?**

I’ve seen surprisingly little discussion of the possibility that UC Davis students who are currently abroad — or have to leave the US — might not be permitted to enroll in remote classes from their home countries. ICE released conflicting guidance, [stating in one document](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/sevisFall2020_FAQ.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3lb9i_NdNx49vA9hwNXjHQ0yAoBu3X9z-20Ehy61TZdz-fUdL0HE4i1j0) that students can take remote classes from abroad and in a [different document](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf) that “only students enrolled at a school that is ***only*** (my emphasis) offering online coursework can engage in remote learning from their home country,” criteria which would appear to disqualify students whose schools — like UCD — plan to offer a hybrid instruction model.

(It’s not clear to me whether ICE/DHS has the authority to regulate educational services universities offer to people outside the US, but they might. There is some precedent — i.e., sanctions against Iran bar US schools from offering online STEM courses to students in Iran.)

**Tl;dr:** Can ICE really do this? Maybe. Universities are suing to block the policy. They might win — or might not. Right now it's unclear how many in-person credits students need to comply with the rules (a more detailed version of the rules will be published soon). Be careful with clever workarounds. They could cause more harm than good. Grad students who are done with coursework \*might\* be in the clear. Students abroad might not be allowed to enroll in online classes.

I hope some of this is helpful."

My resume makes it clear that I'm very end-user/client-oriented since I have lots of front-end and mobile experience, and the teams I expressed interest in during my interviews were all user-facing. However, I was placed onto a team that does dev infrastructure for a fringe product. Instead of creating new features, we make it so that other people can code things, which isn't interesting to me at all and already something I know I won't want to do in the future. I think it would be fine if interest was the only problem--I could just grit my teeth and push through--but there is also a vast gap in skills. I know little about backend and infra (and know it's not what I want to pursue) and it also feels like a loss for the company because it can't put the expertise and interest I do have to use, while I'm spending so much time (which they're paying for) getting up to speed on things I will never need again.  


Both my manager and I are confused about why I'm there because neither of us asked for the other, and it's an awkward ""welp, I'm stuck with you"" all around. I'm also worried that the situation will be especially tough since I have severe ADHD, which makes it insanely hard to focus when something isn't interesting. I guess I'm asking for input on here because I don't know many other SWEs and I don't know what's standard. Hoping I might be able to get insight into the following questions:  


1. Has anyone else had a similar experience? How typical is it for an intern to have any input into what they're working on? Should I just deal with it because interns get placed on teams that are a terrible fit all the time?  
2. Switching teams is probably out of the question, so any advice as to how I can get through the next few months?  


I'm so lucky to have this opportunity and I'm very aware that there are folks out there who would kill to work at my company, no matter the team, and I hope I'm not being an entitled ass by asking on here--I'm kind of at my wit's end because all my experiences in the industry so far have included either a bad manager or unsuitable team.

I later enrolled in a Cloud computing pathway at my college and next semester i’m graduating with an Associates in cloud computing. 

After the bootcamp program, i was also able to land an internship at an AWS Advanced consulting partner where i worked and was able to achieve the AWS Dev, Solutions Architect Associates and the Big Data. I’ve been working long hours at the internship but it seems to be based on Project pay and isn’t very consistent. I’ve tried to look for other jobs but it seems like everything requires many years of experience. Any advice? 
Thanks."

hnxpiz,1,2020-07-09,I'm fighting fantasies of my own death everyday,DTroy_149,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hnxpiz/im_fighting_fantasies_of_my_own_death_everyday/,"You know, I really, really, really want to live.   
I mean, I truly wish to be able to have a life.   
But I cannot.   
So, I have resorted to fantasizing about my own death inadvertently.   
And I am fighting against that kind of thought everyday.   
But it's more or less an uphill battle, and relapse is quite easy with how things are right now.  
.

A bit of context: I am an international student in the United States of America right now. It has long been my dream to pursue opportunities in America. My motivation is largely grounded on the foundational values of this country: personal liberty. Yes, America has its ugly moments, but I have always aspired to be in a place where people's liberty is Constitutionally valued, where the average person can disagree and openly criticize the government without fear of legal repercussions (whether that could hold true in modern day America is another discussion all together), and where freedom of speech and expression could legally combat indoctrination and censorship. The reason I said I wish to be able to have a life is because, to me, a life is only truly life when the fundamental liberties of a person is safeguarded rather than oppressed; if one must choose between standing by those values and die or eroding them and survive, it is not life, it is merely survival. I believe nobody should be forced to choose between life and survival because, if I have to go back to my country, I will join millions of my people in making that same choice.  Of course, this account was made with a throwaway email and I try to keep the information to a bare minimum, even now self-censoring myself. Now that I have experienced the prospect of freedom, I could not return to the docile compliance that I once subscribed to.   
.

So, I have decided to pursue a productive path to American citizenship, knowing full well it would be a long and arduous journey that could span over 10, 15 years easily (hell, when I complete my undergrad it would have been 5 years already). I seem to have a natural affinity for the English language and literary expressions, and am very fond of creativity and writing. I simply elected to forego all that for an engineering degree; it is simply a calculation based on pure practicality, those I would at least report that I genuinely enjoy some aspects of my discipline.   
.

And then the Trump administration hit.  
.

I subscribe to neither the Democrats nor the Republicans, and I am willing to recognize that the Trump admin, like any other administration, did some things good, some things bad, some things in-between. Unfortunately, the one area where I feel they have been the worst at is the same area that affects me the most: legal immigration. With fired up discussions and arguments over things like H1-B visa, OPT program, etc... The fate of international students like me rests in the hands of strangers who knows nothing of our plights or what is at stake for us; they hold the voting power, they hold the offices, they make the rules. We do not. We can only follow them.   
.

With the Trump admin in power, rather than being given the much needed reform, the American immigration system (at least for the path that I pursue) was tossed into limbos of uncertainty, dragging along countless employers who are now even more reluctant at the prospect of hiring internationals. What was once difficult becomes nigh-impossible.   
.

Filtering out employers who don't accept OPT/CPT, who do not sponsor H1-B, who need American citizens for employees, usually let me see the wonderful disappearance of 9 out of 10 postings on any given job board. And even then, there are barely any job that I may qualify for in a way that would make me a superior candidate compared to an American with the same degree but no extra legal baggage attached. On the flip side, I have been able to see, and even been contacted by, people with positions all but tailor-made for my skill set, only to be turned away because of my lack of citizenship.   
.

Let me take a break and say that anyone who claims that we aspiring legal immigrants are here to ""steal jobs"" and that getting a job in America as a foreigner is ""easy"" can take a minute to try being in our shoes. Let me tell you, the prospect of spending the better part of two consecutive decades on visas after visas, extra legal restrictions and paperwork, and the threat of deportability that restricts what we can or cannot do compared to the average American, is not pretty at all. Hell, as a student, we can't even support our own grocery bills by busing tables at a local restaurant; what is a daily reality to Americans is to us a deportable offense. And yes, if you look into it, the H1-B that literally decides our future is run on a **lottery system**. How's that? Years of academic training, hard work, and efforts, to have your future dependent on **luck**? It also gets worse for Chinese and Indians (thankfully, I am neither) who could face decades of backlog for their green card. Also, the green card for permanent residency is actually not permanent, can expire, and still holds us accountable to deportability. At least 5 years on green card are required before we could even attempt to apply for U.S. citizenship. So, for a bunch of ""job thieves,"" I would say we are **pretty f-king dedicated** to our trade.   
.

So, anyway, knowing what kind of battle I will face, I bit the bullet and soldiered on. It was hard, really, getting myself up to submit just one more application in the hope that maybe, maybe this one will work out. But, as I near the end of my program, my time is running short. I have calculated that a Master's will buy me up to 2 years in America, and have secured admission to a program. Afterwards, while Ph.D is a good way to buy some more years, it would often entail weeks of 80-100 hours of work on a measly $20,000/year stipend; a good way to burn through my twenties while everyone else moves up their career.   
.  
Why am I this obsessed about staying in the U.S. for as long as possible? Because I want to **live as long as possible**. When leaving my country and entering the U.S., I felt a degree of freedom and liberty hitherto unknown to me; it is not perfect, but it's a long sight better than what I have at home.  This, this is my only chance to breathe in an atmosphere that is this free and refreshing.   
.  
But the prospect of being forced to return home looms over my head. I know the student visa is only supposed to be temporary. I know all these years will come to an end, and I will have to make my choices. My life is on life support, running on borrowed time in a foreign land, and **this is the only time in my life I have ever felt alive**. I do not want it to end, but I know full well it will.   
.  
And that's when my brain hatched the brilliant idea that **I should die before being forced out of the U.S.**  
.  
Because, you see, no matter how oppressive or authoritarian a regime might be, it holds no power over a dead man.  
No matter how suffocating its atmosphere becomes, a dead man draws no breaths.   
And no matter how painful its tortures and reeducation can be, a dead man shall not mind.   
.  
In death, I shall obtain a form of invulnerability over any and all attempts of governance and oppression.  
.  
And in dying on American soil, I shall die free.   
.  
And so came my long streaks of fantasizing about my own deaths, sometimes even hatching half-baked suicide schemes with low probability of success and high risks of debilitating injuries (which is about the opposite of what I want). It still scares me how I could speculate on the force of a large body of water, the angle of my fall, the impact on my neck, the hypothermia in the freezing water of the river, the possible strength of the rope, all as if I was solving a very technical problem.   
.  
Still, I know people are hard-wired to not kill themselves easily, and I will probably screw up and get myself hurt in an irreversible manner. Couldn't live properly, and couldn't suicide properly, literally the worst of both worlds. **I have not attempted anything, and do not have any plan to attempt anything**.   
.  
But the fantasies remain. Fantasies about ways I could get myself killed before being forced to depart the U.S. They range from physically and logistically possible scenarios to situations so wild and literally out-of-this-world. One day, I would be strolling the downtown streets and meet my end when a robber pulls a gun on me. Another night, I would summon up my own characters in a fictional story I work on as a hobby, only to have them use their magical and fantastical abilities to end my existence in the most surefire way possible. I do my best to starve off those thoughts, to move my mind back to reality. But then, when reality sucks just a bit too much, my brain will go ""wouldn't that be nice if-"" and the relapse train plunges down the rabbit hole. I would long for poisons, stab wounds, bullet shots, anything and everything that would put an end to my existence when I want it.  
.  
With the recent prospect of forced departure from the U.S. for international students (even those already physically present in the U.S. and should definitely stay put during a pandemic), my episodes have gotten even worse and more aggressive. It does not help that I definitely do not have an internship or anything similar going on, and the extra free time means lots of opportunity to relapse.   
.  
**And it has gotten to the point where it sometimes reignites my desire to take matter into my own hands and just jump into the river the day of the deportation order**.  
.  
I have attempted to talk to my family over this. To their credit, they do care a lot, and it shows, and I know it. However, they do not know how to help. All they could do is reciting how fortunate I was to even have an opportunity to study in America, saying they have done all they could to give me such an opportunity, insisting that I should be positive and live on. You know, all the generic lines that people mistake for actual support. I don't think the average person is equipped to deal with depression, and it shows. I have decided to put on a front of optimism rather than continue talking to them about it. They are not helping me. If anything, they made the situation worse by what they said.   
.  
**And after all this, still, all I want is to live**."

I recently graduated as an mechanical engineer from a big engineering university in the mid west and am moving back home to California to find a job as an mechanical engineer but am worried my past will make it next to impossible to succeed. A little background... while in college i made dumb mistakes and hung around people that only cared about partying. I graduated with good internships, and grades but in my partying I received a dui which was eventually brought down to a “wet reckless” or a reckless driving misdemeanor. A couple months later I received a another misdemeanor for disobeying the orders of a police officer. I am embarrassed Just saying it.  As bad as the situation was, it’s made me a better person and changed my lifestyle for the better. Nonetheless, I constantly worry that the mistake I made will affect me my whole life.

I researched heavily into this and the more I research the more hopeless I am so I turn to you, in your experience how badly have I ruined my chances of working as an engineer? My dream was to work in the aerospace industry and i know I have ruined any chance of getting a security clearance or to work for a defense contractor. If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has any insight on the hiring process when misdemeanors are involved, I would love to hear it."
hnyvlk,1,2020-07-09,I'm just a fortunate human being with everything yet I have no goals or motivation to do something in life.,Thelostmind912,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hnyvlk/im_just_a_fortunate_human_being_with_everything/,"# Here's a quick few facts about me :

1. ***I am 22 years old (female) and I live with my mom and dad. I am the only child they have.***
2. ***I  am from India, but I have lived in the UAE ever since I was two.***
3. ***I started university a little later than most people my age. I always regret that.***
4. ***I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in media and communication. I am in my final year now and this time next year I will graduate.***
5. ***My parents have a business that I have no interest or passion to help with. I have my own personal ambitions but my parents believe that these aren't enough to live the life I do currently.***
6. ***I am still trying to figure out what I would love to do for a living. I have some idea and I'm working towards it but my parents don't see it as being enough to live a self-sufficient life.*** 

The issue is my parents don't believe in me. When I leave home, my friends believe that I'm so fortunate, I have almost everything I ask for while their lives are actually hard. I'm constantly arguing with my parents because they force me to enter their business. When we go out on family gatherings, they always bring up the fact that they are worried about where I will get in life because I sit home some days and I don't do much but I know that this is temporary and at some point, I will find what I love to do and make a living.

Mom is always ashamed of my achievements, rather than praising me for my good performance in academics, they are only concerned about the fact that currently, I'm not independent. I don't do many things by myself and they constantly tell me today you're at your own house but when you're married, what will you do? How will you survive?

Currently, I have finished my second year about to go into my final year and I have some free time but I recently lost my best friend to suicide, I've been through some sort of a really traumatising experience with friends and I want time to process everything and then begin thinking about work. My parents don't seem to understand this and every time I ask them to give me time, they instead taunt me on how I am not responsible and one day all the luxury I have will go away if I choose to just sit at home this way.

I do have some goals for myself and slowly but steadily I am working towards them. My passion lies in languages and communication. I initially started to give home tuitions for French and make money that way. During this time, my parents were happy and did not coax me towards joining their business but deep down they have an expectation for me to join and help them at work. Due to the pandemic, these lessons I gave have stopped and now I am just home doing nothing according to them other than the required studies.

Here are things I would like to do

* I love to write, I want to work in this field
* I would love to get my work published but I don't know how to.
* I want to work for the United Nations as a translator- I speak French, English
* I want to teach/ do something relating to communication/writing

That's all I know are my strengths and I definitely want to do something that links these things but I don't have a specific job/internship in mind.

I have worked and had experienced in the past. I have done two internships one linked to social media marketing and copywriting and another linked to events management for a month and also a short two-week work experience at a content writing firm alongside teaching primary students at my home.

I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree of arts in media and communication. As far as my passion for languages. I have finished my French fluency exams by the Alliance Francaise the DELF B2, I'm working towards the C1 level. I will write it this year. I just feel like with enough academic commitments, getting a job or working won't help me perform well in college instead, it will just make my life more difficult but my parents don't understand that. How do I explain to them my situation?

Some days are lazy, I do study but I don't have the drive to work especially when my parents taunt me and forcefully try to take me to their workplace. Its a family business so, therefore, the expectation. I get it but they don't see my side of the story. All they are concerned about is how I have to become independent and financially self-sufficient.

I want my parents to be proud of me but I don't know-how. I have tried to go and interfere with the family business but unfortunately, it does not interest me much, because I would rather do what inspires me or what I am passionate about than just help them but they fail to understand that.

My parents think that all of what I have done is not enough. How do I get them to not force me into their business? I have gone there but it's not my field of interest but they see it as me pushing myself away from important responsibilities?  How do I make them confident of who I am?

They constantly compare me to other young adults my age who help their parents or are either working or doing something by themselves. This has really brought me down and is half the reason why I don't choose to do anything much with life. I want to achieve my goals but if people constantly compare my progress journey to their own, it gets toxic and I don't feel like working at all.

I agree, I also lose interest in things quickly, as in I would not know in how long am I bored of doing a particular job. I 'll do it for a while and then just get back to procrastinating every day.

I know what they say is for my benefit in the long term but I wish they understood that I need time to find what I like to do as well. I'm still soul searching. I'm still trying to find something that I'm most passionate about that I can do for a living but they don't see this as being important.

In my eyes, if I am currently studying and pursuing my bachelor's degree, I shouldn't have the pressure to work simultaneously. I feel as if I can do only one thing at a time but they see that as a weakness.  I promised them that once my degree gets over I will work and do something to earn and feed myself at least but they just focus on how at this moment, I am not doing anything productive. According to them, I'm lazy, demotivated and not yet self-independent.

***I know this is contrary to most people who by 22 find and create a career for themselves but is it wrong to take time to find yourself?***

***How do I manage this situation and build their trust in the fact that one day sooner or later I will be earning and feeding myself and them too?***

***How do I start working and doing something without having enough experience in the field of writing?***"
hnzn63,1,2020-07-09,What do you think about my master program in Data science ?,Cloud_98,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/hnzn63/what_do_you_think_about_my_master_program_in_data/,"Hi everybody, I'm an Italian guy and the next year I'm going to apply for my master. After thinking about it for a while, I decided I want to get into data science. At the moment I'm doing my bachelor in Mathematics. Anyway, my university offers this master which goes by the name of ""mathematics for data science"". I want you to tell me what you think about the program. Here's the courses list with brief description in case it's not clear what the course is about. Sorry if the description is not super clear by I haven't studied the subjects so I don't know neither 😅 -Stochastic processes: gaussian processes, stationary processes and markov processes, martingale -Linear models: statistics, in particular generalized linear models and likelihood functions -advanced statistical methods: analysis of asymptotic estimators. Lot of R. -bayesian statistics: the foundation of the theory itself and its laboratorial part using R (Monte Carlo methods, gibson samples, Hastings metropolis...). -Time series: ARMA models ecc.... R again. -Scientific computing: basically an advanced numerical analysis course with a lot emphasis on linear algebra and pde using MATLAB -Mathematical biology: ok this should be a course in which you study mathematical models of natural phenomena (such as epidemiology ecc...). Lots of pde's and matlab, again. -Topological data analysis: ok this is interesting. It should be something like applied algebraic topology (computational topology maybe?). -Tensor decomposition for big data analysis: ok really don't know what's going on here. Guess it's about advanced topics in linear algebra. The course description says there's also some software involved. -Data analysis and exploration: R again. This course is focuses on machine learning algorithms applied mainly in biological domain. It's also about data visualization ecc... -Scientific programming: algorithms(trees, graphs, ecc..)in Python. Basically an excuse to study Python properly. -Data mining: clustering ecc... -Machine learning -Deep leaning

I'm also thinking about doing an internship if I have the possibility.

As you see there's still a lot of math involved, as it's technically a master in mathematics. For me this is actually a good thing, since I don't want to waste my mathematical background. Do you think it can be good?"

What should I do?,raquin_,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/ho1gan/dont_think_i_will_be_retained_after_my_probation/,"Moved from a job in journalism that I didn’t enjoy to a very very fast paced communications job that is stressful but I quite like. My job is quite varied and I pretty much have never had any experience any of the job scope so I have had to learn everything from ground up. The opening was for a senior position but they gave it to me as an entry/junior position. I was elated to have it - the job scope and company seemed to be amazing learning opportunities

Thing is, my bosses have very high expectations that I don’t think I have been able to meet just due to sheer workload and quality. My work is not bad but not perfect - I am working on what I can improve (factual accuracies, liaising with different departments) but I feel that largely I need more time to really hit the nail on the head of the big boys on my job scope (ie drafting and leading large scale communications plans). 

And after having my two month review with my supervisor, who is aware that two months is not a very long period of time, it does not sound like they are willing to wait for me to learn and develop things to perfection. 

My probation is meant to be next month and as my title mentions, am unsure what to do next if they do not retain me, especially since it is Covid season and I was really really keen on this job. Part of me even feels shame that I can’t keep to these expectations when I’ve always been told in previous positions and internships I’ve been a fast and meticulous learner. 

Of course, I am planning to really step things up and even put in overtime hours and aim for perfection as much as I can but I really am wondering if I should start looking for another job in the mean time.

Would greatly appreciate any advice pertaining to being let go from a job you liked and how you worked and planned your career from there. Thank you in advance!"

I am currently an incoming senior in Computer Engineering, so I am beginning to gear up to find a job, or at least do the preliminary research and start applying as the new grad positions start to open up. My original plan before COVID was to only look in other places, such as Boston, Dallas/Houston, DC area, maybe Phoenix (I have lived in NC all of my life, and because I’m Jewish, I’m trying to look for a bigger community where I move.) Now, with COVID, I am beginning to reconsider these plans for several reasons. 

1. I am currently working at a company as an intern that seems to emphasize that as long as you do good work, you’ll get a full time offer, even with COVID. I also love what I’m doing here and think it would be a great first job if I was to get a full time offer. I am also potentially going to be working for them part time in the fall/spring if the situation allows. 

2. COVID has eliminated a lot of the job market for the time being, I know it will recover, but I’m not sure if it would be in enough time for me to secure a job in one of those locations by mid 2021. 

3. Even though I have had 5 internships, the bulk of the jobs I am seeing in these places have a couple of years experience in order to be considered, this makes my options potentially more limited unless internships would count towards those years of experience. 

4. I would want to make sure it would be safe for me to go out and make new friends, and I don’t know if I am being realistic with the timeframe anymore on when things will pick back up because of how badly the US is dealing with the pandemic.

I have a bachelors in Biomedical Informatics. When I first started school, I planned to go to PA school. With school and work and volunteering hours, I was just stressing myself out a lot and heard from others that,  it is tough to get in. I basically thought I don't have a chance and switched to get a   
degree in bioinformatics.  Once I got into Bioinformatics, its a completely different field and it changed my mindset.  During my senior year, I realized it's just so tough to get an internship too. That's when I realized,  I made a mistake and I lost myself. I graduated and applied to tons of jobs by but I couldn't find any. Its been a couple of years now and I have been working at a pharmacy as pharm tech and I am not happy and just very depressed and stressed. I applied to the master's program for Bioinformatics and I got a scholarship too but I am still very indecisive. I still kind of want to go to PA school but I probably have to take a few classes and boost my GPA as well. I am in my late 20s and I am not at all happy with where I am in my life. 

I am trying to weigh the pros and cons in terms of PA and Bioinformatics. PA school is two and half years once I get in and Bioinformatics, I will be able to finish it by end of next year if things go well. I am not able to decide and just have been procrastinating and making myself miserable. 

Can anybody help me figure out what will be the optimal decision? THANK YOU."

I have to get a job soon, and with COVID’s affect on the job market I’ve realized I need to set aside my goal of working as a developer, and start applying to non-developer positions. That’s not what I want longterm, so I really want to make sure I’m setting myself up as best as I can to transition later on.

With that in mind, I have two questions: 

1. What non-developer positions set you up best to transition into a developer role?
2. How do you build a competitive developer resume while working in a non-developer role?

On top of that my regular gpa is good too. The thing is I have rarely attended professor office hours. I really have no one to ask for letters of recommendation. I think I have two really good letters of rec that two of my high school teachers wrote me I could use, but I am sure those would have no weight right? I have had a bunch of jobs but I don't think my bosses recs would hold much weight either, but that leads me to my other problem: I haven't had any CS internships to get a letter of rec from.

I've heard things from different people where if you got an A+ in their class you could maybe get that professor to write you a recommendation which I have a chance for with Niema Moshiri (CS professor), or if you have As in two different classes with same professor which I could maybe try with Byran Chin. Will I get laughed at if I try to send them an email or has anyone tried this with these or different professors? I am taking summer classes and attending all professor office hours now in hopes to get a letter of rec from somewhere, but since I need 3 of them and I am trying not to use my high school teacher's letters I need all the advice I can get. 

As an added question I did plan on graduating early so I was going to apply for BS/MS slot for those graduating early that has a December deadline. Is there any info on which pool of applicants is larger, the early graduation pool or the regular graduation pool?

The problem is that my family will have to pay for my fees (which will be much higher than usual) and for personal reasons, I do not want them to take care of me financially for another year.

I started with data science around 2 and a half years ago in my first year of bachelor's because I really liked data handing at the time. I loved working with messy data and I loved the feeling when I successfully visualised something. Then I learnt about Kaggle and to this day, I always do projects or analysis from there. I've even been able to build a small community of kagglers who support and lift each other.

With all that, I started applying for internships. I'd get rejected initially but I though that that's just part of the journey. I did get a lot of internships and have been able to meet a lot of people. I further moved to domains like machine learning and artificial intelligence and I've been able to get some research papers published as well. I see here, that recruiters love the candidates that can talk to non-tech people and explain their approach and results. I feel like I can do that, I love to write everything that I do as if I were explaining it to a 5 year old. I've also had the opportunity to work with researchers from all around the world.

Yet, I feel like I am not good at interviews and screenings. Or am I just aiming too high? After 2 and a half years dedicated to this field, I often get flustered with screening tasks, I am unable to help people with their doubts, it takes me ages to understand code etc. Most of the internships I have got are through connections and networking on linkedin. I just feel like I have been faking it. I'm not bragging but I have a really nice resume with good internships, good projects, research papers, but I feel like that's just a show because I really don't know stuff. Am I overreacting? Do you guys feel this? Did I choose a wrong career path? I'd rather know now when I'm 21 than later in life where changing careers might be impossible for me.

The interview was for an internship role that aligned pretty well with my background and career goals, and it honestly went really well. The conversation felt very natural, and the company seems like a great place to work with lots of opportunity to grow my career. I can see myself staying at this company for a good portion of my career. My only concern is that the interviewer recommended I apply for other roles as well that are full time associate roles more aligned with my background, but because of the required years of experience I’m not sure I’d genuinely be considered especially since it would be a different hiring manager than whom I spoke with. I’m worried in the end I’ll be overlooked for both roles. I have a bachelors degree in a related field and ~1 yr experience, recommended positions call for 3-6 or 5+ years experience on top of education.

I know I should be elated that I finally got an interview and that it went well. I just can’t help but have this gut feeling that it still won’t work out. I’ve already submitted my applications for each role and followed up with the person I interviewed with to both thank them and let them know I submitted my application for the  recommended roles.

TLDR; interview went great, was recommended to apply to other higher level roles but am worried I will be overlooked due to lack of years in experience and a different hiring manager handling those positions"

I've always been someone who has put aside other things so I can work hard on my curriculum, but I fell flat on the internship side of things.

I had a job as a researcher at my college, and did some somewhat programming oriented mechanical engineering research, but I never picked up an internship.

Having gotten on the bus late, I started searching for a job in my last semester and had no luck - I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I felt like since I was such a good student that a good career would naturally follow.

As it turned out, I had no good sense of how to apply for jobs and spent a lot of time learning what to do and what not to do. Three months out of college and getting a little desperate, I finally got a position at a consulting engineering company as a Plumbing &amp; Fire Protection designer.

I'm about two years into this position, and to say the least I'm unsatisfied. The pay is pretty bad considering my location (NYC), and I don't feel like I'm engineering at all. I feel like a building standards glossary who manages my boss's overload of work - and while I've excelled in my work and surpassed expectations, I'm just not happy with this career.

I have always had a strong passion for computer science, however, it's why I pursued a degree in it. I love programming, debugging, and using my intuition to solve difficult problems. I've used programming to facilitate my work all the time, in college, even now to some degree. However lately, I've been really struggling with the fact that I feel inadequate from a hire-ability standpoint.

I haven't been preparing for a career in software engineering at all. My job experience will tell of no programming familiarity (though I do try to introduce my experience through my cover letter). I don't have a GitHub with any projects in it. I don't have access to any of my projects from college.

So this is just an open plea for any advice or stories people have to tell about being in a similar situation - or even just vaguely similar. I really do appreciate any advice at all, I've just started applying this past month after getting restless with my current job, and I want to know if I really need material to show-off that I can program first.

Other questions:

* When they say ""X"" years experience with Python, do they mean professional experience or general experience?

* It seems a lot of entry-level jobs are geared towards mid-level employees. I should obviously apply anyway, but am I under-experienced even for an entry-level job?

* How has your experience?

Thanks in advance!"
hodq41,1,2020-07-09,Engineering Career Advice in Med Devices?,dklosterman10,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hodq41/engineering_career_advice_in_med_devices/,"Hello all, first post to this sub. I am a 2020 graduate, bachelor of science in Biomedical Engineering from a state school in Ohio. I have had  a long and arduous schooling journey, from practically failing out of one college, to turning it around and graduating with a decent GPA at another. But the icing on my educational cake has been layed on with the COVID crisis. 

To start, I want to say that in my area of Ohio, the medical industry outlook has been seemingly slim to begin with, but i knew it was the path I wanted to take so I trudged along. Internal debate about my career path ensues and I have much self doubt about career outlook all throughout schooling. So  here I am, graduated, degree in hand, and am seriously struggling to find where my dream job is. I can't realistically say this was all that surprising given the lack of attention at our Engineering career fairs to the Medical Industry.. but its still been disappointing to see just how tough it has been to find my niche.

That is why I would like to reach out and see stories hopefully of similar experiences, or perhaps advice on which avenues to stear towards, good industries and companies to look out for, and just generally finding the company culture i so greatly desire. Open to suggestions on where to relocate, where to apply myself etc.. i am locked into ohio for at least a year. But after which the world is my oyster (I suppose).

Following is a rant on my current situation and a little more contextual background...

I have (1) year worth of experience in the Medical Devices Industry from a couple different Co-Op experiences. My first company was great. They had an amazing company culture, I learned a great deal about what exactly it means to be a med device company (think ISO:13485, IEC 60601, etc. ). I gained experience specifically in a Quality Engineering role, and therefore have began to gear myself towards that industry (think: resume speaks to this field particularly). I had a good boss and a decent boss, and generally felt like I knew what I was doing, who I could go to for help, and was appropriately challenged and evaluated...

Fast forward to now when I have graduated (May 2020). I started a part-time intern position in February with a med device company near where I live with the hopes of getting every ounce of experience I can before graduation. I was hired on with loose terms (meaning no actual end date) and was given word that I would be re-evaluated upon graduation. So I begin my role and have a mentor and boss in the Quality field (great, this is the experience I need). But things quickly begin to unfold. I work in a fast-paced building and every ounce of my training was performed (on the job) by my mentor in the 3 hours time before he left for lunch at 11:00 AM. This left little effective time for training, and he was often swamped in the mornings. Come to found out, he was not the happiest employee and after 12 years of working at this company he left 3 months into my being there. This leaves me thinking oh man whats going to happen with me and who will replace him? Well the answer is nothing happens.. i continue on and apparently he has not been replaced. 

So the issues I have with this company are plentiful.. my training has been practically non-existent. I started my role as an intern and had no expectations layed out, no real chance to express my experiences and talents, no feedback from my boss, the list goes on. I fumble through my role in Quality, and take every chance I get to learn along the way. Ive reached out to a great deal of people for learning opportunities, and have done my best to understand what goes on and why and what I do in my role. But it all boils back down to my boss. He is involved in practically everything, and because of that has no time for anything. My work is divulged in a matter of seconds, emails are one sentence responses, I often have zero context of my next project, and have gotten ZERO feedback on any of my work. I have reached out to HR about concerns but have gotten radio silence until a third email sent out 1.5 months after the first, and FINALLY a phone call.

But.. the response I get is one of seemingly more annoyance than anything and any feedback I so greatly desire is boiled into one phrase... ""we have gotten feedback about retention of information issues from multiple sources."" Ive gotten no chance to defend myself, and not to mention.. THIS STATEMENT IS ABSURD! If they would even take a moment to put themselves in my shoes and realize HOW the information is passed on, then there would be no shadow of a doubt that this is THEIR OWN FAULT!

So all rambling aside and frustration aside, I am genuinely seeking advice and other's experience. This company seems to be milking me as an intern and paying me as such to perform essentially the same role as my mentor.. i also find it strange that the company can afford to be without a quality engineer in our building, or (somehow) find it unimportant? That decision is beyond me... one other important thing I notice is the culture.. NO ONE WANTS TO BE THERE.. but at the same time, the turnover isn't THAT BAD? We have guys in our lab that have been there 30+ yrs. 

So am I just the young buck who is so naive to think that I am passionate about my work and just want to put in a good days work and be proud of what I do? But at the same time, how much do I want to invest into a company that sees no investment in me. Is this wrong to think? I thought it was a two-way street where I put in the work and effort and the company will provide me with the resources to succeed and be the best I can. But has just not been the case.

If the corporate culture is this way through and through, than i ought to just quit before i even start. Was so hoping to have found myself with a proper company and career outlook, but here I am COVID-HIT, mildly depressed, and VERY frustrated.

tldr; medical devices Quality Engineer has a tough time finding a job. Is searching for career advice, personal experiences, and advice about corporate culture and office environment toxicity."

I am stressed and don't know what to do.,Careful_Apple6156,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hofwjo/currently_interning_at_software_startup_i_am/,"I have no real world programming experience. Just a bachelors in CS.

I had been working at a big Indian consulting company for 6 months for my first job. They trained me in full stack development.  After not finding any software clients, they said if I don't accept a position as support I will be terminated. I didn't want to do support work so I looked for a new job and found an internship at a startup.

By the luck of the draw, this startup asked a bunch of questions that I happened to know and some programming questions that were fresh off of a previous interview. I aced the interview and they offered an internship that paid a lot higher than the amount originally advertised. It is  also a remote job.

There are so many new tools that I didn't even put on my resume and the code base which has no comments. I have been willing to spend all hours of the day to learn the tech stack on my own and to look through the code but it is still not enough.

He was surprised when I said I hadn't started coding by the third working day  which means I was suppose to be working  over the 4th of july weekend to be able to do that. While I am okay with that since it is a great learning experience, it is still not enough for the deadlines that are looming. I asked for more time to get used to the codebase but he acted very surprise during the daily standup which was quite embarrassing for me.

It is a remote job, and an international team by the way. So there are language barriers when asking for help. The CEO is my main person of contact, but when I ask a question he answer in a way that makes me use skills that I don't have. I think he thinks I am a lot more competent than I am.

I am honestly a nervous wreck at this point. I feel like the expectation is way too high for an intern. I am already suppose to know about NoSQL databases, docker, OAuth, JIRA, their Github pipeline, and reading their Confluence within a week. None of this was introduced, it is just expected for me to know by reading the Confluence, which 1/4 of is in a foreign language. I  am trying to understand the codebase to start coding but I simply need more time to absorb everything.

I have been reading and working for the last 8 days nonstop and still don't know how to start or how to work around the code.  Just as an example of the expectations set, he had me do a 10pm onboarding meeting with another new hire from across the world.

It's one thing to ask if I am willing to work this hard to gain some experience. I don't mind the hard work. But no matter how hard I work, I am not competent enough to keep up with the pace that is being set.

What should I do? It's only been a week.

edit:
By the way, I just wanted to know from your experiences. Are most startup internships this stressful? What about entry level positions. Is it expected to start making code contribution by the first week at an internship? How long is the usual ramp up period?"

I’m basically scrapping my old resume and creating a brand new one. I’m a recent college grad, employed in my first “real” job for about a year now. Fortunately, it happens to be related to what I went to school for (Marketing). I’m happy there, but my wife sent me this blog post from a local marketing agency basically saying that they’re growing and always looking for new talent, and with the current job market being the way it is, I figured “Eh, I’ll send ‘em my resume, tell them I’m not in a hurry to leave my current job, ask them to keep me in mind for future opportunities, and see what they say.” 

I’m currently trying to figure out what to put in the second job slot on my resume. I paid for about half of my college education on my own, and I had to hustle in college to make ends meet. Therefore, I have lots of work experience; It just all happens to be outside of marketing. I never had an internship or anything like that; I wasn’t offered a paid internship, and I couldn’t afford to work for free. I worked as a Resident Assistant in the dorms for about two years (2016-2018), then moved out of the dorms because I wanted to experience apartment life and have a little more freedom in my senior year (2019). In order to cover my living expenses in the apartment, I worked as a bouncer in a local bar during the school year - less than a full calendar year. So here’s my question: Do I put the RA job on my resume, which I lasted longer at and I think would be more impressive to a recruiter, or do I put the bouncer job on my resume since it’s more recent and will fill in the gap in my employment history?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. I will of course post the finished product here for review once it is completed. 

Thank you!"

Over the past three months I've picked up and reached an intermediate level at three new programming languages(had good grasp of OOP before all this), gotten better at Java which was my first language and now familiarized myself with Git and starting to put my pet projects  on my GitHub too. 

I'm doing DS and Algorithms course along with a MATLAB programming course right now and I find myself putting really unhealthy pressure upon myself to do my best all of the time. I punish myself and treat myself really poorly when I don't get an expected mark or don't get as much done and things of that nature.


It's summer and I see people my age enjoying life while I just wake up everyday and study and work on my portfolio stressing out about my grades and not knowing enough and then beating myself over my mistakes. Is this really how it's supposed to be? I just don't feel human anymore. Then again I feel if I stop doing all these things, I will never make it in the tech industry so I don't know how to find that balance and I wish I knew how things work out in the end.

Deep down I just have this fear of not getting a job and not being good enough and not even getting an interview so I have just been stressing myself with pushing myself a lot and even though it's gotten me to a much better place skills wise than I was two months ago, am I taking things way too seriously? Am I putting too much pressure on myself? 

I wish I could just know if things work out towards the end :("
hoiqg3,8,2020-07-10,[Intern] Advice on Improvement in Interpersonal Skills,tldrthestoryofmylife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hoiqg3/intern_advice_on_improvement_in_interpersonal/,"Doing a remote internship. Some context about my situation:

Generally speaking, I'm a pretty strong programmer. To clarify, this isn't my ego talking; I've received this feedback from my immediate manager and others on my team. With that said, I've run into some difficulties in communication and interpersonal skills (ranked in order of priority):

Difficulty #1:

There's another intern on my team who, while definitely very smart, doesn't seem to move as quickly as I do in understanding the technical or business context of our product. They ask some questions in standup that I'd consider to be trivial and need a bit more help on the technical stuff in some areas than I would. Mind you, I have no insight about their actual performance -- that's between them and their manager, of course -- so I have very limited authority to say this.

I like to solve technical problems and give people the window to rely on my help, so I once posted \[in a rather long post\] about some info about a technical subject and gave her context info that was, while technically correct, only tangentially relevant to the task and, not to mention, something that you'd learn in an OS class at college.

The other intern in question, subsequently, reached out on video chat to say that she'd prefer it if we both just focus on our own work, because she had felt there were times when I was derailing her work in some ways. I understood to some extent what she was referring to, so I profusely apologized and that I'd be happy stay out of it if that's what she feels is best. She was really nice about it too, assuring me that she knows that I'm coming from a good place and offering help in anything I need.

Since then, I haven't really gotten involved in any of her tickets. I mostly just keep to myself except for a few select people to send memes to and talk politics with on the team.

Difficulty #2:

In code review, a senior engineer suggested a different testing setup than what I'd had. I was perfectly on board, but I first asked ""Even though I'm 100% OK with this change, are you sure we won't need this in the future?"" To this, they referred to ""YAGNI"", which makes sense in this context.

On top of that, I tried to implement what they said, but botched it by still not fully understanding the change requested. The second time I submitted it for review, the reviewer directly said ""This is only part of what I recommended -- you should read the part where it says ...""

At this point, I knew that I had fucked up, so I messaged him to apologize for making him repeat himself and did my best to explain myself. I assured him that this would no longer be a problem in the future, to which he responded very kindly.

Difficulty #3:

I generally err towards a pretty fast tempo of speech, especially when I get excited about a subject. I do my best to be coherent, but I sometimes go at it a bit too fast in meetings.

In my attempts to fix this, I make a conscious effort to keep track of my tempo and slow down when I'm still constructing what I'm about to say, and I also end some things with ""Does what I'm saying make sense?"" or ""Do you understand what I'm asking?""

.............................................................................................................................................................................

With that said, I had a meeting with my team lead today. He told me quite frankly that, despite my technical proficiency (which is, as he describes, ""table stakes"" for working at the company), I have a lot of room for improvement w.r.t. my communication skills. He explained that, specifically in (1), the post I made was liable to derail the conversation, not to mention also liable to come across as condescending, since the context I provided should already be clear.

I'd known that this was a problem from my side for some time, so I was eager to receive his feedback and ask him for tips on moving forward. He gave me some great points to think about moving forward, and then I expressed my plan to implement exactly what he said in my work for the next week or two before circling back with him on how it's going. He was very impressed with my eagerness to feedback and dedication to professional growth, and we left the conversation on a good note.

Some questions:

1. Is it common for interns and new grads to have problems with the interpersonal and communication-related aspect of things?
2. Has anyone ever themselves had or have worked with an engineer who had a similar problem? Are there any tips for growth that come from this?
3. My intern manager, team manager, and coworkers have been nothing but extraordinarily supportive since the moment I've gotten here. They're clearly putting a lot of effort into me, and I really don't want to let them down. How can I best express how grateful I am for this and give them the impression that this effort isn't wasted on me?"

As I was brainstorming for the PIQs I noticed that the things I'd written for question 6, ""Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom."" and question 7, ""What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?"" were both similar.

For question 6 I planned to write about my interest in computer science, backing this up by showing the various projects I'd created, the clubs I'd joined, and the courses I'd taken on my own time.

However, some of these projects I also mentioned in my brainstorming for question 7. The majority of my projects have had something to do with helping high school students in academics or their careers. For example a website I'm working on currently helps consolidate workshops, internships, and volunteer opportunities for high school students into one website.

I'd planned to focus on the technical things I'd learned in question 6, while also mentioning how I motivated myself to do them. In question 7, I'd focus more on how the things I made help my community, in this case other high schoolers like me, and also how I came up with the ideas. In addition I'd also mention things like the volunteer work I've done

Is it ok to mention some of the same projects/accomplishments in separate prompts? I read in multiple websites that I should not be repeating accomplishments.

Thanks in advance."

hojwyj,6,2020-07-10,Alluding to home/family issues throughout college to explain grades.,jasmineandmagnolia,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/hojwyj/alluding_to_homefamily_issues_throughout_college/,"Note: this is going to get personal and long.

I commute to college 4 hours a day by train everyday. When I come home, my family practically screams nonstop at each other for dumb, pointless reasons (let's just say we all hate each other's guts, even though I don't voice it out loud). I have to wait for them to sleep before I can even dream or doing schoolwork or studying effectively, in the hours before 10 pm approximately, noise pollution kills me internally as I try to plunge into engineering. If I am lucky, I will hit the silent times of night as early as 10:30 pm before I can actually get shit done. What that leaves me is less than 6-7 hours to do what I need for school well and sleep before I wake up for the next day.

When I did this routine for the first two years of college, I did it fairly well. I got grades good enough to pursue what I want (internships, research, and scholarships), and I managed to put on a sane personality in front of my friends, peers, and professors at college as an overachieving (lol) student. I was grateful for my success, and for the times I cried out of how difficult it actually was, I didn't complain because that gave me success.

Junior year comes, and I realized that I couldn't nor did I want to be such a robot anymore. I argued a lot more with my family after putting down my calm, peaceful facade, broke down a lot mentally and emotionally because of having to balance more difficult (but not impossible) classes and my issues at home that directly impedes my studies. My fall semester GPA was a 0.6 difference to my cumulative GPA at the time, which dropped it to approximately 3.7. While it's still a great GPA objectively speaking, that 'gap' is very obvious on my record. COVID-19 made things a lot worse too, as I faced my home issues more frequently at home, and I ended up failing 2 classes. (I made up for one of them and got a B+ this summer, and I plan on retaking it next spring.) Because of my college's pass/fail system, my GPA stayed the same which made me realize that this metric is nothing more than a joke in my case.

These issues began even before COVID-19, but was exarcerbated by it when I originally planned to hide them all. None of my professors know about my specific home/family issues as they are in fact personal, and I originally intended to keep it that way. But now I'm wondering if I should mention them at least a little bit to those I plan on asking to write me LORs, but that could be seen as a sign of weakness or unprofessional. The bigger implications is when I apply for PhD programs this fall and future scholarships, fellowships, and other academic/research opportunities.

I know that these issues aren't related to disability or a coronavirus death, but to me, they are very legit and real. I just can't tell if anyone else will see it that way though. Frankly speaking, it isn't cool to admit that during exams, I hear my mother's voice telling me, as she does on a regular basis, that I am not smart or talented enough to do engineering, among other things she and my family has said regarding my studies.

Any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated, especially from anyone who relates the sloghtest bit to these struggles. :)"

interns working on MSRMC bangalore are on the frontline treating COVID patients and risking their lives but the college administration is treating them horribly
 
1)They are being forced to buy PPE with their own money.

2)Protesting interns are being indirectly threatened by saying that construction work is gonna start where they are protesting and they might get injured

3)No attendance or stipend(which is a measly 2000 PER MONTH)given for the duration they quarantine for.

4)The Principal Medha Rao is refusing to even MEET them face to face to discuss their problems as theyve been exposed to COVID patients.She is using a speaker to communicate with them so that She isnt at risk.

5)The administration is calling the lack of PPE a ‘silly demand’ and are basically telling the interns that theyre ‘failing their duties as doctors’.All this while the consultants and professors sit on their asses and put all the work on interns.

The only thing the administration cares about is PR so Its my humble request to y’all to spread this message further."

hon91z,0,2020-07-10,Should I leave my $140k/year corporate job at 27 to build my growing side hustles? My thoughts and journey to what led me here.,justincorporated,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/hon91z/should_i_leave_my_140kyear_corporate_job_at_27_to/,"For those of you running your own companies full-time, I'm sure you can think back to that day when you finally made the decision to go all-in. Somewhere deep down, you had a burning passion that was telling you to *just do it*, regardless of how many of your loved ones told you you're crazy.

Rather than your name ending up as a single line on a ""Happy 40th Work Anniversary"" slide of a PowerPoint deck, that's likely forgotten in the next hour by everyone who saw it, you knew you were destined to build something of your own.

For me, that day has finally come. I'm ready to give up my $140k/year salaried corporate job to risk it all in finally follow my dream of achieving freedom from corporate America. If you want to learn what led me here and where I'm stuck, it's a bit of a read, but I'm pretty excited to share it with you.

*Note: I'll admit I'm* ***very*** *grateful to even have the opportunity to make this decision right now, especially given the current amount of unemployment due to COVID. I'm very fortunate to still have a job and I realize there are many people out there struggling right now to even get the most basic employment.*

# A Little Context

Don't get me wrong, I've always had my ""side hustles."" I came from a lower-middle-class family with divorced parents, so I knew if I wanted to build any degree of wealth, I'd have to create it myself. If I wanted to go to college, I'd have to pay for it myself. New car? Better start saving.

In high school, I launched a beef jerky company, a car audio installation company, a grow box company for growing ""tomatoes"" (this was back in 2010) inside gaming PC towers, and did freelance videography as a way to start saving for college. However, I was fortunate enough to get admitted to the top university in my state, with an *almost* full ride, so I figured why not try that route before going full-time as an entrepreneur.

My dad (who had his own construction company) insisted college was a waste, but since I was paying for it myself, he didn't have much of a say.

# The Path to Corporate

From there, my ventures took a bit of a pause while I got my degree in finance, did an internship with Amazon, and landed my ""dream job"" (so I thought) working in consulting at a top firm. I figured helping Fortune 500 companies grow was as close as I could get to entrepreneurship, but after three years of traveling *every single week* to clients across the world, even that proved to be just a paycheck.

I made the decision to leave consulting to work in-house at a large corporation in my city so that I could focus more on spending more time with my girlfriend and dog, seeing friends, and growing my side hustles. At the time, these included a drone media company and freelance videography -- both of which I was super passionate about.

Now 27 years old, this new gig had me bringing me close to **$140k a year after our annual bonus**, as my consulting experience brought me in at a post-MBA level, without having an actual MBA. Again, I am ***very*** grateful for this and realize it's not the norm for most people my age, at least outside of the investment banking world.  Technically, combined with my side income, this put me near the top 1% of earners under 31, [according to Financial Samurai](https://swiy.io/1VJe).

At first, the work was awesome. I developed the strategy for launching the organization's startup initiatives, got to work with top venture capitalists, and found ways to tie in my passion for entrepreneurship every chance I got. I was still tied to golden handcuffs, but I couldn't see them yet.

# The Turning Point

Fast forward a year, however, and half my team was suddenly laid off as digital strategy was centralized under another division. On a new team with no clear role, I was now working *very* few hours a week on actual work, and my brain was feeling completely underutilized. I knew my time was ticking here, but I figured why not build up a little safety net first.

For every month I worked, I was able to add a full month's worth of incremental living expenses to my savings (roughly $2400), in addition to my 10% retirement contributions. Even though I dreaded the overarching stress of having to deal with corporate politics and bureaucracy, it was pretty chill. I won't self incriminate myself here, but the work was fairly passive compared to my consulting days. Fast forward to COVID hitting the world, plus everyone working from home, and it became even more so.

# The Rise of the Side Hustles

Not that I'd *ever* work on my side hustles during the day when I was hammering away at work from home, but suddenly, things were starting to gain some serious momentum. Come January 2020, I'd made the decision to turn my freelance video gig into a full-fledged digital agency, combining my knowledge of creative, strategy consulting, and marketing into something much bigger than myself.

This post is by no means a promo for my agency, so I'll spare the name of it for now.

There were agencies that did paid social, others that did video production, and consulting firms that did strategy -- but few that did all three, and did them well.

I asked a buddy of mine if he'd be interested in being a contractor to help with the paid social (i.e., Facebook ads), given there's a *still* huge market for that and he'd recently left his job doing it for one of the top agencies in the world. I leveraged my freelance video network to build our creative arm out with top talent, and suddenly, we had a *real* team.

Fast forward three months to now, and I've managed to land three *large* e-commerce clients on retainer, bringing in around **$12-15k in monthly recurring revenue** (on 3-6 month contracts), in addition to some sporadic fixed-fee video work (**additional $3-4k each month**).

After paying out contractors and monthly expenses, I've been able to **net around $5k each month** (before tax), though I plan to only take out what I need to cover my living expenses and private health insurance ($2.5k/month).

Recently, we also launched a paid newsletter that features a hand-picked collection of the best e-commerce video ads and strategies we've seen each month. In the first week, we've already signed up 40 people at $29/month, so we're hoping this becomes a reliable (and passive) income stream as well.

As we continue to land new clients, the profit should rise exponentially -- not counting churn, of course, which is a given in the agency world. I built a massive financial model in Excel that's able to forecast our exact expenses/earnings/margins down to the dollar (mainly used for pricing our deals), so at least I'll be able to predict where our cash flows are trending before they become a problem.

In the long-term, we plan to use this agency as a vehicle for launching and scaling our own e-commerce brands, shifting away from client work in the end, though we're likely months away from experimenting with that.

I also have about **$90K in liquid assets** right now (high-yield savings and non-retirement investments), built completely on my own over the last few years. Ideally, I'll use this for investing in real estate over the next year or two, but also have it as my ""safety net"" in a worst-case scenario.

My other side projects (online courses, etc.) usually net around $500 a month completely passively, meaning I'd likely be at **$5.5k/month in earnings** for now, plus or minus our fluctuation in clients.

Was I really about to cut my salary in half to do this?

# Time for an Ego Check

Truth be told, that decision was already made the second I landed my first client. I don't know for certain if this agency is going to be the first big hit that takes me to ""successful entrepreneur,"" but I do know for certain that there's no way I'll ever know unless I try. I can't keep working for a large corporation forever.

The part I'm still struggling with is putting my ego aside, letting go of what everyone's expectations of me and ""my path"" should be are, and just doing it. Worst case, I'll always be able to go back and work for a smaller tech or startup company in a senior- or exec-level role, though I can't see myself doing that without trying this first.

It seems these days, anyone can start an ""agency"" without having an education, any real experience, or any clue how to run a business. All it takes is some shady marketing guru selling you a course on Facebook to ""fully prepare you."" So, why on earth would I leave my 6-figure, well-respected, and basically passive job to go work more and earn less?

Maybe, it's because those are the exact reasons why mine could rise above the rest. Maybe, it's because regardless of how the agency plays out, this will simply be the first big move among many that lead me to earn back full control of my life as an entrepreneur.

Regardless, the decision has been made, so it's only a matter of time before that corporate paycheck is no longer worth the looming stress of a corporate job and I press send on that ""It's been real..."" draft to all my coworkers.

# Where I'm Currently Stuck

**My questions for the** r/Entrepreneur **community**:

1. Am I crazy for wanting to give up my salary (and notable position) to go scale a new business in such an ultra-competitive industry, or would I be better off putting my capital and finance/strategy knowledge into something with more untapped opportunity? Maybe buying an existing business instead?
2. Would you resign on your own and leave on good terms, or wait until you got laid off (or worse) and potentially burn a bridge, but keep collecting a paycheck as long as possible due to these uncertain times?
3. Should I go ahead and invest in real estate while I still have a steady income, even though I risk buying at a market high and then being tied to a mortgage payment?

Thank you for your thoughtful responses!

hoqb38,63,2020-07-10,Fall 2020 Reopening Plan (sent to employees first),33183172460,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/hoqb38/fall_2020_reopening_plan_sent_to_employees_first/,"Dear University of Florida community,

The fall semester is quickly approaching, and we know you share our excitement as we prepare to reengage on our campus.

By now, you’ve likely heard about or seen [UF’s Reopening Plan](https://coronavirus.ufl.edu/media/coronavirusufledu/Reopening-Plan.pdf) for the fall semester, which lays out how the university will move forward amid the ongoing pandemic. [Our Plan Forward](https://coronavirus.ufl.edu/our-plan-forward/) is a comprehensive guide for students, faculty, staff and our community on what the fall semester will entail. It is a living and flexible document as our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and best practices to address the virus evolve. We encourage you to review it as well as to visit [https://coronavirus.ufl.edu/](https://coronavirus.ufl.edu/) for the latest updates and FAQs, but we also wanted to share some highlights from the plan that we believe will be important to you.

**Campus life and academics**

Classes begin August 31, final exams will be completed by Dec. 18, and instructors are encouraged to allow course and exam completion remotely after Thanksgiving break.

Students who registered for fall classes in February will **not** be required to re-register, although they may need to adjust their schedule in cases where classes have been divided into additional sections to allow for physical distancing.  Please review your fall schedule at [https://one.uf.edu/](https://one.uf.edu/) and review fall course offerings at [https://one.uf.edu/soc/](https://one.uf.edu/soc/)

In order to keep students, faculty and staff as safe as possible, we have changed how we offer many classes in the Fall.  Some in-person classes will be smaller to allow for physical distancing.  Some classes will be held outdoors.  There will be more online classes, and some will be hybrids of both in-person and online.  Students who prefer to stay online for the fall semester who can do so while staying on track to graduate on time, are encouraged to configure their schedules accordingly.  

Given the current surge in coronavirus in Florida, we are approaching the Fall schedule cautiously, but flexibly.  Across all undergraduate, graduate and professional courses, 35% of the sections are scheduled to be held in face-to-face or hybrid modes\[1\]. The distribution of these courses among colleges will vary considerably, depending on pedagogical needs.  An additional 35% of the sections are scheduled to be delivered in a synchronous, online format.  That means that students will be engaging with the instructor and course activities at a prescribed time over the internet.  If the incidence of coronavirus improves during the Fall term, these courses could become face-to-face courses simply by assigning a meeting room.  Given the current incidence of the virus, we cannot count on that happening, but the option to convert to face-to-face is there throughout the Fall semester.

Residence halls and dining facilities will be open with modifications that promote necessary physical distancing and other safety measures in alignment with UF Health recommendations.  We expect most of the facilities students rely on to be open, including the Southwest Recreation Center, the Libraries, the Reitz Union, and Newell Hall.  

Campus residences will operate with a reduced capacity and will adjust occupancy within some rooms to promote safety of our community. Triple rooms will no longer be available.Masks will not be required within a student’s own room as roommates in residence halls will be treated as a single household. However, face coverings are required in common areas, hallways and outside of rooms where physical distancing may be difficult to maintain. 

We realize that experiences outside the classroom are every bit as important as those that take place in the learning environment. Campus traditions as well as extracurricular and co-curricular activities will continue to the greatest extent possible, although many will occur in modified fashion.

\[1\] Includes internships, independent study, graduate dissertation, supervised research, supervised teaching, and undergraduate research.

**Promoting a safer, healthier campus**

The entire campus community is expected to continue the standard practices of wearing face coverings – required in all UF facilities – physical distancing, handwashing and staying home when you feel sick. UF also will be expanding enhanced cleaning and safety protocols in residence halls, dining facilities and classrooms with the arrival of the fall semester.

The cornerstone of our plan is the [UF Health Screen, Test &amp; Protect](https://coronavirus.ufhealth.org/screen-test-protect/) program, which was launched in early May to return faculty, staff and students to campus at no cost to individuals. Every student will receive a letter outlining the screening process.  All students are required to complete a mandatory COVID-19 screening questionnaire. Students also will have access to COVID-19 testing.  Additional student screening and testing information is available on the [Students page of the Screen, Test &amp; Protect website.](https://coronavirus.ufhealth.org/screen-test-protect/students/)  

Should the need arise, the university has reserved rooms on campus and rooms off campus for student quarantine use. Students in quarantine will be provided with food, sundries, counseling and other services, as needed.

**Your role in our success**

Finally, while the university is doing everything in its power to make this fall a success, perhaps the single most important factor in making that happen is individual responsibility. Each one of us will determine whether the fall semester is a success. Like you, we want this fall to be rewarding both academically and socially.

We have created a thorough and thoughtful approach to re-opening campus, and we will continue to provide an exceptional education and opportunities that will enable the success of our students, faculty and staff while preserving the legacy and future of our great university.

Sincerely,

Joe Glover, Provost

Charles Lane, Chief Operating Officer

So when I turned 18, the summer before college, I applied for a few jobs. 

My father ended up forcing me to be an intern in his office. I already had another job, but he kept saying it would look bad if I declined his offer. But I hadn’t even applied for the position. So I accepted both jobs. 

My father ended up getting heavily involved in my job, even though he wasn’t my boss. He works in the recruiting side; I’m an intern to the accounting department. He’d constantly call me in when I wasn’t scheduled, right after my 11 hour shift from my other job or on my day off, and overwork me to the point where I don’t have time to do anything else. 

Yesterday things got worse. My father called me screaming at work that they needed me now, my boss had talked to him, etc. I went in and talked to my boss. I was aware I had work, but I had spoken with her about coming in on a Saturday and getting it all done then. She said she hadn’t spoken to my father at all that day. 

I got really frustrated and I ended up finishing the work. I went home and told my mother I want to quit. It’s not about the job; the job is decent and I love my boss, it’s about my father ruining my schedule I built with my boss and calling me in randomly. 

My mother started screaming and saying I can’t quit because it’ll ruin my fathers image. But it doesn’t matter that he’s ruining the last month I have at home? That he’s lying just to get me into the office to do more work? That he’s overworking me? 

I told her that I think my mental health comes before their image, and she lost it, calling me an ungrateful child. I’m not ungrateful. I didn’t even want the job. My other job pays the same amount but they treat me way better and don’t do the stuff my dad does. 

I just feel so stuck."

I had never felt so inferior than when I was in my college courses, surrounded by people who could read and write code in C++ like it was basic English, whereas I was struggling to even understand a pointer, or was impressed if I  managed to write a single if...else statement. I had lost an internship because I couldn't keep up the same pace as the other interns writing automated test scripts in Python.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, as miserable as I was I keep looking back at wanting to learn how to code. I suppose it's a skill I'm jealous of since I never managed to get the hang of it. I guess the big question I'm asking here is, was there anyone who absolutely was terrible at programming but came back at a different point in your life and had vert different results?"

They are very late with replying to anything and I want to ask them for the money that I worked for. It’s not much but I was counting on the salary. I signed a contract and we both agreed for them to pay me. 

I asked my school as well what I could do about it and they pretty much just said they can’t do anything about it, so just keep asking until I get a reply. 

I want to know what I could do to receive my money, since they are very hard to contact in general.

She is working full time now for almost a year whereas I only have had internships. I have just graduated and will be working full time starting from next week though. Our lease ends at the end of August, and our landlord only does yearly contract. We are thinking instead of renting a new apartment or signing a new contract, we could just buy an apartment, but not sure how to proceed as we don't have a lot of work experience.

The place we are looking at is about 700k, nothing fancy, we are just living in an HCOL city. We would put down 10-15% down payment. so the mortgage will be around 600k. The new job I am starting will have a base pay of 100k and her current job also has a base pay of 100k. Since she's worked for almost a year we could probably qualify for a mortgage with her pay, but probably not for 600k, but if her RSUs and bonus are considered then it might be sufficient. Her RSU and bonuses add another 37k to her income this year. Do you think we could qualify for a mortgage together with barely any payslip from my side? would RSU and bonus be considered? Or should we sign for another year of rent even though we are ready to buy an apartment?"

hov6db,2,2020-07-10,"How to manage parents who are bad at finances? I am in the US, parents are in India.",runnyrum,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hov6db/how_to_manage_parents_who_are_bad_at_finances_i/,"tl, dr; I am 28 years old, living in the US. My parents are retired in India and they have bad spending habits. They have no retirement amount but they get a monthly pension. I have no idea how I can convince them to budget and reduce expenses. They demand any amount of money every month for expenses that I do not want to give. I already have set up my monthly salary to go into investments, retirements, insurance, utilities, etc. I will have to cut down my monthly investments to send money to my parents.

Background: I am 28 yrs old and I have just paid off all my (and my family's) loans and have started to save for retirement and investing. My parents stay in India and they are retired. My dad gets a modest government pension and they live in a house that we own. My dad insists that the pension is not enough for all his purchases.

Financial history: I started working in 2013 in India. By that time, we already had many loans (my educational loan, car loan, house loan, some other loans against his retirement fund as well) - my salary was just making a dent in the principal amounts, Dad's salary was entirely used to just pay off interests for many years. I worked for 4 years in India and foolishly trusted my Dad to stay on top of the loans. I was sending as much as 30% of my income to pay off loans, I was not saving for retirement or investing, etc but was living comfortably, occasional dining out, etc. In every phone call, the loans are all called out as ""educational loans"" and Mom and Dad push me to spend less, not eat out much, but save. I used to feel guilty to take a vacation - I went for a short drive with my friends once over the four years. Even a nominal purchase like a blender will be responded with ""the blender sounds good, but how much did it cost? we still have many education loans to clear, try to save more"" - especially by my Mom.

Every couple of months there will be some huge expense that is completely out of our budget that comes from the money I sent home to pay off the loan. Over the four years that I worked, the loans reduced a bit but my and Dad's salary was not enough to really pay off loans and manage expenses.

I took a huge risk and did my Masters in the USA from Fall 2017. This added another huge educational loan. (We have a few properties and farmland in the village as collateral so we could get lots of loans, these assets are sentimentally linked and unsellable) Luckily, I got an RA and my entire tuition and living expenses were paid off and on top of that, I could send $300 per month home during my masters.

I worked my ass off to earn an internship in a software company for the summer and sent around $10k home. I was still unaware of the expenses and loan payments at our home. But, now I asked Dad for a detailed sheet and he sent me - the outstanding loans were insane, I needed a windfall to pay off the loans.

Again, I worked hard to convert that internship to a full-time job with a competitive salary. I used credit cards (balance transfer etc) to pay off my loans so that they are paid off with 0% interest so that I could pay off the credit cards with the stocks I got after 1 year of work.

After this, I stopped sending money home and my Dad retired at this time as well. My Dad sold one asset for some expenses but has been repeatedly telling me that I need to send money home every month. I told them that I will not send any money home until I get a detailed expense sheet.

My Dad definitely goes overboard in buying any item (he has to get the best one in the store - be it a refrigerator or switchboard, etc) and if it doesn't work. Our house is filled with stuff so much that there is barely space to walk but my Dad continues to buy things that he thinks is a good use (and then never use it after 1 week) My Mom is very disconnected from all purchases, she only has a narrow view of groceries, kitchen or prayer items. She did not know the exact amount of loans but reiterates ""shouldn't spend too much, should save money"" - she says it more than she actually implements it though (she randomly makes insane costs to temples with no planning or budgeting)

They have been maintaining an expense sheet for 8 months (they didn't for 2 months) - this was a huge change that I never saw before. But, some of the expenses are ridiculous and they go over the pension amount (twice the pension amount). I am not sure how I can educate my parents about budgeting, limiting expenses, and planning ahead. They stubbornly maintain that expenses cant be foreseen and that the expenses they make are all necessary."
hoy3j7,0,2020-07-10,One C on my college transcript in summer course after freshman year,cinnamon177,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hoy3j7/one_c_on_my_college_transcript_in_summer_course/,"I got a C in my recent summer course; I had an internship that I was doing as I was taking the class, which was already at an accelerated pace due to the short time frame of summer courses. It was an Econ class and I received a C after getting 2 A’s and 2 B+’s my freshman fall, with the spring being pass/fail due to the pandemic. I understand that the C will bring down my GPA, and with hard work for the next few years, I can work to fix the damage to my GPA caused by this grade. However, I fear putting excess pressure on myself, expecting near perfection of every future course I take. I am already extremely hard on myself and I attend a top 10 private university. Is it possible to achieve a solid GPA—3.8 or there about—with this C? I know it will be hard. However I feel like I am an isolated incident, as if many of my peers do not encounter such a blow to their grade point averages over their college careers."

I started working for a tiny startup right out or college working under someone I worked with during an internship. Things were going really well and although I have many (MANY) hats to wear, I've felt like I was making a contribution to my team.

Since two months ago I've slumped into a depression that's been difficult to get out of and my work started to show (bugs in prod, lousy testing, mixing up tickets etc.). 

This monday I had a call with my boss (who was the one that got me hired, we're pretty close by his standards) and he told me what I already knew: there were quality issues with my code recently and the managers have noticed too. He told me if I can't get it together in a month they may have to take extra steps (possible termination).

I have since been very organized and making sure every thing goes through QA but issues are still coming up from old code. At this point I'm wondering if I should start looking for a new job so I wouldn't technically get fired but I doubt anyone would hire someone with 6 months experience during a pandemic.

I'm not sure what to do and feel like I'm out of options if I get fired. Any advice would be great."

I've been solely taking care of my daughter for the last three months. Slightly over ninety days, gone in  a breath. I did yoga most days. Meditated. Practiced gratitude. And tried not to think about the impending return of work as email after email screeched on my phone throughout, like nails on a chalkboard. Trying to get their barnacles to filter through me like the others still stuck in the grind, depleting me of the best of my energy, the most of my days.

This is the longest I have gone without working since I started when I was legally allowed at 15. Before then I babysat and had a paper route. It's all bullshit. Stop this train, I want to get off. 

I am head over heels in debt from student loans. I always will be. My dad raised seven kids on a shit salary working a job that sucked out the best and made him a tired and worried version of himself. All of us sent to Catholic schools because to my dad religion and education were everything. We were mocked incessantly for being poor, yet I was the only one I knew who played violin until I graduated high school, did ballet, gymnastics, theatre, volleyball, basketball, two seasons of softball, cross country, and track most years. It was not that I wanted to do any of those things. But what my parents did not have in money, they made us for in energy and determination. I did not really have a choice.

Kids would make fun of the car my parents would pick us all up in, usually a kid or two hanging out the windows of ye old station wagon. One maybe jumping on the roof while my mom laughed. She truly did not care what anyone else thought. I was mortified my entire childhood. I just wanted to be like every other family. I used to think it was money that divided us. But it wasn't. We were the only ones I knew who were free. Anything we wanted to do, my parents encouraged. I would get home and jump in the lake, so expansive it looked and felt like the ocean. I would swim with a friend or my brothers for miles, from the beaches of one town to another. If I drowned no one would have been there to save me. We grew up strong. We learned to be competitive. We learned to fend for ourselves and with a crazed loyalty, fend for each other. We ran like the wind and when we wanted to do something there was no one stopping us. We played poker on the roof, climbing out of one of the bedroom windows. We would tie up my brothers karate belts, one end around his bed frame, the other end tied around one of us as we rappelled from the third floor window. I would tell my hippie mom that I was going to paint the walls of my room from something I had a dream about and she would say cool. My babysitting money went to acrylics and oils. 

I have such a hard time fitting in. Get with the program, society says. So I do. Or I try. I wear normalcy like a Halloween costume. It's fun for a while, but soon enough I just want to take it off. This game of Professional Woman. I know the right things to say. But inevitably I feel it stirring inside, a fierce rebellion. I AM NOT THIS I scream into oblivion, but no one and nothing hears me. They say the definition of insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over again, expecting different results. I look around me, but no one else seems to care enough to even want different results. Maybe I am insane.

The grind. Most of our lives spent in an air controlled office. I did not even grow up with air conditioning. Windows closed feels like a coffin. Niceties and politeness ooze through the office floors. When I first became an attorney I would bring a tennis ball in to work and take breaks like a smoker to throw it against the wall outside. My feet ached and still do from being stuffed inside an uncomfortable shoe. My Brooks Brothers dress that I spent hours of my life paying for, cloying. Suffocating. The yearning for freedom emanated from me in waves. I decided to go to law school three weeks before my first year started. If I believed in regret, maybe I would have regretted it ever since.

What is wrong with me? Most people around me seem to want the white picket fence and the security of a steady paycheck. A dream job? Who events WANTS a job? I am not lazy. I work hard, but fuck, can the work at least MEAN something? Society dictates judgment based on our profession. Why should I proudly introduce myself to the world by what I do when what we're all really doing is lining someone else's pockets? 

The energy we put out into the world comes back to us. I try to remember and be kind. I reflect on what I really want. What kind of life do I actually want to live? We can't function without money. Yet currency and money are two very different things. Is there a way to live above it all? So many things do not matter. Society is a construct. Two hundred years ago, the things we said, the way we dressed, everything was different. We as a collective group decide what behavior is morally reprehensible. We separate ourselves from the behavior of animals in the wild with the differentiating factor of inward reflection. We know and can see the consequences of our actions. 

So why is it so wrong in today's society to not want to cater to the whims of a few, and join the masses of many, wasting time, our only indispensable resource? We're given a map of the ""right"" path in life, a Candy Land game board chosen for us before birth, a winding road of school, internships, then work until we're too old to even really enjoy the fruits of our labors. A wrong spin and you slide back years. A little luck, and you're ""ahead"" of your peers. But I don't want to play anymore. 

I want out. I want enough money to never have to worry about money again. I want to work my ass off at something that never feels like work. But holy shit, right now I have no idea where to turn and how to get there."

And what's the best way to prepare for an internship in Software Development? I heard going on Leetcode and Hackerrank and reading ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" book is good?

2. What are some classes I should be taking to help me prepare?

3. What are some pros and cons of having an internship at a place like Google, Amazon, or Apple compared to a startup?

4. How to Find ideas on a project to work on?

5. Ways to network in college especially on social media (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn etc.) 

  6. What are your thoughts on mass applying for internships compared to being more selective?

7. Is this feeling normal?

I messed up on a big project that was sent to clients and missed a few comments for things they told me to do. This resulted in a meeting where they told me how I was not meeting their expectations and now I need to turn in all my stuff.

I'm really lost at the moment, I worked so hard during my undergrad. I networked with people within this company, and had internships every summer of varying experiences. Is this a sign this career path is the wrong choice? I honestly hate the concept of having to work to live, and even only being here a few months the 9-5 completely drained me.

* Why I want an MBA:
   * I like coding, but i don't want to be a software engineer for that long, really enjoy problem solving and bringing in non-technical skills to technical solutions
   * Geographic flexibility, career flexibility, networking, being surrounded by really smart people and motivated people from different backgrounds (not even from just a networking perspective, I just find that super enjoyable)
   * Cement business experience after 4 years of being in the technical weeds
* Why I want one now: 
   * Deferred Admissions, applying this fall (4 years from start of work)
   * Pivot to either strategy/operations/tech consulting/PM
* Target schools: M7 (Probably H/S/MIT LGO the most)

**Background**

* Work experience: (still in school)
   * 3 internships, 1 at one of the GAFAM, 1 internationally in Europe at a Big4
   * Hopefully starting work at GAFAM or as a quant for 4 years pre-MBA (depending on area probably $100k+ starting)
* Extra curriculars and other experience:
   * Head RA at my university
   * President of my major association
   * Founder of a professional greek life council at my school
* Undergrad school/major: T50 University, CS + Business major (and picked up 4 minors in related/semi-related areas)
* Other education/coursework: MS in Computer Science
* Race/nationality: White
* Sex: M

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 760/50Q/41V/8IR (just crammed for the online version so no AWA), probably still could pick up more points with some more studying if that would be necessary
* Undergrad GPA: 3.97

I graduated in December of 2018 with a business degree and pretty good grades. I naively thought things would be pretty simple: I can work for a year or 2, then go for my MBA and go on with a leadership position

I managed to get myself an internship at a startup biotech for business development, then through connections another internship in a venture firm in NYC...then the pandemic hit shutting down the city, unfortunately before I was going to take the GMAT for business school

After a few months of working from home, I kinda realized that this kind of work, while interesting, isn't something I think I'd be willing to do for the next 10 years or so. The pandemic DID kind of slow things down to a crawl to be fair, but the work is a bit less exciting than I imagined it'd be...at least at my level

Regardless, when work slowed down during the pandemic I had some time to think. After some soul-searching I realized that my driving force most of my life was just to please my parents, but now I just cannot seem to find my passion in my degree. Especially painful is that I'm kind of a disappointment to my dad right now anyways.

Regularly now at the dinner table, I keep hearing the whole ""back in my day"" stories of how he had things much harder and he still carved himself a very successful life from literally nothing as an immigrant from Communist China and he's VERY critical of my lack of passion and motivation to go ""above and beyond"" what I'm currently doing which is not that much

Regardless, here I am, in the middle of a pandemic, with disappointed parents, unsure what my passion for my field is, and not knowing where I should even go. Do I keep trying to find work in this pandemic and maybe find a field I can join? Do I try and return to school for something else? Is there some alternative?

My question is, what would be better, a double degree in Electrical Engineering/Comp Sci, or co-op for either one of them. Would the variety of the double degree open as many opportunities as the internships that co-op provides? Does co-op just make your future a bit more secure with the internships, and not much else? 

Also, if I end up going the co-op route, which course out of the two would I be better off doing? I know that some co-op degrees are more useful than others, how does comp sci and electrical engineering compare?

It's only 1 extra year but costs about €12k. In my head I would like to hold back on my masters and maybe do it a few years down the line to pivot into a certain field or subfield if I wanted to. The university seems to be pushing this narrative that engineers NEED a masters to stay competitive in today's job market. 

My supervisors at my internships have told me that a good engineer will still be a good engineer with or without a masters. At both internships it was roughly a 50/50 split between those who had a masters and those that didn't and they were both equally competent in my eyes. They did say however that the bigger multinational companies tend to put bigger emphasis on them and not having one may go against me if I was interviewing at one.

Could I expect to be paid more, even as a new grad, if I had a masters or does it matter? Does the cost of the masters (plus a lost year of earnings) justify compensation later in my career?

TL;DR Is doing a masters worth it? Should I wait a few years or do it straight after undergrad and get it out of the way?"

On October 2019 I finished my bachelors in Geoinformatics engineering. Had almost zero knowledge about programming. I didn't know where to start! 
Started with theory, Java  fundamentals,DB, Java EE,  and then I started doing a small project implementing CRUD Operations.
During the learning phase I applied for a intern position and I made it through the first interview,but not in the second technical interview.
I knew that it was early for me to apply, but I felt really pessimistic, and until yesterday I had no hope for a web dev position.
During these past few months, I was just learning new things and implementing into my small project. 
But I was into that loophole, where whenever I did something right , I felt that I could become Steve Jobs, and whenever I could fix a bug, I felt like I was the dumbest person in the world. Ups and extreme downs. Because the Covid situation, in my country (eastern europe) , intership are non-existent, and yeah that was another downside for me. But just last week I read an internship opportunity in a good company. I applied but with no hope. For my surprise, I got a call from the company. I was going to be tested for my logical/maths skills, and I got a 80%! Next interview went great, I was really confident and chill! And that was the story of how I got my first internship!

I've been very unhappy at my current company and decided to apply for a new job. Ended up with offers from two companies, one in Germany (company 1) and one in the US (company 2). Either would be a significant improvement over my current job, but I only have 4 days to decide. Due to the pandemic I haven't visited either one, and I'm having the hardest time making up my mind.

The salaries both seem competitive by local standards. I've been dreaming of living in Europe since I was a child. I love singing opera in my spare time and traveling, and Europe is perfect for that. I'll even get 30 days of paid leave every year. I did an internship in Switzerland a few years ago and had a blast there. After everything that's been going on the US these past few years, Europe seems particularly attractive right now.

But there are things I don't like about company 1. It's an old-school car manufacturer near Munich. They are quite rigid and track employees' hours with ID swipes. I need to be at work for 9 hours a day on average. This seems to penalize people like me who work efficiently and get things done in less time. My desk is right next to my boss, who, I've been told, is a bit workaholic. I like what the team does and so far I like the people very much, but I won't be able to switch teams easily if it doesn't work out. The company also offers very few perks/benefits. There's no signing bonus. I had to handle my visa application and apartment search myself, without knowing any German (to be fair, my future boss tried to help, which was nice of him, but it's not his job). There's not even free coffee at the office. Moreover, I don't know anyone in Munich, so I'll be alone.

Company 2, on the other hand, is one of the biggest tech companies in the Bay Area and very prestigious. I have friends there who are very happy there, mainly because the benefits and perks are incredible (free meals, gym, spas, etc). Even though I'll only get 15 vacation days, the hours are more flexible and I've heard there's unpaid leave available. There are plenty of activities on campus. I don't care much for the work they do, but it will be easy to switch teams. I may be able to transfer to a different office overseas, but I wouldn't bet on it. One of my best friends works there and I know the area. It will be an easy transition.

Overall I think company 2 is a better company, and a safer option that doesn't take me out of my comfort zone, but one can argue that I should be getting out of my comfort zone while I'm still young. Jobs in the EU are hard to come by these days, so this could be my only chance to move to Europe. But should I bet on being sufficiently happy at company 2 to make up for the regret of not going to Germany? What should I choose, a great company or a great country to live in?"

I also took a Computer Networking class and that was so fucking boring.  Unfortunately, I did not get any internships and I do not have any industry experience.  I did graduate with a high GPA so at least I have that going for me, and no, I don't expect it to mean jack shit to employers. 

I know that the economy is shitty right now but I have applied to hundreds of jobs and have not heard a response back except from scummy places or scams like KGS Technology and Revature.  Assuming my resume is not crappy (I have not been interviewed yet so they don't know if my personality is bad or not), how can I get an entry level programming job? 

I am not opposed to getting a masters degree in Software Engineering but I have zero interest in pursuing a masters in CS because I don't want to learn Assembly or build a crappy operating system.  I just like programming in ""high-level"" programming languages.  SQL isn't bad either because it's just applied Set Theory.  MS Access sucks dick, though.  

And before someone suggests that I get a masters in Data Science, I have taken Applied Statistics and Applied Linear Regression using R, and while I did well, I found the material extremely uninteresting. 

I hate HTML and CSS but I really like OOP programming and the data structures that I learned in Java.  Is Javascript fun? 

Also, I don't need to get hired by a Big-N company so advising me to grind Leetcode problems may not be necessary. 

tl;dr

I like programming in Java using OOP but I hate computer science. I also think HTML and CSS is boring.  How can I get an entry level programming job? So, what is the best route to getting an entry level programming job? If I were to enroll in a bootcamp, based on my interests and disinterests above, which one would be the best fit and would it be beneficial to landing me an entry level position?  Or should I just self-study and work on my portfolio? Or should I pursue a masters in Software Engineering?  I know that none of these things will guarantee a job.

**Extracurriculars/Activities: In retrospect my order was wack and did not line up with my major**

1. Chinese music orchestra (9-12, President): played in an orchestra dedicated to Chinese music, taught over the summer and lots of cultural exchange efforts, *essay on this for cultural/diversity stuff*
2. Stanford Research (12): did neuroscience research w/ a postdoc at Stanford medical school afterschool, *essay on this for ""why this major""*
3. Founded a program to get more girls involved with math and build mentorship (11, 12), *CommonApp essay*
4. Speech and Debate (9-12, Captain and VP): states + TOC quals, my event was really underresourced, *essay for leadership + overcoming challenges (*
5. Competitive Math Program (9-12, Founder + Head Coach): my old middle school was the only team in the area without coaching so I went back and founded a program, later recruiting other coaches + directing them
6. Harvard Internship (summer after soph): neuroscience again yo
7. Journalism (11, 12, editor)
8. AI Research (11, 12): worked with a Chinese company for manuscript drafting, not hardcore research stuff lol
9. French Honor Society (9-12, President): did couple events, the club was kinda sus ngl after we lost our advisor
10. Water Polo (10, 11): i really sucked lmao designated benchwarmer

I also submitted a sample of my Chinese music to all schools who would take it besides Stanford because I missed the deadline haha; they had a space to let me explain the music which I think helped put a lot of the work I did in context (ethnomusicography + linguistics as hobbies)

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. USABO Semifinalist (2018, Top 50 in 2019)

3. TOC in debate + did pretty well
4. Journalism Awards (Top 10% nationally in a certain category)
5. National Merit Semifinalist

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Honors Lit teacher: junior year, knew her very well, she loved me + supported me whole way 9/10

AP Calc teacher: junior year, cordial, 7/10

Harvard Prof: decent letter speaking to my intuition, 6/10

Stanford Prof: decent letter speaking to my research abilities, 6/10

**Interviews (in order I did them in based on vague memory)**

Harvard: fucking bombed it lol it was awful 0/10 would not ever want to do that again even I'd reject me

MIT: hyped up on caffeine which actually worked, 9/10 had a great time, talked about my speedrunning hobby as well as more personal stuff

Northwestern: good interview, but I messed up and made it seem like I wanted to do journalism not neuroscience lol 7/10

Middlebury: great interview, got to talk about COVID-19 when it was first starting with my interviewer and internal politics of China (shits wild yo) 8/10

Rice: amazing!!!! my interviewer was so so sweet n drove Rice to the top of my list for me, talked about problems w/ competition at the high school level a lot 10/10 loved her

UPenn: decent, talked about speedrunning more and changing careers in life 6/10

Dartmouth: also amazing!!!! again, my interviewer was super super nice, she let me choose a question to answer at the end which let me talk about my passions in reading (more interviewers should do that ngl) + def helped me get in bc I could feel myself lighting up like no other interview got me 10000/10

**Essays**

**Spent most of my time here because I applied to 27 schools (oops)**. My main strategy was to make a doc and categorize each of the essays into one of 5 categories: culture, leadership/adversity, equality/activism, ""why this major"", and ""why this school"". I made it so that my non-""why this school"" essays were UC prompts which saved a bunch of time. In addition, since besides the ""why this school"" essay I could kinda manoeuvre one of the other 4 essays into the topics, I only wrote about 10 unique essays total.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Amherst
* CMU
* Dartmouth (originally committed here)
* Middlebury
* Rice
* Swarthmore
* UC Berkeley
* UC Davis
* UC Irvine (Regents)
* UC LA
* UC SD (Regents)
* UC SB
* Williams

*Waitlists:*

* Columbia (last minute movement to acceptance!)
* Duke (got off, but stayed committed to Dartmouth)
* MIT
* Northwestern
* Northeastern (didn't stay on)
* Tufts (didn't stay on)
* WUSTL (didn't stay on) (only applied for parents lol)

*Rejections:*

* Brown (applied PLME last minute as a shotgun)
* Harvard (REA defer -&gt; reject)
* Johns Hopkins
* Pomona
* Princeton
* Stanford
* UPenn

**Additional Information:**

After getting deferred from Harvard (after r/chanceme said I was solid smh), I went into panic mode about my application chances so I shotgunned like 8 schools (which actually turned out well for me lol). I followed the A2C advice for waitlists and reached out for interviews from Columbia and Duke, where I hadn't gotten an interview yet. I managed to get some and I think it made a big difference since I ended up getting accepted by both. Instead of writing my LOCIs about similar topics to my applications, I just talked about my hobbies like speedrunning, biking, and language.

&amp;#x200B;

The Columbia acceptance letter since the email went into my spam and I only found it while clearing out my email (thank god I looked!) Choosing between Columbia and Dartmouth was really hard but I ended up at Columbia. Dartmouth is criminally underrated though and I think everyone should have it on their application list.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think the strongest and weakest points in my app were my ECs. On one hand, they were all over the place and had little to do with my major. On the other hand, I was really passionate about everything I did (in my interviews I called myself ""chaotic""), and it helped me enjoy life during the high school grind, and my efforts paid off in awards. **I just did stuff that I thought was fun**. I see people complaining about ""having"" to do something to get into college but for me all my ECs were just as fun as playing video games so I never thought I was losing out on having a social life or friends (I'd rather spend 2 hours doing debate research than 2 hours of LoL or smth).

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflections/TL;DR**

\- No one is safe

\- Sort out your essays beforehand to save yourself a lot of headache and stress

\- There's no such thing as too many passions: I never did anything for the app and I think that helped because my passion showed though through awards + essays.

\- Apply to colleges that give you flexibility in what you want because I have literally been changing my intended job every other day since March 2020 so you never know

\- Always do whatever you can once you're on a waitlist and do it fast

\- Check your spam lol"
hpfiaz,1,2020-07-11,New Grad: Junior Solutions Architect Consultant or Cloud Engineer,hhtun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hpfiaz/new_grad_junior_solutions_architect_consultant_or/,"As a new graduate CS engineer, I would like to pursue a career related to the cloud.

With my actual interviews, I have to decide between 2 different types of positions : Junior Solutions Architect Consultant or Cloud Engineer.

Career Evolution is very important to me, as well as the daily tasks I will be doing. 

I am a geek that loves technical stuff, yet I have discovered through my internships that working all the day on computer isn't my favorite job. On the other hand, I still miss some essential soft skills, I'm not very comfortable with dealing with human conflicts and managing meetings, but it is something I want to learn with time. I'm also interested in entrepreneurship and I'd like to launch a business in the mid/long term.

I am wondering if it's better to start my career as a Cloud Engineer to master technical details then switch to a Solutions Architect position or to start directly as a junior solutions architect consultant ?

Is the solutions architect's job a good balance between technical stuff and human / business stuff ?"
hpfm1s,7,2020-07-11,Graduated. What now?,the_quiet_tone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hpfm1s/graduated_what_now/,"Probably should have asked this question a lot earlier. Anyway, here's a summary of my situation:

- graduated recently BSc, major in computing science, minor in mathematics from University of Alberta

- was a big struggle even getting this far. Things happened in my personal life which really messed up my grades, couldn't get into any internships as a result. Got a bunch of A's in my last 3 semesters, but when you combine it with the absolute mess I had previously, it's a cumulative 2.6 GPA. Not enough to get into most Masters programs, and honestly I don't want to - I'd like to see a few cents in returns from the time and money I've already put into my studies before investing even more.

- I have barely 10 connections on LinkedIn, and already sent a request to everyone that I've had a conversation with in the last ~5 years (again, because of my personal issues I was in no mood to initiate conversation with anyone, or go anywhere other than home/university/grocery store). Going to try requesting my university profs and maybe members of groups on machine learning, software development, etc, etc, once my profile looks a little bit better.

- I have a github account, but it's kind of unimpressive and a little abandoned. I'm planning to start a new one and actually attach my name to it. On that note, I want to do more projects, particularly in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, because in class we barely scratched the surface and I know I could do better. I'm also going to try to make a complex original game with Pygame, if I can, but that's maybe too ambitious.

- I hate sending job applications. More than anything else I've experienced, and I've experienced some truly terrible things. My resume's as good as can be expected for someone with no internships, non-retail work experience, or good overall GPA, and just a Bachelor's degree. My 1 month free trial LinkedIn pro tells me that for every job I've applied (and basically every other CS job in my city) there are ~400 applicants .... in the first day alone.  ~50% of them have Masters degrees, and 10% have a PhD. People with PhDs are applying to entry level jobs. I haven't had a reply yet, not even a negative one. I'm not convinced that my chances of getting a job are not 0.  

- So very many positions require C# or Ruby on Rails. I don't know the second thing about either. They were never even offered in my university as far as I know. I could write a program that solves extremely complex puzzles or accurately classifies images or autopilots a robot in an unknown environment, but I'd have to look up how to print 'hello world' in either.

So what do I do? Learn Ruby on Rails or C# or both so that I effectively triple the positions I can apply to (I mean I suppose I can lie on my resume and apply to them already and try to quickly learn something before I'm called to an interview)? Do projects for github portfolio? Work on networking and try to get a job through my currently almost non-existent connections? Just spam apply at every availlable position all day long and hope?"

So, I got an intern into a company whose product was a web app. I always wanted to see what a system programmer does. When I saw that a hardware company was looking for a firmware developer, I applied and somehow got in as I was good at solving DS Algo questions, had studied Computer System Architecture and Operating Systems.

I never even had heard most of the terms in embedded systems. So, now that I am working as a firmware developer, it seems a bit hard for me. I am lagging behind at work. Sometimes it takes an entire week to even debug something. There are so many gaps in my knowledge.

hpgj77,2,2020-07-11,Conflicted on returning to a part-time minimum wage job after months exempt due to Covid,jon131517,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hpgj77/conflicted_on_returning_to_a_parttime_minimum/,"Hi all!

So I'm an engineering student, in university for 2 years, I have about 3 more left. I've had this part-time job in a retail location in Canada for 4 years, and it took me a year of applying literally everywhere to get it. I've been on exemption due to Covid because my parents are paranoid-scared about everything (like I'm common sense-scared, which means I take necessary precautions, but they insist I don't do anything, but that's a whole other can of worms), and my mom has to go help my grandmother with her meds in her old age home. I was laid off in March and got a call at the end of May asking if I'd be interested in returning. I've been on exemption since, and recently got a call saying, basically, ""show up or ship out"". I have a week to decide. I still live with my parents, and until I got that call, they kept telling me to drop it, that I don't need the job. Now they impatiently say ""well it's \*your choice!\*"" as if they want me to keep it.

I've been on a full-time internship since May (I know what you're thinking, but I'm outside 99% of the time without the 5000 randos crossing my path every time I'm there, so not the same type of job \*at all\*), and I have a possibility of staying on part-time as of September, but I don't know if that's going to happen as contracts that I would've been given are falling through due to timing (construction). I'd love to stay part-time, as I make almost twice as much per hour and I'd actually be doing something related to my field, in which part-time jobs are practically nonexistent. I want the money, but even if I can't keep the internship job part-time, I don't think I want to go back.

I made a pros and cons list, and it's non-conclusive:

Pros: pocket money during school, I'm already there, they're flexible with hours, there are a few decent coworkers, sometimes it's quite enjoyable, it's right next door, and it allows me to invest money.

Cons: garbage salary, I don't enjoy working with the public, it eats up time better spent, we rarely finish on time, the managers refuse to accept and address problems that don't directly affect them, there's no possibility of learning anything of future value, I have to spend my time defending policies and selling product I can barely pretend to care about, there's an endless cycle of change for the better, then go right back to how it was, I always have to drag myself in (at the last possible second), and last but not least, they're doing nothing to protect their employees in the wake of the pandemic (no spine to take the profit loss to force clients to wear masks, so we protect clients, but they don't protect us).

The other problem is that right now, I could give 1 night and 1 day per week, and they're willing to accept that. But both would cut into time I could spend with my girlfriend, who I barely saw for 3 months and who I'll probably end up having to not see much again as the intelligence-devoid part of the population forces us into a second wave (sorry, the pandemic made me even more snarky than usual). She also made her work schedule around mine, and it would really suck for her if I now went and took time she's giving me but could be working and work during that time.

If I'm going to change jobs, it's going to be once school starts since I'm full time with my internship, but I have no idea what to do in the meantime. I really don't want to go back, but I do want a fallback option in case I can't find anything for the winter.

I was thinking of trying to bargain if I decided to ditch. Like ""yeah I'll come back, but it won't be at minimum wage. If I'm putting my safety in danger because of the store's negligent policies, I'm being paid somewhere between a manager and what I was already paid or I walk."" My girlfriend says that's not worth it, but I don't know.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, but Reddit, what do you suggest? I want the spending money, limited as it may be, but I can't stand the job, and it took me forever to find."

And I’m debating wether keeping it or ask the university to remove it.



I know the title sounds weird so I’ll try to explain my situation.
So first of all, I’m a 3rd year electronics engineering student and last January I started to apply for internships in my city (barely any available). After 2 months I finally found one and they interviewed me and I was hired!

My first day of work was scheduled to be March 23, 
But... corona happened/ state of emergency in my country / work from home etc. and I was laid off as a result without even a single day of experience gained.

Now that things look slightly better I started applying for internships again (even less available than before). The thing is that my university uses a weird application form where the company receives my transcripts and a basic information generated “resume” containing things like name,phone,email and internship experiences.

Now because of my previous internship now in my resume there’s the name of the company that I applied to and next to it the number of hours I was working there which is 0. 

I didn’t pay too much attention to that, but now I’m having second thoughts and believe that it might be a negative aspect on my resume even though it wasn’t really my fault. 

Should I contact my university and ask them to remove that experience from my resume or will companies understand?

Thank you!"

**So here's some backstory.** I graduated college this past December, and have been struggling to find excitement into what I went to college for. During college, I went through a few IT internships and felt a drive to excel in them. There were plenty of times when I felt indifferent to the work I was doing during my internships, but I dismissed them by thinking ""It's just because this is an internship, it'll get better when I'm out of college"". With that mindset, I stuck it out and finished my degree. Once I graduated from college, however, I felt this disappointment with both myself and my field.

During this year I worked in the IT field as a one-man IT department but I did not enjoy the work at all. I also felt isolated as the only one doing IT in the organization. The one thing I did enjoy was speaking with users on the phone and helping them through technical issues. I'm no longer in that position.

A profession that I've always envisioned myself in is teaching in public schools. I feel like I would have some real impact there and have a real cause. That said, I'm worried that I'm pulling the plug too early on the IT field, and the right gig might be around the corner.

So for those of you who have made a shift in your career, what do you believe pushed you to make that decision?"

I will be a freshman in college this fall and am looking for an internship. Over the past few months, I have learned python and created a few projects. I am currently searching for an internship either remote or in the Houston area but all the ones a looked at are requiring me to be majoring in something STEM-related and be a junior/senior. I am majoring in liberal arts right now, but am looking to transfer into CS my sophomore year. Are there any software engineering internships that don't require these things? Also besides having a couple of projects on my resume to talk about do you guys have any recommendations of anything else I can add? Besides the projects, I don't have anything else. I know there is a low chance of me finding one, but if anyone knows a place I can apply to that would be great. Thanks in advance!"

They either got a good paying job, travel, or have a healthy relationship and seem very happy.

I am a sophomore, and I had a very precise plan about how I want to spend my summer: get an internship, get a job offer and get hired, afford to pay rent for my last university year so I don't have to live in the college dormitory anymore, and save enough money so I can travel to Asia next summer. And maybe get a girlfriend.

But all of my plans went downhill. I had a few interviews and I got rejected. I didn't give up, and kept trying with no result. A friend of mine only had one interview, and he got accepted(the internship was an Android development internship and he didn't have any knowledge about it, while I told them about the small apps I created on my own). I was frustrated when I found out, and I may be a shitty friend for that. I wasn't happy for him, I was actually sad. And now he goes to work and learn everything I studied so hard on my own, and in the end I'm going to be left behind. He also got a girlfriend out of nowhere. That doesn't make me frustrated or anything, but when I look at it I see it as he's starting to live my dream.

I also have other friends who got developer jobs at the age of 19, and now can afford to live on their own, and travel.

I don't understand why, but I feel like they are walking all over me. I always end up shocked and asking myself 'How is that even possible?' when I see how unlucky I can be. But, I never gave up and I'm still trying with no results so far, but with a precise target.

I want to feel better about myself, and love myself for who I am and realise that one day everything will be how I want to. But honestly, I don't feel it right now. Life always has a surprise for me."

I think this is my second post here. This story takes place during my internship last summer. It was written after my internship was over but I forgot about it until now.  I'm still learning, so there may be some mistakes in what I say. Please feel free to correct me or offer your thoughts on the root cause of the issue.

Anyway, let's get to the story.

It’s a normal day halfway through my summer internship working at the main office of a global waste services company($Company). $Company grew rapidly in the late 90s and early 2000s through a series of large acquisitions and no one thought about consolidating any of the 500-odd pieces of software used throughout the acquired companies or about standardizing our network. As a network engineering intern, I was working with the network team on their yearlong network standardization project. 

I had a site to do that fateful day. As a diligent intern, I always checked up on the current setup at each site before the activation. Months before, $Company decided to stop doing site surveys before each activation so, like the proverbial box of chocolates, I never knew what I was gonna get. 

This site had 3 switches listed in our monitoring service, 2 3600 series and one SF300 small business switch. Per my usual routine, I ssh into each switch to copy the old running config in case we needed to back out of the change. I copy the configs of the 3600’s no problem but when I try to ssh into the SF30… no dice. I try all of our username/password combinations after trying tacacs and even find some old usernames/passwords from coworkers and still no luck. I knew nothing about this switch series so I decided to ask my good friend Google.

It turns out this small business series, (now the SG300 which I encounter in a later story) is meant to be “user-friendly” in that you can manage it with a web interface. I try the interface, but Teamviewer is stealing traffic on port 80. That rules out changing the config of that switch, so at this point I figure we can just get rid of it. There are a ton of unused ports on the core switch and I check a few times throughout the week to make sure they remain unused.

We finally get to the day of the activation. It’s a conference call with me, a remote tech from our MSP, and a tech contracted by our MSP to be onsite (This particular site was about 300 miles away). The MSP tech configures their new fangled SDWAN device and then I get to reconfiguring the LAN.

I have no issues. We configure both switches and I have the onsite tech move any cables on the SF300 switch to the core switch. We do user testing at the site and everything is good. People sign things confirming the change is okay and we begin the strange and awkward process of saying goodbye to people on a conference call.

The next day:

I come into the office to an email for our site contact. There are seven phones that are powered but can’t call and one that is completely dead. It just so happens that I moved 8 cables from the SF300 to the core switch. What a coincidence.

I look over the new configs I put on the switches and I see no issues, so I take a look at the old configs. There were two vlans configured on the switches: vlan1 and vlan2, for data and voice respectively. The IP for the data vlan, per our standard, remained the same but most of our switches had only have one vlan configured. We add a voice vlan (among others) when we reconfigure switches at all the sites. 

Well, the old voice vlan was a 192.168.0.0/24 subnet and the new one is a 10.0.0.0/24 subnet. This is a problem, but I realize that it’s only these 8 phones that don’t work. 

I ask the site contact to send some pictures of the network room and make some interesting discoveries (that could have been found with a site survey). There is a 48-port unmanaged Netgear switch and a the phones are running off an old IP-PBX from a company that was likely contracted to install phones without approval from our telephony team. The PBX is connected to the Netgear switch which is then connected to the core switch. Here’s a fun little diagram: \[PBX\]---\[Netgear\]---\[3600\]. There’s a nice sticker on the PBX with a 192.168.0.1 address on it. Interesting…

At this point, I am in way over my head and this issue may be related to networking, but I’m breaching telephony territory at this point, so I ask some coworkers on the network and telephony teams. They’re as confused as I am. The telephony guys recommend putting in a request to replace the entire phone system (which we did but the company is having money troubles so anything like this requires senior executive approval).

In the meantime, we bounce around some ideas on how to make sure the phones can reach the PBX to make calls. All the phones that are broken are on the second floor connected to the IDF switch, so maybe it’s a routing issue. 

We decided to get in touch with the site contact again but we can’t reach them for a few days via email, IM or phone. The contact finally decides to email us back and happily mentions that the phones are working normally as of a few days. Great, thanks for the notice. I’m glad I didn’t spend more time trying to solve the issue in the interim (sarcasm).

Now all the phones are working except the dead one. I email our contracting company to send a tech out to patch the phone back into the switch. The morning the tech is out there, I get a call on my way to work (keep in mind I’m one time zone behind). Surprise! It’s the tech we sent out to the site. He patched the phone back in, but it’s not pulling an IP. 

I remember seeing in the old running config that the port connecting the core switch and the unmanaged Netgear had a description of “Uplink to Netgear phone switch.” I tell the tech to plug the phone into the Netgear switch and Bam! It’s got an Ip and can make calls.

I tell my team about this interesting revelation, that the 192.168 subnet is still active our network. We have no idea how the rest of the IP phones are communicating with the PBX.  We also realize that, should a phone restart and lose its previous config, it would probably stop working altogether. We start pushing harder for the site upgrade, which is probably going to be 16k or so.

At this point, the issue of out of my hands so I forget about it. But lo! A text on my personal number (which I gave out for the contact to send pictures of the site) that a phone just stopped working after (you guessed it) it restarted. Still, I can’t do much about it now. The request is pending approval from senior execs and it’s not even in my team anymore. Plus, this happens on my second-to-last day, so I don’t want to add this to any last-minute tasks. 

In the end, I left before exec approval on the request. My coworkers took me out for a nice dinner on my last day and overall it was a rewarding experience. I’ve been offered the same position next summer so I hope then I can find out what happened then. 

TL;DR - Network upgrade (and some poor judgement on my part) causes phones to stop working and we could have planned for this if the company continued surveying each site before each upgrade.

P.S.

Since last summer, the company cancelled the internship program due to COVID, and no one else is really hiring interns :("

Trying out jobs and internships in the last 2 years has helped clear things up. **At this point, I'm struggling to find a path -- a Master's degree to begin in 2020, an entry-level job, anything--that aligns with my interests.** 

*The basics:*

I'll be 26 when I get my B.A.  I'm single and never planning on kids, so I'm fine with moving and/or traveling for my job throughout my life.

*My interests and strengths:*

* Concerned about our world / enthusiastic about making a difference, specifically for refugees and minorities. Stories from around the world really move me.
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
* Good at journalistic writing--I've contributed to student publications (op eds, articles) with an international focus
* Adaptable, open minded to learning about new cultures and going to new places
* Fascinated by YouTube documentaries and docuseries that focus on social issues; I'd be excited to make one or be a part of it (telling the stories)

*What doesn't work for me:*

* Working at a desk 40+ hours per week in a corporate setting
* S a l e s
* Constantly struggling financially--I'm fine with working my way up, but I don't want to struggle to live. I want to live well and eventually own a home.
* A stale, predictable work environment that doesn't challenge me with new assignments and people to meet on the regular
* Little room for growth--I think I'm a good leader, so I want to ascend

If anyone has any ideas or wants to brainstorm with me, I'd appreciate it! Thanks"

Departments are reduced to few employees and the workload is ginormous. My very first week I got called out at a meeting by my boss for asking too many questions. I was just trying to understand the work. It has only gone downhill from there. I was told after a month that I that my work was not up to par. The work requires technical skills which I lack but I was very transparent about it during the interview. I keep getting reminded of my lack of skills, and was told that although I’m learning, it only benefits me and not the company because it’s not fast enough.  

I also feel like mistakes are not an option, and I feel like I make a lot of them. It feels like this is not an internship, but cheap labor for the company. I get very little help, and I’ve been told by my boss that “they didn’t have time for this” when I ask a question about a task or try to find an innovative solution. This is putting a lot of strain on my mental health, as the work is stressful, I get little to no help from my supervisor and they are putting me down any chance they get. The very little self esteem I had is crumbling every day with that supervisor. I need a certain amount of hours in order to graduate, but beyond that, I am afraid that cutting the internship short will look bad on my CV. I also know that even having an internship with the pandemic is a miracle, and finding a job after I graduate will be even harder. I’m at a loss. It’s like I have to choose between my wellbeing and my future."

&amp;#x200B;

I always had a keen eye for art. When I was a teenager, I noticed I had a knack for picking apart details of a painting, whether it be on canvas or stretched across the sides of the buildings in the city I had called home. I would become momentarily entranced by every piece I saw, admiring its composition and the personality behind each paint stroke. But what really stood out most of all in every painting, were the colors. 

Hot reds and oranges were my favorites. Strong, bold, and almost painful to look at. They elicited the strongest feelings in me, almost making my blood move quicker in my veins when I saw them. Of course I always have a soft spot for a nice, warm yellow. 

It was no wonder that when I entered into the workforce, I ended up in a frame shop of all things, after a few years of job hopping. This was a place where I could ardently admire work that artists or their customers would bring in and spend as much time as I needed staring in adoration. It was the most rewarding job I had ever had. A far cry from the meaningless desk jobs or exhausting customer service line. 

For a long time I fervently thanked the owner of the workshop, June Mulligan, in my head every day. She brought me on because she said she “saw the spirit in me” and decided that she needed me on the team. The team of course consists of about four people, six in the holiday season. We had June, her wife Lilith, Brandon Warsaw (a graduate from a local college who studied wood work), and lastly me. The two people we hire in the fall and winter usually vary. We rarely have folks come back for another season. 

Not for any particular reason, the place was quite pleasant to work at, if at times a bit hectic. Some seasonal workers only came while they were in college, others just choose not to come back for personal reasons. Nothing especially sinister ever happened in this workshop. Everything was normal.

Was. That is the keyword. 

This… I don’t know exactly what to call it but this occurrence that happened in late February of three years ago has utterly and irrevocably broken me into **pieces**. 

It was at the end of the holiday season. Things had slowed down and we had just said fond goodbyes to our two seasonal employees. They were two exceptional young ladies who had actually been interns studying under June while they took a semester here in town. 

I could feel my body finally starting to decompress from all the pent up stress from pushing out order after order. Christmas, Hanukkah, several birthdays, Valentines day all rolled into one and went so fast that I barely had time to admire anything at all. It was quite frustrating and I was itching for a new piece to come in so that I could properly sit down and work with it.

At about half past three, when the shop was soon to be closed, I heard the bell to the shop door ring. I stepped out into the storefront to see a pleasant looking woman, short with impossibly long salt and pepper hair. In her hands she held a large rectangle package wrapped in brown paper, something I could only assume to be a painting or print of some sort. 

I greeted the woman happily and asked what I can do for her. She introduced herself as Mel, saying that she had done a painting and she would like to have it framed. 

“Wonderful!” I said, and I could tell my own face lit up like a firework. I offered to take the piece in her hands to the back while she looked at some framing options. She gladly handed the heavy painting over to me and turned to look at the sample wall. I eagerly walked to the back and when I rounded the corner, Lilith saw me. She beamed at me from her desk and told me to set it on the empty counter by the back wall and she’ll get some measurements. 

I pouted at her, I wanted to be the first one to see it. She laughed and shooed me away, so I went back to the front to help Mel pick out a frame. Something basic, she said, just a plain black frame will do. Simple enough. I asked if she would like us to demonstrate how the painting would look with the frame on it, but she said there was no need. 

I got some other details about how she wanted the piece framed, and by the time I had gotten that all written on our form, Lilith came back with the measurements. She had scratched them on a postit and just handed it to me, scurrying back to her desk to whatever bookkeeping she was no doubt trying to finish before we closed. I didn’t see her face, but from what I gathered from other people’s reactions, I am sure the painting also had no affect on her. 

I finished up the forms for Mel, and started calculating an estimate for her so that she could pay the down payment. The whole interaction was so utterly normal, it makes me so sick to think that what happened stemmed from this one, simple transaction. I don’t remember the total. She happily paid the installment needed, thanked me graciously, and said to me something that rings in my ears every night for the three years. She said to me-

“I hope the piece is not too loud!” I laughed, thinking she just meant that the colors she had used were very bright and vivid. She, however, did not laugh with me. Mel simply smiled, and turned to walk out into the snow flurries that had just begun to fall.  

I began to input the information I had taken into our computer system, and when I was typing in the customer information that Mel had written out for me I noticed that Mel was not short for Melinda like I thought it had been. The name that she had written was Melpomene Sound. An odd name but I’ve seen artists use weirder names. She must have been painting under a pseudonym.

After I finished typing the information into the computer, I filed away the paper form as a backup. From the front I heard a couple of the back computers chime as the notification for the order went through. 

I practically skipped into the backroom, overeager to see this ‘loud’ painting that the woman had brought in. Lilith however stood up before I could even fully round the corner. She told me that she was heading out for the day, and asked if I was okay closing up by myself, as she and June had a dinner planned this evening. I agreed of course, it’s something I’ve done hundreds of times over the years, why wouldn’t I be comfortable doing it. 

I said my goodbyes to Lilith and shut the shop’s front door behind her. Now, I practically jogged to see the painting. I was so thrilled and excited to finally be able to inspect it. As I said previously, I had not had the chance to fully admire a piece of art in a long time, and the itch I had was so close to being scratched and I was practically giggling when I walked up to the back counter. 

Lilith had recovered the painting loosely with the brown paper it came with, so that the piece was protected from dust and things while it was waiting to be stored properly. I gently grasped the paper and pulled it away from the painting and promptly let it fall onto the floor with a loud rustle. 

My god.

I could feel my jaw go slack as soon as I had lifted the paper. This painting was wholly the most beautiful and striking thing I had ever seen in my entire life. I knew at that moment that I had to purchase this painting from Melpomene. It **had** to be mine. She was not kidding when she said the word “loud”.

It was an abstract piece, splashes and swirls of color mingling together in the most divine way. They almost seemed to dance together, twirling in a mesmerizing display of shocking reds and warm blues that sung loudly and in such a way that made my heart sing as well. I had never seen blue used in such a manner, but it worked beautifully. More so, there were dozens of other colors sprinkled throughout, delicately accenting and complimenting the main colors perfectly.

It was painful to think that soon, I would have to give this piece back and probably never see it again. I hoped briefly that Mel might be a famous painter using a fake name, and that this piece would be hanging in a gallery one day so that I may gaze upon it once again. But even that thought was painful. I was sure that, to truly satisfy the aching song now playing in my heart, I would have to acquire this painting. 

I stared at the artwork for such a long time, completely entranced, that when my cell rang I jumped about a half mile into the air. I swiped and held the thing to my ear with a shaky “hello”.

“What are you still doing there?” June said in a concerned voice. “I haven’t gotten the notification for the alarm being set.”

I panicked and looked at the time. I swore audibly and profusely apologized to June, saying I had gotten caught up with the new piece and filing that I hadn’t noticed the time. The worry in June’s voice was apparent, but I seemed to appease her when I said that I’d be out of there soon. When I hung up, I had to lean against a chair.

It was eight in the evening. I spent four hours staring into that painting. I couldn’t believe it, it almost seemed impossible. Had I really gotten so caught in the intricate brush strokes that I lost all sense of time? I honestly thought it had only been twenty minutes. Sure enough, when I walked back out to the front of the shop, the sky was dark and the only things I could see were illuminated by the streetlight outside. My lone car in the parking lot, and snow threatening to block my car from being able to move. 

I quickly and as delicately as I could stored the painting so that it would be safe while we waited for Brandon to build the frame, gathered my things, and hurried out of the door. I worried that I might have been too late and that the roads might be impassable, but I managed to make it home unscathed. 

I haphazardly slapped together a meal, and fell into my bed when I was done eating. Being thoroughly exhausted, I thought I might fall asleep rather quickly. 

Yet when I had lain in my warm bed, I couldn’t seem to doze off. I tossed and turned for hours, practically begging myself to fall asleep. The only thing that I could seem to concentrate on was the crooning song that I couldn't hear, but could feel deep in my core now. It pulled at my muscles and urged me to move, to get up and walk. I tried for so long to suppress the feeling and relax, but nothing worked. I googled methods to try and lull myself to sleep, but they didn’t quite carry out, I’m assuming because I was too frustrated.

Finally I gave up and got out of bed. I began to pace around my apartment quietly and in the dark, trying to burn the theoretical energy I thought I had, when I noticed that the pull I was feeling was pulling me towards my door. Whatever it was, it wanted me to go outside. And so I did. I put on some slip ons and a large coat and walked outside into the frigid night air. 

Snow was still steadily falling, the night was almost deafeningly silent. Inside me, however, the song singing and rattling my bones was still playing. It was quiet and yet it roared so loud it hurt. I noticed that I was shaking, but not from the cold. I was shaking because my body wanted me to keep moving forward, it wanted me to walk.

I took a few steps before I stopped myself. Something was wrong, and I don’t mean the way I was feeling. I stared for a moment, almost not seeing what was in front of me, but suddenly realized what I was looking at. Across the street from my apartment was a fuel station, its lights normally glowing well into the wee hours of the morning. From what I could see, the lights had dimmed. Or so I thought.

The more I looked at the station, the more confused I was. The lights weren’t dim, it just appeared to be a different color. They appeared to be… gray. That couldn’t be right, however, the lights themselves were not colored. It was the hard plastic shell around the lighting that colored it. Had they replaced all the panels while I was away at work today?

But that also couldn’t be right, because when I looked even further, the paint that I remember accenting the building had also turned a dull shade of gray. I specifically remember the building having orange paint accents and lighting around the canopy. They wouldn’t have been able to change all of that so quickly. 

I felt the pull again, strong and demanding, and I automatically turned to walk in that direction. I stopped dead before I could take a second step. Where was my car? I thought I had parked it right outside, but the space that I thought held my car now held a different vehicle. Well it was the same vehicle, but the color was a dark muted gray. Yet it had to be my car, because in the rear-view mirror hung my parking pass that was given to me when I was in school. I never bothered to take it out. 

My stomach churned with panic. 

What was happening to me? I whipped my head around, trying to see what else had changed. What else had changed its color? It was useless, because the change hadn’t happened to my surroundings. The change had happened within me. Sometime between leaving work and getting home, I had lost all perception of color. Or had it happened even before I got home?

I desperately tried to remember the last time I saw a color, ANY color, but the only thing that screamed in my mind was that tragically magnificent painting. 

It took me hours to calm down. I did not sleep. I had eventually managed to pry myself off the concrete, apparently I had fallen in my panic, and made my way back into my apartment. I tried to keep my eyes closed, but I had to look. I had to see if my vision would come back. I’ve done some research on color-blindness, but rarely have I heard of someone being completely gray, let alone a woman. 

Futilely, I waited to see if it would come back. It did not. I phoned in to my doctor’s office to schedule a visit as soon as the office opened. I was happy to hear that they actually had a cancellation tomorrow and they could squeeze me in. Rare, indeed. 

I was scheduled in at work today, but I couldn’t bear to walk in there, unable to see the true beauty that waited for me in the storage bin. I debated for an hour on whether or not to call in, an action which wouldn’t cripple the store, but would still be felt when trying to work on production. 

I decided that wallowing in my own fear and sorrow wouldn’t do me any good, and that being productive would do me at least some amount of good. So when it was time for me to come in, I dutifully got ready and headed to work. I underestimated how much the change would affect me, and by the time I pulled into the parking lot I was in tears yet again. I did some breathing exercises to calm down, and dejectedly walked into the shop.  

As soon as I stepped foot through the threshold, I noticed the immediate change in my vision. It was so sudden, like someone had flipped a switch and everything was normal again. It startled me so much that I jumped and dropped my bag. 

June looked at me from the counter with concern.

“You alright?” She asked as she was flipping through some papers. I probably looked mad, I could feel sweat starting to drip from my forehead despite the blistering cold sweeping in from the still open door. I nodded shakily and shut the door, scooping up my bag with a sigh that was close to relief, but still laced with anxiety. June once again asked if I was okay and I assured her that everything was fine, I had just had a rough night and couldn’t get to sleep. 

I walked past the counter and went to put my stuff down. Briefly, I glanced over to where the storage bins were in the back, trying to get a peak at the painting, but I couldn’t see it where I had placed it last night. I walked fully through the doorway into the back, and saw it laying on the counter, Brandon hunched over it taking secondary measurements. 

I felt a heavy protective urge, but I managed to stifle it down as I stepped over to where he worked. He gave me a pleasant greeting as I saddled up to him, taking the pen and pad from him and writing down the numbers he softly spoke to me. I barely realized I was writing them, I wasn’t even looking at the notepad. 

I did feel relief was over me as I looked upon Mel’s painting. I could see every color, and while I was relieved, I still had a pang of worry. What had caused me to lose my color perception like that? Was I just hallucinating? Was I drugged? I waved that last thought out of my head, as I couldn’t recall a moment where I could have possibly been drugged. 

The worry ached in my gut, but my brain was abuzz with the excitement I felt from looking at the painting. I went about my day, helping Brandon cut wood for the frame and assemble the pieces. All the while, glancing over from the wood shop at the storage bins where we had placed the piece back after we’d gotten every measurement we needed. 

Again, I felt the longing, aching pull in my muscles. I thought, for a moment, that maybe the source of the pull might have been from the painting. That maybe, the need to have this piece of artwork in my life was so strong, its enchanting call so compelling, I was tangibly feeling it in my body. I thought how impossible that would be and carried on. Yet the thought had burrowed itself deep in my brain, and I couldn't be rid of it. I know now that I was correct in some regard.

How ardently I wish I had been wrong.

I maintain a good level of productivity while working, despite my current state of mind. I found the work distracting enough to pull my focus away from my fears. I felt accomplished even by the time four o’clock rolled around. 

I said my goodbyes, my eyes lingering on Mel’s piece for a second too long. June asked me if I was going to steal the thing, and we both laughed. Me, more nervously so. She didn’t seem to notice. 

I gathered up my bag and headed out the door, halfway expecting my vision to turn grey the second I exited. It did not however, and I shook my head. What had happened to me was probably just some weird hallucination, and I could bring it up with the doctor the next day.

Unfortunately, I wouldn’t get that far. 

I didn’t notice at first, but it was more obvious to me now that I was driving home in the daylight. My vision had been gradually going grey, the further I went from the frame shop. I began to feel the panic rise in me again. It gripped my body in a vice and I almost ran myself off the road. I pulled my vehicle to a stop on the shoulder, thinking that if I stopped, the graying would stop.

I was wrong. It continued to grey until every last speck of color had been wiped away from my sight. I felt my eyes swim and I just pressed my head against the steering wheel and wept silently. 

I don’t know how much time had passed but when I lifted my head up, the sun was going down. I cursed myself again, losing track of time is something I've rarely done and it brings anger ripping through my blood. The more I focused on my anger and anxiety, the worse things got. 

I had managed to bring myself home and burst into my apartment. I tried to pace to calm down, but it didn’t seem to be working again. I tried to sit down and meditate, tried every method I knew of to calm down and still, nothing served to quell my emotions. 

I even brought out my old boxing gear. I pulled the speed bag out of my closet and set it up in my living room. It always felt good to beat out my anger in the past when I had issues. But now as I exhaust myself further with my punches, I still feel disparity gripping at my soul. It was about eleven at night when I realized that something else had been going wrong.

The call.

It had gotten louder. Still I could not actually hear it with my ears, I could only feel its cacophonous canticle practically ripping through my body. It seared my body like hot iron, and the pain was immense. Tears streamed down my face AGAIN and I so desperately wanted them to stop. I wanted my exhaustion to stop. I wanted the pain to *stop*. I wanted this siren song to stop. I wanted the overwhelming and abysmal grey to **stop**.

I can’t say how I made it to the shop. I only remember fumbling desperately with the lock in the dark, practically whimpering as I pushed through the door. Again, as I step foot in the building, color springs forth and consumes my vision once again. I slammed the door shut and pressed my back to the cold glass. I began to weep, loudly and unrestrained. The song in my bones somehow grew louder and I sobbed even harder as I slid down to the floor. 

I crawled on my hands and knees to the back, snow falling off the jacket I had haphazardly thrown on my body. I dragged my aching body over to the storage bins and as delicately as I could, I extracted Melpomene’s painting from it’s shell. I tried to keep my tears from falling on its perfect canvas as I laid it out on the floor.

Still weeping I curled up close to the piece, hugging my body as close to it as possible while trying to keep my disgusting bodily fluids from ruining it. I lay like that for what felt like hours, wailing uncontrollably as the song rattling in my soul did not dampen. 

So slowly time moved and I had been screaming for so long. No one came for me. I was alone in this shop on the cold floor howling my lungs out and still no one came. Days had passed and the song grew larger and louder within me until I could bear it no more.

I blindly reached up to the counter closest to me, fumbling for the pliers that I knew were there. The only thing I thought is that the true way to silence this discordant hymn would be to just end it. Stifle out my own life to silence this never ending song.

I would rather not explain what I did to myself that night. The only thing you need to know is that what I did produced an alarming amount of blood. It covered the floor and seeped into Melpomene’s painting. Eventually in my crazed fit of self violence, I lost consciousness.

But I did not die.

I was abruptly awoken by two police officers and June standing over me. The officers looked a bit furious, but June mostly looked concerned. I stare up at them in confusion, and then back down at myself. There was no blood. 

The officers had to help me up off the floor and they sat me down while June examined the painting with a quizzical expression.

Apparently in my desperate haste to get to the shop, I had forgotten to unarm the alarm system. I had only been there for about 15 minutes apparently before they showed up. I thought about how impossible that was, but I didn’t say anything. My perception of time had been just as capricious as my color perception. 

They asked me questions that I could barely understand, not because I was confused, though that didn’t help. I couldn’t really hear them. Everything sounded muffled and I couldn’t quite comprehend anything they were saying. It was only when June tried to ask me why I had come down, and what was wrong with me, that I actually truly heard.

I couldn’t explain myself. If I explained myself, they would have me locked up, and that I was sure of. As if I could even really begin to describe what was happening to me in the first place. I could think of no other excuse as to what I had done, however. I just stayed silent. 

Eventually after so long of noncompliance, the officers began to lead me away. They packed me into their patrol car and placed me in the nearest hospital. I cannot recall anything between getting out of the police car and my second to last psychological evaluation in the hospital. 

The only thing I can recall is that when we were leaving the shop and driving away as June looked on with a solemn expression, the call began again.

And it only grew louder the further we drove.

Now, as I tell this story, I cannot in good faith say that all is right. The colors never returned to me. The world is grey and cold. And if I pay attention, if I concentrate hard enough, I can still feel the quiet song. The hymn-like chords creeping silently through my body. 

It pulls me still."
hpq9bb,2,2020-07-12,Current college student. Looking for tips for future,icefiji,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hpq9bb/current_college_student_looking_for_tips_for/,"Hello. I'm a current junior pursuing a Bachelors degree in Cybersecurity. 

My background:

My school requires me to complete at least 6 weeks of professional IT experience (240 hours to be exact). Since I'm a junior, next summer is the only chance I got. I'm stressing over it quite a bit since the anxiety is getting to me. If I don't land an internship, then I can't technically graduate. 

Currently, I have a CompTIA Network+ cert and I'm planning on getting the Security+ by the end of this month. If that goes well, I will try and go for CySA+ before the 001 retires. I decided to get these to help my chances of getting an internship. My school, for some reason, doesn't emphasize certifications... How are we, students, supposed to get an internship without some actual knowledge that is only taught after the 2nd year? (this is a whole different rant.. i won't continue)

I also applied to many companies last year for this summer(2020) but I never heard back from any of them. 

My question:

I applied to all different kinds of IT intern positions last year but didn't get accepted. If I get the Security+ alone, or even CySA+, will it significantly impact my chances of getting an internship?

I've been seeing many posts on this sub regarding help desk jobs and such, but I seriously don't know what I'm capable of. 

Also, if I were to get an internship and graduate with a good GPA, do I still start out at helpdesk? Would the value of my degree help me start at a better spot?"
hpqk6q,0,2020-07-12,Next steps for rising senior (BA Math) looking to work in software engineering,Piccolo-Signal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hpqk6q/next_steps_for_rising_senior_ba_math_looking_to/,"I'm a rising senior in a BA Honors Math program at a well-known school. I have good grades and have done well for myself in math (some grad level courses, a research paper pending publication, and an in-progress math thesis related to algorithms and complexity theory).

I've taken a few CS courses, such as theory of computing, data structures, compilers, and competitive programming (I took first prize in the end-of-term contest), but only 3 CS classes are on my transcript, since I took one class pass-fail, and dropped a couple of classes because of the poor instructional quality, despite having good grades.

I have also worked as a programmer for a research project with a professor. I developed a (admittedly patchwork) backend for his project using Flask and SQLite.

Programming and computers in general has been a major hobby of mine for many years. I'm a member of the school's Linux user group, and I tend to use fun, terminal-based alternatives to popular commercial software. It's hard to self-assess my abilities, but I feel like I write (vanilla) Python and C at a comparable level to my CS classmates. I used to write Java (and still can, to a point), and I've dabbled in JavaScript for the research project, as well as Go, Clojure, shell scripting, and some others. I know some basic principles of C++ but I don't like using it when I can avoid it.

Here's where I struggle:

- Being an arts major, I don't have access to the same career services and events as the CS majors.
- There are a few important concepts that I know fairly little about: operating systems internals, computer architecture, and database theory among them.
- I am unfamiliar with the fashionable frameworks and libraries of today (e.g. numpy, React, etc.), though I am a quick learner.
- At this moment, I'm out of practice in terms of interview-style problems.

What are my next steps for getting a job as a software engineer? Specifically, should I focus on more formal education (i.e. classes this year and maybe a master's program) or networking/leetcode/practical projects? Should I be looking for internships or jobs when I graduate?"
hpqndy,17,2020-07-12,A letter to my younger self,harley_pixel,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hpqndy/a_letter_to_my_younger_self/,"Do it today.  Do it before you care about more people who you never forget, but they won't cross the street for you after you've gone to the end of the Earth for them.  It never got easier like they said.  In fact... it got worse.  
You think finding Mom passed out with track marks is the biggest stab in the back,  after she sobered up to get us all back, only to slip again?  But, (you and i, we, us, me) I stayed.  Tell your brother you're to tired to come over the night you take thos pills. Let it be Mom who comes in to pass out on the couch and find you dead the next morning.  Don't let your brother know what you've done,  because deep down you know he cares.  Everyone cares,  but mostly they only care as long as you can help them.  Trust me you'll talk yourself out of it every time after that.  You'll know how upset everyone got and how it was so inconvenient, too (then you feel guilty for wasting everyone's time).
See here's how life never got easier:  That guy you're with?  He loves you and he shares similar goals of hard work and raising a family.  You have a son, he's the ONLY reason you fight to live today.  That man? He goes to war,  and war happens.  And, that crazy smile everyone knows him for?  You begin to hate it, because you are the one who sees the crazy behind it.  Despite,  working 60+ hours,  going to school full time,  working an internship, and raising a son- you will never do enough.  You literally work yourself into the hospital and it will never be the same.  The day you graduate college, you barely remember it.  A week later, you open your eyes, what little you can, and realize he's crying over your limp body thinking he's killed you... You finally realize if he doesn't kill you,  you'll kill yourself.  But.. you have a son and he is the ONLY reason you leave.  But, you left where he was just young enough to know that you left Daddy, but not remember the fighting.  OH! WAIT!! Want to hear something funny? All those hours you worked, after he came home, driving 2 hours day and night to visit him at the VA, guess what?  Everything you do for him, learning insurance inside and out,  learning appeals for state disability and VA hearings? 2 months after you get the balls to leave him,  he is acknowledged to be 100% fully disabled by PTSD.  He asks if you will now come back after learning he was given the back pay for those 3 years. He thought you'd come back for money.  Was he never more wrong. After you end up sick in the hospital, multiple organ failure, getting put into a medically induced coma he couldn't be bothered to turn around and come back to visit him.  You will close your eyes- crying,  scared, and alone. Waking up to not a single missed call,  you decide in that moment you never want to feel like you are going to die alone again, it is the moment you fell out of love with him.  3 months later you walk away.  That is the scariest time in your life.
You get your dream job and realize you're amazing at it, make friends, and even meet a wonderful guy. Your dream job... becomes the reason you can't leave.  You stay sick and end up dependent on the insurance company you work for... At least you have amazing medical care now.   But, you need it.  You're medical file is a mystery.  You lose a kidney and require daily antibiotics; the last infection was resistant to all but one drug.  This is a struggle that rips through you,  but at least we're strong. Working is how you get out of bed everyday, but eventually that barely becomes enough. Those friends.. Ha! You don't make friends at this age.  You eventually realize you're just the spare tire,  no one really cares or thinks about you unless you are a last resort.  That guy you meet...?  You fall in love, again, but don't worry he's still in love with his ex.  Our family loves him,  he is great with our son,  his daughter calls you her step mom.  But, he refuses to accept that he allowed you to fall this hard.  He still sees his ex,  he still sees those lithe chick's, but even though it hurts you- you're invested. You love him,  but you know his daughter would be crushed.  You love her, too.  But,  she was raised by her daddy and she,  like our son,  thinks her daddy walks on water.  
You're a giver. And you give everything, until nothing is left. Daily you walk through life empty handed with nothing to show for all the work you've put in. You put yourself into unimaginable debt putting Mom into rehab. No one is here for you tonight as you cry yourself to sleep.  No one wants to hear your sob story, your hospitalizations become routine to your family, death is your best friend,  but your scariest memory.
So,  I beg you.  Do it now.  16 years later,  it doesn't get easier.  It only gets worse. If you don't,  can't,  won't finish the job... do us a favor? Just don't care about people.  Live your life.  Move away when you get that chance. Keep your expectations of how people should treat you low.  They will never treat you as good as you will them."

hprjm4,7,2020-07-12,"Mature Student, still unsure of Path",TobaccoTomFord,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/hprjm4/mature_student_still_unsure_of_path/,"Just want to start off by saying I love the support and community of my subreddit. I find myself often lurking or giving advice, but it's honestly so hard to diagnose yourself when there are so many blindspots. I hate opening up about myself but I love the insights of this subreddit.

I'm late 20s M, mature undergrad student studying Finance or Accounting (not really sure what I want, I'll get to that). I never knew what I wanted for the longest time, thus starting school when I was 25. Prior to this, I just worked a lot of retail sales type of jobs. I finally decided to go back to school to do Accounting because I honestly had no idea what I wanted to do and thought it was time I kicked myself in the ass, bite my tongue, and just get a damn stable job. I am an INFP to the T, if you guys are familiar with the MBTI.

Fast forward, I am now in my 4th year and set to graduate in another year or so. I have a 90% average, and have done an internship in FP&amp;A and one as an auditor in public accounting. I'm also involved with my school's endowment investment fund (it's a really competitive program where only \~10 students are admitted each year). You'd think life would be great and I have my career journey all set for some type of high finance or management consulting, or public accounting role...

The thing is, I'm sort of a fraud. Not a cheater - but I have gotten to where I am by being a great public speaker (Which is funny because I am actually a very introverted/homebody type of person, it's just something I must have gotten better at from working retail for so long, or just something innate that I never really had to practice or think about much). In fact, I really believe that is my communications skills that have sold me on every opportunity I have received, whether it be competitive programs within school or jobs. I sort of actually really suck at finance and accounting - I'm not very good at math, nor am I very analytical; it usually takes me double the time of all of my peers to do something. This makes me self-conscious to apply for jobs related to my field or program, because I honestly just don't think I can compete with my peers, or just high-finance calibre seeking students across my country at all, whom are all looking for these lucrative jobs (that are generally available to students in university endowment investment funds). This program has sort of broke my confidence in a way... and sometimes I feel like I'm better off just being a regular student rather than having the spotlight on me.

Which brings me to ""what should I do next"". Well, what I really enjoyed was my entrepreneurship courses. I loved identifying opportunities and then getting your hands dirty and creating a vision with your ideas. Knowing this, I don't feel like high finance is an option for me but I should probably do something that involves creativity, communication and public speaking - someplace or somewhere I can really leverage my charisma, without being so super analytical/quantitative/numbers based.

So here are my thoughts on what I should do, would love everyone's feedback on these options:

1. going back to public accounting - since I have experience, I am sure I can go back and get another job with a Big4, grind out a few years and get my CPA. I've weighed this as 'can't go wrong' option because of the versatility of the CPA post auditing career. Con is the stress, and generally low pay relative to hours worked.
2. something sales/marketing related - I would change my major all together and take the classes I actually enjoy - and honestly i feel become a lot happier. I think there are less up-side of jobs, or even any jobs at all than accounting/finance given covid... but my mental health would be a lot better. Con: marketing degrees aren't as marketable as finance, no pun intended. This also probably means leaving my investment program.
3. what other jobs involve public speaking? I get that the degree is just a degree at the end of the day and it is what you make out of - but what other careers can I pivot to given the foundational skills I already have? Ideally, something I can get right out of gate of university, or work/gain experience to work towards would be ideal.

Aside from this, I have a background in P&amp;C insurance sales, and I am passionate about fitness. My BHAG: own a business someday. Sorry about the long read.

tl;Dr - I am a mature university student, studying accounting/finance, great grades (but just work hard in school); not actually really good at accounting/finance, really skilled in public speaking/communications - what careers can I pivot to with my charisma?"

hpx0os,4,2020-07-12,Wondering if I should stay at my internship or look for new opportunities,reddingBobulus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hpx0os/wondering_if_i_should_stay_at_my_internship_or/,"I took an internship in San Jose, California in December 2019. It's slightly above minimum wage with two weeks of vacation and health insurance. I took this job right out of going through around 6 months of the programming school [42](https://42.us.org), which I started right out of high school. I do not plan to go back to 42, and this is my first full-time programming job excluding a few Upwork contracts.

However, it seems that more than an internship in the sense that I began the job with a lot of responsibility. I am one of three developers in the ~25-person company and the only one who does it full-time. But I often do not feel competent enough to do their tasks as fast or as well as they need. My tasks right now involve learning lots of embedded C and low-level networking on Debian, fixing a C++ plugin for an obscure program with no documentation, and creating a program in C++ QT in a few weeks. This is on top of interacting with subtractors and customers, along with learning how to use the hardware and math behind the company's product and its industry ([Fiber Bragg grating sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Bragg_grating#Fiber_Bragg_grating_sensors)). I had some mentorship when I was at the office, but I have relied on Google as I work from home until the 17th due to the pandemic.

The company culture does not have me receive deadlines; I have tasks that I need to do for each day, assigned by my non-programmer manager with input from me. The company only started using Git and Azure a month or so before I joined, and it is rarely used. While there's an effort to start organizing the company's workflow with CMMI and other processes, so many projects are critically late that it gets put in a low priority. Thus, I am often a key person in a project worth five (sometimes six) figures despite never having worked as a programmer (or even a real job) before. It's frustrating and stressful because I feel that a lot of the company's failures come from its management disfunction and disorganization, which I want to help improve but have not.

I took this job with the expectation that I would leave when I would find a new job, though I put it off for a while. As I write this, I start thinking that my issues with the company are a reflection of my insecurity, lack of maturity/work ethic, or a lack of skill. I have been programming since I was eleven, though mostly in Java and web development so I am learning embedded C and C++ as I work. I have hesitations about finding a new job because I wanted to keep adding to my work experience. Now that it's been six to seven months, would you say that is a long enough time spent at one company to switch without it looking bad? Are there any risks to staying at my job versus finding a new one, or even quitting?

Apologies if this is a rant; I need to get this off of my chest to people who understand the situation."

Hey guys!

I need some advice. I am currently a rising junior with a major in computer programming. Due to being indecisive and exploring other career choices (and not wanting to waste more time) I decided to choose computer programming over comp sci since it would require less classes and money since I had already invested in community college. I really enjoyed math and science in HS but I didn't want to get all wrapped into those subjects and focus mostly on the programming side to comp sci.

So far, I've taken courses in different programming languages and learned most of the fundamental programming concepts. That being said I am feeling a little anxious that I will not be as prepared as other comp sci grads for a software engineering position. At this point I have not gotten an internship but have made a couple of projects; the computer programming major at my school is primarily focused on more of a project modality than tests, which I really like.

So the questions is that is a computer programming degree really that worth it? Should I switch/transfer to a computer science major? The problem is that I have already invested quite a bit of money and time and I want to jump into my life after college at this point.

What should I do guys!?"

I know that's degrading, but I had no other choice, I was shifting careers after dropping out of my Masters due to a mental health breakdown and in India where I live, that was the only way I have to shift careers.

Now here comes the entitlement I want to speak about. After those 8 months, the CTO had a chat with me 4-5 WEEKS after I expressed interest in a full time position. And get this, he tells me that I have the skills but since their company develops data solutions, I need to be able to come up with real world problems that my skills can be applied to.

I was fuming, isn't it the upper management's job to get contracts from other businesses whose problems they want to solve and then tell us that this is the problem, now solve it? This guy was sitting there, asking me to do that complete process, his fucking entitlement was something to see.

Luckily (unfortunately in hindsight), I thought about a potential problem and laid it to him, and made some progress solving it, after which I was hired.

Now, 7 months into the job, I hate it, I absolutely despise it with every fibre of my being, it turns out that the upper management really is incapable of bringing in projects and contracts from other businesses. I am working on a dead end project now and that CTO is taking out his frustrations on me by saying shit like I need to communicate more and be more social with my co workers.

I have been applying to jobs since 3 months now, must have sent around 1000+ applications, have had 4-5 interviews that went till the final stage but no results.

I absolutely despise being a wage slave in the current system but that's all I can do.

* Graduated 2018 from a top ~10ish CS school (public state school) with 3.9+ GPA
* Worked in industry at a FANG type company for 2 years now
* 3 internships, two at national labs, but ZERO traditional research experience
* Can't leave my current job until at least March 2021

The problem I'm trying to solve is, I currently have no traditional research experience, and no real academic references. My question is, what is the most realistic route to take from here? Some options I've been considering are:

- Volunteer at a lab in my spare time ASAP and apply to a one year masters program for Fall 2021, then PhD Fall 2022.
 - Could I get enough experience and references this way in the next several months while working full time?
- Volunteer at a lab in my spare time ASAP and apply to PhD programs for Fall 2021.
 - If I can get experience in the next several months, would that make me a strong enough PhD candidate?
- Try to get a job as an RA/lab tech/volunteer in March 2021 and then apply to either an MS or PhD program for Fall 2022

Through a friend I received a contact and some help with applying to my dream company.

Here's where I need some advice. My school is focused mainly on C programming, OS, Shell, Embedded stuff,  with some x86 and cpp thrown in. But my dream is to work in Sec, what are some projects or work I can do to make me stand out in the application process? I currently don't have much experience apart from some Hack the Box.

What would be some recommendations on what I can do to make it seem a bit more worth while for them to take me on?"

I'm a self taught web developer since Feb 2019 and aspiring to be a full stack developer. I started with frontend and started learning server side and databases 4 months ago. 

I did one interview process already for a pure software engineer internship but I failed that one in my 3rd interview which was data structures and algorithms heavy. They said no studying was required for that 3rd interview programming assessment. Now I been studying data structures and algorithms daily. The internship I applied for now we have to do a full stack project to qualify but I know this isn't the norm from what I've heard. 

I'm sure for a pure full stack developer role the interview process would a bit different.

I'm busy doing finishing touches to my portfolio, studying common interview questions, studying data structures and algorithms everyday in Javascript.

What can I expect the interview process to be like for a junior full stack developer?"

I am a rising junior, OOS tuition payer (international for practical purposes) and my parents and I think that it is not worth 18K to have a full online semester because it is literally like watching any other classes online and it is definitely not what we are paying for. I won't be able to build meaningful relations with professors and research is going online/remote as well, which is particularly useless for me because I work in a lab that deals with human subjects. I am certain I am going to take this semester off and work for the family business because there is a strict lockdown where I am from and little scope for internship. I am interested in a masters in comp bio/ bio stats or bioinformatics. So I have a few questions:

To people that have graduated in winter, how does it affect your grad school plans and employment prospects, if at all. I am just want to know what I am getting myself into. How do you recommend spending time in an off semester.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

hqdwc0,19,2020-07-13,[University] Opportunities to take up during gap year,sanicsuper,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hqdwc0/university_opportunities_to_take_up_during_gap/,"Hi there! These few months had been a hectic period where we are all eagerly waiting to get our university application results and having this Covid-19 pandemic made the process even harder (slowing down of application process, huge competition for university placements, etc). For those who have secured a place in a university, congratulations!! But for those who did not, I empathise with you.

A little background about me is that I had just graduated from polytechnic this year and initially applied for the Work-Study Post-Diploma Programme (WSP) for the April intake and secured a company to work under for that programme. However, 2 weeks before the semester was supposed to commence (end of May), the company withdrew their application from WSP and that resulted me in not having a job and also ruining my chance in applying for university (as by the time I have gotten the news from the company, the application dateline for all universities had passed). This got me so depressed at that period of time. Fast-forwarding a little, I received an offer from SIT after doing last minute late application to the school. During the period of time between getting “retrenched” and waiting for an update from SIT, I did some research on how to make full use of my time (as I thought the chances of going to university were close to 0 and I have to take a gap year). As such, I have decided to share with you, especially to those who are planning to take a gap year, everything I know about any programmes or internship opportunities to take up at this period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Opportunities offered right now:**

**1.	Work-Study Programme (WSP) – Post Diploma**

Applicable for: Singapore Citizens, PR, and NSmen from Polytechnic

Application period: Any time till commencement period

Upcoming commencement period: October 2020 (every April and October)

More info: This programme is for you to gain industrial experience while testing your discipline by having to balance between work and study (an example of the programme’s weekly schedule is 2 “school” days and 4 “work” days).

[https://programmes.myskillsfuture.sg/WorkStudyIndividualProgrammes/Portal/SkillsFuture\_WorkStudyProgrammes\_IndividualFAQ.pdf](https://programmes.myskillsfuture.sg/WorkStudyIndividualProgrammes/Portal/SkillsFuture_WorkStudyProgrammes_IndividualFAQ.pdf)

(Also search up Work-Study Post Diploma Programme in your polytechnic school website to see the courses offered and the relevant diplomas they are looking for.)

Note:

a.	Please be careful of the time taken to finish WSP if you are planning to apply for university next year (AY2021) as this programme usually takes 12-18 months to complete, which means that it will approximately be completed in Sep 2021 (12 months) and it will clash with all local university semester commencements.

b.	If you are interested in applying for a course that is not closely related to the diploma you have, you will need to get interviewed with your school so that they are able to access you and see if you are suitable for it. If you have the relevant diploma, your application will be accepted by your school and they will immediately send out your documents (resume, cover letter, etc) to all the companies that have signed up for the course that you applied for.

c.	This programme is only applicable for 3 years from when you have completed your course of study (ORD for National Servicemen). Eg. If you have graduated in 2020, you can only apply between 2020 - 2022 (2020 – 2024 for NSmen peeps).

d.	If there are no participating companies or insufficient students applying for it, that specific course in the programme will not be opened for that semester.

e.	You will gain a $5,000 sign-on incentive: $2,500 after officially registering for the programme (without the company withdrawing from the programme) and another $2,500 after completion. (The incentive benefit will be forfeited if you did not complete the programme.)

&amp;#x200B;

**2.	Work-Study Programme (WSP) (Joint University Programme) – Specialist Diploma**

Applicable for: Singapore Citizens, PR, and NSmen from Polytechnic

Application period: Any time till commencement period

Upcoming commencement period: October 2020 (every April and October)

More info: Some of the participating universities include SMU, SIT, and SUSS. (Search up Work-Study Post Diploma Programme in your polytechnic school website to see the courses offered and the relevant diplomas they are looking for.)

Note: To my knowledge, the information is similar to Post Diploma. However, the difference is that if you have done well for this programme, you can get the opportunity to continue studying in the University to obtain a Bachelor’s Degree (you can also get exempted for some modules you’ve already done under this programme).

&amp;#x200B;

**3.	#SGUnitedTraineeships Programme**

Applicable for: University, Polytechnic, ITE and other private educational institutions fresh graduates (AY2019 and AY2020)

Application period: Any time from 1 June 2020

Upcoming commencement period: -

More info: This is suitable for those who are unsure of the industry they are pursuing and can use this opportunity to “test the waters”. This will be an internship with a contract of approximately 12 months.

Note:

a.	Use #SGUnitedTraineeships on [www.mycareersfuture.sg](https://www.mycareersfuture.sg)  to find traineeship posted jobs.

b.	Take note of each job application’s closing dateline (jobs will only last around 30 days from the date posted).

&amp;#x200B;

**4.	Other opportunities I have heard of but not knowledgeable enough to advise:**

a.	Work-Study Certificate

b.	SkillFuture Series (various online courses that can enhance your portfolio)

&amp;#x200B;

If you are taking a gap year but are not planning to take on any job or internship opportunity, that is totally okay too as I understand that everyone deserves a break, or some of you may be taking the time to emotionally/physically recover from school (I have some friends who emotionally suffered through poly and barely made it) and that is okay. Just wishing everyone all the best for your future endeavors!

If I have made any mistakes somewhere or if you guys have more things to add on, feel free to leave a reply so we can help one another. My DMs are always open too! Thank you for making it through this long post!"
hqeqdk,10,2020-07-13,TIFU by Accidentally Leading All Wedding Guests to Eat The Dessert Favors Before The End of The Wedding,bri7154,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hqeqdk/tifu_by_accidentally_leading_all_wedding_guests/,"Hopefully the title makes sense, if not, it will soon. This happened several years ago, when I was in highschool. I didn't know about this subreddit then, but I remembered the story today and thought it would be a good share.

A family friend, who is like a little sister to my mom, was getting married. We all loved her fiance and were super excited for this marriage. The day of the wedding, my mom picks me up from my internship and we drive out.

The wedding was at this beautiful rented hall with a charming rustic vibe. My mom and I are some of the first people to arrive. We dont know anyone else, so we're just hanging out around a standing table (not sure what they're actually called, the tall ones you stand at or need tall chairs) when I notice something. In one corner, there's a table with SO MANY krispie kreme donuts on it. The family friend and her fiance met at a gym and are kinda fitness nuts, and krispie Kreme Donuts are their absolute favorite cheat treats.

I point out the table to my mom, and we go check it out. To the left of the table is a chalkboard sign that says ""Donut forget to take one home!"" On the table, there are bags to take the donuts home in. I also point this out to my mom, and we debate for a few minutes about if they are for now or later. I'm fairly certain they're for after everything, for the guests to take home, but my mom is convinced that itll be fine if we eat one each now. We're both hungry and it's going to be a while before the eating part of the wedding, so I figure it wont hurt for us to have a snack now, and I give in to my mom. We use the bags to hold the donuts and head back to our table.

We probably would have gotten away with this, but the other guests who had arrived notice that we have donuts. A few of them find their way to the donut table. Then a few more. Then more as more arrive. Eventually, the entire table is empty, completely devoid of delicious sugary calories even before the ceremony had began.

After the wedding, the new husband and wife head over to the donut table, so excited to eat their favorite treat, only to find that they're already gone. Our family friend told my mom about this, how disappointed they were that they didn't get to eat any, and how confused they were that they were already all gone. My mom sympathized, and definitely did not tell her that WE were the ones who started eating the Donuts before we should have.

Today, the couple are very happy and have just welcomed their second son into the world. I still feel kinda bad about what we did, and I really hope they've had enough Donuts since then to make up for it!

TL;DR: Went to a wedding, saw a table of donuts meant to be taken home after the wedding, but then led the guests in eating all of them before the ceremony even began. The newlyweds didn't get any of the donuts, and still dont know why it happened."

hqgxvp,0,2020-07-13,Middle eastern (Lebanese)(currently pursuing a bachelor's degree) assessing my options to travel to Germany,littyhead,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/hqgxvp/middle_eastern_lebanesecurrently_pursuing_a/,"Hello, I'm from the middle east (Lebanon), and I'm expecting to graduate (bachelor's degree in computer science) next year. I'm planning to start learning german soon, so I'll probably have a year's worth before I'll have to travel. 

My first option would be to apply to a university(English taught master's program in computer science) in hopes of getting a student visa. Regarding my finances, Lebanon is currently going through an economic crisis, our national currency lost most of its value, so the support that my parents could've offered before now dropped a lot. I'm skeptical if they can even pay half (10,236 euros per year) of what is required for my living expenses. If they can scrape up enough money from their savings to get me a 1-year residence permit, I have some questions about working to cover a certain amount of money once I get there. I know that I'm only allowed and able to work for approximately 70-80 hours a month. I was wondering if I can get a job relevant to my major while studying so hopefully, I'll be getting more than the minimum wage offered for classical student jobs. I know that it's really risky to be heavily dependant on my job to cover most of my living expenses but I don't seem to have a lot of options. I also wanted to ask about the schedule of a master's program. Is it more flexible than a bachelor's program does it vary based on different circumstances? I've also been looking into the freelance visa and I wanted to enquire about the chances of that working out for me. Also, I read that if I didn't have enough savings, my parents can sign a pledge if they had enough income or savings of their own. Is there a way that I can get money from my parents on a monthly basis instead of the blocked account option. 

Due to my dire circumstances, I've been considering maybe looking into a work visa rather than a student visa.  I realized from my basic job search that IT jobs are in demand in Germany, but I still have my doubts over why I fresh graduate like me could get accepted(I have a few internships for work experience but that's it). 

I know that I'm in a really bad situation where it's unlikely that I'll be able to make it to Germany and survive, but I thought I'll ask anyway.

PS: I didn't find my university while using anabin, but I was surprised that a lot of other universities in my country weren't found there as well. Does that mean that I'm not eligible or is there some other way to check?"

hqi0x7,0,2020-07-13,What to do next?,part_dead,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hqi0x7/what_to_do_next/,"I am 2nd Year ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) student from India, and I have been coding since I was in Tenth (in C++) grade but I stopped in between for the first year of my college (at that time I was just solving 1 question in 2-3 weeks, like a hobby). 

Soon after starting my 2nd year in college, I realized that Electronics was not meant for me and I decided to pursue a career in CS. To do that I thought that I will do a Masters degree in CS and started solving some problems (in Java) from Codechef and Hackerrank consistently (in between this I tried Javascript and Front end Development for about a month and didn't enjoy it at all so quitted that too). 

Soon I realized that all this was probably not enough and I needed to work towards a more concrete goal (like being a Data Analyst or Web Developer). So I talked to my friends about this, mentioning my love for algebra and problem solving, I asked them what should I do next? They told me to try out Machine Leaning.

So I enrolled in the Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew NG (for which I learned MATLAB) and at the same time I had a mandatory 5 week Internship from my college, in which I was lucky enough to get an ML based project, ""Analysis and Prediction of Stock Market Prices"" (for which my group used Python). During the project, I felt everything was very rushed and I was not getting to learn much which was not helped by the fact that our mentor showed zero interest in the project. The project turned out to be okay but the whole experience made me want to take a break from ML, so I again just started solving random problems but this time in Python. 

At this point, I have tried out more than 4 languages in the span of 3 years and feel very confused as to what to do next and what should be the goal for my future. If any of you have any suggestions for me it will be highly appreciated. Also, should I pursue a Masters degree or just try to go for placements after college?

P.S: If there are any people that did their Masters degree abroad and want to share their experiences then they are more than welcome to do so."

The pay is decent.

I'm wondering if I should take my chances by rejecting this offer and applying to other companies for the summer. The reason I consider this a risk is because I have no prior internship experience. I also had a hard time getting interviews last year.

Should I reject this offer and try to find a better summer internship instead, or should I accept this offer and try to look for other full time jobs?

I'm looking for companies that offer data science roles (mostly in the financial sector just because that is where most of my experience is in and I am comfortable dealing with finance-based data -- even though I've applied to firms from other industries).

The roles I've applied to include junior data scientist, entry-level data scientist, data analyst, junior data analyst, quantitative analyst, internships pertaining to the aformentioned roles, and other similar roles. I applied to all sorts of companies (start-ups, small-medium size companies, big firms, and even public sector). In the beginning (before COVID-19 pandemic), I've interviewed a couple of times. But then the pandemic came and these companies went on hiring freezes.

I've applied nearly 2,000 times and only either got ignored or automated rejection emails. I used job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, Google, Upwork, ZipRecruiter, USAJobs, and Angel List. I've also directly applied on company websites. I've even directly messaged company recruiters and pertinent managers on LinkedIn if that company had a job post.

During this pandemic I've been learning new technical skills, built a COVID-19 dashboard and working on a machine learning trading algorithm (see details in resume on bottom of post).

I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. I've posted my resume (anonymized) on the bottom of this post. I even optimized my resume through a paid service on [resumeworded.com](https://resumeworded.com/) to make it more ATS friendly. (and no this is not an advertisement for this service haha)

If anyone has advice on how I can improve my resume or what I can do to better my chances of being offered interviews please let me know. Much appreciated!

Hi {insert name},

We want to thank you for taking the time to interview us for our internship track.

Unfortunately, the team has decided not to move forward with your candidacy.

**But!** You can apply to our internship track and interview again as soon as you brush up on some basic programming concepts. Some suggestions on how to do this are:

* Take more high school CS courses and read ahead of your class.
* Take online courses from Coursera, Udemy in Algorithms and Data Structures. 

**Also**, you can still check out our mentoring track here and apply for it. This track gives you an opportunity to make incredible personal projects with graduates from top CS colleges.

Let’s build something awesome, together!

I just finished my bachelor degree in Computer Information systems two months ago. Now, I am kind of lost for directions of what I need to do to advance my career. Here's my background: 

\- 3 months of Computer Lab Assistant for a private college (2016)

\- 9 months of Tech Support for the Department of Education (2018 - 2019)

\- Current internship for Department of City Planning: IT Service Intern, started Feb 2020 (Started working from home since late March) 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to move towards system admin positions. I love playing around with Windows Server 2016 and 2019. Right now, the tasks that I am doing it mostly software/drivers update. Using ZENworks and BMC Client Management for storage tasks. 

Base on my background, can you guys provide suggestions or recommendations on what I should pursue so that I can land my system admin role after this internship? Thank you."

&amp;#x200B;

I  recently got an offer to do a co-op with a company for next spring.  However, this co-op interferes with summer internships and I am a rising  junior. I am a little interested in the co-op; however, I don't know if  I want to work for that company (for personal reasons) after I  graduate. The co-op is also in an industry that I have no interest in.  The pay is decent.

I'm wondering  if I should take my chances by rejecting this offer and applying to  other companies for the summer. The reason I consider this a risk is  because I have no prior internship experience. I also had a hard time  getting interviews last year.

Should  I reject this offer and try to find a better summer internship instead,  or should I accept this offer and try to look for other full time jobs?  (For background purposes, I have a perfect gpa and several side  projects and cs related activities. I am also going to be a junior this  fall so I'm hoping this would help as well.)  Thanks!"

hqsnci,2,2020-07-13,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (7/13/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/hqsnci/weekly_job_qa_thread_7132020/,"Hi all,

Here is the twentieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer? That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

Whenever I read through CS subreddits it just makes me depressed, but I do understand that what I'm seeing are probably the top 10% of CS students. So where do the rest of the average CS students go?

Assuming the top CS students are the ones that not only get top grades in school, but also code as their hobby, grind leetcode, and get into big-N companies.

Where do the average students who don't religiously grind leetcode, have basic school projects on their resume, do little coding outside of school, but still do pretty well GPA wise end up?"
hqst6w,1,2020-07-13,How to help depressed family members?,Yidhkshskhsusj,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hqst6w/how_to_help_depressed_family_members/,"My brother (22) has been depressed for a couple years but I didn’t notice it till recently. I’m a college student so I haven’t been home much just during Christmas and thanksgiving breaks and during the summer but last summer I had a full time internship so I only saw my brother for a couple hours in the evening when I got home. This summer though with Covid my brother lost his job and I lost my internship so it’s been the two of us at home all day and that’s how i started to realize just how deep this went. His depression is a big mix of issues that I think were kind of always bottled inside the main reason is his girlfriend broke up with him two years ago and honestly it was just a really toxic relationship (all take no give from her) she was very callous when they broke up and continued to insert herself in his life, contacting him just to let him know that she was over him, that she had moved out (somewhere she can now have whoever she wants over), telling him she got therapy and he should to, etc all while she was blocked so she would show up to our house or email him or contact him other ways.  Another part of it is he’s stressed about the future, not just cause of Covid, but he’s always been stressed about money cause while we didn’t grow up dirt poor we did watch our mom struggle a lot growing up (never knowing if we’d have water or power when we got home from school, never asking for anything as simple as socks because we never knew how bad money was, etc. Our dad left when we were really little and honestly wasn’t really in our lives until we were almost in high school, to tell us he had a girlfriend and that she was due to have a baby in a week (turned out to be the next day) when he took us to his house (that we had never been to or known where it was) it just kept becoming a bigger stab watching him love his new family, watching them not struggle for anything and I know both me and my brother still resent him for it even if he has tried to make amends for the past, we are really close to our mom and we will never forgive him for the pain he caused all of us. I know this is a lot I just don’t know what’s relevant and what not and I just keep writing. Anyways I thought he was talking to his life coach in the phone outside like he does every day, we’ve been trying to find him a therapist but nobody we called is taking new clients since Covid, I went outside to ask him what he wanted with dinner am I saw 4 empty beer cans next to him and him just lying on the bench (he’s not a drinker so that immediately freaked me out) and he’s been on anti depressants for about a week so I got him inside and started making him pound water especially after finding out he had also taking some hard liquor (I don’t know how much) two of his friends are here now and they’re all talking in the back but idk what to do. I’m supposed to go back to school in 3 weeks but I don’t want to leave him alone at the house. We are thinking of making him go stay at my dads house during the day since my stepmom works from home and my little sister is there but idk if that will just make him madder or what. I’ve convinced him to come stay at my apartment for a week when I go back. I just don’t know what to do, I want to take a year off maybe so I can stay with him but 
1. I know it would just make him worse cause he’ll feel responsible for me pausing my schooling (he’s always been adamant about me finishing) 
2. I can’t afford to not be in school/ working so idk how much id even be home since I’d have to get a job 

This was really long but if those who read this could please give me some advice I’d greatly appreciate it"

I am currently back in college pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, currently a Sophomore in standing with a previous B.S. in liberal arts.

I have roughly 7 years of sales experience but 0 professional software development experience, nor any internships.

I recently applied to a \[non-FAANG tech company\] for a software development internship.

After looking at my experience, they responded back suggesting sales/marketing roles and have sent a follow-up e-mail encouraging me to apply.

Does anyone have any experience in switching from sales to software development once employed?

Is it inadvisable to accept non-software dev internships while I'm trying to change careers?

I wouldn't mind getting some professional experience in the technology industry but I want it to focus on the subject I'm studying in my classes."

The peer pressure is just too real. So I aim to get involved in some researches in my sophomore year.

I know GT is a college that emphasizes a lot on research, but what would be a good way to get started, with little network as a new transfer student? Do you need to know a professor or take her/his courses to join the research? My major is mathematics, considering a CS double major."

**G.P.A:** 3.1 / 4 (Got an extremely high upward trend but probably the aspect I'm most worried about)

**GRE:** Verbal (161) Math (166)

**Letters:**

* One from my PI, very good relationship.
* One from a clinician who sponsors/consults for a medical device start-up I co-founded, very good relationship and is renowned in their field.
* One is from a professor whose course I've taken, and who has collaborated with my research lab and can vouch for my academics which might help the GPA(teaches an extremely challenging engineering grad-level course on campus, recently got an A in it), relationship isn't as strong as previous two but still strong.

**Research experience:** 1 year of research in mechanical engineering lab. COVID cut alot of my projects short since undergraduate students haven't been allowed in labs since early spring.

**Work experience:** 3-Month Paid internship for a European Medical Device company in designing/engineering catheter mechanisms and urological devices. Company is well-known in Europe. Considering possibly getting my supervisor here to write a letter.

**Publications:** Co-Author of two published papers (one for my research lab, and one is independent but related to my start-up.) Will try to get more but COVID might make it tough lol

**Recognition/awards:**

* Winner of over 6000$ in grants and business awards for start-up, featured by University Program.
* Deans list

**Misc activities that might be relevant:**

* Organizer of mentoring program for engineers.
* TA for fluids class and a programming class.

**Research interest:** Medical device design (would love something similar to my work internship), or microfluidics. ETH Zürich has a lab I'd love to work in and takes Master's students, and I will likely contact this lab and reference it in my application.

I will likely apply to other masters programs in Europe and in the US as well

hr2r1m,2,2020-07-14,How do I effectively ask for a promotion/raise based on my situation and Covid-19 in general?,PM_chris,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hr2r1m/how_do_i_effectively_ask_for_a_promotionraise/,"Edit based on Stickied mod thread - location NYC. 

TL;DR: I go into a lot of detail explaining the org changes and other shifts that have me doing a LOT more work these days, and sitting higher in the organization. I'd like advice on how to ask for a raise in these uncertain times, and how much I might be worth. 

I am less than 30, with about 5 years experience managing IT Projects and Operations in a few diverse environments. I'm PMP, ITILv3, AWS-CCP, and previously (expired) SAFe Agilist certified. 

I was hired as an IT Project Manager in October last year, making just over $100k annually. I did good work, and managed maybe 3-4 concurrent projects at a time. Late 2019/ early 2020, I made sure a big IT integration got done, that had a lot of visibility. Even though I wasn't there long, I got a small pay increase (less than $1000 annually) and an additional $1000 bonus at the end of the year, since my management wanted to ensure I was compensated for doing a better than expected job. 

In March 2020, Covid-19 happened and a lot of things went to shit. Capital projects got cut, but the work was replaced with cost saving projects and security work, so my level of effort didn't go down at all. The focus was on getting people to WFH, and making sure we were saving cash whenever possible due to uncertainty. (Often needing integral system change projects to uncouple us from vendors).

In April 2020, we announced VERY significant pay cuts for 10 weeks, to keep staff and stay liquid. I think this made sense, and I figured it would keep most of us employed. Then shortly after, they laid off my manager, who had been there 4+ years. Between the different cost saving projects, the many projects that couldn't be delayed, additional operational tasks, and now my boss's necessary work, it isn't exaggerating at all to say my work tripled. 

Shortly after, the technology team shifted and changed, and due to my boss being removed, I now managed multiple projects directly for our SVP, and report directly to the head of technology. The SVP seems somewhat ambivalent, but my direct manager is really happy with my work. This also isn't necessarily a promotion, but previously there was a bit more separation, and a much smaller workload. Even as things are becoming more 'steady state' in terms of working from home and such, my work responsibilities are still massively more than previously. This doesn't seem temporary either. The technology head and I have a great rapport, and he seems to see me as important to the future of the org. In addition to the project work, It feels like every week I've been getting more operational responsibilities, and working more as a leader in the organization. He mentions he sees me transitioning into a mixed Operational and Project manager, and he's really happy with the insights I've had on setting up a more 'ITIL-esque' high functioning IT department. He's looking into getting an intern for me shortly, and potentially an analyst reporting to me in the future (currently there are hiring freezes, but we expect them to be over by 2021)

The pay cut is fully stopping after next week. Management has been upfront that while it's a tough time, our company is a lot better situated than expected, and they're not expecting any further cuts. I'd like to ask for a raise, since I've been handling far more responsibility and putting in a lot more hours. I don't really know what someone like me is worth though exactly, and I don't know what I should ask for. I also don't necessarily want to become over-paid and become a big lay-off target if there's another money crunch. (Although frankly, that's a good problem to have)

Any advice, concerns, suggestion, or even general thoughts and commentary here would be greatly appreciated. As you can imagine, this is all extremely new to me (like the past months have been to most of us, I assume). Thanks already for reading this wall of text!"

I’ve suffered from severe depression for as long as I can remember, right after high school my family forced me into engineering college. Which I didn’t really want. Life from there onwards is a big blur, I was on heavy medication when I even studied for my finals. 

Only a few months ago I completely came off of my medication. And I’m anxious to apply for a job because I can’t remember anything from my degree. I graduated with honours (second lower) and more than half the time I was high. 

I graduated last November and I’m so afraid to apply for a job as an engineer because I can’t remember anything. Even if I have graduated engineering feels foreign to me. 

I can’t sit around with a degree and I have never worked before. I could take a final year text book and not know anything in it. I’m surprised I graduated in the first place. It feels like I don’t deserve the degree at times. 

I want to start working, but I fear I’ll never be recruited. What is work life like? What would it be like to walk into work as an intern or junior engineer? Do I have to remember things from my degree?"

hr3qz7,1,2020-07-14,Second SFF Build!,nhes,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/hr3qz7/second_sff_build/,"Hey guys! I built a [r/sffpc](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/) about two years ago that I've been transporting across the United States pretty frequently for college, internships, etc. Now that I'm pretty much set on attending school from home for the fall, I thought it'd be a good time to upgrade (and downsize). Here are the specs of my current build:

\- Node 202  
\- i5-8400  
\- MSI Z370I ITX  
\- EVGA GTX 1050Ti  
\- 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3000 (looking back at my receipts I paid way too much for this lol)  
\- Samsung EVO: 250GB M.2, 500GB 2.5  
\- Corsair 400W(?) Gold PSU

I used the stock CPU cooler with *no other fans* so it runs pretty loud and hot during gaming. Probably should have been more mindful about thermals and cooling but the space heating came in handy on the east coast.

Ideally, I'd like to carry some of these parts over to my new build and sell the rest. Also want to give AMD CPUs a try. Here are my proposed upgrades (budget not super important):

\- Velka 7 (redesign of the 5, releasing this month)  
\- AMD Ryzen 5 3600  
\- Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 (chromax black ftw)  
\- Asus B450-I  
\- RTX 2070 Super FE  
\- +1TB WD Blue M.2

This was loosely compiled based on a bunch of Optimum Tech videos that I watched. Open to any and all suggestions that you guys may have. For reference, I mostly play Fortnite, sports titles (2K, Fifa, etc.), Warzone, and most recently, Hyper Scape. Clearly, I don't need insane graphics performance, but being able to play those games at 144+ FPS on high/ultra settings would be nice :) I also know the 3000 cards are coming out but can't be bothered to wait potentially several months to get one when the performance upgrade wouldn't mean much to me anyway.

Y'all know much more than me, so please don't hesitate to critique and ask questions. Thanks for reading, and I appreciate your time!"

I worked at a healthcare company doing similar work last summer and realized the same thing that I am now. For people doing internships or just starting out full time, do you struggle seeing the big picture with some of the apps or services you are working on? Like how each part fits into the system and how each part communicates and interacts with each other? 

Maybe it's just because I don't learn this stuff in school or that I just haven't been too exposed to it yet in my career, but sometimes it's overwhelming. For example, I'm given a task to create a microservice to incorporate into our back-end. I do endless googling and researching to see how this is possible, but still doesn't make sense in my head. I'm stuck and don't even know where to begin. There's things that I haven't thought of like security or somehow containerizing the API. Plus, the corporate firewall and other issues big business can bring. And I don't fully understand how to run it locally vs in prod/dev so it's hard to mess around with. This is where I reach out to my manager for help, but I really wanted to start being more autonomous especially because I will be graduating next spring and need to start figuring these types of things out by myself. I also don't want to be spoon fed the work that I accomplish.

Does anyone else feel like there are a ton of gaps in their knowledge as they first start out? For anyone that went through this, does it get better? Do you get better at solving these types of problems that you have no idea where to even begin?"
hr4ghg,1,2020-07-14,Selecting my letter-writers,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/hr4ghg/selecting_my_letterwriters/,"Hi everyone,
I’m putting my applications together for a computer science PhD (ML systems specifically). However I’m in a bit of a dilemma when it comes to my letter writers.

Context:
My applications will by and large be going to highly ranked universities (top 15). The reason for this is that my undergraduate advisor (top 15 university also) said that he would be happy to have me join his lab. My GRE scores and grades etc will be sufficient to get into my own university, so I am setting it as the baseline.

Now to the dilemma.
I have a decent publication record, with 2-3 papers. I’ve worked for 3 professors over time - one at my original university (lowly ranked), and 2 from my current university that I transferred to (highly ranked). I also did a research-oriented internship at a FAANG company, and my manager has a PhD in ML. I imagine I could ask him for a letter too.

So here’s the thing. Of the two professors I worked with at my current university, one gave me real ML work and I did a lot of great work with him. The other, I guess was worried that an undergrad couldn’t handle real ML work, so he got me to handle building the website for them to test their algorithms on public users. I published a paper with the first professor, and am working on a second as well. The second professor I have none with.

I know that I shouldn’t ask for letters from professors I’ve only interacted with as a student, but what about a professor who I’ve worked with, yet wouldn’t let me work on directly relevant tasks? If needed, I can instead get a letter from my manager in industry. I know academic letters are preferred, but if he can’t write a good letter for me that would be even worse. The professor in question also has reasonably good connections, another reason I’m concerned about potentially excluding him.


What would you do if you were me?"

* APs: 10th: APUSH 4, 11th: Chem, Calc AB, US Gov
* No Substantial Individual Awards
* Note: AP CS A is not a course in our school, and to take AP CSP I’d need to drop chem so I didn’t

I understand that I don’t have many individual awards, but I do have a few team awards I’ll mention later. I’m really not a good test taker at all, but I know that for a lot of schools you need to have high SAT scores. Opinions on whether to go test-optional (thanks to COVID) would be helpful.

ECS:

**In School**

* School Podcast (Founder, Chief Editor): Consistently around 130-200 views per video
   * Mainly talk about Sports
   * Starting a BLM initiative
* President of Bollywood Club
* Founder/ President of NBA 2k Club
* Founder/ President of School’s ESports Team
* Member of School Newspaper → more formal (editor, have not written articles yet)
* President/ Chief Editor of 2nd School Newspaper → informal (have not written articles but am well known for editing)
* Selected to be Student Ambassador
* Math League member (C team)
* Other clubs: Chess Club, Fantasy Football Club, Breakfast Club, Jefferson Awards (for volunteering), B+ club, etc. (I got a lot but none are too important)

**Outside School/ Volunteering**

* Animal Shelter Volunteer (fed, cleaned up cats)
* State Park Volunteer (cleaned, removed invasive species, maintained grounds)
* Salvation Army Volunteer (gift collector)
* Tutoring/ Tennis coach for low-income kids
* Young Community Representative of the local Temple
   * Unofficial volunteer, I go frequently
* Attended Yoga Classes, volunteered a bit there
* Audited multiple courses on edx (Python, Java)
* Earned certificate for an app building course on edx

These are my general ECs which I feel aren’t too special. I’m not sure how much of an impact the podcast makes on my application because there is some content that is a bit 18+ (curse words and stuff).

I founded the 2k club as a way to network (a fancy way to say make friends) and to share my passion for basketball with others around me. This slowly developed into an interschool (national?) ESPORTs league between people across the country.

**Music**

* Been in  band since 4th grade (percussion)
   * Voted Section Leader
* Play the guitar, couple of concerts in school

Any suggestions on how to improve this section would be greatly appreciated, although I don’t think it’s a huge deal. I was thinking maybe posting a couple of videos on guitar tutorials for Indian music (there’re a couple that I know how to play)

**Athletics -** 12 season

* I love sports, but as a vegetarian Indian, it's pretty tough to compete.
* 3 year JV Cross Country - might get voted as captain this year
* 3 year JV Basketball - voted JV captain/ undefeated record last season  (not a big deal because JV I guess)

Basketball’s really my passion but I don’t have the physical capabilities to compete with others. That’s kinda why I started the whole sports podcast and 2k club (and other stuff you’ll see later).

* 3 year JV Tennis - will be captain this year, but it’ll be too late by then

Ok, ok I know all of you are immediately writing off, but please read more because it gets better don't worry… hopefully.

Moving onto the real stuff. Below are the main things that can carry me:

**Summer Internships**

Sophomore Year

* Computer Science internship with a prominent university in my area
* The professor didn’t really care about what I did so I created a Python program that analyzes images of a basketball game
* I published a paper with this research as the first author in Junior year
   * The only caveat
      * My dad was the 2nd author on the paper because he is also a professor (in the same prominent university and in computer science)
      * My internship was not with my dad or linked to my dad in any way but I needed his email address to actually publish the paper as it was for a pretty high ranking venue that only accepted graduate/ postdoc (legit) papers.
      * Obviously I did all the work on the paper since it was basketball related, but my dad did edit it after I wrote it and stuff.

So as you probably guessed that’s my biggest “hook.” Honest opinion, does it look bad that my dad is a co-author (even though it should seem obvious that he did none of the work)? My professor wasn’t really involved in the work that I did either, so he didn’t want to put his name on it.

Junior Year Internships

* I was going to continue my research at the university mentioned above, but unfortunately, COVID struck and canceled it
* I landed an internship with a prominent entrepreneur company in the are
   * Very selective, only 2 kids were selected
   * I practically founded a “startup merch company” (in the words of my advisor)
   * Made it from scratch: website, merchandising, logo making, branding, marketing
* I also got internship with another prominent company that teaches how to be an entrepreneur
   * I am in charge of their social media and marketing
* On my own, I’m continuing my CS research (although it has been pretty hard to with everything going on)

**Leadership**

* Elected Class President (9th, 11th)
* Communications Board Grade Representative (10th)
   * Elected position, official photographer of basketball games, created/ edited newscasts for the school → where I realized that I should make a podcast
* Environmental Board Grade Representative (10th, 11th)
   * Elected position, created multiple initiatives to promote recycling/ environmental friendly campaigns
* Co-Founded Robotics Team
   * Won state award for best design
* State Leadership Group
   * Highly selective (application, essays, interview process), program that shapes leaders, teaches skills like networking, distinguished speakers
   * I might be downplaying this, but my state is pretty small
   * Won the award for “Best Networking and Partnerships”
* Engineering Seminar
   * Founded this annual organization (in junior year)
   * Organized the whole event → got speakers from top companies like Boeing and DuPont as well as students from top colleges like MIT, CMU, UPenn, Stanford.
   * Created whole application process and accepted students (30% acceptance rate but that doesn’t really matter)
* Co-Founded/ organized inaugural State Environmental Summit
   * Contacted speakers, selected venue, ordered food, advertised → The governor of the state came and gave a small talk
* Co Founder of multi- school environmental competition
   * Basically, like a “save the environment” campaign where you get points for doing environmental- friendly activities
   * Selected by school board to be the president (I mean… obviously ig I co founded the thing)
   * Guided team to 4-1 record which was 2nd best

When you look at it I got about 3 major topics/themes throughout my application → Basketball/Sports, CS, and Environment.

Ok so in terms of essays, teacher recs:

**Essays**: I’m thinking of talking about how I wasn’t on varsity but applied my passion for basketball in other ways (paper and podcast)

I think it’ll come out pretty good. I know this is a huge part of my application so I’ll need to spend a lot of time on it.

**Teacher recs**: I got math and Spanish teachers to write it. Math teacher seems to like me but we’re not that tight. Spanish teacher doesn’t like me too much but he’s a nice guy so I think it’ll be ok. Honestly, I didn’t have many options.

Sorry for the long post but I wanted to put everything I got on it. I’m really not sure how major my stuff is so please give me all the constructive criticism you can... Be as mean as possible. Any recommendations on where else to apply would be greatly appreciated."

Also, we haven’t even been able to launch our product yet to generate revenue even though upper management promised me that it will be launched at the beginning of May. Knowing this, I have also sacrificed some weekends trying to get ourselves ready for the launch in May, which nobody in my team has. And now that we didn’t even launch yet, I am deeply regretting this decision. Even though I have been recognized for this by upper management. 

I am also being well underpaid the industry standards for my job compared with the amount of work that I have produced. I’ve asked my CTO for a raise but he has just been postponing it even further, until after the launch which has still not arrived yet. 

On the other hand though, I have made a ton of close connections on the team (just not to the point of us being friends outside work) and I have grown a lot as a developer. Our team is also really small and we haven’t been able to recruit more people due to a lack of interest and tight budgets. I’m pretty much the only person who works on the front end (being a front end developer), which I’ve realized isn’t good because I have nobody to learn from. Our work atmosphere is also very relaxed and there doesn’t seem to be too many important deadlines to meet. 

So knowing all of this, me leaving will cause huge problems for them as I am the only front end guy, which I want to avoid as much as possible but at the same time I really would like a change and staying at this company isn’t good for me on a personal level."

Some background about me :

* Hold French Citizenship and Swiss Resident Permit
* Finishing M.Sc in Computer Science at ETHZ
* Speak Fluent French, close to proficiency in English, limited skill in German
* Indirect relatives USA (siblings of parents)

I've  been wanting to move to the Americas for a while. To be honest, I'm  just a victim of American Soft Power. My idea of success is to move into  these big cities filled with skyscrapers and fancy parks along squarely  laid-out streets. Everything seem to be so spacious and modern, unlike  here in Europe where most is packed, old and sad. This vision might be  completely nonsense, so feel free to correct me.

Ideally, I'd like to either move in Quebec or Toronto in Canada, or New York, Boston or the Bay Area in the USA.

Since  I didn't finish my master's studies and there are opportunities for me  to go abroad, mostly for the thesis and the internship, I figured now is  a good time to think about plans about moving out.

What  would be the easiest point of entry for me? Should I use the internship  opportunity to have a 'taste' of what life is like across the Atlantic?  Would it be easier for me to apply in a European headquarter of an  American company to make the transfer easier?

I  don't know if this is the right place to ask, but should I move out at  all? Switzerland is alright, the salary is highest in Europe but the  cost of life kinda balances it, and I'm not a huge fan of the city (I  live in Zürich).

Let me know if there's any questions I can answer to make my query easier to deal with!

I'm afraid it's gonna be long. I'm honestly not sure if this guy is just not into me except for dirty snaps or if he is but is as insecure as I am. 

I have been texting and snap sexing with this guy for 3 YEARS now. I know him from an internship. I thought he was super cute but I'm a socially anxious loser so I didn't act on it (didn't know how). Somehow, after the internship, we got to talking on social media (Facebook, Instagram, mostly Snapchat) and Whatsapp.  At first normally but it progressed to dirty pictures on Snapchat. This went on for a while and we told each other some personal stuff  (only sexual personal stuff though). I don't really remember how exactly we got to the topic but he told me he hadn't had sex in years because his frenulum tore once while masturbating and it scared him I guess.  I told him I also hadn't had sex in years. During our conversations he said some things that made it clear he was insecure, like comments about the size of his penis and also that if we would have sex he would probably cum really quickly. I would reassure him, tell him like it doesn't matter then we do it again later. Besides the sex chats we had very mundane chats like how was your weekend etc. Never anything deeper. 

After a (long) while of Snapchatting and sometimes talking on Whatsapp I wanted to meet up with him. From all he had said to me it seemed like he would want that too. But then he didn't really respond and I asked again and then he got mad!! Then I was like: Fuck this shit, Fuck him (not literally) and I blocked him on Snapchat (this was like end of 2018). 

After a while I was weak I unblocked him or he talked to me on Whatsapp, I don't remember, but we got to talking again and we talked about what happened. Basically he felt like I was being pushy. I also explained my side. After this I kind of stopped caring about him and stopped really responding but guess what then he began texting (via Snapchat) and snapping a lot more again. It's stupid to say but it felt like I had the upperhand again and he was chasing after me. I didn't send any dirty snaps any more but he would and I would respond with text. Sometimes it was annoying and pushy and I would basically let him do his thing so he'd stop bothering me. 

After a while things were kind of ""normal"" again and later I also started sending dirty snaps again. So now it's july 2020 and for the past few months I've been crazy horny. a few weeks ago I was reaaaally into the Snapsex, first time since a looooong time. He asked to meet up. I said okay. He said yesssss. And now he's not really responding again. I just don't get it. He was the one who brought it up. 

Part of the reason all of this has gone on so long is also my social anxiety. Actually meeting up with him scares me soooo much. Especially just meeting up for drinks or something, without sex. Somehow having drunken sex with someone is less scary to me than having a date. But most guys would jump on the chance to have sex so this situation is just very weird. It's fucked up and my anxiety is making me go crazy. Should I just accept this guy doesn't like me?"

So I graduated in 2018 with a bachelors and I have internship experience, full-time experience, and free-lance experience (around two years total).

Currently I am freelancing and looking for a full time position.

I'm not having much luck...I believe my resume is well done to be honest. I have re-done it a million times and simplified it and I think it is very good as it is now.

I was thinking of putting a line in my resume near the top of the resume that I am willing to work for free for experience and if they like me they can hire me salaried full time (something along those lines).

I have been applying for months, for around 3-4 hours per day, and have heard very little (few interviews).

I have leveraged my network and have followed up and have really done my best to try to get a job but for some reason it just is not clicking (probably due to covid, but still, people ARE hiring so I should be able to get a job, right?)

So at the moment, I was thinking of including this in my resume to show that I am willing to work hard and learn and be a part of the team for the long term even if I am unsalaried for some time (perhaps a month, two months, three months)

I just want to get a full-time job and occupy my time. I am getting very sad without having a sustainable income. 

What do you think? What should I do?

I am currently living in the middle east and applying there. I don't know what else to do. Do you think it is a good idea?"

On the other hand, everyone has been telling me to do personal side projects as if that's something easy to do. I feel like I have literally no idea where to start or what to create since I don't have the skills to do that. I have been teaching myself C++ but even that seems so little compared to what other people are doing.

hrdxe7,0,2020-07-14,Story of how I became a DevOps Engineer at 19 years old,Nuclearb0m,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/hrdxe7/story_of_how_i_became_a_devops_engineer_at_19/,"I wanted to share my story in case it might be of help for others trying to get into this particular field of tech. Although I had been doing DevOps work on a project I got into through my school, I didn't feel like it was enough to call myself a DevOps eng. Recently though, I got a contract job as DevOps and have been doing pretty well with AWS, EKS, K8s etc. and I thought that I finally earned my title.

I got my introduction to DevOps and operations side of things when I was a new developer intern around November of last year, before this I knew nothing about System Administration, CI/CD, Build systems, the Cloud or anything of the sort. My interest mainly stemmed from how impactful and practical it felt to be working with this kind of technology. I learned roughly all I know in the last 3-4 months and I wanted to share the approach and resources I used:

&amp;#x200B;

`GNU/Linux`

This one sits at the top of the food chain for sure. A very solid understanding of this helps a lot when it comes to learning other technologies like Docker, and it's your core skill for sure. I will say that your daily use of Linux won't be enough by itself in most cases. My number 1 suggestion is the [Linux and UNIX System Administration Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554). It covers almost everything you need to know to become functional. It even gives you introduction to topics like Configuration Management, the Cloud etc. (put heavier emphasis on learning Networking really really well)

&amp;#x200B;

`Docker`

Without a doubt the leading piece of software for containerization. I tried to learn Docker inside out as much as possible and it's definitely worth it. You need to understand many things such as, Dockerfile optimization techniques, its networking model, volumes, using cache to your advantage etc. You should also be decent at `docker-compose`, it's very widely used and simple. You can ignore `Docker Swarm` for the most part. For resources, I mainly just read the docs, googled and watched YouTube videos. However, there are decent courses on `Udemy` as well if you prefer that.

&amp;#x200B;

`Kubernetes`

Definitely, the weakest part of my skillset but I've been picking it up rather quickly recently. K8s is a different beast, and you sort of just have to forget Docker's model and way of thinking about things to try and understand K8s. It definitely takes time and a very solid foundation of Linux and Docker is important to make learning easier. (Assuming you run Docker as your container runtime of course). Official docs are the best resource I think, you just need to read quite a bit. [Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)

&amp;#x200B;

`Configuration Management` 

I haven't really needed to use such tools much, mainly I just learned a basic level of Ansible and that's been good enough so far. You don't need to worry so much about this one. The SysAdmin book I mentioned gives you an intro to these (specifically `Ansible` and `Salt`). As long as you're good at reading documentation, you'll be ok.

&amp;#x200B;

`CI/CD`

I personally started with `Jenkins` but you can use any other commonly used CI tool. Although older and disliked by certain parts of the community, I'd suggest just setting up your own Jenkins server for practice purposes. Bonus points if you deploy it as a container, either bare-Docker or even on K8s if you want to be fancy. Usually being just familiar with 2 CI/CD tools should be enough, they're very easy to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

`Git`

I happened to be the one managing the repositories for the project I was talking about and needed to quickly learn it as comprehensively as possible. I think it's important to be very confident with `Git` so you can help out your co-workers or friends or set the workflow for the team. Should ideally know as far as: `rebasing`, `resetting`, `rewriting history`, `branching`, `remotes` etc and ideally understand the common open source `Git` workflows. Videos of talks at conferences are good for learning this and the book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is also good.

&amp;#x200B;

`Terraform`

I haven't needed to use TF specifically so much, right now mainly I write infrastructure as code in `Pulumi`, which is a TF wrapper but let's you write in TS, JS, Python etc. It's not difficult to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

`Cloud Providers`

You can learn this one in a really practical way because AWS/GCP/Azure will give you free credits and what not. (more if you are a student) They usually have good official docs so always check those first. A pet project could be:

1. Write your own custom Docker image for a Minecraft server
2. Provision an instance on AWS with Terraform
3. Install Docker/other dependencies with Ansible
4. Deploy the container onto the instance
5. Put a load balancer in front of it
6. Point your DNS at the Load Balancer

&amp;#x200B;

`Software Development Experience`

Personally my previous experience has definitely helped me, it's usually incredibly important for you to at least understand the build system of the language/framework so you can at least create pipelines. You should also know basic things like how to inject Environmental variables in different languages. Programming experience wise, `Python` is always a decent language to start with and some `Bash` helps but your mileage will vary quite a bit depending on the company.

&amp;#x200B;

`Closing thoughts`

Becoming a DevOps or Cloud engineer was definitely my ""dream"" job and I expected to get there in a few years or whatever. It feels really weird to have accomplished it at 19 years old as a sophomore (now a junior) in college. It's been really fun so far and it's everything I expected/wanted it to be. If anyone has questions, I'd be happy to answer and thanks to the community for all the help. And yes, [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) is good.

P.S The information overload is crazy on this particular line of job and it's there daily, be ready for it."

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
I 'm a student in my masters at material science and I need a device I can store away, write notes on, use for CAD programs (Autodesk Inventor), occasionally game. I can use something else to write notes on but I still want to be able to just start the computer and enjoy working or gaming with it. Battery life for a lecture day would be nice, but I can take notes with my tablet so basically it could even be a workstation with a build in display that just stores away nicely.  

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
I go to the gym 4 times a week and as long as the device is stable and robust I will be happy. 
* On the other hand I dig the thought of having a light notebook that I can use for gaming at home, maybe with a eGPU?

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
N/A  

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Yes autodesk inventor and I want to be able to play stuff like Cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Mordhau, Battlefield, Hunt: Showdown

Everything will be an improvement from my 5 year old gaming tower. I remember that Apex didn't run with stable 40FPS on it. Never played with more but I'm down for it.

Hello,

tldr: small apartment, no room or joy for a extra desk, notebook needed for studying, working and gaming, as quiet and as carefree as possible. Plug and play eGPU and a Ultrabook would be amazing I guess, if there is a setup where I even can use the Notebook as a tablet to write formulars: perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

basically I will move in with my girlfriend next week and start a new job in the local university. My old gaming setup was a gigantic tower computer that I build myself. It is exactly 5 years old today and sadly I never use it no more. The apartment my girlfriend and I will share is tiny and I will use the kitchen table for doing work and studying. Basically I need a setup that is easy to store away. I don't like to have a extra desk at my home for work or a computer.

When I was locked up 14 days because of Corona I reconnected with a lot of dear friends playing some games. My setup was still easily running stuff like Hunt: Showdown or Battlefield 1.

So I guess what I search is a mobil solution I can put away, use for some engineering like (autodesk inventor for example) and if I find the time play some games. I read a view articles about eGPU, maybe there is a notebook that is customer friendly and easy to connect with this technology.

I just finished my bachelors degree and after a little internship I will start my masters in material science. I'm totaly fine with spending more money for devices that let me enjoy my life rather then saveing money in the wrong places. I had a look at the Acer Nitro 5 notebooks, the dell inspirion and the razer blade series. What I don't want is to play some games and have a plain start in front of me."
hroco9,11,2020-07-15,What its like from a hiring manager's perspective,ListenBruv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hroco9/what_its_like_from_a_hiring_managers_perspective/,"Hi everyone - I thought I would provide this perspective as I think its missing in some of the questions that get asked on here.

I run a small team (3 other people) for a professional services organization and have had to go through the hiring process a couple of times in the last few years. Here's how the process went in a mid-sized company like mine; the role was for a Communications Specialist equivalent, with a salary band of 50-70K (based on experience and negotiation skills).

**Step 1: Create Job Description**

The JD was created based on the skills we wanted to see from candidates, and the soft skills needed for success in the role (e.g., comfortable discussing strategies with senior executives). We put the experience at 1-3 years to cast a wider net of younger professionals, but were open to even new grads as long as they had some semblance of experience via internships and/or presented themselves well.  For example, if they held jobs at McDonald's and Tim Hortons, but had a degree related to Comms and did a 3 month internship somewhere, we'd still be willing to consider them as they could learn the role.

So new grads, if it says 1-3 years, I'd still encourage you to apply without any experience.

**Step 2: External Recruiter Does Screening Calls**

Even in a company of 100 people, I, nor my boss had time to sit there and sift through 100+ resumes and pinpoint which candidates we wanted and screen them. We left that to an external recruiter who's entire job is to do it all day.

She based her screening criteria on the information we provided for her. The person needed to have the experience we wanted (ideally), the right hard skills (Creative Suite, etc), and had to present well/be confident.

\[Note: because it isn't an exact science, we later found out that even if candidates get past the screener, they are often not the right fit. Some may present well in phone interviews but really poorly in person for whatever reason. In our case, several candidates lacked poise/presence in person, and this was a key requirement.\]

**Step 3: We shortlist candidates**

After the external recruiter narrowed it down to about 4-5 candidates we should strongly consider, my boss and I sat through and sifted the resumes.

**Hint:** if you are being recruited and are submitting your resume, a more modern resume DEFINITELY stands out so I would encourage you to use it. But this only applies to roles where you've been actively recruited by a recruiter who will send your resume to the hiring manager.

From the 10 resumes we saw, we, quite honestly, skimmed the cover letters and focused more on work experience, education, and hard skills. Resumes that were more modern definitely stood out (it was a Communications role and professional/polished presentation of resumes hinted at their attention to detail and creativity skills).

Out of the 10, we narrowed it down to 3 we wanted to interview (and no, not all of them had creative resumes, some were just plain). Of the 3, there was one candidate that REALLY stood out on paper. His resume was impressive, his samples were impressive, and he had a glowing screening call with our recruiter. To keep it safe, we still wanted to interview the other two as well.

**Note:** At this point, all of the candidates we were interviewing already had the hard skills needed to succeed. So on technicality, they were all capable of doing the job. Our objective  in interviewing the shortlisted 3 candidates was more so to  determining soft skills and *\*gasp\**.....fit - both with the people on my current team and with the company culture.

**Interviewing Shortlisted Candidates - Soft Skills**

So what were the soft skills we were looking for? (remember, these were hinted at and sprinkled in various parts of the JD):

* The role needed someone confident/poised as they would be dealing strategically with higher ups in the organization and would need to express their POV
* My team at the time consisted of people who could focus individually but were easy to converse with - so we didn't need a social butterfly, but we also didn't want someone really quiet in the role
* The company culture required someone who came across as polished and ""corporate"" to a certain degree. This would be especially important during the beginning of their tenure as they would need to get buy-in from higher ups.
* The role required someone who we needed to know would be comfortable in the role for a few years (as it tended to have high turnover). The growth opportunities for the role were also fairly limited, so someone looking to settle in and learn more about the business and stay in the role would be preferable. We of course don't explicitly say this in the JD.

**The Interview Process**

Of the 3 that we narrowed it down to, here was our approach to the questions:

* Asking job-specific questions: do you have experience interacting with senior executives? Etc. We were looking for some semblance of a relevant response that made sense with the job and was transferable.
* Asking ""tell me about a time...."" questions: we were looking more so for similarity between the situations described and what would be relevant to the position. So if the question is about dealing with a difficult stakeholder (as that would be the case in this role), the example needed to be very similar to that for us to give the person a check.
* The candidates who stood out were the ones who REALLY researched the company, and it showed in what they said between the questions, and also what they asked during the Q&amp;A period at the end. If a candidate was already already a strong interview, but then they closed showing that they had done research about the firm (beyond ""you have 5000 employees""), we were much more inclined to move them on.

Honestly, at the end of the day, **the interviewees did not need to be perfect**. None of them were. Some got nervous. Some stumbled and stammered. That didn't matter as much; the main things that did were:

* Were their responses relevant to the job they'd be doing?
* Are they genuinely interested in our company/industry or are they going through the motions (this one is pretty easy to tell as an interviewer, and the candidates who are really interested *easily* stand out)
* Were they someone we thought would fit with the current team? As in - knowing they already have the skills, was their vibe too much/too little for the current team and stakeholders they'd be working with? **This was, ultimately, just as important as the first two questions, if not more.**

Realistically, we often knew within the first 5-10 minutes if the candidate was likely to move forward.

**Interview results**

When we interviewed the first 3, here is how it went down; again, note that all of them had enough experience of relevance and the hard skills to do the job:

* **Candidate 1:** Was very nice, but a little shy. She was soft spoken, and didn't really stand out in any way. She was decently prepared but we were unsure about her vibe and whether she would actually be a fit for the demands of the role. She went into our ""later reconsideration"" pile - which meant the external recruiter was told to keep her ""warm"" until we decided how to move forward (hint: she did not get the job).
* **Candidate 2:** This was the candidate who was the clear favorite on paper. In person he was a disaster. Overly cocky, very brash and forward, to the point of annoyance. He offered us terrible tips on what we are not doing well and what we can do better on. This did not sit well with us because he didn't even know the business or the rationale behind our decisions so it was not appreciated. He was disqualified about 5-10 minutes into the interview. Don't be this guy.
* **Candidate 3:** Was a good mix of confident and easy to talk to. She was less experienced than Candidate 1 and 2, but made up for it with her attitude and interest in the role and the company. Passed the ""vibe"" check. Wanted to stay in the role a while because her last role was unstable and she wanted stability and to learn a new industry.

Candidate 3 was chosen to go forward and interview 1-2 other stakeholders that she'd have to work with. Those interviews were honestly just formalities - unless she was an absolute disaster and the stakeholders disagreed with our decision - they would be moving forward.

**References Actually Matter**

While most people think References are just formalities, they are actually not. What we are looking for is a theme/consistency in what your references say. For example, Candidate 3's recommendations were all glowing and were consistent.

One time, we were in the final stages of hiring a candidate and we did her references. She **did not get the job because of what her references said.** Basically, all three References let slip that she can be difficult to work with and combative. If your *references* are saying that then the truth is likely much worse. We rescinded the offer, without exposing that it was her references that gave her away.

**Unsuccessful Candidates**

After Candidates 1 and 2 were notified, we gave them - mixed in with some niceties - pretty direct feedback about their interviews. For Candidate 1, we said we needed someone with a little bit more expressive as the role required being in front of people often. For Candidate 2, I made it very clear to the recruiter that this person needs to work on his interviewing skills as he comes across extremely brash and arrogant. This feedback is important for the external recruiter as well, as they will likely not consider that candidate moving forward for similar opportunities.

Anyways, 3 years later and Candidate 3 is still with us and turned out to be a star hire since she fit the ""vibe"" of the company and the team. She is in line to get promoted shortly.

**TL;DR:** Ultimately, there is no ""formula"" or ""hack"" to ace the interview process; it is often a mix of having the right attitude needed for the particular role (hints should be sprinkled in the JD), preparing for the interview (this step will immediately set you apart), and asking the right questions. Sometimes, even if you do all those things right you may not get the role because your ""vibe"" wouldn't fit that of the team already in place so they don't want to risk it.

Happy to answer any questions you may have!"
hroigb,0,2020-07-15,How to decide what to do in CS?,part_dead,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hroigb/how_to_decide_what_to_do_in_cs/,"I am 2nd Year ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) student from India, and I have been coding since I was in Tenth (in C++) grade but I stopped in between for the first year of my college (at that time I was just solving 1 question in 2-3 weeks, like a hobby). 

Soon after starting my 2nd year in college, I realized that Electronics was not meant for me and I decided to pursue a career in CS. To do that I thought that I will do a Masters degree in CS and started solving some problems (in Java) from Codechef and Hackerrank consistently (in between this I tried Javascript and Front end Development for about a month and didn't enjoy it at all so quitted that too). 

Soon I realized that all this was probably not enough and I needed to work towards a more concrete goal (like being a Data Analyst or Web Developer). So I talked to my friends about this, mentioning my love for algebra and problem solving, I asked them what should I do next? They told me to try out Machine Leaning.

So I enrolled in the Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew NG (for which I learned MATLAB) and at the same time I had a mandatory 5 week Internship from my college, in which I was lucky enough to get an ML based project, ""Analysis and Prediction of Stock Market Prices"" (for which my group used Python). During the project, I felt everything was very rushed and I was not getting to learn much which was not helped by the fact that our mentor showed zero interest in the project. The project turned out to be okay but the whole experience made me want to take a break from ML, so I again just started solving random problems but this time in Python. 

At this point, I have tried out more than 4 languages in the span of 3 years and feel very confused as to what to do next and what should be the goal for my future. If any of you have any suggestions for me it will be highly appreciated. Also, should I pursue a Masters degree or just try to go for placements after completing college?"

Minors: Creative Media, Computing Technology and Applications

Overall GPA: 3.765 (will rise after summer semester hopefully)

Major GPA: 3.023 (will rise after fall semester)

GRE: Planning on taking but waiting until we can test in person again (I don't have a Windows computer)

Current School: two words: Nick Saban

Work Experience: I've worked as a student master control operator at a television station since August 2019, completed a 1 month internship as a content creation manager remotely, and currently working as an audio editor for a new podcast that will be releasing in the next few weeks.

Research experience: I've written a lit review on the gender inequality of the music industry and will hopefully be continuing this for my capstone project my spring semester of senior year or will do a different topic (I really have no idea yet). I've also applied to help with a research project on campus for the fall outside of my department (no one in music is working on research as of right now). No interview date for that has been set yet. 

Race and Identity: white female, first-gen college student, US

Interests: music/audio mixing, media broadcasting, inequalities in the music industry, radio, television

Extracurriculars: Sigma Alpha Iota, CMAEDU, Phi Eta Sigma, Paws UA, Golden Key National Honor Society,  Concert and Symphonic Bands (no credit)

Required portfolio: I have all my best audio, other media works, and writing samples on my portfolio website that I keep updated regularly. 

Schools applying to in master programs in music technology, recording arts, broadcasting, or media studies (mainly music tech or audio tech):

• Georgia Tech, Middle Tennessee State University, Syracuse, Georgia Southern, UGA, American University, Belmont University, Carnegie Mellon University, Coastal Carolina, University of Texas at Austin

Georgia Tech is top choice followed by Georgia Southern and MTSU (I'm wanting to stay somewhat close to home if at all possible)

Possible issues that may arise: 
• I have 2 Ws on my record (Music Theory 2 and Music History 2; I retook both and received a C+ in theory 2 and an A- in history 2, but received a C- in theory 3 and a B- in theory 4) 
• Started college out as a music education major and switched my 3rd semester in (the same semester I was taking theory 2 the first time)
• I added Creative media as a second major this past January after being told that I would be able to graduate with 2 degrees and better job opportunities. This was a lie as I found out in May, which is why it is now just a second minor. I'm not sure how this translates on a transcript nor how it could hurt my chances of being accepted.

I've already experienced imposter syndrome my entire time in undergrad so might as well continue it 😂 

Most of these programs have been super selective, so my anxiety is through the roof with the thought of not getting in somewhere and Mr. Corona isn't helping any. 

If you have any suggestions for other programs to look into, please send them my way. I must note, however, that I cannot do a performance-based music program; my primary instrument is clarinet, and I developed arthritis my sophomore year of undergrad in my right thumb. I was able to alleviate the pain for about a year and a half before it became unbearable to play longer than an hour or so, even with a neck strap and brace on. I will have to get surgery within the next few years to remove a part of bone in that joint. My doctor will not do the surgery until it has progressed much further than what it is currently at. I wear a brace most days."

I originally made reddit to post a suicide watch post, because my ex broke up with me and I really didn’t see any reason to go on so I figure I would update on my cake day just to see mental health progress. About a week after my post I was hospitalized because a friend called the cops on me, and honestly it was beyond traumatizing for me, I only stayed for about three days but it messed me up. 

Fast forward a bit and I decided to go to a local college instead of move so I set that up and three months after I started talking to my ex again. It was mostly filled with me being constantly anxious and then him wanting a friends with benefits situation, in which he sent mixed signals to where I thought that he genuinely wanted me back, throughout a year and a half used me for nudes and then he cut me off again. Honestly the best thing that’s happened to me so far. I was already progressing because I had friends from theater and I just threw myself in it and found out that was what I truly loved to do. Honestly after last November I had started to get so much happier and better than I ever was during that year and a half. 

December I begin another play and honestly I’ve never been happier. I’m doing what I love I’m constantly with friends and I’ve finally figured out how to deal with my depression, by being around friends. February I’m accepted into an internship at the national gallery of London and I start dating the guy who I was in a play with. The beginning of March was probably my happiest. Even though COVID was started my boyfriend and I were still seeing each other for the time being. Obviously I no longer have the internship, but I’m hoping I can go next year. My new boyfriend broke up with me in May, honestly I saw it coming and I don’t blame him he was a senior and moving away I just wish things went slightly differently. He wasn’t really talking as much and was distancing himself, and that fucked me up for a week or so, but I’m not mad or anything I fully understand. So the COVID situation really messed me up, but overall I’ve been doing great since my first ex was officially out of my life. 

Being mostly alone and by myself has impacted me a lot mentally, but i know it won’t be forever, so I try and just think about the future though some days are way way worse than others. I know it’s not too detailed, but I think I’ve grown into a nicer and more happy person all around even if it’s more difficult now. I know when I get back to school I’ll feel a bit better since I’ll have classes to occupy my mind instead of my anxiety and depression. 

I’m sorry this is so long and I honestly become hopeless and suicidal to this day, but even when I feel awful and want to die I know things will eventually get better even if it seems like it never will."

Hey folks. Time flies and we're already into the third quarter of the year.

**Bad news first:** Coronavirus cases are increasing rapidly in some states in the U.S., which indicates that there will be a drag on the economy due to business restrictions in those states, resulting in continued high rates of unemployment.

You can check on how your state is doing using the links below. For those of you outside the U.S., refer to your government's health ministry for the most updated information.

* Overview: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states

* New Cases &amp; Deaths: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/state-timeline/

* Rate of Positive Tests: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states

I don't have any hard data on which engineering industries are affected the most, so I recommend searching for recent discussions here and in r/AskEngineers.

**The good news:** Read around long enough and you'll find some industries have been buffered from the economic impact of recent events. These are typically industries that have already had their contracts approved through FY 2020, i.e. defense and Medicare — which implies that defense contractors, spaceflight, national laboratories, and medical devices may ramp up hiring despite current economic conditions.

However, note that this is just my personal view of the situation and I don't have any evidence to back it up (aside from stuff everyone can access like BLS). Do your own homework and ask around before making any career decisions.

For broad macroeconomic updates I recommend visiting r/econmonitor. You'll mostly find stuff about monetary policy, but there's some insightful discussion on unemployment.

hrrg1b,2,2020-07-15,"I have an interview today and I'm supposed ""bring photos of things I've done""",accidentalelectrical,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hrrg1b/i_have_an_interview_today_and_im_supposed_bring/,"I'm honestly a little confused about what the mechanics of that should be. The position is a post grad engineering internship (postgrad being used loosely here, I graduated in late 2018 haha) at a very small but well-establiahed and respected astronautics R&amp;D company. Since I had an internship during college at a NewSpace startup, plus some less related but more scientific research experience during college, I can probably scrape together a few photos to illustrate my resume. Question is, would it be best to like, print them out? I usually bring printed copies of my resume for myself and my interviewer(s) to reference, so I could pretty easily tack on an appendix of related images to print too. But for some reason that feels weird to me, possibly just because I haven't done it before though. On the plus side it'd be an excuse to actually use those clear report cover things 😂 

The alternative would be to bring the photos up on my phone but that seems unprofessional, or maybe a flash drive but that's outdated and both are a bit impractical anyway. 

The one other viable option I've considered is to bring my tablet (a surface pro 4), which would circumvent the need for any papers at all, plus the screen is large enough that you can actually see details in photos. Plus, I coincidentally just yesterday got a fancy stylus that I can draw/write on it with with (since as a highly visual thinker I can't understand or explain anything without drawing it and making notes haha). I just worry about technology inevitably not working as expected under pressure (also I can count on myself to forget basic computer skills if someone is watching, let alone when that someone is kinda famous in the industry and actively judging me hahahahaha not like I'm nervous or anything).

*So, should I play it safe in paper space and just use all my printer ink and report covers, or should I go out on a limb and use technology like a damn young adult with a STEM degree?*"

I'm majoring in CS and just got a 3 on APCSP, like the easiest AP out there, and I've loved coding all my life, so I really thought I had a 5 (my first AP exam so I don't really know how realistic a 5 is), until I flubbed it.

So, there are \~200k people on this sub, and some of them are bound to be really fucking smart. And those people are the one's that will be confident posting. Not people like me, who fucked up junior year and wasn't offered AP classes freshman and sophomore years, leaving me with a grand total of *1 AP class, with a 3 in it. Fuck.*

I have a 3.8UW and a 4W, and will most likely have a \~1350 SAT score. I've never founded a club, or done anything crazy. I've only taken 1 AP class.  It's not because I don't have access to these stuff, I simply just *didn't do shit*. I'm so incredibly sorry that I can't juggle my EC's, grades, job, test scores, internships, dual enrollment classes, and side projects all at once. I'm so incredibly sorry some days I just want to get the fuck home after a stressful ass day, and play Overwatch and Minecraft for hours on end, just laughing and having a good time with friends. 

What I'm trying to say is that there are some really impressive people on here, and naturally, they'll be the ones to talk about applying to T20's, and we'll be the ones worrying our asses off on just getting somewhere in the first place. Most people, whether we like it or not, are average, or somewhere a little above or below it. 

I'm not going to get into Harvard or something, and have a tiny sliver of a chance at my top school UCB's computer science. I'm not going to be some legendary kid for my home town that's the first to get into an Ivy league. I'm simply just a dude. And that's okay, right? After some college lets me in, I'll have a great time making new friends and new stories, and I'll graduate and the entire college application process will be behind me. 

(TLDR) I guess I'm trying to say that even if you bombed your AP tests, or flubbed the amount of rigor of coursework, tell yourself that it'll be fine. There's more to life than college admissions, and the people here are *really fucking impressive,* so it's okay if we don't exactly match up with them. One day, you'll have a fucking family or career or whatever your life will revolve around, and this will seem so small. So it's okay. You're okay. I'm okay. We're average, or slightly below or above average, and that's okay. That's actually very average."

hruait,1,2020-07-15,Feeling down about rejections,sassylilmidge,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hruait/feeling_down_about_rejections/,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently unemployed - I was laid off at the end of last year from a very good job at a prestigious company after only three months in the role because my manager (an individual who did not have a choice in hiring me) hated me from day one and made my life hell (she herself ended up getting fired only a couple of months after me).

For some context, I am three years out of school and graduated from an Ivy League school, and was at said prestigious company for almost three years before getting laid off. I got a promotion to a different team after being in a position for almost two years on another team and when I switched teams is when I got fired. 

I’ve been on the job hunt for several months now, and have had so many interviews and sent through numerous amounts of applications and nothing seems to be able to get me a job. I’ve done mock interviews with friends and family in all different kinds of industries and have gotten great feedback which I’ve incorporated in my interviews. 

For every interview I get, I spend about a week researching the company, preparing answers, connecting with about 5-6 people from my alumni network and being on my A game for the interview, yet I am still not getting an offer. This makes me so incredibly demotivated when I’m putting in SO much time for each opportunity and getting 0 return... especially when I’ve been at it for almost 8 months now. 

For those of you going through similar experiences, how on earth do you find something within you to keep going despite the constant rejections when you’ve prepped so so hard? I just get more and more depressed with every final round interview I fail and it makes me want to try and find a job less and less each time. Especially when a majority of the jobs I’ve been applying to are entry level, and with 3+ years of experience (including internships) im way beyond that. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to stay motivated or suggestions for companies that are hiring like crazy and don’t care much about your credentials/will take anyone? The other idea ive been toying with is just starting my own company (even if it’s small, at least I can have something to put on my resume and fortunately have enough saved to be able to bootstrap my business idea) and applying to business school, so I can wade out corona in a curriculum and feel like I’m somewhat making progress with my life. 

TLDR; I’m an Ivy League graduate with 3+ yrs of work experience at a prestigious company and am currently unemployed, can’t seem to get a job anywhere and am feeling hopeless worthless lost and depressed AF. Considering starting a company to start to feel a bit more productive and to have something to put on my resume."

I'm an intern for a company that needs its past sales files backed up. Currently our process is downloading files from ShareFile onto an old computer, which transfers to an external harddrive which transfers to RackStation. All of this is automated but sometimes files are missed and the constant checking of multiple platforms is a pain.
Since we use Synology, rsync is a potential solution right? Could we download files from sharefile straight to RackStation using rsync? If so, would this be easy to set up?

My dad Is pressuring me to become an RN (Registered Nurse) But I have no Interest In this what-so-ever.  My true passion/goal has been 3D design/animation/modeling etcc.. since the age of 14.  (you get the point).  I've also had a goal since the age of 14 to move to Norway for a better/happier life. I have all the requirements I need (except for a few which I will state)  to get In the University that I've chosen. The only requirement I don't have  Is that  I need to have   ""+ 1 year university / college studies in academic subjects""  which I don't  because I dropped out of my prerequisites  for nursing.  So my solution to this Is going to full Sail University for 1 year(In 3D)  to get that over with (If this will work as an Requirement) Then I can start building up my portfolio to get accepted In the Uni (By the way I will be going through with this after Covid, In 2023 or 2024)    So this way I have my portfolio done and my Higher Education Entrance Qualification done, I'm not sure If this will work which Is why I require the help of all the redditors out there.

Now moving onto the next Issue, I have no idea how I will do this, my course is 3 years long and It's taught In English, I also forgot to mention that I will be staying In Norway after my studies by getting a job/Internship at a 3D studio afterwards.

I have 15k saved up, I will probably need more than that.

Few Questions:

Can I work part time as a full time student? If so, How many hours?

How much money do I need to make the move and apply?

Is It possible to work and pay for living costs, yearly?   (The Univcersity has no tuition except for some yearly fees which are around $600)

How hard Is It to find a job as a full time student?  (I know this will not be easy but I am a very charismatic Individual and can present myself and stand out)

Can I receive any scholarships?  (I will be going to an Art/3D University, they only require a beefy portfolio, so I don't know how scholarships work In situations like this)

Can I stay In Norway after studies provided that I find an Internship?

Is It hard to learn Norwegian?

hrup6c,116,2020-07-15,[POLY] MY JOURNEY THROUGH NA &gt; ITE &gt; POLY &amp; TIPS,jkaess,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hrup6c/poly_my_journey_through_na_ite_poly_tips/,"Hi guys! Don’t really know if this will be helpful to anyone but i just wanted to share my journey and some tips that may help whoever find this helpful!

**\*disclaimer**, i’m listing things that have helped me and have found it helpful throughout this journey especially it’s such an unconventional route. so to whoever needs this, feel free to read on and AMA!

some background info: I’m actually a Normal Acad student (12 point) who decided to pursue a route to ITE through the direct poly programme offered by ITE (2 years of higher nitec and if you manage to obtain a cgpa of 3, you will sort of be guaranteed a spot in your mapped course/course related to your higher nitec course)

**ITE:**

As a direct poly programme(DPP) student, you are required to start school a few months earlier than the O’Level intake. Take these classes as foundation classes for students to catch up to their O’Level peers (especially since the difference between N’level standards and O’s is quite a jump). There aren’t any exams or tests, just suck it up and go through it (and make some friends along the way!)

For my course, all the dpp students were put together in a class. So we were quite lucky that the friends we made earlier on were going to be with us for the remaining 2 years.

**TIPS:**

* **Find out your study method!** do you score better in a supervised setting or are you more of a hands-on learner? If you’re the latter, the DPP route is certainly a better choice! (after all ITE is a technical education type of setting)
* **Know what you want to do!** don’t take up a dpp course just because you want to get out of your secondary school or skip sec 5. if you’re unsure whether the course is suitable for you, ask around for guidance (trusted secondary school teachers, your peers, your parents). Use elimination method if required: e.g I don’t see myself doing this, this, this, therefore i’m only left with this choices.
* **Know who to mix with!** there will be bad influences but honestly most of the closest friends I have now are my friends I gained through ITE.
* **You can still change your course when applying for poly!** however, make sure you have a portfolio available for your change and ensure that you are prepared for their questions during the interview (e.g why are you making this change etc.)
* **Your first sem grades are important!!!!** try your best to score. with only 4 semesters, it’s going to be difficult to pull your grades up subsequently if your first sem grades are bad.

**POLY:**

I managed to get into Leisure and Events Management(LEM) in TP (now known as HTM) with a 3.2 C.GPA upon my graduation from ITE. I struggled initially, adapting to how different ITE was from Poly and that we no longer had lecturers who were there to provide us with constant feedback on our work. Despite this, I still manage to perform better on certain modules as I had already studied the basics in ITE. In addition, the projects that I managed in ITE made projects in poly feel like a norm and easier for me to regurgitate the information required.

Overtime, it became a lot easier for me to adapt to my surroundings as I realised that the key to managing my school life was really time management. I wouldn't say its' impossible to have social life, sleep and still score well as I have many friends who manage to have all of it. However, if you can't that's okay too. Know your limits and know what is important to you. As I have a part-time job, I did not join any cca and prioritised my school work. I also gain CCA points through volunteering and other positions that did not require me to make any major long term commitment.

**TIPS:**

* **Start to understand yourself.** As I start to shift into adulthood, I start to realise that the events life may not be what I am looking for. As much as I love creating and executing them, doing it as a job may not be what I would want to pursue as a career. It was demoralising as I've been studying it for 5 years. But that's okay. Find other alternatives and know what you can build through this skill you have learnt. Read up, look at some soft skills that you have learn during your time in the course and what interest you. For myself, I found out that I have a keen interest in facilities management and find passion in arts related facilities and therefore, steering towards that direction for further education.
* **Back to basics!** Similar to ITE, your first sem grades are important! Try to focus on getting your basics right as most year 1 subjects are foundational. Also, keep these notes as you'll tend to refer to them for more information time to time. Even during my time in year 3, I still refer to my year 1 notes and projects for references as many key information are present.
* **Prioritise!!!!** Know what is important to you. Don't push yourself if you know you're at your limit and don't compare yourself with others. Its' normal to take a break sometimes. The number of times I've broken down because I felt so incompetent really took a toll on my mental health. But always, talk to someone. Its' okay to put yourself before your studies sometimes.
* **CCA.** As mentioned, I did not have any CCA but took up various positions and volunteering work that provided me with CCA points. For TP, taking up the class representative position and attending events offer students SEAL/CCA points. Don't give opportunities like this up. It may come in handy whether you are looking for friends or just aiming to get the points. These points are honestly, a booster, when it comes to university applications as it really helps in showing that you're an all rounded student (especially when they ask you to talk about how you contribute back to the community and demonstrate some of your leadership qualities).
* **Use internship as a trial**. Whether it is to try something new or work in an industry you're interested in, use your time as an intern to find out about the real world. Find out from your supervisor and colleagues. Observe what they do and how they tackle these situations. Use this time to find out if you can see yourself in this industry and if not, what are your alternatives. If required, you can always use the elimination method (what are your choices &gt; removing your dislikes &gt; your final choice)
* **Consult your lecturers.** When in doubt, always ask! Many lecturers are really keen on helping students. I often seek guidance from lecturers as they have insights and knowledge on the industry which can be really helpful in mapping what I would like to do in future. If you have doubts on which intern company would be suitable etc, you can always check with the lecturers for more information on the company.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other tips:**

* **Your friends may not be the best group mates.** And that's okay. Different people have different working styles and sometimes, your working styles may clash and arguments may arise. However, try to work things out and not to ruin any friendship because of projects. Ensure both parties understand that the argument you guys had is based on the project and no hard feeling should be involved.
* **GO TO SCHOOL!** I know its' tempting to sleep in a few more hours and to skip classes but TRY to attend and go for every lecture and tutorials. Sometimes, its' better and easier to absorb information if you're listening to it first hand as compared to copying your friend's lecture notes.
* **Find out what kind of learner you are.** I personally am an audio learner when it comes to receiving information. However, I memorise better when my notes are hand written by myself. Find out what style suits you best and the best way for you to retain information as all these come in handy when memorising for close book exams.
* **Study ahead of time.** I really can't stress this enough but as tempting as it is to procrastinate, studying ahead of time really can help you prevent information from leaking especially when there are tests packed back to back.
* **Planner**. If you don't like to use a planner, your phone's calendar will do fine. Take down important dates (submissions, tests, exams) With a planner, you get to see a clear view of what is due and what is coming up in the month so to prepare yourself mentally and give yourself that sense of urgency that you probably need if you have been procrastinating.
* **Mental health.** Always take a break. Go out with your friends! Take a walk! Talk to your loved ones. School can be tiring and draining. But always remember there are people who are around you supporting you. Its' helpful to rant to someone especially when things can get a little too overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

And I think that's about it! I graduated TP with an above 3.5 c.gpa and an 'excellent' record on my CCA points (about 60 points for TP standard). Will be attending NUS PFM this coming semester (nervous but excited). Its' been a long journey for me and hope this post will be helpful to anyone who needs it!!!

PS. feel free AMA by pm-ing me or commenting!! Just hoping to help anyone who needs clarification or doubt when it comes to NA &gt; ITE &gt; POLY route since its' not a conventional route that many people have taken."

I'm succeeding well in school but I didn't start programming until right before coming into school. Older student (29) so I have work experience but nothing directly relating to CS. I'm just trying to get a feel for what kind of projects employers have in mind for first internships. Particularly interested in FAANG but realize that it definitely won't happen for my first especially in my situation. I am trying to get in a better position to intern for one of them before graduating though.
hrxhme,5,2020-07-15,Extremely long rant wherein I make many a stupid decision aka a transparent cry for help,socket_and_tenon,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hrxhme/extremely_long_rant_wherein_i_make_many_a_stupid/,"Hi everyone, I created this account because this whole college admission thing has me really stressed out and I thought that maybe an outside perspective would help. I am a rising senior that attends a fairly well known public performing arts school. I have only played flute for the past 5 years, but I have otherwise been involved in music from an early age, and for a long time, it was my dream to become a band teacher. I have attended mildly prestigious music camps, participated in a chamber music club and for the past year I have participated in a somewhat competitive precollege program. The most I've achieved was 3rd place in my age and instrument group in a low profile competition - no all state orchestra, no awards, no nothing. 

Throughout my sophomore and junior year, I struggled with regular panic attacks, anxiety and depression until my parents finally forced me to begin going to therapy. I went on medication right before the start of quarantine and since then, some combination of the meds and the lack of stress has allowed me to begin to reevaluate my vision for my future. Over the past few years, my interest in music has began to dwindle as I developed more of an interest in math and science, but because of all the money that my parents have invested in my musical career, I felt too guilty and scared to consider pursuing anything other than music in college. As a result, I took on a lighter course load my junior year, in part due to my issues with handling stress, and in part to allow myself to devote more time to practicing. 

I chose to take AP Biology because my physics teacher told me that it was a course that relied primarily on memorization, which I believed was my only strong suit at the time. I have always done better in writing classes (even though writing is usually a slow and painful process for me) than in math or science courses and I had a particularly rough time in physics (despite enjoying the curriculum and ultimately performing well in the class), so I thought that AP Physics and AP Chemistry were off the table for me. Looking back, I really regret this decision because I took AP Calc AB and ended up loving it, doing fairly well overall, even if I was never the best student in the class. Unfortunately, I ended up hating AP Biology -outside of chi square analysis and the labs, nothing about it appealed to me, especially since the teacher relied heavily on the textbook and the students to direct the class. I spent almost every day of that class wishing that I had taken AP physics instead, even if I would end up failing the course. 

Ultimately, I realized that something was wrong a month into quarantine when I started procrastinating for flute practice by doing calc and physics problems. Somehow, the idea of majoring in mechanical engineering had lodged itself into the back of my subconscious and I couldn't get it out. There is a number of problems with this: 

1. I have no background in STEM. I have not participated in a single math or science team, robotics club, done an internship, learned a programming language, etc. I have absolutely no STEM extracurriculars to my name that would justify my sudden interest in engineering, besides like tutoring math this summer but that's essentially nothing. 
2. Even though I have decent grades (101.92 average, gotta love overinflation) My current SAT score is abysmal, especially for the math section (1440 overall, 660 math) I took it before the outbreak without studying, foolishly thinking that I would have another shot at fixing my score. Another reason not to procrastinate in the future. 
3. I have no idea about how to write an essay about why I am suddenly interested this because I either don't know the reason myself or maybe its based in some sort of inferiority complex and constant need for validation but I'm still in denial about it
4. I have a poor track record handling stress and engineering is a notoriously demanding major
5. I still want to participate in music in some way, even though I am no longer sure that I want to pursue it as a career.

Unfortunately, because it is so rare for me to feel any sort of passion about anything else as of late, some part of myself has latched onto this idea and won't let go, which isn't exactly helpful when I'm trying to make a college list. I'm honestly not sure of what else I would want to do, because I'm pretty sure it's not music anymore, even though I don't exactly know how to break this to my parents or my private teacher. I don't want to go to an Ivy or a T20 school or whatever, I just want to regain some sense of purpose in my life instead of sleeping all day and wallowing in my own misery. I don't know if there are any schools out there that would take someone like me for engineering and when I brought up the idea of community college with my parents they got angry with me and told me that I was selling myself short. I feel bad because my parents don't actually put any pressure on me to succeed. They are extremely supportive of me in every way and maybe I should just major in math or something because my current profile doesn't lend itself to anything except like music or premed (but I don't like bio). 

Anyway TDLR: I decided I want to major in mechE at the end of my junior year, but my whole resume screams music major, please help. I am sorry for wasting everyone's time, I am aware this post goes on far too long just wanted to get it off my chest."

I initially decided to study as a Civil Engineer because I wanted to be more like my Grandfather, but I just went through classes not thinking too much about it and having apathetic feelings towards the discipline. It wasn't until junior year that I started to question why I was still studying Civil Engineering, and my folks pushed me to stay until I got an internship the following summer, which cemented my concerns into reality. I decided to look into the CS programs at Cal Poly since it was something that was always in the back of my mind, but I was told that I way into my Civil degree to add a new major or minor. 


I'm involved with the California Department of Rehabilitation due to my Autism, which helped out previously with books and supplies, but then I found that I could have further education paid for, like a master's or a post-bacc. I did apply to the second-bacc for Software Engineering at UCI which I somehow miraculously got admitted, but I didn't have all of the prequisites needed (and they got back to me way after registration for summer classes, May 15th, and they said April at the latest), so I admit that I messed up on that pretty hard. 


My counselor at the DOR recommended taking a coding bootcamp affiliated with a UC (so that it would be covered), which I did notice some red flags with Trilogy during the extremely easy interview and ""selective process &amp; not giving out employment numbers"", but I trusted my counselor so I wanted to give it a shot at least. Fast forward to right now, after three days of lecture the instructor seems fine, but the material is something left to be desired plus all of those horror stories with Trilogy freaked me out. I'm going to speak to my counselor about the bootcamp later today, and see if I could get the money refunded to the state, cause I didn't pay for anything and even I still see those flags hard. 


This leads up to my main question. I still want to switch over to the tech industry, but Trilogy is giving me bad gut feelings. I have looked into programs like Oregon State University, and CSUMB which offers post-bacc CS degrees online. Doing a Masters's is also on the table, but I'm not what exactly I want to specialize in (being a dumb 20 somethings). I would prefer OSU, but my counselor did say that funding for that school would be considered private (out-of-state), so I would be limited to the equivalent value of a UC tuition rate for that school year. If I went to something within California and is public, then it would be fully covered. What would be the best call for me to make? I do have lots of Udemy and free stuff to do in-between applications (being unemployed and all), but I do realize that I should work part time at the very least if I'm pursuing further education and help out my Mom. I owe a lot to her, more than I can every say or do, so I would want to work towards a career that I can take care of myself and that I enjoy doing. 


I apologize if the post seems excessively long, but thank you for taking the read the post, and I'll do my best to work towards a better future with your advice (despite Coronavirus wreaking the entire health and economy of the US).

I'd like to know whether it would be well-perceived by academia if I add a note in my internship seeking e-mails that explain why I got bad grades at some point (during approximately 2-3 semesters, I was suffering from a severe burnout and it had a serious impact on my GPA, although it is still a good one).

A lot of summer internship offers have been revoked due to COVID-19. If you are one of them and feeling bad, DON'T.  


Instead focus on what you can do during this summer to level up your skills.  


I had spent my summer doing small projects and improving my coding skills.  


I would try to solve problems on Project Euler. It is a collection of mathematical problems that require you to write an optimized code to solve it.

I did a project comparing 2 different types of path planning and coded them both on Matlab.

This is mainly to the guys, especially the young guys who are below 25 or just out of college.

I'm 28 years old. From the outside, I seem to be doing well. I have a solidly built physique. I read books. I know how to express myself to others. I do not seem to have excessive self-consciousness. I started a business (it failed) and have gained solid employment (I got laid off). I seem to be someone who is making their way through society. Except I'm not.

It all started back in 2011 when I moved back in with my mom after my sophomore year of college. after living on campus. I thought it was something temporary. I would graduate in 2013 and be out of here. Flown the coop. I also planned on moving to another state, because I had grown up my entire life in one state. Except that didn't happen. I didn't get a job until September of that year and then I was in an accident a couple of months later that sidelined me well until 2014. I got a job in 2014 as an intern making $12 dollars an hour. I bided my time until I could jump ship to an actual job. I got the job in mid 2015, making $38,000 year. At that point, it should have been bye bye. But no, I wanted to save money and take a good chunk off my student loan debt which at the time was 40k.

I made progress. More time passed. 2017. I planned on jumping ship to a new job. I got laid off before that happened. I decided to start my business. A year and some change later - I failed. Except now I was 20k further in debt trying to start it up. Got a new job in January 2019. I wanted to move out in June 2019, but that 20k of credit card debt + my student loans which was now at 35k. If I never hunkered in, it would never get paid off. So I hunkered down. I sliced through it and paid off 30k of debt in one year. I would have to deal with the rest of it on my own. I just turned 28 and I wasn't getting any younger. June 2020, move out.

March 2020 comes. Boom. Covid hits. Everything unravels. I get laid off last week in April. My mom needs some money to keep the house going because she got furloughed. There goes the rest of my savings for my deposit for my apartment. Now I'm in the process of finding another job and trying to get my business another go to generate side income. But now I'm 28, going to be 29 in two months now. I'll be almost 30 before I get my own place.

I missed out on the expansionary period of the 20s. Not once was I able to go on an adventure. I didn't approach women because I didn't want to take them home. I made excuses. I procrastinated. I didn't learn crucial life lessons. I had a massive safety net to prevent real failure. I have no real self-image credentials to fall back on. My friends are getting married, some are having kids, some have homes of their own now. They all learned what they needed to learn. I didn't.

I can't really call myself a man or an adult because I truly don't know what it's like to be out on my own. I'm a virtual child. Now, I'm expected to do all the things I should have done and I haven't truly grown up. All because I kept kicking the can down the road. I had 7 long years where I could have made things happen but I didn't. I didn't go full throttle.

My message to all young men is to bite the bullet and leave home as soon as possible. The amount of emotional and lifestyle capital you'll gain is incomparable to the financial losses. Money can be gained. Time can't. And now, social life is inaccessible until this pandemic is over and I'll have to start from scratch. But you don't have to be me. Use your time wisely and win where it counts. Don't always seek the easy path."

Do you have any suggestions?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hs4p0z/22f_europe_just_graduated_with_a_liberal_arts/,"TLDR: I just got my bachelor degree in psychology/communication (major) and English (minor). I wanted to get into the communication field younger, but I’m not sure if it’s the right thing for me. I’ve never known precisely what I wanted to to as a career. I feel like I’m a Jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none type of person and this gives me some anxiety about the future. I’m planning to see a career counselor, but I would love to hear insights or suggestions for a career path I might not have thought about.

Hi there (this is my throwaway account), sorry for the long post.

I just graduated from university with a bachelor degree in psychology/communication (major) and English (minor), but since forever I have never been sure about what I wanted to do as a career. Back in middle school, during some orientation classes, we were asked what was our dream job. I didn’t have one, but I answered « journalist » because I liked the idea of writing articles about a bunch of different subjects. I also had the vague goal to work for a ‘good’ cause in some NGOs (yes, I was pretty much an idealist). So, based on that, I aimed for the communication field. 

I chose a bilingual course in highschool (first language/English) and Spanish as an option. I made the mistake of not thinking concretely about the future while I was still a teenager. Back, then I pretty much lived in my own bubble. I was detached from the ‘real’ world and afraid to step out of my comfort zone. I’m a pretty shy and passive person. At first, I wanted to take a gap year after HS to travel and figure things out, but my mother wasn’t fond of this idea and encouraged me to go to university straight away and I listened to her because I didn’t know better. So I enrolled in the closest university to where I lived.

I have mixed feelings regarding my studies. I learnt a bunch of interesting things, enjoyed many classes, got good grades, met interesting people. However, at the same time, I developed anxiety and couldn’t see a clear path for my future and how I would use what I learnt in potential jobs. Some people around me joked about how liberal arts students end up jobless and miserable. Even though that’s not true statistically in my country, I see what they mean and I feel discouraged and useless. If I could start all over again, I would probably take a gap year to get more experience and maybe choose a degree in a field in high demand. 

My final year of university took a mental toll on me. I had a very stressful time writing my final dissertation which was crucial to get my degree (you don’t obtain a degree if you don’t pass some classes, there is no GPA system here and you can’t retake classes). During these months, I questioned all my life choices. I was afraid of failing and couldn’t help thinking about all the things I should/could do instead. My mind jumped from becoming a nurse, a secretary, a medical assistant, an electrician, getting into CS, IT, programming, even sales (probably not a good idea as an introvert lol), etc.

That’s when I realized I didn’t really know what I was doing with my life, how I got there and for which reasons. I feel like I’m pretty numb to myself and don’t really know what I truly like. I’ve been floating through life all these years going where people expected me to go. Right now, I have my degree, with good grades, but I feel unhappy and lost about which direction to take right now. My parents are hoping I will pursue my studies directly because « it’s harder to study when you’re older » and « you’re good at what you’re doing ». I don’t feel like pursuing my studies right now though because I feel so lost in life and don’t know where I want to go.

Here are some jobs/internships I did during my studies.
- I started to write movie reviews for an online media as a volunteer in my second year. While it was interesting at first - I like to analyze things - it’s getting a bit repetitive.
- I was also a private tutor for a few kids in middle school for 3 years. It was alright, but not my favorite thing. I kept doing it because I like the idea of being helpful to them and I could gain a little bit of money.
- Before entering my fourth year, I did a short internship as a journalist which was quite interesting, but I fear that I lack the social ease to do this job. I had to meet or call new people on a daily basis which was a bit exhausting and I often felt out of place.
- During my fourth year, I became a student assistant in my university (it basically consists of helping out students with organizational questions and ordering books). I actually really enjoyed this one. How the my uni system works is really counter-intuitive and I was happy I could help with explaining it.

What I think are my strengths:
- Learning varied subjects easily. I had decent grades in all subjects at school. I had to put more efforts in chemistry and biology though.
- Learning things on my own. I can study things independently. Learnt piano and drawing portraits that way.
- Languages. I speak English fluently, talk/understand Spanish and second mother tongue casually, understand some Italian and working on my German.
- Analyzing. I had many essays and research projects. Supporting an argument, organizing and interpreting data isn’t much of a problem.
- Attention to detail and coherence/consistence. This can be a curse as well, but I can point out things that aren’t clear nor making sense.
- Writing. I’m not totally sure about this one as my sentences tend to be a bit heavy and I’m sometimes using words or expressions wrongly. I also feel like my vocabulary is limited compared to other students in my field. During my internship, my coworkers seemed to be happy about my work though. 
- Imaginative. Not necessarily in the artsy creative type of way but ideas and different ways of seeing things come easily to my mind.
- Listening/advising. I can relate to people easily and understand what they mean and making them feel better about themselves.

What I think are my weaknesses:
- I’m very self-conscious. I overthink social situations and things I said or did. I think my social skills aren’t really great. When I don’t have an affinity with someone, I don’t know really what to say to them. I‘m not good at networking neither because it feels forced.
- I’m insecure and I fear failure. I always think I won’t be able to achieve things until I achieve them. But the cycle repeats itself. I also usually avoid or postpone things I think I’ll fail.
- I don’t have much of a presence and I have troubles getting assertive. Many people I know have strong opinions and state them easily. I don’t do that unless I’m 1000% certain about what I’m talking about.
- I’m hypersensitive and don’t take criticism well. I’ve made progress on that, but I still feel easily butthurt and discouraged by some comments.
- I feel scattered. My mind considers too many options and I have troubles sticking to only one. I think a lot about what I could do then end up doing nothing. 
- Procrastinating. I often do things at the last moment unless I’m passionate about them. The pressure makes me more alert and productive. It doesn’t work well with long term project though unless I have intermediate deadlines.
- I’m clueless about how the ‘real world’ functions. I’m not the most practical person ever. Things that are supposed to be obvious look alien to me. I have troubles to get my driving license for example.
- I rarely learn from my mistakes. I keep repeating the same shit over and over, especially when it comes to my procrastination. 

With all of that, I am wondering if staying in university for a grad degree is a terrible idea and if there is a career path that might suit my strengths, experience and degree. Do you have any opinions or suggestions for me? I would truly appreciate some insights here.

I don’t want to go back to university right now, but since Covid hit there are even less job opportunities than usually and I’m afraid I won’t find anything decent or anything at all. Money isn’t a problem for me because education is quite cheap here. 

Regarding my career, I don’t think I want to become a journalist anymore, because I don’t think I would fit in that field. I’m open to paths I might not have thought about, especially on the more analytical or technical side."

I am just so sick of all of this that I am starting to despise what I do for a living, dreading going to work.

I feel stuck. I've been working for this company over the last 6 years, giving them countless hours of unpaid overtime, including holidays and weekends, only to be ""rewarded"" with more pressure, more demands, lack of any kind of appreciation and empty promises. You see, my coworkers are great people and we work really well as a team. In order to help each other we always go the extra mile - none of that is in consideration to our management, they don't deserve it.

I feel stuck because I started working there fresh out of college (I did my internship there and was instantly hired), so I've never been to real work interviews and I am having real trouble wrapping my head on how should I write a resume, because I seriously have to leave this place and never look back, it's impacting my health and my confidence - am I able to get another job in another place? Do I have the skills? How will I afford my bills without a job?

After 6 years, my life is nowhere near where I'd like it to be, nor my pay is where I feel it deserved to be. Remote work during lock down was awesome though. I don't have time for anything, I spend my life exhausted and worried about everything, I am neglecting my friendships and even my relationship. I even adopted a puppy in order to force myself to disconnect from life problems (and because I am a dog person and always wanted to give a home and love to one) and I see myself just tumbling from chore to chore and not being able to have the energy to spend quality time with the ones I love, nor time to relax and just chill.

To add to it all, with pay cuts (a more miserable paycheck), I will have no vacation this year, which are two camping weeks that I always look forward to and I am not being able to find a house to move to (lousy apartment neighbors and lack of backyard for my puppy to stretch her legs). I think I might collapse any day now.

I am the one who has to put everything in place and make things happen, I am responsible for my own life, so I am in no way playing victim, just needed to vent. Thank you kind strangers."
hs8lvd,9,2020-07-16,Is my self-perception distorted or am I just a terrible software engineer?,ThrowRAjesse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hs8lvd/is_my_selfperception_distorted_or_am_i_just_a/,"Hi everyone,

I hope this fits here. It will start as a self-therapy post but please stick till the end.

I graduated in information systems at the end of February this year and have started looking for junior software developer jobs in the past couple of weeks.

I never really knew what I want to do in my life. And the time-out during the pandemic has given me a lot of time to reflect on my life.

I am a guy who is mediocre in multiple fields. I play the piano, I work out, I am am versed in the finance field, and of course I have some fundamental knowledge in CS. But the mediocrity is not even the problem. The real problem is that I am not really passionate about either one of these things. So I am currently witnessing the years holding the most potential just gliding away. 

At first, I thought it is time to just try out different things until I find *the one* that sparks my passion. But I am not sure if that is really smart to do. There are so freaking many things in life you could do and I also have tried quite a few. I even had a 3 week internship in a school for children with developmental issues which I found to be not too bad either. But nothing really sticks to an extent so that I can say: ""I freaking love doing xy!"". Going through thousands of things is like like playing the lottery.

So I figured that the wisest move in my situation might rather be playing the cards that I've been dealt. I mean, I have a degree with a quite good GPA in my pocket. And I am not completely lost when it comes to software engineering. I did understand major important algorithms in college, I got the advanced mathematics concepts too. But I just feel like I haven't learned too much coding in college. I feel like I managed to implement the bigger coding projects that relied on frameworks like Spring Boot only by googling for solutions without really understanding the fundamentals of different frameworks. I mean, I got away with it (I actually got an A- for my thesis which was pretty much a software development project), but in essence, **my knowledge in CS looks like a patched cloth. I feel like I've skipped half of the steps I should have completed in order to stand where I am standing today.**

And because of that, I am scared of interviews. I feel how I have so little knowledge and I can literally hear myself talking out of my ass, already feeling like I am busting the interview.

Am I being too hard on myself? What is expected from a Java Junior developer? I managed to write a web based application using Spring Boot, set up a PSQL and had it communicate with APIs. But if you ask me what the difference between a service and a controller is, or what beans are, I just can't seem to give a sensible answer. I feel like I've looked up those things so many times but it just doesn't stick in my head. It might be because I might have skipped too many intermediate steps. I am really scared of interview coding challenges.

What would you do in my shoes? Should I grab a book and just go though all the basics? Do you have any recommendations? All this makes me feel so stupid lol. I don't want to be someone pretending to be good at what he is working."

1. Securing a job abroad (looking at Scandinavian countries and surroundings. Europe majorly).

2. Pursuing masters or internship opportunity there through some scholarship programs (maybe I suck at Googling but I couldn't find satisfactory results).


I have a lot of reasons for choosing to go abroad which is why I'm not going to stress on that point. I need some guidance as to what is a good place to start. I can try friends and family, overseas job websites, search for universities, maybe some local agency that specifically deals with this stuff, LinkedIn (I have no idea how to bother people politely enough for them to respond) etc. 


Maybe some of you have been through this before, and I'd greatly appreciate whatever advice I can get. **If it helps**, I'm a BTech graduate (good score, respected university) currently working in the IT industry. My self evaluation is that I definitely have an above average (Indian standards) skillset.

hsb16t,6,2020-07-16,Building skills for interviews,Kay_co,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/hsb16t/building_skills_for_interviews/,"Ok so I’m supposed to be graduating in May (if I can even register for any CS classes) and I’m trying to get ready for interviews now. I know hiring pretty much starts now so I’m ready to apply everywhere but all the jobs require so much more than just knowing a programming language. They ask for a lot of technologies I haven’t practiced yet so I’m trying to enroll in every online course I can to learn and build up enough skill to interview on. My question is, how do I know I’ve learned enough? I guess a better question would be, how do I apply everything I’m learning into projects or something to really use every single part of what I’m learning so I know how to do it again in an interview. 

Background: I’ve had 3 software engineering internships at a FANG company and this is my first summer since I started college where I don’t have one (kinda depressed about it). I code in Java and I’ve taken DS&amp;A before but my knowledge isn’t the best because I never applied it which is why I’m relearning. I’m trying to learn JavaScript and python right now to add to my skills and open up more possibilities but I work full time at a restaurant so I code after work/in the middle of the night."
hsblpm,3,2020-07-16,social anxiety and college is really driving me to the edge,snoopy3001,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hsblpm/social_anxiety_and_college_is_really_driving_me/,"I probably wouldn't be posting here if I wasn't getting desperate but at this point I don't know what else to do or who else to talk to. This might be sorta long so sorry for that.

I'm currently in college but have been on summer break. I haven't even done much this summer due to quarantine (among other things) and despite all that's been happening, I feel like everyone around me has somehow managed to make good use of their time while I've sat in my bedroom depressed for most of the summer. 

College itself has just been one gigantic mistake for me tbh. I've always been book smart so academics was never a big problem, but I'm struggling with everything else that comes with college. My parents and family always insisted I go to college because working minimum wage isn't really viable and at the time it sounded like a good idea and if I could handle the academic side I figured I could handle everything else but boy was I wrong.

My parents have never really been that involved in my school life besides occasionally signing off a permission slip or whatever else I needed, which basically means I've been in charge of handling the school side of things for as long as I can remember. They've never even checked my grades. But now I'm realizing that I really wish they'd been more involved to help me make decisions cause I'm young and I keep fucking up every decision I make. 

My fam has never been to college (except my gma but that was so long ago) so they didn't help me with SATs, ACTs, and choosing a college at all because they said they didn't know much about how it works (which is a shit defense might i add because how is a 17 yr old gonna know much either when this is their first time doing all this too).

I ended up choosing a hella expensive college without thinking much about it. I figured I'd just pull out some student loans since my piss poor family wouldn't be able to afford it and the school had already given me a scholarship so at the time it didn't seem like that big of a deal. Plus, my best friend was going to the same school which was a big win for me since I wouldn't have to worry about finding a roommate. 

The icing on the cake is that i have pretty bad social anxiety. It's gotten WAYYY better since high school mostly because I started going to therapy for junior and senior year to work on my anxiety and depression (i had already attempted suicide back when I was 15), but it's still pretty bad. Everything I do is dictated around what my friends do because I struggle to do things on my own. Phone calls are my literal worst nightmare and even though I'm almost 20 my mom still makes a lot of my important calls. Trying to find an internship is nearly impossible because I'm too afraid to even reach out to people so I already feel like i'm lagging behind my peers in that aspect. The only reason I even managed to get a job at school was because I went with my friend to the job fair and I wouldn't have even gone if she didn't go first. I've definitely managed to do some things on my own which I'm kinda proud of but I'm still too far behind everyone else for it to matter much. It's hard when everything in college is dictated by connections and social interaction.

So now, not only am I gonna be in a huge amount of debt when I get out of college, but there's no guarantee I'll get a good job because I struggle too much to even make good connections and land interviews. 

I know it isn't good but all I do is constantly compare myself to my friends and classmates and think about what they must think of me. When they hear about how little I did this summer I stress about whether they think I'm a failure or not. I wonder if they judge me for not being as good as they are and it's driving me deep into depression.

I constantly feel like a disappointment to my family and wonder if I should have been born in the first place. All I've left them with is huge financial burden and nothing to show for it. I feel like my only escape at this point is to kill myself because the debt is going to follow me forever which means I'll most likely be broke for the rest of my life, and I can't seem to escape from my mental illness which has ruined my life before it even got much of a chance to begin.

Only thing keeping me here is my mom and the fear of my family having to take up my debt when I'm gone."

TLDR; Denied by 5 schools summer 2020 (applied to all with GMAT waiver) &amp; reapplying fall 2021. FEEL HELPLESS &amp; NEED HELP finding gaps in my application to get accepted! Willing to take difficult criticism &amp; advice. Very thankful for any advice!

**Background**:

· Work experience: 4 total years (1 promotion, non-management) at a FinTech firm in client service for hedge funds, PE firms &amp; large TAMs. Analytical role I turned into creating my own team (but not a direct manager). Firm was bought out by large publicly listed back-office computer software company in 2019. Top performer awards. Due to athletics, never had internships

· Extra-curriculars &amp; other experience: Charity board member, PE club member, VP of athletic extracurricular club, mentor, serve multiple charities

· Undergrad school/major: Finance from low-tier Dakota state school (Undergrad GPA: 3.67)

· Other education/coursework: multiple investment clubs &amp; athletic committees

· Race/nationality: White male from Nebraska. Sex: Male

· Other: Division I athlete

**Stats**:

· GMAT Score: 630 GMAT. Did not apply with GMAT score due to average GMAT scores &amp; waiver. Spent a year studying using bad resources early on, never been a great test taker &amp; time crunch of the GMAT doesn't compliment my strengths. Was 3-4 weeks from finishing TTP (now expired) when schools announced GMAT waiver. Pivoted efforts to applying. Did not take a practice test &amp; have not looked at the material in 4 months. Historically I test poor on reading &amp; vocab so do not believe the GRE suits me better. One official 480 test score taken before TTP. 

· Target Schools: 1st choice - Kellogg part-time. 2nd choice – any top 10-20 full-time OR T5 part-time (very flexible work hours &amp; WFH policies to be able to do this). Very open to location. Likely enroll in the best ranked school I can get into. (Kellogg PT, Haas PT, Fuqua FT, Anderson / Marshall FT)

**Summer 2020 Application Pitch**: 

· *Why I want an MBA*: enjoy servicing PE firms using our technology; MBA will allow me to transition to the other side of the table to work for one. MBA classes will help gain skills in financial analysis &amp; build connections. LT goal is to create my own PE firm in Nebraska.

· *Why now*: learned industry &amp; had experience working with PE firms. Need connections &amp; financial analysis skills.

· *What I bring to the table*: experience entering unknown environments &amp; finding ways to bring people together. Adversity faced in Division I athletics. 

· Received an interview to 4 of 5 schools &amp; thought they went well, but zero feedback.

**Other**:

· Although they each went to more prestigious undergrad universities &amp; have more diverse ethnicities, work colleagues &amp; friends accepted into PT &amp; FT programs using similar pitches of jumping across the table into PE (both PT &amp; FT). 

· Expected promotion to Senior Analyst in December 2020

· Current company &amp; role at a standstill. Although big, not a well-known tech/computer software company. 

· Applied as Nebraska citizen in hopes of some sort of diversity.

**Questions &amp; Unclear Answers**:

· 1 year from now I do NOT want to be in the same spot I have been for the past year. Do I…

1. focus solely on improving GMAT score?

2. jump to a bigger tech or financial firm (because current firm is not well known)?

3. change my target end goal from PE to IB or Product Management? (Is IB or product management more realistic? Am I shooting too high trying to jump across the table into PE?)

4. apply in a few years after more work experience?

5. Other/combination of above

· Does my Dakota state school degree &amp; applying from Nebraska not offer enough diversity?

· Are there any classes at Northwestern or University of Chicago I can take to improve my chances? 

&amp;#x200B;

Zero direction from admissions committees &amp; large amount of time &amp; stress spent on this journey has me feeling helpless. Again, I welcome difficult criticism &amp; any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

However, a friend (who also graduated in the same program as me, recently) got a job as a sysadmin/database admin, and is telling me that there's a second opening, and that he could recommend me to his boss.

The job pays about \~15k less than the average developer job in my city.   I'm interested in taking it as a ""stopgap"" job until I can find a SWE job, because it's available and I'm likely to get it.  But at the same time, I'm worried that taking a full-time IT job (as opposed to SWE) could hurt my chances of getting an SWE job later on.

All of the conversations between my advisor and I were saved to my student email.

So I graduate,  move out of state and start my job.

Fast forward 9 years and 2 jobs later.

I lose my newest job (with a different company) due to Covid. I apply to several different jobs and I got a call back from one of my top job selections.

They told me they cant hire me because the college I attended said they don't have a record of me graduating.

I call the school and I was told that they have records of me attending but I was only 'a few credits shy' of graduating.

Apparently what happened was either my advisor failed to override the classes and DIDNT TELL ME or somehow he didn't know he failed to override them.

After hours of explaining and pleading with the college they told me that the best they could do was re-enroll me but I would pretty much be a freshman again because credits expire after 8 years, and the program has changed to the point where most of the valid credits wont even apply to the degree anymore.

I dont know what to do. I spent so much money and I'm sick to my freaking stomach.

The advisor doesn't work with the school anymore, and I was told they don't know how to contact him. My old boss told me he remembers the emails he had with my advisor, but he doesn't have them anymore, and my school email has been deactivated for several years now.

Is there anything legally I can do?

**Update:**

I got frustrated and went on a long bike ride. I didnt realize this blown up. I'm being asked alot of the same questions so i'll answer them here.

**How could you not know if you received a diploma? Wouldn't you check in if you didn't get your diploma in the mail?**

I graduated with several  minors and certificates. When you graduate with a 'certificate' they will send you a literal certificate that looks just like a diploma. When they sent the certificates to my Dad's house (I was in a different state) I told my dad he could keep them. (as a way of thanking him for raising me)I guess my Dad thought that one of the certs was my diploma. He had it framed and hung it up, but we lost it due to some house damage, and I never really cared to request another one. (I really didn't care about a sheet of paper)

**Can you get someone to recover the university emails?/ The university should have the emails?**

I already asked them about this and they said that a students email address and emails are removed from the database 2 years after inactivity and they do not have the ability to recover the emails.

**Did you walk?**

Yes. (But to be fair, you can walk without graduating)

**Does a degree matter now that I'm 9 years into my field?**

The job market is very unforgiving without a degree.. Especially now that I'm senior level, most companies will think not having a degree makes me unqualified, or they will use it to try and get me for way cheaper.

Also, I worked HARD for that degree. Not only did I earn a 3.2 GPA, but I spent over $80,000 to obtain it. The fact that all that money is potentially lost/gone down the drain makes me sick.

**Can you just go to an online college and transfer your credits?**

Yes, but most colleges have a 25% rule where I have to obtain 25% of the credits from that college to graduate from there. So that will cost me roughly around $40,00-$60,000 and I have no job at the moment. Plus there is no guarantee that all the credits will transfer from my old school."

I have a physics bachelors with which I was originally planning to go on to earn an MS but got burnt out to a crisp on school. I have ""working knowledge"" of several programming languages and a laundry list of other what some people would call transferable skills. My internships were all in academic research, none in industry, so I know I have to get creative explaining how any of that could make me a good fit for industry-specific tasks. I'd been working a series of McJobs since graduation, got laid off from the last one right before Virus-mania started to run wild on the job market, and with my savings decided to commit myself to full-time job searching since.

From mid mid March to early April, I partook in an interview process for a technical writer position at a software company located in a city about 200 miles away from where I'm currently located, where I've since made plans to relocate to regardless since it has a much better job market for tech regardless. It went from phone screen with an HR person to a zoom interview with the program director. My selling points for this position were my knowledge of scientific writing from the aforementioned academic research and familiarity with the programming language their company uses. As you might guess I didn't get offered the position. Though I proved to be a good culture fit, I was, in all likelihood a backup candidate as the job posting insinuated it required someone with more experience than I had, which can't have been difficult to find. The company has re-posted the position twice since then on indeed (where I originally applied, and applied twice again to no avail) and posted it through many other recruiting agencies on other job search engines, such as CyberCoders and APC. A recruiter from a staffing network I have my CV on even recommended me to them again for it.

Fast forward to the present, a week or two ago I submitted a generic ""submit your resume for general consideration"" on the company's website and today I got an email inviting me to a ""Find out what you're seeking in your next position"" zoom meting in a couple weeks. They have a different HR person now than when I interviewed months ago, minor detail. I am still kind of interested in the tech writer position, though it seems like they're not interested in me anymore. I am also interested in doing something with data analysis, however they don't have any related vacancies to that at the moment. I've never done an interview for a not-listed position and I really want to get this right, especially with the current state of the job market and economic tumult. Given the specifics of my situation and general rules with this type of interview, how should I prepare for this?"

hsgb9o,10,2020-07-16,"22F, Europe, just graduated with a liberal arts degree. Not sure what to do next. Do you have any suggestions?",[deleted],careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/hsgb9o/22f_europe_just_graduated_with_a_liberal_arts/,"TLDR: I just got my bachelor degree in psychology/communication (major) and English (minor). I wanted to get into the communication field younger, but I’m not sure if it’s the right thing for me. I’ve never known precisely what I wanted to to as a career. I feel like I’m a Jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none type of person and this gives me some anxiety about the future. I’m planning to see a career counselor, but I would love to hear insights or suggestions for a career path I might not have thought about.

Hi there (this is my throwaway account), sorry for the long post.

I just graduated from university with a bachelor degree in psychology/communication (major) and English (minor), but since forever I have never been sure about what I wanted to do as a career. Back in middle school, during some orientation classes, we were asked what was our dream job. I didn’t have one, but I answered « journalist » because I liked the idea of writing articles about a bunch of different subjects. I also had the vague goal to work for a ‘good’ cause in some NGOs (yes, I was pretty much an idealist). So, based on that, I aimed for the communication field. 

I chose a bilingual course in highschool (first language/English) and Spanish as an option. I made the mistake of not thinking concretely about the future while I was still a teenager. Back, then I pretty much lived in my own bubble. I was detached from the ‘real’ world and afraid to step out of my comfort zone. I’m a pretty shy and passive person. At first, I wanted to take a gap year after HS to travel and figure things out, but my mother wasn’t fond of this idea and encouraged me to go to university straight away and I listened to her because I didn’t know better. So I enrolled in the closest university to where I lived.

I have mixed feelings regarding my studies. I learnt a bunch of interesting things, enjoyed many classes, got good grades, met interesting people. However, at the same time, I developed anxiety and couldn’t see a clear path for my future and how I would use what I learnt in potential jobs. Some people around me joked about how liberal arts students end up jobless and miserable. Even though that’s not true statistically in my country, I see what they mean and I feel discouraged and useless. If I could start all over again, I would probably take a gap year to get more experience and maybe choose a degree in a field in high demand. 

My final year of university took a mental toll on me. I had a very stressful time writing my final dissertation which was crucial to get my degree (you don’t obtain a degree if you don’t pass some classes, there is no GPA system here and you can’t retake classes). During these months, I questioned all my life choices. I was afraid of failing and couldn’t help thinking about all the things I should/could do instead. My mind jumped from becoming a nurse, a secretary, a medical assistant, an electrician, getting into CS, IT, programming, even sales (probably not a good idea as an introvert lol), etc.

That’s when I realized I didn’t really know what I was doing with my life, how I got there and for which reasons. I feel like I’m pretty numb to myself and don’t really know what I truly like. I’ve been floating through life all these years going where people expected me to go. Right now, I have my degree, with good grades, but I feel unhappy and lost about which direction to take right now. My parents are hoping I will pursue my studies directly because « it’s harder to study when you’re older » and « you’re good at what you’re doing ». I don’t feel like pursuing my studies right now though because I feel so lost in life and don’t know where I want to go.

Here are some jobs/internships I did during my studies.
- I started to write movie reviews for an online media as a volunteer in my second year. While it was interesting at first - I like to analyze things - it’s getting a bit repetitive.
- I was also a private tutor for a few kids in middle school for 3 years. It was alright, but not my favorite thing. I kept doing it because I like the idea of being helpful to them and I could gain a little bit of money.
- Before entering my fourth year, I did a short internship as a journalist which was quite interesting, but I fear that I lack the social ease to do this job. I had to meet or call new people on a daily basis which was a bit exhausting and I often felt out of place.
- During my fourth year, I became a student assistant in my university (it basically consists of helping out students with organizational questions and ordering books). I actually really enjoyed this one. How the my uni system works is really counter-intuitive and I was happy I could help with explaining it.

What I think are my strengths:
- Learning varied subjects easily. I had decent grades in all subjects at school. I had to put more efforts in chemistry and biology though.
- Learning things on my own. I can study things independently. Learnt piano and drawing portraits that way.
- Languages. I speak English fluently, talk/understand Spanish and second mother tongue casually, understand some Italian and working on my German.
- Analyzing. I had many essays and research projects. Supporting an argument, organizing and interpreting data isn’t much of a problem.
- Attention to detail and coherence/consistence. This can be a curse as well, but I can point out things that aren’t clear nor making sense.
- Writing. I’m not totally sure about this one as my sentences tend to be a bit heavy and I’m sometimes using words or expressions wrongly. I also feel like my vocabulary is limited compared to other students in my field. During my internship, my coworkers seemed to be happy about my work though. 
- Imaginative. Not necessarily in the artsy creative type of way but ideas and different ways of seeing things come easily to my mind.
- Listening/advising. I can relate to people easily and understand what they mean and making them feel better about themselves.

What I think are my weaknesses:
- I’m very self-conscious. I overthink social situations and things I said or did. I think my social skills aren’t really great. When I don’t have an affinity with someone, I don’t know really what to say to them. I‘m not good at networking neither because it feels forced.
- I’m insecure and I fear failure. I always think I won’t be able to achieve things until I achieve them. But the cycle repeats itself. I also usually avoid or postpone things I think I’ll fail.
- I don’t have much of a presence and I have troubles getting assertive. Many people I know have strong opinions and state them easily. I don’t do that unless I’m 1000% certain about what I’m talking about.
- I’m hypersensitive and don’t take criticism well. I’ve made progress on that, but I still feel easily butthurt and discouraged by some comments.
- I feel scattered. My mind considers too many options and I have troubles sticking to only one. I think a lot about what I could do then end up doing nothing. 
- Procrastinating. I often do things at the last moment unless I’m passionate about them. The pressure makes me more alert and productive. It doesn’t work well with long term project though unless I have intermediate deadlines.
- I’m clueless about how the ‘real world’ functions. I’m not the most practical person ever. Things that are supposed to be obvious look alien to me. I have troubles to get my driving license for example.
- I rarely learn from my mistakes. I keep repeating the same shit over and over, especially when it comes to my procrastination. 

With all of that, I am wondering if staying in university for a grad degree is a terrible idea and if there is a career path that might suit my strengths, experience and degree. Do you have any opinions or suggestions for me? I would truly appreciate some insights here.

I don’t want to go back to university right now, but since Covid hit there are even less job opportunities than usually and I’m afraid I won’t find anything decent or anything at all. Money isn’t a problem for me because education is quite cheap here. 

Regarding my career, I don’t think I want to become a journalist anymore, because I don’t think I would fit in that field. I’m open to paths I might not have thought about, especially on the more analytical or technical side."

First time posting on Reddit but I have been a lurker for years! 

I am a 25F working at a big 4 tech company as a software engineer in the US. As I am about to hit my 2 year mark in the tech industry, I have been doing a lot of thinking about what I want to do next. I had always anticipated going to grad school for CS but I am now realizing that I more interested in technology policy / regulations / computational social science. 

The kinds of programs I am considering are MS&amp;E at Stanford, CMU EPP, Harvard PPOL. 

My current trajectory so far:

Undergrad school: highly selective liberal arts college 

Major: Double major in CS and Math

GPA: 3.9 

Research: Senior thesis in theoretical CS which didn't lead to a paper. I was chasing tech internships each summer and didn't pay attention to research until my last year. 

Work experience: Working on an ML team at my company. Got promoted within a year which is considered a fast trajectory. 

Recommendations: I expect 2 profs from my undergrad school and my current work manager to write strong reccs.

GRE: good scores

Extracurriculars: Volunteer at a tech outreach non-profit.

Do I have a shot for these PhD programs at all? What can I be doing to strengthen my application?"

I even did two internships and later a job on computer vision projects.

However, after 1.5 years of working, I am getting laid off, because I do not have enough knowledge in computer vision to continue contributing to the company in a meaningful way.

I am now stuck with a degree and work experience that are completely unrelated to each other and I feel lost where to proceed from here. I have accepted that it is unrealistic to continue pursuing my dream job in computer vision and would like some advice on realistic options for my career.

This is my profile in summary:

* BSc and MSc in Mechanical Engineering but practically zero related work experience. Not even a single project because I insisted on computer vision.
* 2+ years of experience with computer vision related projects. Mostly manipulating images/videos and extracting information from them, nothing terribly advanced.
* Lots of programming experience, mostly in Python, but also a significant amount of C++.
* Lots of OpenCV, and some ROS.
* I like self learning. I learned everything I needed for my projects by myself.

I do not think I should go for a traditional mechanical engineering job because I have zero relevant experience and I cannot leverage my extensive programming experience. On the other hand I cannot really compete with true software engineers since I lack many basic knowledge in CS. I feel that robotics companies would fit my profile best but there aren't many such companies and they seem to prefer hiring specialists rather than someone that has a background in multiple fields."

I'm (21M) planning to work full-time and part-time at two separate tech companies. I have a year and a half left of college, but I plan on at least taking a gap year. I know most of you would say stick to it and finish the degree, however for as long as I've tried, I've struggled with attention to school and I've been on probation since freshman year. To the point where it severely impacted my mental health. It wasn't until earlier this year that I was diagnosed with ADHD combined. The diagnosis came as a bit of relief to me, as I always thought there was something wrong with me and I was a failure. My parent's don't really believe in ADHD or mental health-- they believe you should be able to rough out anything.

When I told them that I plan to move and work for two companies for a year right now, my dad lost it. My mom was surprisingly okay with my decision. The problem is that my dad is really controlling person in the household. When he doesn't get his way, all hell is let loose and everyone suffers. We got into a fight last year when my grades dropped, and he constantly called me lazy despite holding 2-3 internships during the summer.

I know I have what it takes to survive by myself. He brought up the point that the opportunities will always be there and if I move, better opportunities will always come and I will not finish degree. The ironic thing is that while trying to persuade me, he tells me I'm capable to do anything. Personally, I'm fine with that. If better opportunities keep coming without risking my mental and physical health at college, I see nothing wrong with it. My mom has told me to resolve this issue with my dad because its increasing her BP and she can't take it anymore. I'm also constantly guilted by my parent's health to do what my dad says so further complications don't arise. I really can't take it anymore and I just want to move. My fear is that if I go through with this decision, my mom and younger brother will suffer."

I take all my classes online and my internship is generally low level support tasks with some opportunity to assist supervisors on larger project implementation. 

My concern is quite interesting and may be, in part, a symptom of a larger psychological ""conundrum"" if you will. Maybe even a common conundrum of sorts. I have somewhere between a 3.6-3.75 GPA and I am entering my final two semesters. I feel my ability to get good grades reflects the effort I put into assignments and my ability to perform when a task is asked of me. However, I do not necessarily feel I absorb much of the information afterwards. Lets say I retain 10% of the information covered in a form of complete understanding. I fear that performing from memory is essential in cybersecurity. Sometimes I watch people on various streaming platforms perform CTF or penetration testing tasks in a rapid fire motion.

I get stuck in this place where the IT work in a desktop support sense is usually very easy and mundane. It will not sustain purpose or a feeling that I am where I belong in a career much longer. At the same time, I do not feel quite adequate to take on more networking and cybersecurity roles. Perhaps, I could get the required work completed but the doubt stems more from that ""belonging"". I'm worried the people I will work with might look down on my knowledge base. In a field such as cybersecurity I tend to get the sense that there is not much room for ""fake it until you make it"". That is to say, I have been through the formal schooling but can not jump into the terminal and start cracking away at auditing a companies security posture. Additionally, I spend all this time trying to figure out what is going on in my higher level courses.... I sometimes find myself at work forgetting basic networking terms and uses. Anyways, sorry for ranting. If anyone has been in a similar position before.. how might I go about deciding what the next step to take really is and what kind of career roles I should be seeking out?"

I've been feeling discouraged because of my current situation. I was hoping to get some insight and get a better understanding.

I want to go to UT Mccombs for the master of accounting program. Their program is one of the best in the U.S.

I have a 3.9 GPA and I have multiple awards &amp; distinctions. I am apart of the honors college as well and I've conducted research with the department chair 

I was super active on campus and held multiple leadership positions. I worked full time and had an internship as well.  

So, what's the issue? I SUCK at standardized testing. I've been studying 5 hours each day for nearly a month. I've only scored a 300 on the GRE. The average for UT Mccombs is a 320

I've accepted the possibility that I may never score high enough. So I've been beginning to think that UT wouldn't even glance at my application.

Are my expectations realistic or am I simply wrong here.

Any tips or insight would help! Thanks!"

Reaching out to seniors in uni courses that fit the above or anyone with leads on where are the best courses to go into for this field? I applied to SUTD (and ofc other unis, but this was the closest) last year but unsuccessful :( was rly looking forward to joining their courses in medtech and into EPD..

I'm aware that for these sort of things, you need a post-grad after getting into one of the many branches of engineering (BME, ME or EEE) for undergrad. Even having to GO overseas for the more clinical ones (like @ La Trobe University) but I'm leaning more into development/research. With COVID19, I'm not sure if going overseas is a thing for me (not to mention the debt) -&gt; Edit: I'm okay with overseas options if it starts 2021, but just not sure yet financially

My background is as follows:

\- Education: Polytechnic diploma with 3.7+ GPA (with merit but honestly dont know if this means much?) in computing but my work/'volunteer' experience dealt more with electronics and hardware.- Experience: I'm in an internship doing general robotics software ( and am hoping to secure a place to shadow at a hospital to make sure I understand what I'm getting into). Had 1 R&amp;D stint and 1 Exec role in a SME tech company- Personal interest: Both curiosity and very sob grandfather story but am legit that going into this has a personal stake for me (and actually involves my grandfather).- Test scores: Going to retake SATs in Physics (610), Bio (650) and Math 2 (610). Math 1 is at 700. My scores are really bad I know...- Not a lot left :(

Thanks so much in advance for going through this word-vomit and stay safe yall\~

I'm currently doing an investment banking summer internship and if all goes well I'll hopefully receive a FT offer by the end of summer. However, I really feel like I made a mistake by choosing banking. I'm actually a CS major at a top 10 school but have spent most of my time in college focused on finance because as a 1st/2nd year I thought that's what I was interested in. Now that the fake ""attractiveness"" of banking (prestige, pay, etc.) has worn off and I have a little experience with what it's like, I'm trying to think of other career plans after realizing that banking might not be the best fit for me. I feel like I was too caught up in what others were doing as a freshman/sophomore.

I've enjoyed the CS classes I've taken so far and want to pivot to software development, but is it possible in just the one year I have left to get enough experience? Other than the CS major, my resume has no relevant skills/projects/internships. I do have some experience with data structures/algorithms and coding so I wouldn't be starting from scratch. 

I know I'm already in a much more fortunate situation than many others and I acknowledge and am thankful for that, just wanted to hear some guidance/thoughts from others and what is the best approach. 

Thanks!"

I then found one reliable company (pretty big, established, international company), and pretty sure can land an internship there.

We (a group of 3 people) have decided to group up and apply for that company. I am the one that searched for all the details of the company (email, phone number, address).

Then, suddenly one person barge in and sends the application without me and my other friend consent. 
The only thing that she does is asks for one person in our group (and she said yes, without our opinion). 

Fast forward 2 weeks later (yesterday), they (the barger, and the yesser) received a call from that company, tells them that they have gotten the internship. Also, the company receives only 2 person for the internship. And me and the other friend did not receive any.

Keep in mind that the barger sends the email by herself. 
And the said yesser, her application is sent by me (together with mine). 

The company calls the barger first, telling she got the internship, then later calls yesser:

'Your other friend, do you want him too?' 
'Yes, of course, we applied together'.
'But we accepts only two person, and we have chosen one earlier, and the other person is you'.

She is literally speechless at this point, but can't really do anything as to get that company is really a golden opportunity (especially most of us still hasn't received answer from other company) . 

Right after that, yesser called me and said that she got the internship and told me as above.
Earlier, I had already knew that the barger had gotten that internship from my other friend.
That means that neither me, and my friend got that internship.

I was boiling hot at that point, but still aren't doing anything stupid (yet).

What should I do?

Tldr; a person barges in on a 3- person group that is applying on internship and landed the internship with one other group member (with only the consent of a person in the group)"

So, M(21)y girlfriend (long distance relationship) has depression (from a past relationship plus family issues) and her parents are not really the kind who 'believe' anything like that happens. Moreover, they are separated (not divorced) and always put her in between and give no fucks about anything happening to her (I would refer to my girlfriend as 'her'/'she' throughout). She doesn't like either of her parents since they have really been treating her like shit; her dad lives and works in my home town (I study elsewhere) while her mom lives in a different place a bit closer to where she goes to college. She had gone to stay at her father's for a week when suddenly the entire country was put under lockdown and she had to stay 3 months on the trot with a very toxic father who always feels like she should be constantly grateful for everything he's done for her and that he didn't throw her to the streets. During her period cramps, he didn't believe that it pains and forced her to so some household chores which led to her fainting, which he also called fake. Plus he kept shouting at the top of his voice all the time which led to partial hearing loss for her and she slept around 3-4 hours per day the entire period of time. We pleaded her mom to file a complaint or do something about it but she was unbothered by it all.

We somehow got her out of the place to a flat which she shares with two other near her college in another city, lying to her dad about why she's going away. In this new place too she's suffering a lot because one of the flatmates eats up her food and does not take any precautionary measures while going to her workplace, doesn't clean up after coming back and sleeps with other guys at their houses not caring about the pandemic. The other flatmate doesn't even stay there right now. Also the flat has 5-6 hours of electricity shut off each day due to some maintenance going on. You can understand what her situation is

Also her dad doesn't pay her any money really. She's searching for a part time job or internship very eagerly but hasn't been able to get one so far. This and a whole lot of other problems too.

You might ask how this is relevant? Because this is where I come in. I've been kinda the only person who's been with her throughout everything. She doesn't really have any friends providing actual support, just saying ""It must be tough for you. But hold on"". I've been the guy she tells everything to. I've been the person staying awake leaving everything I have if my own to take care of her and her feelings. To uplift her and help her in any way and to pull her ahead on the darkest days when she went towards the edge of giving up her life. Till today every second awake I've tried to remain if she needs someone to talk to or needs any help. Why I do it is because firstly I adore her and secondly I'm scared because she actually has no one except me.

And all this has affected me a lot too I admit. Now a bit about me. I have never been diagnosed professionally but I show symptoms of ADHD. I suffer very severely from procrastination and I have tried getting help for that. I get really anxious moments whenever a deadline comes near because I always put off eveything till the last possible minute. This happens very frequently and I really feel low and defeated in those moments.

And that is what is happening now. I have to finish a compulsory project in ny department that I was given months to work on and I only have about 13 days left for it. This project is supposed to be under the guidance of a professor but my prof has been really unhelpful and has just stated the topic on which to work on. This is a topic which would need the help of someone with more advanced knowledge but I'm afraid to ask my prof (or any other prof in my department for that matter) because he is quite moody.

I've been putting off so much for two reasons, because I've been really busy taking care of my partner and because I have this very irritating habit of procrastination on everything.

I would gladly acknowledge any help/advice coming my way (regarding her problems as well as mine).  And if you've actually read this entire thing with patience you're really awesome.

TL;DR I give all my time supporting my girlfriend suffering from depression and I get really stressed out when my deadlines come near because I suffer from anxiety and procrastination myself "

I've been on the job hunt ever since, and was lucky enough to get a couple interviews, then came the pandemic.

And tbh I can't help but feel a bit ashamed that I can't find a job right now because everyone's saying that ""IT is one of the few industries that aren't really affected"", more so now when the demand for online tools has skyrocketed.

I’ve been dating my long distant boyfriend for around 2 years now and we’re about 200 miles apart. We’ve visited each other multiple times and really care for each other. Recently, things haven’t been so well in his household. While not physically abusive, my boyfriend’s parents are often verbally abusing almost everyday now.

This all happened since things have been getting really bad since he came out a few weeks ago. His parents say they support and love him when he came out, but they made him watch anti-gay videos for 3 hours and made him read anti-gay books just in the past week. They also think this is all just a fad and bad-decision making on his part. Of course, this is all due to their deeply-rooted Christian background but of course this doesn’t sit well with the either of us.

His parents always blame him for situations he has no control of. His mother’s computer broke down because of a virus, and they’ve been arguing for hours saying how it was his fault when he has never touched the device ever. She also forgot the password to the device and blamed him even though he shouldn’t know that information. They keep calling him an awful son and I often recoil whenever I hear him shamefully call himself a bad person in front of his own parents over the microphone when we chat each other.

While his parents are paying off for his cost of living (shelter, food, etc) and not to mention his college tuition, we really don’t know what to do. All of these events have really taken a toll on him, and we’ve both come to the conclusion that this household isn’t very good for his mental health. This is especially amplified by the fact that he’s stuck with them during COVID and doesn’t have much of a life beyond living there now. He barely has any privacy and is caught in either an argument with his parents about his sexuality or about some other trivial matter he has nothing to do with almost every hour.

I’ve offered him to live with me next semester (since college is online now), but we really don’t have a solidified plan. Is there perhaps a safe way to compromise with his parents to let him stay over? Given their possessive and anti-gay attitudes it seems rough, and we would really appreciate any advice. 

There’s also the other option of not telling his parents and running away, but this seems risky and we’d need lots of input on it. I could pick him up and shelter him, but there are many things to think about. We don’t want to particularly sever his familial relationship by doing something so drastic.. 

I currently live with my parents as well, who are open to having my boyfriend stay over. We just worry about if his parents cut off his college tuition (he still has 2 more years to go), and how we’ll handle his cost of living. My boyfriend and I could get jobs or internships to cover that, but it’s just an extra precaution to think about.

What do you guys think? I of course try my best to comfort him and tell him things aren’t his fault, but his family constantly gaslights the situation against him. Any advice would be appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished an year at work since graduating from b-school and was looking at my finances today and realized I have saved about \~50k and the overwhelming feeling I have is just gratitude. I know it might not be a lot for many people but its the most I have managed to save in my \~30 years on the planet. Dont get me wrong, still heavily in debt from student loans thanks to b-school, but it feels so fucking good to have a little safety net.

I didn't come from a traditional b-school background - was a super naive and idealistic liberal arts grad who spent many years after college working for non profits. I loved some of the places I worked at and hated some but at some point I realized I was just working really hard and had nothing to show for it.

I had been considering going to school to get an MPP but when I saw the cost of tuition at some of the top schools I ended up deferring. Around the same time an ex-bf reached out to me asking for help on his b-school apps. His gf wasn't supportive of his decision to go and I ended up writing his essays for him and he got into like MIT, Wharton etc etc. The process of helping him made me realize that I could do this myself, something I hadn't really considered before and I ended up applying.

I got into a few places - one that was ranked \~15 gave me a decent scholarship but I also got into a top 10 school (closer to the 10) that didn't give me anything, but the top consulting firms came to recruit there and I chose to go there and take a shot at Strategy consulting.

I found business school recruiting and especially consulting recruiting to be the most stressful thing I have encountered. I had never been around that many ""sharks"" before. Some of the people in my school were straight up awful and I hadn't witnessed the kind of competetiveness I saw before. I had four interview requests for an internship and I bombed the first 3 -was really nervous, couldnt sleep the night before my interviews etc. This is after working my ass off casing etc etc But the last one was a strategy consulting firm and I basically told myself I am just going to try and do well on this interview and not think about anything beyond. Managed to sleep through the night before, and on interview day - I just fucking aced it. I came out feeling good and kind of just didn't care if I got it or not. That evening, lying in bed drinking a beer playing some dumb game on my computer I got the call. I was genuinely shocked. Interned there that summer, came back full time, and this first year I got positive reviews etc. 

I have a ton of b-school loans to pay and taking them on not knowing if things would work out or not literally aged me a bit. But after this first year, I feel both really lucky for being in the position I am and glad I took the risks I did.

I know this is a long inner monologue but really wanted to share."

I've only had a few responses from recruiters and hiring managers, mostly just phone interviews. I'm starting to doubt my job readiness and believe I need to again modify my resume/portfolio with better content.

I'm kind of in a bad position because I've never had an internship throughout college, my work experience is retail and restaurant industry. So you can probably imagine it's been pretty discouraging with just about every entry level job needing experience of 1-3 years at least in finance/accounting roles. While most internships are only for students, so needless to say I've applied to about 50 jobs so far and haven't had much luck.

I guess the kind of advice I'm looking for is what kind of positions I should be looking to start in. I'm currently doing my CSC course, and down the road I'm thinking about the CFP or CFA (I know very both different). However, I was hoping to get some advice from some of you who have been in the field for a while. I'm more so looking into which direction to take, I'd say I'm interested in personal finance and financial markets, but I hear a bad reputation surrounding financial advisors (sales heavy, cold calling etc.). I see an ideal job as 40 hrs weekly (not no IB jobs where they work 14 hour days like I hear), a good amount of interaction with others (hoping to not stare at a screen the whole day), and a decent compensation. I'm into investing and trading foreign exchange markets since I was about 18.

Tell me a bit about your jobs in the finance industry, how you started out (ie., entry-level jobs you've had), the education you had, what an average day looks look, salary and anything else you'd like to add!

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place but covid got me thinking about major shifts in the job market as well, automation taking over, and a deeper recession coming. Also just feel like I've finished school, and though I'd have every thing figured out, feeling a bit lost!

Any comments are greatly appreciated!"

I have an employment gap since graduation because my partner's parents suddenly passed away in an accident while I was finishing my degree, and we needed to take time to handle the estate and just not work. I am not sure if I should address up front in my cover letter, since it will come up in the interviews and I'm not sure if this gap is getting me screened out. 

I have some experience as a technologist at an engineering consulting company, but I am looking for entry level engineering roles in other areas (manufacturing, automation, robotics, controls). I have been taking online software development courses as well to compliment my minor in Computer Science. Finally, I have other employment that I have left off, some construction jobs, an overseas internship, office work, but it's mostly before 2010. 

Thanks for your help.

So, I opted then for doing my internships, which were called off due to confinement. Despite it was discouraging, I did get some valuable work experience and plus did bring forward a proposal to the project I was assigned.

My plans in long term are doing a MSc in Computer Science, but I'm afraid that this decision could negatively affect in some way my future application.

I have only had one internship at a small company from my hometown.

I took an early interest in making and understanding programming languages and in particular compilers. I did take the elective class (got an A) and have done 2 to 3 toy compilers as side projects, both before and after the class. Grades and GPA are not an issue for me, and I am interested in returning to education for a Master's and potentially a PhD.

What worries me is how to get into the compiler field. What job titles should I look for, what project should I do, and the like. Are there any related fields that may be easier to join and then morph into compilers? 

For example, Apple has a position called ""Clang Compiler Engineer"", which sounds very much like what would interest me and it only requires a Bachelors. Almost too good to be true, so it probably is. Are there any similar positions at different companies and what would the other job titles in the area be like?

The IdeaPad 3 has an AMD Ryzen 3 3250U processor with 2 cores, 4 threads, and a 512 GB hard drive and costs around $475. I mainly use my laptop for school work and such as well as casual gaming, but no online gaming or too fast paced.  I was wondering if I could get thoughts and opinions and some general knowledge since I don't know much about laptops and computers. I had one of out tech guys come into the office I intern at and asked him about these, his suggestion was the S340 because he thought it would be good for my purposes and plus he knows more about the intel core processors and suggested at least an i5. He said he didn't as much about the AMD processors except that he didn't like the cheaper ones and thought if you were gonna use an AMD to go for the higher tier ones. 

Some questions I still had are is how important are the number of cores and threads and how much would there be a difference between these two laptops in terms of the number of each core/threads on each one?  Would it be worth it to splurge a little more on the S340 if it performs that much better? And would it last longer (In terms of years of use I could get out of it)?

ht9ksj,3,2020-07-17,"How do I decide if I want to do a gap year, go to school in-person, or do online classes from home?",ThrowawayRA3373,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ht9ksj/how_do_i_decide_if_i_want_to_do_a_gap_year_go_to/,"I was supposed to go to UCLA in the fall, but now due to Covid, most people haven't gotten housing offers. I was lucky enough to get one, but prices are expensive, everyone is in singles, and are wearing masks and social distancing. Classes are all online (for most freshman), and most facilities are closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It definitely doesn't seem like it'd be an ideal college experience. I'd be sitting in my dorm, alone, taking online classes, unable to access most of the opportunities that make UCLA worthwhile, and it seems super lonely and difficult to make friends. I wouldn't be able to get close to anyone, there'd be a lot less social opportunities, I'd just kinda be alone. I'm sure I'd still meet people, but it'd be very different and not at all the same. Plus, I have friends (younger friends still in HS) who I could still talk to at home, so it's not like I'm alone either way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, then, I could do classes online from home. But I really don't want to stay with my parents (they're very conservative and I'm not, and I end up fighting with them a fair amount), but I also feel like at this point I'm used to it and could put up with it...It just really wouldn't be ideal, but then nothing is anymore. And I found, from my last trimester at home, that I really suck at online classes and disciplining myself. And on top of all this, I'm an undeclared major. I wanted my first year to explore, join clubs, see what I'm interested in, talk to people, and land on a major. And I wanted to really get involved in my GE classes, and see what interested me. I \*know\* that being at home, doing online classes, even if I pass I'll gain a much more superficial knowledge of the subject than I would if I went to classes in person. So that's not ideal either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so, I could also take a gap year. But there's two big concerns with that: one, I don't know what opportunities are available because of coronavirus. I could try to find an internship/volunteering experience, but I don't know how likely that is, and an online internship seems less beneficial than online classes. I could also try to get a job, but again I don't know how much that'd really benefit me/better myself. My other concern is that I don't know how actually productive I will be. Maybe in a gap year, I'd force myself to be productive and make my parents hold me accountable, but I'm worried that much like online classes, I will just flail around and do nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, if I do a gap year, that's the only situation where I could maybe get a normal freshman experience, and not miss out on a full year of college, which is really important to me. I'm not a partier at all, I'm a nerd, but I didn't have a lot of friends in HS, so I was really looking forward to making lifelong friends in college. Missing out on a year of that would be really disappointing to me. Yes, I'd also be a year later into the workforce, and I'd be a year older than everyone else in my grade, but I'd get the four years of college that I really really want. But again, I'm scared of ""wasting"" a year if I screw up and don't do anything useful with my gap year. Plus, I might (probably will) have to reapply to UCLA if I do a gap year, which isn't a huge deal to me, even if I don't get in, but it's another thing to consider. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my parents aren't super on board with a gap year, mostly because they don't know what I'd do that's useful, and because they want me to do online from home because it saves them money. I think I could convince them, but it'd be really stressful and difficult. We'd argue and fight and scream at each other and ultimately once I talk to them about it, I have to have my decision made because I'm gonna have to fight so tooth and nail for it that I'll end up convincing myself it's the right decision (this same thing happened with picking a college). 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I don't know whether I should do in-person Covid housing, online classes from home, or take a gap year. I don't want to miss out on my freshman year of college experience, but I'm scared I won't make a gap year useful, plus I have to convince my parents. And I don't know if housing is worth it if it's going to be all quarantine-style anyway."

Lately I’ve come to realize that they are just not good for me to be around and I am starting to question my mental health due to the way I was raised. My older sister seems to have done better than I have with being successful while being completely complacent to my parent which just makes things harder for me.

Right now, they constantly track me through my phone and get mad at me when I come home past midnight. They have even tracked me when I’m off at school in another state. My dad is very anti-drug and believes I need to stay clean so I can get a security clearance and follow in his footsteps.

Looking back I’ve realized that my parents have raised me to be dependent on them. I have very low self esteem and have always seen myself as less than others. This has also led to me lacking motivation and ambition which they get mad at me about too. I also suspect that I have or used to have sleep apnea which may also be from their parenting.

I’m tired of it. I want to be more independent but my family doesn’t foster an environment for that. I don’t know what to do right now. I just want to try getting an internship next summer far away but I would also be abandoning a lot of friends which I really don’t want to do and I don’t even know if I’m mentally capable of doing it.

Now I have a job at McDonald's, I first got it thinking it would be just a summer job but now with the whole au pair think falling through it's looking like I'm going to be stuck here the whole year if I don't figure out something else to do. I've been applying at old folks homes and other places that seem like they would be a good fit/also have low COVID exposure since I currently live with my grandparents.

I love gardening, photography, and I especially love to bake (considering taking a culinary arts course in my gap year but still unsure) I also really enjoy thrifting and making my own clothes.
I have always loved learning about new cultures and have been on small exchanges in a few European countries and last year I was awarded a scholarship by the US State Department to go in exchange in Ghana. I was supposed to be there for 10 months but had to come back 3 months early due to COVID.
I am politically active and one of my friends and I are trying to get our racist school mascot removed. Many people have told me that I should become a politician/diplomat but I'm unsure if I would enjoy the job. I'm pretty good in argumentive situations although when I am very passionate about things I can get a bit emotional haha
I am passionate about climate change although I have never had the chance to become truly involved in the cause.
I was EIC of my school newspaper junior year, it wasn't a big paper but I enjoyed writing stories and editing the ones submitted to me by my peers. I wasn't the best at editing or perfect at writing either(as you can probably see from this post lmao) but I tried to do my best regardless.
I'm an average amount of smart and feel inferior to a lot of the kids applying for internships, scholarships,
I'm really good with little kids and old people and enjoy spending time with them. My mom says I should become a nurse like she is because I am good at taking care of people but I'm a bit squeamish so I am scared that I couldn't handle the job haha. My mom believes whole heatedly that I can do anything I want to do which to me is quite frustrating because I know that over all I am a very average person with an average intellect. I know I'm not special and wish she would just be realistic with me and my future. 
My ""dream jobs"" are a photojournalist, a travel show host, and a test kitchen chef. Obviously, they aren't very realistic/ financially stable areas to go into and most of their job markets are oversaturated so I kinda gave up on them lol.
I hope I can get some advice and opinions about it all. Is there a specific field that I should look into? What helped you find your way to where you are now? Are there any specific skills/experiences that will make me more attractive to future employers?  
I just feel very overwhelmed and don't know where to start with the process or even where to look to find a way to get involved. I know that it takes time to find out your path in life but I am hoping that someone can give me some advice on how to get started."

You would think by now that I would be able to handle a simple coding challenge.
I was feeling good about myself and hopeful for my future but then I applied for this student org on my campus. There’s an interview process which includes a coding challenge and I had a week to submit it. They give challenges based on past experience and I got the hardest one. It’s due soon and I haven’t solved it. The worst part? It says in the description that “it should take you less than two hours”.
If I can’t complete a coding challenge just to be accepted into a club is there any hope for me at all? I had an internship where they let me do pretty much all front-end because they were nice and knew that’s what I wanted to do. I got so lucky landing that internship because they basically wanted someone with no experience they could teach. But no job is ever just going to interview someone with questions about front-end even if it’s literally a front-end dev position and I know that
I thought that having a CS degree meant you knew CS but looks like that’s not true I guess 🙃 I literally don’t even care what type of company I work for I just want a job where I can use the degree I worked really, really hard for. Am I even going to be able to get a job where someone trusts me to code or should I just apply to the nearest starbucks?
If I sound dramatic I am genuinely really sad. I feel so bad about myself. “Two hours”. I feel like an idiot

TL;DR: I am one class away from my CS degree and I have immense trouble with some coding challenges. Am I employable?

EDIT: okay I am having more luck after drawing it on paper like people said. I doubt I’ll figure it out in time anyway but I am somewhat closer

EDIT: okay I am a lot closer"

htgswc,5,2020-07-18,What should I do during my gap year?,csgapyear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/htgswc/what_should_i_do_during_my_gap_year/,"Hello everyone, here's some basic info about me:

I'm an 18-year-old student in the US and I've been programming for a few years. My background is primarily in AI (specifically deep learning, NLP, and computer vision). I was supposed to start college this fall, but with COVID-19, my school is conducting most of their classes online. Many students and professors have told me that at this school, you really learn a lot by struggling through problem sets with other students and seeing how they approach problems. Well, that obviously won't be the same in a Zoom setting, so I've made the decision that I would like to wait a year to start my education (assuming I can find something more productive to do instead).

With that being said, I also don't want to waste my time; my goal is to learn as much about real-world software engineering as I can. I'm currently working an internship at an AI startup, and I've learned so much in just a month, so I really would like to continue on that path. However, this internship is a lot less structured than I'd like, so I'm hoping to find some opportunities that will help me keep learning at a rapid pace. So far, I have 2 ideas for what I can do:

1) Coding bootcamp. By working at my current internship, I've started to see how truly localized my knowledge is. There are many parts of the tech stack that I know virtually nothing about. Given that I have such a significant knowledge gap, I'm thinking starting a 3-month bootcamp in August or September might be a good idea if I can get accepted. After that point, I'm not 100% sure what I would  do since most internship opportunities will be gone. I'm considering just trying to apply for jobs and see if I can get anything. Though I'm aware it'll be tough since I won't even have a bachelor's degree.

\*Note: Right now, most of these bootcamps have shifted to conducting classes online, and I'm not sure if that would be as valuable as a traditional bootcamp experience.

2) Better internship. Alternatively, I could try to get a more formal internship. My biggest concern is that from what I know, internships are generally for the summer so college kids can complete them between semesters. But my interest is to do something during the school year. Does this mean I would have to apply for a normal job? If so, should I? And as far as the comparison between this and a coding bootcamp, I really don't know which would help me learn faster, so I would also appreciate some insight on that question.

\*Note: I don't have much experience with the kinds of coding challenges that are asked on technical interviews, so it may be difficult for me to get an internship/job. I'm trying my best to cram as much knowledge into my brain as I can, but interviews will definitely be a challenge for me.

If anyone has other suggestions for how I could learn as much as possible, please do let me know. If not, which of these options should I pick and why? Thank you so much to anyone who took the time to read this, I really appreciate any and all feedback :)"

I'm a Filipino student that is an incoming junior studying from the Philippines planning to apply on the Ivies and MIT. Below are my stats:

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics:** Male, Filipino, Grade 9 - 10 is a science high school, but I'll transfer into a fairly competitive high school on my last two years, and first-generation

**Intended Majors:**

MIT - Biological Engineering or Biological-Chemical Engineering

Harvard - Chemical and Physical Biology

Yale - Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry

Princeton - Molecular Biology or Chemical and Biological Engineering

UPenn - Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering

Columbia - Biochemistry or Biophysics

Cornell - Biological Engineering

Dartmouth - Biophysical Chemistry

Brown - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

**SAT/SAT II:** I am yet to take these tests, but my latest practice SAT has a score of 1490 (770 M 720 R) and my SAT II subject tests that I plan to take are Math L2, Biology, Chemistry or Physics.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** Philippines doesn't do GPA, but my average from the Grade 9 and 10 is 94, which according to one website is a 4.0. My class rank as of now is rank 2, but that may change because I'm transferring.

**Coursework:** In the Philippines, there are strands which you will pick when you get into Grade 11. I picked STEM, which has Calculus, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics (Calculus) as some of their subjects. I'm planning to study for the AP Calc BC, AP Bio, AP Chem, and AP Physics C to take it the summer between Grade 11 and Grade 12.

**Awards:** This is where my application falls apart and is kind of worrying because I don't have awards. I joined the Science Olympiad team at my school but I didn't make the cut. The same happened with the Math Olympiad Team.

**Extracurriculars:** This is also where my application falls apart because here in the PH, we don't focus on extracurriculars, so I'm kind of late on the EC game. But I'm currently building a math and science website aimed to help students for learning. I'm also aiming to create a book on cells the summer between G11 and G12. On top of that, I'm planning to pursue a research internship at one of the universities.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I did research, but it is a required subject at my school so I don't know if I could call it an EC.

(Please give me suggestions on how to improve my ECs).

Thank you!"

I switched to the major a bit later so I just finished up our DS&amp;A course last semester, and to graduate on time I'm taking a course right now during summer. This summer I've been doing an internship also at a not that well known company. It's not exactly a SWE internship by title but I did get to do some programming. My concern is this, it's about to be recruiting season and I just haven't had time to get any LeetCode in or read CTCI on top of my course/work. Nor do I have any impressive side projects. With how competitive things are and how shitty the economy is right now, I just feel sort of hopeless about my outlooks for an internship at a Big N or whatever term is used for these ""top"" tech companies. I'm well aware there's companies outside these, but I was really aiming for these. The summer after junior year is most important, and I feel like I won't be able to land a good internship for then given the timeframe.  I know how elitist and stuff this sounds, but I just wanted to voice these feelings. It kind of sucks how recruiting is basically already happening and will close up so soon, and I'm about to miss that window :/ Any advice? Should I just buckle down and LeetCode? Do I have enough time for anything? Honestly I'm just nervous man, with the way the economy is right now especially, all these timelines closing in and realizing I'm about to be an upperclassmen"
htj48b,1,2020-07-18,What is the best way to finally get a job in your field when you have the education but little experience?,discofruit27,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/htj48b/what_is_the_best_way_to_finally_get_a_job_in_your/,"So, long story short, when I graduated high school I went to get a degree in advertising with plans to be an art director. Those plans fell short when after a couple of years I had a life event in which I moved back home for a bit. For a couple years I worked two jobs (in retail) and was pretty depressed so I did nothing to really improve my life in any way. I ended up going back to school and studied graphic design. I just graduated this year, and I’m very happy with my decision. I did an internship last year (at a place I really didn’t like as it was a rather toxic environment) so therefore it never turned into anything. 

I don’t have any financial help, so in order to continue paying my bills I have been working at a retail job. It is a job I have had for years, since my boss works around my school schedules really well and it is always kind of a good fallback when other things don’t work out. Not to mention I love my coworkers. Unfortunately I feel it’s harder to get ahead this way, since some of my design friends have a lot of help so they’re able to do unpaid internships or have more time to focus on their goals when sometimes I get home exhausted. 

I’m 27, and I feel like I’m getting at a point where I have wasted my twenties since I still don’t have an “adult job” or anything in my field. I have done some freelancing, and recently had an interview for a marketing position at a non-profit in my area. I almost got the job but they went with someone who had more of a writing background because that’s what they need (however they did a debrief with me and I will be doing some project-based design work with them going forward). Obviously things are tough right now with the pandemic, but there are some things available I just need to look for them. 

I am just self-conscious that at this age I have worked since I was 15 but none of it really relates to my field of work. I have friends who have never had a job but still found graphic design work because of knowing someone/being good at schmoozing, yet I am still very self conscious about having lots of retail but no design related experience. I have some education, and a decent portfolio (plus some good contacts) but if anyone has any advice on some things I can do to move myself forward I would really appreciate some guidance. I forgot to mention I was also going to work as a TA this summer for my graphic design program but am no longer needed as they are only doing online classes. 

Quarantine hasn’t helped since I am an essential worker and have been working throughout the pandemic, so I haven’t had the extra time to really delegate since it has been pretty mentally/physically draining so many days I get home and just want to relax. 

I recently found an open position in my city for a summer job doing a lot of social media marketing. I found some free online courses I’m working through to add a certification to my resume. I want to send my resume/cover letter after the weekend before the deadline. I guess I need to sell myself, but without the experience I feel like I wouldn’t be first on anyone’s list and it gets me down. I just need someone to give me that chance so I can get a foot in the door. 

Any advice is appreciated at this point. Sometimes I just feel like a big loser! 

Thanks in advance!"
htjed4,2,2020-07-18,Advice on Getting a TS Clearance,infosecthrowaway3,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/htjed4/advice_on_getting_a_ts_clearance/,"I know that r/cybersecurity is pretty much flooded with new comer advice, but this question is a little off the beaten path. 

After doing quite a bit of job searching I've come to realize that to really succeed in the field I will most likely need a a Top Secret clearance. After looking through the requirements and automatic disqualifiers, I'm honestly a little concerned.

A bit about my past: I have been a long time... uh.. aficionado of mind altering substances. I have bought sold and used everything outside of the deadly triad (meth, crack, heroin). This eventually lead to a rather intense police investigation, that I narrowly escaped due to the expertise of a well paid lawyer.  I also have attended some anonymous rallies, and generally hung out on the deep and dark side of the internet for a long time as well. 

**Here's what you need to know:** I have no felonies, nor any formal allegations of drug charges or anything other than a speeding ticket on my record. I did attend rehab once (two years ago), but have been relevantly clean since then (I attend EDM festivals and partake in the festivities but do not sell or post anything about my drug use). I do have old social media accounts that have a storied history of giving advice and telling stories of my drug use (think the old era of tumblr).

I am really passionate about the field, I'm working on finishing a degree in philosophy and economics, before I go on to attend an online school for a cyber security degree. Meanwhile, I have and IT internship at a local bank, where they have offered me a permanent position (this is just broad IT helpdesk/network or system administation not info sec specifically). I have an appointment to take my Net+ in August, and I plan on taking my Sec+ before the new iteration next June. I play with tryhackme and hackthebox in my spare time. I'm building a home IDS and IPS on raspberry pis for my home network. 

**The Question:** I'm honestly pretty worried that my past choices will shut down a career that I haven't even started. Is there anything I should know? Should I go ahead and start purging any accounts that have anything drug related tied to me? How deep are they really going to look into me? Are we talking pulling my search history from google, or just looking at my official past?

Throwaway so that I have one less account to purge."

I grew up around one of the best public school systems in the US. I graduated from an amazing high school and got into a top university. I've coasted through college by having a group of friends with loose morals when it comes to academic integrity. Overall my circle has probably reduced my workload on assignments and projects by at least 50%. But I've still kept a good GPA by cramming the nights before exams and by being a good test taker. I have zero projects outside of class and internships, and zero extracirriculars unless you count selling drugs or joining a frat. The prior two summers I've had internships at smaller companies. Both summers I was given a vague, open-ended project, probably beyond the scope of my skills. I really didn't get much done those summers due to a lack of caring but it was something for my resume.


Last fall I finally got an in with some of the big name companies. Luckily coding challenges come naturally to me and I aced my interview to secure a dream internship at a FAANG-level company for the summer of 2020. I thought this summer would be different. With a legit internship at a legit company I thought I could finally have a good run at an internship. But nope. I've completely fumbled the bag. I'm not working hard enough, I'm behind on milestones, and would be surprised to get a return offer. I feel like quarantine/remote work has killed my motivation. I usually rely on having peers around me to stay grounded and remind myself that I can't be falling behind. 


I feel like a lazy spoiled fucking brat. I give up too easily if I can't figure something out and feel too anxious to ask for help immediately. If I can't succeed at a company that's meant to be a great experience for interns then I don't think I'm cut out for this industry. But the problem is there isn't really anything else I have the qualifications to make a career out of. Deep down some part of me thinks I'd be content to work a job where I wouldn't have to worry about thinking and getting stuck/frustrated. But I also know I couldn't work a job like that and feel anything except shitty watching my friends, peers, and siblings surpass me in every way possible. 


Next year is my last year of school so I need to figure shit out now. I'm willing to keep trying at SWE for hopes that I'll feel more at home when remote work ends. I'll at least have an internship at a great company on my resume, but without a return offer will I be able to secure a full time job at another good tech company? I'm good at things like taking tests and coding challenges. It's also not like I completely hate CS. I actually kinda enjoyed some of my algorithms and theory classes. But I feel like none of those things are applicable to the actual industry. What should I do if tech just isn't for me? I feel completely lost right now."
htltqx,1,2020-07-18,I need help dealing with some paranoia/my reactions in regards to indirect &amp; passive aggressive actions of people towards me,canevryonechillplz,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/htltqx/i_need_help_dealing_with_some_paranoiamy/,"Sorry I dont know if this is the right place to post this, Im just looking for some help.

Sorry for the title, I dont know how to express it. Basically, Im hypersensitive(?) to people's passive aggressiveness/indirect communication. Like I notice it, and it makes me overthink as to what they mean with their actions, or what their point is. Sometimes I dont get it. 

Ill give an example. I started talking to a guy a while ago, sometime around February I mentioned to him that I used to smoke pot, because I did (it was a slight issue and Ive actively take action to help my self over the years). On April 23rd 2020 I stopped for good. Sometime a little later I felt like he was hinting stuff so in May I admitted to him that I stopped and the date. On June 21 he sends me a message saying he slept for 22 hours, to then stay silent until the 22 and at my 23:05 (His 1am) he sends me a voice message exactly 23 seconds long, where somewhere in the middle of it he seems to rush his words. June 23rd I just send him: ""23 is my facvorite number, Makes me happy to see it so many times on a single page. Happy June 23rd \[daisy emoji\]. He doesnt asnwer. The next day I send him a message at my 23:23 to ""make a wish"" just so that i can say that 23 is genuinely my favorite number and has been my entire life. 

Just yesterday i sent him a message around 9:15pm, which he answers about 10 mins later, then I ask if he has 10 mins to spare so we can talk, he doesnt answer until 23:23, under the pretext that he was on a business call from USA (so about 2pm USA time). I mean it might be true, but it might also be manipulative and calculated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand coincidences are a thing, but sometimes its too much. 

Another example: This one HR peer set me up with a HR manager from the company she interned at and it took this lady ages to give me the time and day for a call, then eventually approve my application for one of the several positions I applied for, and when at the end she finally sent me the offer for a position, I had to kindly decline as another company had been more efficient at the interview process and getting me an offer. About a week after I decline the offer, the peer who had initially put us in touch changes her Linked in Job status to the exact title I was hired for, but for a different company. 2 reasons why this doesnt make sense: 1. she has 2 on going ""jobs"" one is an internship while the other is this position, and although she just posted it, apparently she started it in March, while she started the intern position in February. 2. She is HR, she studied HR, she has interned as HR, how can she become an Account Manager at a different company all of a sudden? Like what are the odds? This just raises red flags to me and makes me feel targeted to a certain extent, I wont lie. It also makes me feel and think someone from the company I am going to join went ahead and told the company I declined. (Please note I was hried by HR and Hiring managers in the headquarters but my position is based in a different country, the position i declined is in this country, so its possible these people know each other. One of the people I interviewed with for the declined company has the exact same first and middle name as my new boss, which raises more red flags for me)

&amp;#x200B;

My point with these two slightly brief but not really examples is that I see a lot of these actions, and put several of these dots together. I understand that this comes across as paranoid, but in all honesty, I do think there is some validity to my ""consipiracy theories"". I feel like sometimes these ""indirect attacks"" and ""passive aggressive actions"" can be extremely obvious. The only thing that is missing is the proof, and the fact that they cover themselves up well with plausible deniability.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to deal with these thoughts I have? The way I put these things together. WHY am I even getting this kind of shit? I do believe sometimes I stand out to people, like I feel have a pretty particular life story. Like I think it makes so much more sense if I lay absolutely everything down, but that would be long. Do I come across like passive aggressive from the get go? Am I just too sensitive? I understand I overthink things but I do feel like there is a reason to.

&amp;#x200B;

Im so sorry for the long post and slight rambling. I dont know what to do about this, where or what to read. Anything is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much"

With that being said, the general gist of what I want to know is any opinions or advice that could help me finally land a full-time job, and maybe more specifically, what do I have to do to possibly show a potential employer to just give me an opportunity/chance especially if I don’t have a shared contact that could refer me to a position considering that is going to be the majority of my cases unfortunately. So as for my “background” info, I do have a Bachelor’s degree in International Relations and I had tried looking for work in relation to what I studied right after I graduated to no avail, then I tried looking for any work just to make some income, and the only thing I was eventually able to find was a part-time job. If I am honest, at the time I maybe didn’t look for a job as hard as I probably should have but none-the-less I did try. I have other experiences of course such as working in the restaurant industry, worked as an intern at the Panamanian Consulate, a newspaper warehouse, and worked at 3 different health care clinics including a hospital. Anyways, so I ended up working at the part-time job for 4 years and within those 4 years I was promoted to a supervisory role, it wasn’t a good job and even after I had been promoted it was still only part-time and I stayed there for that time period partly because I became complacent (since it was the only thing I could find after constantly applying to multiple jobs and nothing) and also because I kept holding out hope that I could get promoted once more but to a higher position that was full-time with benefits. Unfortunately, if my degree was worthless before, it is even more worthless now considering I graduated back in 2014. 

I was a at a cross roads in my life (and am currently as well I guess), I could’ve either continued at that job that essentially was going nowhere, or go back to school and work towards a “practical” (in the sense that it was a study with a high job outlook) degree. So I decided to go into the PTA program (physical therapy assistant), I studied harder than I ever have before, during my 1 year of pre-requisites before applying I would study 8 -12 hours a day including the weekends, got straight A’s (a first for me personally) and I got in my first try (there is a waiting list like many healthcare programs) out of an average of 200 applications in which only 32 get accepted. Whilst in the program, I continued to study just as hard if not harder due to the sheer quantity of material and pace of the program, and was so unbelievably stressed and utterly miserable. I eventually ended up leaving the program in the 3rd semester (2 year program) because I realized it just wasn’t for me, not just the sheer stress from the non-stop hours of studying but the field itself, while it had its interesting aspects it simply was not something I ever truly enjoyed or was passionate about. This was just last year (2019) when I decided to leave, and since leaving I was “fortunate” enough to find a part-time job (all I could find) at a fine dining restaurant by going in person to over 15-20 different places, but then eventually me and around 5 other co-workers had to be laid off once the COVID-19 pandemic hit. I have tried different things to improve my chances of finding work, right after I had graduated with my bachelors I had tried going to career fairs, I made online resumes through various job board sites such as *Indeed*, and *CareerBuilder*, I also tried to spruce up my *LinkedIn* profile the most that I could with the experiences that I have. I don’t have many connections at all, but the very few that I do have, I’ve asked to just keep their “eyes open” for me so-to-speak. Most jobs nowadays are all online (in terms of applications), so I have filled out many applications on job board sites, but I also have tried going in person to various places with very little luck. Since I have left the program and since I had been laid off from my restaurant job due to the pandemic, I have sat down and tried to really think about what are the things I have always enjoyed learning about since I was a kid, and whether any of those subjects would be worth going back to school for, even though I truly TRULY don’t want to go back to school, I feel like I’ve spent a lifetime already in school and I’m tired of it and want actually want to work. 

After taking into consideration the “passion” I have for the various fields I’m interested in relation to the “practicality” in terms of their job growth, none of the fields are worth it in my opinion. Yes, I don’t want to make the same mistake as before and only pursue something out of “practicality” and would want to lean more towards something that I have passion for, BUT at the same time I don’t want to go to the opposite end of the “spectrum” and just pursue something that I am passionate about but has no real or low job prospects. That would just be time and energy wasted, along with more student loans I’d have to take out which I really REALLY don’t want to do either. I am not super picky either in terms of what job I can get and I don’t expect much (as entry level which is perfectly fine) and don’t think I am asking for much, I realize that I only have so much experience in various backgrounds, but I already know that you have to work your way up. But even then, naturally like anyone, we all have standards that we want to aim for and simply put, some jobs/careers that interest us more than others. One of the very few and constant jobs that I see for someone in my current position is sales, and its just something I am not particularly interested in nor do I think I would be very good at it, but even so I have applied to some and haven’t gotten a position doing that either. I am currently 28 years old, and I am not happy with my current situation because I want to move out of my parents’ home, I want to work, and I want to be financially independent. I am NOT going to give up though no matter what, I am going to keep looking for work and keep applying, but if I’m honest it is starting to get very disheartening and I’m really trying to keep my head up. I apologize if some of this sounds like I am venting because I guess it somewhat is, but the other part of this is me trying to reach out and ask for help, they always say to ask for help, well that is what I am trying to do. So just to re-iterate, what more can I possibly do to have a potential employer to just give me a chance, I am stranger and they don’t know me, fine, I understand that and that is why I always INSIST to please contact my previous employers. They can explain that I am a hard worker, reliant, take orders well, communicative, and just have an overall great work ethic, but I don’t even know if the employers are bothering to contact them. That is probably one the biggest issues holding me back, that most people aren’t even willing to give you a chance unless they have a shared contact that refers you to a job, and there is only so much “excitement”/”enthusiasm”/”energy” you can possibly exude to a recruiter for a position assuming you even get as far as an interview. I really look forward to any help, suggestions, and opinions you all could share.

Thank You"

I wanted to ask all the people who found a job after university/college, how did you do it?

A bit about my self:

- I graduated university 3 months ago with a 3.1/4 average (I know not the best).
- within university I joined a few clubs like the investment club and DECA U
- I did 4 internships at Royal Bank of Canada (twice), Manulife and a Government Agency.
- I also have 2 years of retail experience 

I know my grades aren’t the best but I figured that I would at least find some sort of entry level job in corporate banking at least in operations. I have applied to many corporate jobs but I did not even receive a single interview.

I am not mad about not getting a job but I am frustrated why am I not getting a interview? 

I have seen people with 0 relevant job experience get jobs I know my experiences are fit for.

I have also got my resume edited several times but still no luck? 

I also tried networking via LinkedIn but people don’t reply or if they do reply it’s not that useful. 

What am I doing wrong? Is it time I look into the crime world? Because this decent man lifestyle ain’t working out and I got student loans to pay back 😂😂 


This entire system is screwed up. I never wanna hear anyone say “you can be whatever you want” cuz that’s not true unless u filthy rich."

htoya0,187,2020-07-18,These are my notes from Graduate Admissions Essays by Donald Asher,Texas_Rockets,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/htoya0/these_are_my_notes_from_graduate_admissions/,"I read this book and it was extremely helpful and served as a great introduction to the grad school application process. I continuously recommend that people on this sub read it so I figured I may as well post this

&amp;#x200B;

**Book Notes**

General 

·  See if emailing professors makes sense for this kind of degree. If so, go back to location 724

·  The biggest mistake made by applicants is to not customize every application 

·  Don’t get too attached to one school during the admissions process

·  Double check every step of the application that requires other people’s effort 

·  Plan on submitting your application months early

o  Especially with a rolling deadline because they make decisions as applications arrive and they’re pretty exhausted by the end 

o  For competitive programs make sure to apply at least 2 months early 

·  Make checklists and timelines for each school

·  Most schools wont review your stuff until everything has been received

·  Talk to schools about the application fee waiver beforehand because it can take time

·  If there’s a significant wait time between application deadline and now take a relevant job or internship to show that you’re serious about this field 

·  Asher’s law: though shalt not call, write, or visit any professor without having read some of their work

·  Three most valuable ways to stand out if you’ve already graduated

o  Write to professors

o  Visit the program

o  Submit exceptional work sample 

·  You should definitely visit your top choices if you can because it creates a really good impression 

·  Always coordinate visits beforehand. Tell them you’re very interested in the program and would like to visit and ask if someone can meet with you during your visit 

o  Don’t just hit up the main office. Get in touch with a professor, for example

o  A few days beforehand be sure to call or email to confirm your appointment 

·  When submitting a work sample it should be directly related to the grad topic and must be really good

·  Don’t stop working on the application until you’ve verified everything is done

·  Verify that the program and grad school requirements are the same 

o  Professional schools usually have more control over the application requirements than the grad school does 

·  Hit submit before the final materials start arriving

·  Pay the fee asap 

·  Some schools may call and ask you if you’d accept if you were admitted. Be honest but protect your options. 

·  Schools have wait lists so there is recourse for them if you accept them decline down the road

·  If you think you’ve been waitlisted do something to try and change their mind like submitting another LOR

·  If you get denied and would like to know why, just ask. The council of grad schools encourages schools to answer specifics @ loc 1599

·  Ideally, don’t submit your application for the top choice school until you’ve submitted the others so you’ve got a few dry runs under your belt 

·   

Essay

·  **When your essay reflects that you’ve chosen a school that closely matches your interests it has a big impact on your application**

·  If you have to write your essay by filling in a window write it somewhere else and paste it in. they can see what you write before you submit it

·  If the essay window has a character count feature make sure you adhere to it so it doesn’t get cut off

·  Make sure it’s the same after you paste it in because sometimes they fuck with the punctuation and grammar and stuff

·  Most essay prompts are mostly the same so write it for top choice school first then modify it for the others

·  Make sure you’ve read the prompt very closely 

·  **The first draft should be brutally honest**

o  Don’t think too much, just write 

·  **Be confident and assume you’ll be admitted**

·  Don’t use footnotes

·  Write well but don’t overdo it with regard to syntax and stuff

·  **Try and have an interesting first line or paragraph** 

·  **A great way to open is to start with an epiphany – when you decided you wanted to pursue your current goals**

·  Avoid using words like ‘meaningful, challenging, beautiful, wonderful, invaluable, and rewarding’ say what you mean; either describe the event in question or report emotions and thoughts in more basic detail 

·  Address questions asked in the order they’re asked, be specific, and **provide details**

·  Quality over quantity. **Give rich descriptions and their meaning and don’t just list stuff off** 

·  Refer to other parts of the application when necessary (e.g. see LOR, see resume)

·  **Demonstrate that you’ve carefully researched the program and considered your reasons for applying ot this program (even value statements if they seem important)**

·  After you address specific points in the prompt you can weave in additional points as you’d like 

·  **Don’t just say you’ve always wanted to be an x; mention specific things that demonstrate your interest** 

·  Even if it’s not required, mentioning career plans (logical, clearly defined career plans) is a good look because it makes you seem mature

o  Though if you aren’t sure don’t fake it because it shows 

·  **If you’ve faced adversity in school or life it may be beneficial to let the admissions committee know**

·  **If you have grades that don’t represent your true potential you can explain them. But remember you want to keep your essay as positive as possible.** Keep justification short and simple – no whining. 

o  **Though if you bring it up its got to be resolved and in the past** 

·  Maybe mention how long ago the shitty grades were because they usually give less weight to grades that are 10+ years old

·  Examples of how to correct fucked up grades are @ loc 2128

o  “I would like to address the issue of my academic career. As you have my transcripts, you can clearly see that I was not especially serious in my frst few years as an undergrad, and you can see that I have improved dramatically. I have a 3.9 in grad school and expect to continue to do well”

·  **The way to see the essay is to make sense of the rest of the application**

·  If they don’t give guidance on essay length make it between 500 and 1000 words

·  Important points from admission officers

o  **When they just seem to be saying what they think we want to hear we can pick up on it right away**

o  I hate it when I can tell that they’re recycling material they wrote for other schools

o  **I don’t like essays on deep personal problems or excuses for past performance. The essay should be upbeat, convincing, and persuasive** 

·  First draft should be raw and candid but on the second draft you want to change it into academic language – the sort that a scholar would use to write to another scholar 

·  **When editing read each section of your essay and ask how the reader will respond but don’t over analyze** 

·  Avoid seeming arrogant. Instead of saying x must y say x would greatly benefit from y

·  Be careful not to reveal weaknesses and deficiencies like egocentricity 

·  I should not be the first word of your essay 

·  These essays are about content over style

·  No need to capitalize fields of study

·  Put full name at the top of each page and use a heading for all docs you’re submitting

o  Ex

§  ‘christopher davis

§  Applicant for doctoral program in education

§  University of mass

§  Fall 2009 incoming class 

·  Some people sign their essays, which the author thinks has a sincere and truthful feel 

·  Adding humor into essays tends to fall flat for most people, but if you can pull it off it helps

·  If there are specific professors you’re interested in at the school be sure to mention it

o  And its usually a good idea to identify several of them 

o  If you don’t have specific professors you’re into mention specific classes or areas of study you’re interested in 

o  If you’ve read their stuff mention it

·  Customize your essay at least at the beginning 

·  **“I have maintained a 4.0 gpa in my major and a 3.84 overall’**

o  **“always parse your grades in your major if they are high, and especially when they are this high”**

·  Mention major accomplishments in your essay even if they are mentioned in your resume

·  **Mention the locale and that you’d like living there but don’t harp on it**

·  “it’s okay to mention a past failure as long as youdon’t dwell on it, don’t whine or complain about it, and use it as a demarcation point for growth, achievements, and perseverance

·  **Always assume that readers only see your essay and not the other parts of your application** 

·  Be sure to answer the ‘why here’ question 

·  **“personal history, no matter how dramatic, is the spice, but the heart of the meal is the academics”**

·  Predicting your own success isn’t bragging, but confidence based on self knowledge 

LOR

·  Check with each recommendor to make sure they submitted it

·  Recommenders will get emails telling them to submit the letters; verify that they do

o  And confirm their preferred email address before using that one 

·  It’s better to have a letter from someone who knows your work than is just famous 

·  Schools say sometimes to not submit an extra LOR but you can disregard that

·  3 criteria for selecting LOR writers

o  Do they know you well enough to write about you in a detailed and persuasive manor

o  Will they say good things about you 

o  Are they reliable enough to write and post the LOR in a timely manor 

·  Schools typically prefer LORs from people like professors or employers that are familiar with work and study habits 

·  Specific LOR from a supervisor is better than someone high up in the organization that doesn’t know you well 

·  you should waive your rights to be able to view things in your education files

o  grad programs discount LORs if you don’t waive your rights to view your education files – some won’t even look at your LORs if you don’t waive your rights 

·  once you have been assured that the letter has been posted send a sincere thank you card to the author 

·  good letters address intellectual capacity, work habits, social skills, and academic preparation 

Interview

·  You’ll need to be articulate about ‘why this field and why this school’

·  Be prepared to ask intelligent questions about this program, faculty, research etc. 

·  Examples of good questions to ask

o  What are the programs strengths

o  What kind of students thrive in this program

o  Placement rates and types of jobs people get 

o  What makes this program different

o  What sort of candidates excel in this program

·  You wan to convey that your primary interest is to find a good program fit and not just to get into a good program

·  Questions you can expect

o  Have you read any good books lately 

o  Which people do you admire in this field

o  What can you tell me that’s not in your formal application materials

o  Why do you want to be in this field

o  What do you do with your leisure time

o  How do you study

o  Talk about a major failure in your life and how did you deal with it

o  What are your career plans and how does this program help you

o  What other programs are you applying to

o  What will you do if you don’t get in 

o  Why should we admit you over the other people applying 

o  What makes you different

·  Be well prepared then just be yourself and don’t be afraid to say I don’t know 

·  Show up a day or a few hours early and just get a feel for the campus

o  Show up to stuff exactly five minutes early 

o  Always have a pen and paper with you"
htpq8d,1,2020-07-18,Deciding Whether to Defer or Not to Defer From Graduate School,OerstedAllive,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/htpq8d/deciding_whether_to_defer_or_not_to_defer_from/,"I'm a 24 year old woman in the United States currently working from home full time as an underwriting assistant, my first full-time job out of college. I live with 2 elderly parents who are currently living off of their savings and are not assisting me with anything past housing and feeding me. My only ""debt"" is just on my braces. With my company's dental insurance, I paid 50% of the fee (I paid in full back in December) and the insurance is supposed to slowly pay out the other 50% for the next 2 years. I'm searching for a new job that will remain flexible to my grad school schedule (all classes take place in the middle of the workday) and let me work early mornings or late evenings.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months back, I got accepted into my preferred graduate school and program for a Masters in Artificial Intelligence. Unfortunately, I spoke with my company about it and they did not want to offer any job schedule flexibility, and have been asking me for a resignation day since then. They stripped me of some of my major job duties and started ignoring me during weekly meetings recently, so I am feeling a bit of hostility for not resigning like they want me to. I dislike my job duties as they are no longer engaging or meaningful, and my manager will not speak to me unless necessary anymore. Additionally, my salary was reduced by 3% beginning 2 months ago so I make slightly less than what I used to. This reduction will last for the next 10 months, so for the foreseeable future my salary is now about $43,600/year. In short, I don't know if I will be able to stand the newfound silence and pay reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

My current financial is not great, but it could be better. I have enough savings to last me for several months in paying bills, but apparently if I leave my company (whether I resign or get fired/terminated) I also lose my insurance benefits. My company's insurance has been paying for my braces (up to 50%), but leaving means I will have to bear the brunt to pay the rest of it (a hefty $2300 estimate, I already paid my half in full over 6 months ago). My tuition for this semester is higher than expected, but still possible to afford with federal direct unsub loans at a 4.30% rate (rates are on US Dept of Ed's website). The plan in this case was to lose my job, start school, ace classes, and then begin to apply for summer internships or part-time jobs. During the semester, I would supplement my income with sidegigs like tutoring on Wyzant. (My graduate program does not have any TA/grader/TF/RA positions this semester, but they are considering it for next semester. Hence, I cannot work at my school)

&amp;#x200B;

After doing some rough budget estimations, I see that if I were to be able to defer (and keep my job) until January 2021, I will be able to add another total $7000 to savings (even after subtracting living expenses such as gas, food, etc.). Should I leave my company then, I will only need to pay about $1800 on braces.  So far, this option looks very appealing from a financial perspective: should my situation change and I must attend in person, I will have the money to afford apartment rent and living expenses near my university. Despite this, I don't expect my company to keep me on board even if I push school back. They know I am not going to stay with them for much longer. They have gone as far as contacting my university to learn my schedule and obtain confirmation that my chosen classes have hours that conflict with the 8AM-5PM workday. I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to fire or terminate me AFTER I miss my chance to attend school for the Fall semester.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I recognize multiple factors that I cannot put a solid market value on and thus cannot evaluate my opportunity costs here:

* I have been looking forward to beginning my Masters program for most of this year.
* I want a good excuse to leave my job and work towards breaking into my desired career field.
* I want to earn more money in a job with more growth potential sooner than later.
* I want to network with my peers, as some of them work at FAANG companies.
* I'm afraid of falling behind and not getting to connect with people in the program.
* I want to avoid exposure to COVID and potentially bringing it home, should I stay at my job and be forced to work in person later on.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best decision I can make here that balances my mental health and finances? Is there another solution or scenario I am not considering?"

I've started applying to restaurants and retail stores, and every single one of them wants at least one year of retail or food service experience.

And please don't say internships, because very few of them pay and I couldn't get the ones that did, and I need to pay rent.

Everything about the current job market is frustrating, even before covid, as all my classmates now have jobs. I spend 7 hours a day job hunting.

I could learn any of the skills in the job postings once they hire me even if I don't know them right now and I can do any of these jobs, but they only want the cream of the crop these days, and anyone who didn't devote their life to their career the second they started college is at an extreme disadvantage in this world.

Why are employers so picky about hiring software developers when there is a shortage? How are new graduates supposed to get experience if we cannot get hired to obtain experience?"
htrhyz,0,2020-07-18,ReactJS/Front End - Self Taught and Stuck. Advice?,yogacoder1,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/htrhyz/reactjsfront_end_self_taught_and_stuck_advice/," Hello all! So I am looking for some advice or just any thoughts/feedback would be appreciated on the following:

I'm 23, and I have been trying to become a software engineer for a few months now (since Feb/March). My main focus is in front end - specializing in ReactJS (eventually I would want to become a full stack) but for now front-end is my focus.  
I have been trying to teach myself and learn and practice after my full time job and then usually use my free weekends to work on this as well. I have created some small apps and projects so far. I have a friend/mentor but I feel like it's lacking in a way, they kinda throw things at me but lack direction/guidance and what have you.

I've been using tools like Udemy courses/camps, YouTube, books, etc to help me learn and develop my skills. However, lately I just feel sort of stuck and frustrated with my growth or maybe lack of. I am 100 percent aware that this takes time and is challenging, that doesn't bother me. My concern or question is, has anyone who is self-taught experienced this and have any advice? What else can I be doing? Are there other resources to find mentors? I also still toggle with the idea of boot-camps and the promising job aspects (?), but again they are quite pricey and may not even be worth it. I've looked at internships but they all require you to be pursing a degree or in school etc so I wouldn't qualify for those. I was looking at Springboard bootcamp by Colt Steele as being one of the top options because of the way they have the payments and its better than an ISA I think but I still feel like it's not needed. 

Thanks so much!"

I'm currently a rising sophomore who's interested in applying both to swe and quant trading internships next summer.

I usually have work from 10-6 from my current internship and then I study for summer courses, so I really don't have much time left to prepare for interviews.

I'm trying to prep for interviews once I'm off, but I'm finding it hard to be able to have time to prepare for both leetcode and quant (I'm new to leetcode so I'm struggling to finish problems quickly atm so I don't have much time for quant.)

For anyone who's prepped for both fields, how did you approach it? Did you only focus on one first? Both? Any recommendations on which is more important?

I'm hoping to land a bigger internship than I have right now at a top tech or finance company, so anything is appreciated :) Given the choice, I would do quant over swe, but since I feel like quant has a much smaller, and higher hiring bar (and in some cases also has programming questions), I'm also preparing for swe internships as well, but it's really hard to manage."

How do I get though the work week?,everlastingSnow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/htsepk/im_burned_out_and_anxious_how_do_i_get_though_the/,"I'm a cashier at a grocery store right now. It was just supposed to be a temporary, part-time thing while I made the money I needed to join the regulatory body for my field and looked for an internship to get my career started. Needless to say, COVID-19 has changed everything. I used to work an average of 15-17 hours a week (I still live with my parents so it's all I needed) but now I'm getting a lot of 8-hour shifts and I'm finding the toll it takes on me to be too much. 

We don't get to sit except on our breaks so I'm standing for most of my shifts. My legs, back and feet have been killing me. I'm also having issues regulating my hunger, which is a huge issue as I've been getting headaches and dizziness when I get too hungry for the past several months. On top of that, my mental health is really suffering. We've had cases of COVID in our workplace (one of them led to me self-isolating for two weeks and, thank goodness, I didn't get it) and I've been uncomfortable in public ever since. All of our lanes are open again now and, even with the plexiglass, seeing all the people up at the front at the same time and having people constantly behind me is scary. I feel anxious just looking at *pictures* of crowds, let alone being in one. I can't walk past people without clenching my hands and rushing past. The other day, someone asked if someone got something at our store and I immediately assumed for a moment that someone else got COVID. It was horrifying. Fortunately, that wasn't the case but I was so scared it might have been. I probably wouldn't die from it myself (it's possible but a really low chance) but I have a family to worry about.

This week, I have almost 40-hours and I'm not sure how I'm going to get through it. I'm tired, burned out, anxious and I feel so stupid for feeling this way because I know other people are in worse situations. I'm going to have to work 40-hour weeks all the time for the rest of my life and, while they will hopefully be at a desk where I won't have to worry about pain and hunger, I know I need to get used to it. Does anyone have any advice on how to make it through the week?"

Until recently I thought of applying to medical school, but after my prolonged involvement in research, decided that go for PhD instead. I think I have pretty solid application, but also want to be realistic to where to apply. I am intrested in bioformatic/computational biology or bioengineering, not too sure as of yet. 

My stats: 3.7ish gpa 
1. 2+ years in at biochem lab part of bioinformaticsteam- had different projects, yield one first author pub, and two more in the making ( middle somewhere) hopefully will be out by the application.
2. 1.5 years - immunology lab 
3. Summer internship in Top 20 university. ( 3 month)
4. Did clinical research for a year ( again not sure if it counts for anything)

Did presentations, both regional and national ( I think 5 in total, but will be attending more before application)

Volunteers as Ta, and worked as a tutor for a year or so. Also participate as a teacher fellow for world science festival 

Have my own business

Have different volunteering hours ( not sure if I should even mention it , it was pre med crap)

I need to take the gre, afraid of taking it lol..

I am just trying to construct a responsible list, any feedback will be appreciated. I am not sure if big schools are worth applying to, by big I mean Harvard and MIT.

Does anyone have experience applying to these schools or any other top 10? And what you stat were like ( hope my gpa wont hold me down, and also not sure how much gre will go)"

The employer is having me do some tasks that is a little above my skill level. I have worked constantly for the last 3 weeks with no breaks and can't seem to work fast enough for their expectations. They expected me to start contributing to the repository by the 3rd day.

I have told them about this and how I have worked constantly, even on weekends to try and understand their code base and technology stack. I knew going into this it was going to be a demanding internship but I never expected with the amount of effort I have put in that its still not enough. I told them I didn't think I was qualified for the internship. Their reply is that ramp up is difficult and it's too early to quit and they want to see me work for several more weeks. 

Well it has been several more weeks, expectations are still too high. I have missed several deadlines already. I know they are unhappy I think they have insinuated they want me to quit by saying ""it's your choice"". I took a risk and left my previous job for this internship.

I kind of respect them too much to stay and be dead weight but now I don't think it is smart to quit in the current job market. If I am going to get fired, at least I can file for unemployment.

Could you guys give me some advice?"

The job market right now is super tough as I only see senior positions on job postings.  I do have one offer to be a Software Consultant and I'm scared I'm going to be pigeon holed into consulting as my only experience will be consulting.  The job uses JavaScript primarily. I'm financially independent from my family and I don't know how much longer I can be without a job. My plan is to just take whatever experience as a Software Consultant and work on leetcode + side projects on the side and apply for developer roles when the job market reopens.  Is this the sound way to do things?
htu02k,3,2020-07-18,Dealing with Comments from Others,Scared_Ad_1626,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/htu02k/dealing_with_comments_from_others/,"I am currently dealing with a lot of self judgment with my adhd diagnoses, and my thought process of how to handle this situation reflects that. I know logically I shouldn’t have to defend myself to strangers and feel bad about anything relating to getting help. Despite this I’m still dealing with guilt for not being where I think I should be.

I am a 22 year old who just now got diagnosed with adhd. I had a dentist appointment for the first time in a long time due to covid and was very nervous. I had always struggled with self care and finding the motivation to put effort into myself. I hadn’t been to this office in a while, so they needed me to update my information. The only difference I had to put down was that I am taking Vyvanse. I would have preferred not to, but if in the future I needed any work done, I would like them to look out for any worrisome drug interactions if present.

The woman doing my cleaning began looking through my files and asked me what it was for. I told her mental health because I felt embarrassed being asked. She then asked for what and I said adhd because I hate confrontation and couldn’t say “I don’t feel comfortable saying”. She then started asking me who said I needed adhd medication and if I had been tested and why I needed the medication. This was all done in a sweet tone though. I didn’t feel particularly judged yet. I answered honestly that I wanted to get help for it and I did get tested and I have seen improvements and I’m keeping my eye out for side effects and blah blah blah and she seemed pleased with my answers, so I assumed she just didn’t know about adhd and was curious. 

She then told me that I shouldn’t say it was for mental health though, because people will assume the worst and that she was letting me know for my sake. ah that’s good and gave me a look. I felt so embarrassed because I thought When she told me that others would assume the worse she meant people would needlessly worry that I have something more severe. I think this interpretation just came from self judgment and makes me pretty embarrassed about how much my personal issues can affect how I interpret others, especially given how the conversation started.

For some reason I felt so... guilty? I thought it was because I thought by bringing up my anxiety that she would know that I know that I don’t take it lightly or However, I think she actually meant that people would assume that I’m “crazy” or “psycho”. I became really embarrassed about over sharing about how I had anxiety, even though she was the one who started prying.I feel weird for talking about myself too much and ask her how she’s been doing. She then tells me when she’s stressed out she drinks a cup of warm tea and recommended that. 

Please note that this is a dentist cleaning so this is over a long period of time so there’s a lot of quiet time for me to feel awkward about how I’m butchering this conversation and overthink about what she’s thinking. Even with the long pauses, I can tell I'm word vomiting. However, after years of dealing with anxiety, I’m all too familiar with people who judge those who choose medication. Tea is good though, can’t lie.

The dentist comes in to look at my X-ray. He takes a lot and let’s me know he didn’t see any cavities. I was like... Really??? Are you sure??? Every time I went to the dentist I was ready for bad news. Talking about self care before being medicated is a story on it’s own, but I felt like I was finally seeing the results of my efforts. Medication isn’t a fix all, but I felt like the discipline I knew I had was really making an effect. The dentist also brought up that my mother mentioned I had an internship now and congratulated me.Then the dentist in said something along the lines of haha it’s good because you already have so many. I noticed he also had a strong accent though, and I know from personal experience that it’s hard to make jokes or tease in another language.Even though I know this, 

I still felt all my sense of accomplishment flake off. Why should I be proud of brushing my teeth? I’m 22. Why do I need a medal for flossing?? It’s what I’m supposed to be doing. There’s nothing impressive about it. There’s nothing impressive about folding my clothes either. Nothing amazing about doing the dishes. Good students don’t wait until the last minute to get things done. Good friends don’t forget about arrangements. Good people don’t freak out when they receive constructive criticism.The truth is I do feel really guilty that I have to take medication that might cause me heart issues or put me at risk for addiction just to do the basics. I really feel like I shouldn’t. I know I’ll grow out of this though, just like I did with my anxiety medication. 

My struggles with anxiety and adhd are both hard in different ways. I definitely needed to manage my ocd before I could work on anything else, but I don’t think that necessarily means it was harder. That’s another conversation though and I think this post might be long enough.

TLDR: he said she said he said she ;;I will probably edit this a bunch later because I am on mobile and unintentional autocorrects always escape me. Also for the general struggles of trying to convey what you mean using words RIP.

Questions: 

!!!I’m a bit worried that since my mother is friendly with the people who work here (The dentist asked how my internship was going &gt;&gt;) that they might tell her I’m on new medication or something. I am still under her insurance. Can she see my listed medications? Are there any laws protecting me from this??

How do you deal with small comments? I know if they knew the whole story they’d understand, just how’d I understand why people who don’t have chronic mental health issues don’t need to know a lot about medication. It’s so easy to know things logically, but I’ve become so sensitive to criticism. I make five times as mistakes as the average person so I get reprimanded five times as much haha.

I have 4 module exemptions granted to me (CP3200(6), CS1010(4), CS2101(4), IS1103(4)). I don't think i'll exempt myself from CP3200 which is an internship module.

I read that the poly Advanced Placement Credits are a total of 40 MCs: 20 for Unrestricted Elective Modules and another 20 for specific modules under programme requirements. So with the 3 modules - CS1010, CS2101, IS1103; that adds up to 12 MCs. Im not to sure how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

From this, [CS Poly Exemptions](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/exemptions/polygrad/)

&gt;Polytechnic graduates who are admitted to NUS Computing Courses may receive up to 40 modular credits (MCs) of module exemptions from the following lists:  
&gt;  
&gt;Up to **20** MCs from Unrestricted Elective Modules (UEM)\*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Specific exemptions of up to 20 MCs from programme requirements comprising of one or more modules as determined by the School on a case-by-case basis. Details are indicated in the tables below:

&amp;#x200B;

So if i don't hit the 20 MCs for programme requirements, **will i still get the 32 MCs for SU?** Ive heard/read somewhere that i would get lesser credits to be fair.

May i ask how does the 20 MCs for UEM work? The only clear cut part here is the module exemptions that i am granted. An example would be greatly appreciated!

As a poly graduate, just to confirm I do still have to take the 5 pillars to satisfy the ULR right? And only 2 of the 5 pillars, GEQ and GER, are preallocated?

Also, i'm quite lost in planning for mods in the first semester. I am required to take MA1301 as i didnt take H2 math. It resulted in not being able to take most Level 1000 modules in semester 1 as most have prereq of MA1301. So far i've only planned to take MA1301, CS2100 (just checked this doesnt have any prereq, i may consider taking!) and CS2030S. Heard seniors usually take CS2030S and CS2040S together but am unable to take CS2040S as i dont have its prereq, CS1231S. Not sure how i should go about planning my 1st semester...

I intend to take a minor in future sems too.. but i have submitted my declaration plan. as i read that we can declare it at the later stages? and the focus area can be declared later too?

I was contacted by this company that works on projects in the nuclear industry through a connection with my bootcamp.

I live in Canada and they want to pay me 62k (that's really generous right now as entry level in canada) for an internship... but theres quite a few red flags.

1) They put my start date as July 27th, and I have to decide by July 24th. I'm still in the process of interviewing with other places and would prefer to have multiple standing offers if possible. How do I go about trying to push this date back, what do I say, how long can I realistically get them to wait, etc?

2) The role is ""Innovation Catalyst"". Everyone at this startup is called that and they all work on projects together in the nuclear industry. I'm a little concerned because it's not 100% clear on what I will be doing and it's kind of a buzzword position title. Clearly coding is involved, but it's unclear how much or what technologies I would be using (I think it would vary depending on project). I know I will have to also deal with clients and I'm not sure if that's something I want to do. 

3) Some other red flags like ""minimum 40 hours a week"" and ""unlimited vacation time"" and ""work hard play hard"" that potentially suggests a culture of overworking

4) I only had one longer interview with 4 people on the team. I presented some of my projects to them and they asked me some questions. It went really well and they were impressed. But I expected more steps and I find it strange they would give me the job after 1 interview. I had no real technical challenge, though they did ask me some technical questions.

At the end of the day though that's over $62k for a starting role getting experience, and it's an internship so I don't have to stay if I don't like it. I'm just a little worried about not getting as much coding experience as I need to land the next role.

Maybe I'm overthinking it and this is still a great opportunity. Part of me wants to wait for more offers and negotiate higher salary if I can. I'm just.... not particularly thrilled about the opportunity because its extremely vague, despite the excellent internship pay (which maybe also suggests even better pay after the 3 months).

What do you think? 

Thanks for the advice!"

So I (23f) have always been kinda depressed and filled with anxiety. For long as I can remember I've always felt huge waves of sadness and I was never able to keep any hobbies because I couldn't be in the moment. 
I can't do anything in the long-term and that's for when I'm able to try. 
I wanna try out so many things and most of the times I can't,I'm frozen on the sport and I end up just idly watching shows.
Lockdown was especially hard. I ended up in a very very dark place for more than a month. I'm used to feeling sad, and lowkey wanting to end it all with peaks of suicidal thoughts but that time it kind of was one time too many.
I hot really scared and decided to turn my life around.
I kinda did and it was cool for awhile. I stopped smoking, started exercising, watched my diet, found the internship I was looking for since November, my friends and my husband all complimented me on how great I was doing and how at peace I looked.
But for the last too weeks everything is getting harder and harder. 
When I wanna pursue a hobby, I freeze and feel about myself. When I want to exercice, I feel self-conscious and don't. I, then, bury my guilt with food and weed.
I feel like all my energy goes to being able to attend my internship, I'm fighting against myself so not to ghost my employer. I haven't missed a day yet, but I feel it coming. And on the other hand, I do nothing else except going there. When I come home, I just collapse, I wanna do stuff but I literally can't. move.
And I've just spent my weekend doing nothing. I feel bad because I have schoolwork to do, I wanna experience more with arts, see friends, have fun. But I can't.
Right now everybody in my house is out, and I'm just here crying because I feel like I never will be able to be a normal, functioning human.
I don't know what to do.
I've tried therapy multiple times, I know it's supposed to help, but it's done nothing for me. Maybe I don't go to the right professionals? Idk I'm just so lost...

Thank you to everyone who'll read this, idk what kind of advice I'm expecting, I just needed to do something that feels like I'm still trying..."

**Letters of Recommendation**

2 Professors, I met with them regularly and were really wonderful motivating people. They likely gave glowing reviews.

**Interviews**

Fantastic Swarthmore interview.

**Essays**

My first essay explained my GPA. Being in the completely wrong field and being in over my head. I came back and explained what I did to correct and solve the problem and that's what matters. I wrote generic essays for everywhere except Cornell, where I said why I must be at Cornell and nowhere else. It is a sense of urgency and natural that I take the next step to attend the leader in social science research.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Cornell; Attending
* University of Michigan AA
* University of Toronto Honors

*Waitlists:*

* None

*Rejections:*

* Swarthmore College
* University of Notre Dame

**Reflection**

I really thought my academic and law aspirations were crushed after I got my 2 fails in freshman 1st semester. I continued that trend with 5 Cs that year. I clawed my way back to go where I have always wanted to go. I desperately searched everywhere to see if someone like me had made it to Cornell and I never found anyone. I tried my absolute hardest and put everything into those Cornell essays. I had wanted to attend Cornell since I was 14 and it is crazy that I am here. Please never stop working on yourself, your study habits, and your goals. Also find yourself a community, I found a discord with a bunch of transfer students and it made the process less lonely - because transferring is hard, it's really hard, so do not be alone.

Edit: Also I am not broke because of this if anyone is considering not applying because of price tags! I chose Cornell also because I knew if I got in I was going to get good financial aid, and I did with $50k per year institutional grant."
hu14kk,3,2020-07-19,Importance of Math/Sci Competitions and Teacher Recs in College Admissions,Nan0w0,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hu14kk/importance_of_mathsci_competitions_and_teacher/,"Let's say I'm a generic optimistic senior whose looking into majoring in math/sci. 

I'm applying to a competitive school (acceptance &lt; 10%). I have sufficient grades and SAT scores to get accepted, and I have plenty of time to write and polish off college essays. 

However, my ECs are average: a part time job, and casually being part of our math and science teams. I haven't started any clubs or had any internships (tiny town, no public transport, too young to drive) anything like that. I have done online courses and self-studied math. 

But kids in my area seriously compete (i.e. only competition prep, summer camps, etc.) in math/sci competitions and do well nationally... (me-specific)

Am I completely screwed if I never seriously participated in competitions?

My class participation isn't stellar-- I do the bare minimum to get by in classes I'm not interested in (and let's say that applied to most of my junior year classes). I also haven't really talked to any of my teachers about what I'm doing outside of school, or about what I'm interested in. 

(I know I could just tell them about what I do outside of school, but I don't think the math/sci teachers will believe me... &lt;-- me-specific)

If the rest of the application is solid, is not seriously participating in a math/sci competition and having meh rec letters enough to get you rejected from a competitive school? (Especially if you're not URM)

&amp;#x200B;

(I know this is kind of specific (some of the scenarios are tailored to my circumstances), but I feel that (at least in my school and in my area) there's too much of a hype around math/sci competitions for the kids who like math/sci, and I want to know if it's really true that doing well in math/sci competitions is 'better-looking' than just learning math/sci by yourself)

&amp;#x200B;

(One last thing, this is my first post in this forum, and I think this could fit into multiple topics -- EC, Rec Letters, Rant. I don't know if I have the correct flair, should I just split up the post into multiple little ones?)"

I graduated 3 years ago with a mechanical engineering(ME) degree with decent grades, involvement but no internship. Throughout this whole time I have been unable to land an engineering job but have landed other technical jobs that never panned out to full engineering jobs for various reasons. I have kept applying, contacted some people in the field and even had my resume professionally written and optimized. Unfortunately, due to the job market along with several other factor (i.e. experience) have been unable to land a job.

Additionally, over the last year I have realized what I truly wanted to do would be more in the electrical engineering(EE)/computer science(CS) vein with robotics, aviation or, well, computers. I realize aviation is more of a mechanical but still would get more out of it with EE seeing how the world is moving more and more into electrical needs. I was reading several articles regarding job growth and opportunities where they all stated EE and CS as two of the biggest growing careers over the next few decades, the pay isn't to shabby either.

Now, I am unsure as to what I should do and would like some guidance or advice if anyone has some. I would like to go back to school but am unsure if I should return for a Masters in ME or a Bachlors in EE or CS. They both have their reason for doing them, a master would give me a higher education with more competitive edge but the bachelor would give me a degree in something that is projected to grow at an exponential rate with less competition.

Thoughts?

I appreciate any and all help or advice. Thank You!"

I currently work full time for a large telecom company, and they won’t allow employees to do internships, but was told I may be able to be a part of a project as a way to incorporate experience/project. 
Regardless, is it feasible to have an internship while working full time at a regular job? How do you fit this into your schedule if so? I plan to attend school part time, but using summer semester also to complete degree faster - completing associates BY next fall, and pursuing bachelors hopefully fall 2021.. so that would even lessen my available time."

This is quite a long story, so it would be highly appreciated if anyone can read through this and give me any advice. I'd especially appreciate it if an engineering graduate student can help me on this. 

The past year as an undergraduate senior, I just wanted to try preparing for graduate school admissions for the year after. I wouldn't say I had that good of an idea of applying to engineering graduate schools. I did so by just applying to a select number of schools. I was going to see how the result would turn out but hold off on accepting admission and use that to prepare my graduate applications for the following year. Personally, I for sure want to finish at least a Master's and I know for myself I want to attend engineering graduate school. But, after hearing a few details about a PhD, I felt like it was possible for me to want to finish a PhD, as I had some interest in the research-oriented style. While applying, I thought I was ""qualified"" enough for a PhD application because I met the average admissions GPA, average admissions GRE score, and had three good enough recommendation letters. I have also presented at an undergraduate research conference. I thought that because I was way over the Master's average statistics, I should just apply directly for a PhD. I wanted to avoid the possibility of applying for only a Master's and consequently paying for the tuition and going through the graduate school application process all over. Currently, I honestly think I was naive at that time because I've seen a lot of qualified engineering undergraduate students going for a Master's instead of right for a PhD. After time has passed hearing a lot of other stories, I've heard that a lot of PhD candidates have a very serious and concise sense of applying, whether that be through several fantastic engineering internships/research experience/work experience/Master's program.

Earlier last January, I surprisingly got accepted to two PhD programs. But, due to COVID-19 circumstances, my past spring quarter grades has been impacted and my summer research program has been cancelled. Because of this, I felt that applying to another graduate school program the following year would get me worse results. In case of the worst possibility that I do not get into a graduate program the following year, I decided to accept admission to one of the programs **(Texas A&amp;M Chemical Engineering PhD)**. During this kind of time, I am indeed very thankful to have gotten this opportunity. I am most likely going to defer the start date for one year.

To be completely honest, overall, I feel underqualified as an engineering PhD candidate. I feel that my acceptance was just by luck. I do have research fields/experience that I am interested in and I do have a passion for my major. However, I still don't think I have a clear insight of a PhD unlike others. I don't think I have as good of research, extracurricular, and internship experiences as a lot of other candidates. In fact, I have no internship experience, club leadership experience, engineering competition experience, and independent research project/published paper experience. I have not won any top research awards. I understand that I need to be committed to a lot of work as a PhD student, but now I am confused about whether it is actually for me. I am worried that the incoming PhD work the next few years may be too much for me to handle and may be seriously detrimental to my mental well-being. Additionally, I've heard a lot that if I quit PhD midway and finish only with a Master's, this can be a bad impression for my job application as that I did not fully follow through my commitment. How true is this for the engineering field? If I try to find work now, I have a low chance of being accepted due to no internship experience and current COVID-19 situations. I don't have any idea about my career path yet and I don't feel hopeful about finding an engineering job in the near future. In other words, I'm having trouble finding a good idea about what I want to do for my current life.

Any advice about my current situation would be highly appreciated. Thank you all very much!"

I graduated months back and have been struggling to find a job in the industry. I guess I am fucked for a while. So here's one of the I advise to do before your senior year:

* **Get an internship**

If that means having to make self-projects on your free time, and grinding Leetcode, then that's worth taking your time doing all of that and not ending up in the situation that I am in right now.

* **Take ECS36B/ECS 36C (Formerly ECS 40/60) seriously.**

These are probably two of the most important classes in the intro sequences, and I regrettably took 2 shitty professors. I barely made my way through these classes and lack some essential practices in my skillset as a result. 36C is especially important as data structures will be asked in the majority of coding interviews in the West Coast.

* **Upload your Leetcode solutions to Github**

Obviously, don't upload some garbage code that runs at O(n^4) or anything like that, but if you want to impress future employers, definitely do that. I mentioned self-projects earlier, but your ability to implement data structures is much more important.

* **Learn HTML/CSS/Javascript**

I can't emphasize this enough. A good chunk of wed development positions for software development these days requirement knowledge of these. Davis is a heavily theoretical school for CS, and graduating with only a knowledge of C++/C (which is what most professors use) is going to hurt in the long run as there are barely any entry level positions for C++/C. Knowing only just Python on the side isn't good enough.

Just please, don't be like me. I am currently struggling like no tomorrow finding a position right now."

Enibal stood in the recreation room of his Embassy and tried to display patience. He’d wanted to go out and properly meet the Duke at the spaceport, but that couldn’t be done. Not when the man wasn’t supposed to officially arrive yet.

He grabbed a drink off the table and moved to a cluster of his staff. They made room for him and one asked, “Is he really coming in on a commercial freighter?”

Enibal nodded to her, “Remember, Duke Kazlor Feldarin is not officially here yet. His personal ship is sitting in The Dark outside the system; he’s coming in with the rest of his body guards and personal retainers, but wants it kept quiet for now. Officially he is just one of the executives of Allincor, here to negotiate trade deals, protection deals, and tariff concessions with Humans, Arabso, Findil, and maybe a few others.

“That story is helpful since it is true: He sits on the board of that company, and regularly takes part in negotiations for them.”

“I thought the Royals didn’t involve themselves directly in companies?”

“They do when they found the company themselves. Allincor is a conglomerate the Duke started because he wanted certain charities to exist. He then used it to start production on certain goods that he didn’t like us being dependent on outsiders for, and then to start a mercenary company to protect the other two.”

A new voice chimed in from behind him, “Well, that’s the official story. The truth is that I had some… fundamental differences of opinion with Her Royal Majesties’ High Command about priorities of protection, and had to choose between pulling out the ‘Royal’ card or leaving.”

Enibal managed not to spew champagne through his nostrils nor spill his drink, and even kept both feet on the ground. *How did he get in here so quietly? Wait… the way he said ‘Her Royal Majesty’s’…. he and Henry are going to get on well. Maybe a little too well. Oh, my Queen… what have you done?*

He painted his best smile on his face and turned to find… someone’s shoulder? He took a slight step back and craned his neck to look up into the face he’d seen on vids and pics. The man gave him a conspiratorial wink and then continued. “It took a little time, and I had to convince the Queen to give me dispensation, but Allincor has been a boon to the Empire in a number of ways.

“I am not involved in the day-to-day operation of the company nor its subsidiaries, of course, but I do keep regular tabs on its activities: Sometimes preventing the execs from trying to skirt The Queen’s Law feels like a full time job in and of itself. ”

Duke Feldarin smiled ruefully and shook his head, “But, I have entirely forgotten my manners, please all of you forgive me. I can see by your expressions that you recognize me, now, let me have a look at all of you and see how I do, hm?

“Let’s see, you must be Jokal, the deep blue of your skin tone gives it away: I know you are the only Southern Reaches person here. And, you’d be Garrund, correct?” The Duke gave the man a quick wink, “I saw you hiding your hand so I couldn’t see the scars, so you have figured out that I’ve read your files. Now the game gets fun.

“Then you two lovely ladies have to be the twins, Lilina and Onor. Wait, wait, don’t tell me… You, you are Lilina. Oh, no you don’t, I’m right and you both know it, I saw the look of surprise. And, no, it wasn’t a lucky guess.”

One of the two women who flanked the Duke elbowed him in the ribs hard enough that Enbial *heard* it. He just laughed and continued, “Ok, it was mostly not a lucky guess. Oh, you want to know how?” He winked again and wiggled his eyebrows,” State secret, I won’t tell.

“I’m guessing you’re Kondat, the chief accountant? Good to meet you. My accountants went through the books for this place as a matter of course, and were impressed. That is high praise, by the way, they rarely find most of their peer’s work so much as acceptable.

Enibal watched each face light up as he worked through their little group. *Yes, he and Henry are going to get on far too well. Or kill eachother, but I expect the former.* The Duke then gave him a glance and flashed another of those conspiratorial winks, then turned to one of the interns who had stopped outside the circle to listen.

“And, of course, last and most, you must be the Ambassador, Enibal, I have heard so much about!” The Duke extended his hand to the youth, who stood there completely pole-axed, eyes wide, and shaking in his boots. Kazlor reached out to grab the youngster’s hand and shook it vigorously, “I have to say I’m very pleased to meet you! Hey, I heard you are a fair hand with a practice sword, right? How about we spar a couple of rounds?”

The poor lad was now visibly shaking, his eyes darting around for an out. The Duke put an arm around the young man’s shoulders and made to move off with him, but the other woman who had been flanking him spoke up, her tones those of mock exasperation, “Oh, come off of it Kazlor. This kid is obviously not going to find his tongue, and if you push him any farther he may faint on you!”

Enibal suppressed a smile as the woman gently took the bewildered young man by the arm, whispered something into his ear, pointed him towards the food, and sent him off with a slight bit of pressure on his back. He turned away from the intern to find that the living mountain of the Duke standing next to him with his hand out.

He took the offered hand and shook it, while the Duke beamed a smile at him. “Ambassador Enibal Pensar, it is a pleasure to finally meet the man I keep hearing about. I have to say that I am impressed with your work here. Now, about that sword practice…”

Enibal felt a surge of ice run from his neck to his toes, and his eyes went wide. The Duke got an amused look in his eye, and he brought himself under control. *Oh, you think that’s funny do you? I can give as good as I can get!* He gave the man his best eyeroll and spoke in his best mock-humility tone of voice. “I am afraid that I have no skill with the blade, or any other weapon really, as his Grace well knows. However, if His Grace is so weak in his self opinion or assessment of his skills that His Grace wishes to trounce a defenseless Ambassador with a stick – despite praising that ambassador’s efforts – it would be my duty to oblige.”

He hung his head slightly in a mock-bow and spread his hands a little away from his sides. Micro-expressions of shock and amusement flashed across the Duke’s face while the three women with him giggled. *Wait, three? Where did the third one…? Oh, she is a quiet one, I see.*

The Duke tried to look severely at him over the insult, but third woman slid in beside the Duke, slid her hand into the crook of his elbow, and spoke in amused tones, “I do think he got the better of you on that one, dear.”

The woman who had elbowed the Duke put a hand on his shoulder, leaned in, looked up at him with an affectionate smile, and spoke. “And, you have no one but yourself to blame.”

The third woman giggled and gave the Duke a peck on the cheek, “Too true, Sis did warn you, after all!”

Kazlor rolled his eyes in exaggerated exasperation, then threw his head back and bellowed a laugh while he put his arms around the two women at his sides. Enibal felt himself smile at the man, partly in bewilderment at his behavior, and partly at that of the women. The Duke leveled an amused gaze at him then spoke. “Touché, Enibal! Well played! You may profess to be disarmed, but I am happy to see your rapier wit is as sharp coming off your tongue as it is off the tip of the pen. Verbal sparring is another fun game to play, and I get the feeling we are going to have plenty of opportunities to spar together in the coming months.

“But, my manners seem to have escaped me in the excitement!” He extricated himself from the two women’s hold, then turned toward the one who had elbowed him. Enibal tried to get his mind to catch up with events and finally took a look at the woman. She was stunningly beautiful, from the blue sheen of her skin to her large, expressive eyes. He looked at the other two, and saw that they were a match for her, even the shorter one who seemed a little shy and wore glasses. *Glasses? In this day and age? What has she got that they can’t correct?*

The Duke spoke. “These three women, aside from being the most beautiful women in all the Empire,” All three women giggled, rolled their eyes, and gave him a sharp look as if they disapproved of his statement…but had the faintest hint of a blush and a smile pulling at the corners of their lips as the Duke continued, “are my three wives. This,” He held out the hand of the shorter woman first, “is Lady Yoro Sela-Feldarin, the most intelligent woman in the kingdom.”

Enibal shook the offered hand and looked the woman in the eye. Once he saw past her glasses and the slightly dressed-down attire she’d chosen, he could see the beauty her husband had described. She smiled slightly to him and he felt like he could see the deep intellect hiding behind those deep eyes. He brought himself back to the present and, for a moment, he feared he’d offend the Duke, but the man just smiled in approval and continued, “And this is Lady Irnor Kendo-Feldarin, who can cook better than any Master Chef and tends to be prime mother to our brood of children.”

Enibal moved to take her hand, but she held it out palm down instead of sideways. He tried to grasp it for a shake anyway, but she moved her hand so that he had her fingers, then so that it was nearly in front of his face. She made another move and he made the mistake of looking her in the eyes. Her eyes were a deep orange, which set off the blue of her skin perfectly. They danced with amusement and seemed to dare him both to back away, and kiss her hand.

*In for a drop, in for the river.* He lowered their hands so that he could bow properly over it, kept his eyes locked on hers, put his best salty look into them, grinned slightly, and brushed his lips to the back of her hand. She gave a soft chuckle and wiggled her eyebrows at him, then turned to The Duke, “I think I like this one, dear. Can we keep him?”

Enibal snapped back to himself and realized how he’d just flirted with the wife of a Royal. He straightened quickly and looked at the Duke to find an already-familiar look of amusement on his face as he answered his wife, “Now, now, I think my sister might have something to say if you spirited off her prized ambassador, my darling!”

Enibal took an involuntary step back. Polygamous marriages were more common than not in the Empire, and not all of them were exclusive. Getting tangled in one could cause complications, however, particularly with the wife of a noble. *Gorta spit! What do I do now?*

hu9v9n,4,2020-07-19,TIFU by pointing a knife at the reception guy at my accomodation,tifuthrowawayknife,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hu9v9n/tifu_by_pointing_a_knife_at_the_reception_guy_at/,"(Context) Due to COVID I've been stuck in my student accomodation alone for the passed few months. The particular accomodation I'm in does nightly checks around midnight where the reception staff does a walk through of all the hallways/communal flat spaces (relevant later). I'm moving out soon and with the combination of the stresses of social isolation, packing up my things, revising for my upcoming exams and completing a remote internship I have been falling short on sleep and have missed some meals here and there. I have been driven absolutely stir crazy. I don't have a good support system and having been managing by myself the best I can.

&amp;#x200B;

My kitchen is comparitvely a lot larger than my room so I've been storing boxes of my things in the kitchen as I've been organising myself bit by bit this weekend. Tonight after sitting down to eat dinner in my room, my first proper meal of the day at 11pm, I was about to go and get a knife from the kitchen, in my sleep deprived state I'd only brought a fork with me into my room. Just as I was about to open my room door to go and grab one, I heard the main flat door open and overheard some unfamiliar male voices (for context I'm a girl and am staying in a girl only flat). I was curious who this could be and as I needed to get a knife anyway, I thought this was a good excuse to go check. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went out and saw that it was the guy usually on night shift along with someone else who I thought at the time was a locked out resident being shown back to his room. The night shift guy had turned the lights on in the kitchen and was looking at my boxes of stuff and was on the phone. I went in and grabbed my knife and went up to the night shift guy and waited until his phonecall was done. I asked ""Is there a problem"" and he said something along the lines of ""do you know who owns this stuff"", pointing to my boxes, and I replied ""Yes, it's mine"". Then the night shift guy and the other guy left. I went back to my room to make a dent in dinner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt weird about the whole encounter and thought about how when I was talking to the night shift guy I was actually holding up the knife the whole time. I must have completely freaked him and the other guy out, I felt freaked out myself just trying to process what had just happened. I couldn't eat with the thought of this playing on my mind. I went downstairs to the reception to go and look for him to apologise for the weirdness. He wasn't at the reception desk so I left him a written note apologising for the knife and explaining why my stuff was in the kitchen. On my way back to my flat I ended up running in to him just as he was coming back, I had the chance to apologise in person. It went a something like ""sorry about the knife, it was a bit aggressive, I was about to eat"" understandably he seemed a bit freaked out, told me not to do that again and all I could muster was ""yeah idk"". I am so frustrated at myself for not apologising further and making the whole situation weird. To make matters worse the guy I thought was the locked out resident was still with him. It was now clear to me, he wasn't a locked out resident. He was obviously a new hire and the night shift guy was training him up, that's why they had stopped in my kitchen to have a chat. I'd just freaked them both out for no good reason! I am absolutely kicking myself for being so weird and freaking out some guys just doing their job and taking a long hard moment of self reflection.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Held up knife in a threatening manner to night shift guy and new hire being shown around. Lesson learnt, get a good nights sleep and avoid weird behaviour.

&amp;#x200B;

ps. I completely understand how I freaked him out and it's my own fault for being weird and coming across as threatening. I don't hold knives often and I didn't give a second thought to how I was holding it when I was talking with the guy, my mind was on my dinner and also whether I needed to move my boxes out of the kitchen. Stress does weird things to the brain. I am feeling completely apologetic, would I make it weirder if I went back down to reception and explained myself a bit more to the guy?"
hua2ze,10,2020-07-19,"First Internship, Messed It Up",might_be_a_donut,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/hua2ze/first_internship_messed_it_up/,"Hi, 

I got an internship offer before Covid hit my area. They said they would offer a remote one to me still, and I jumped on it. I was so hyped. However, as Covid and school went on, I had more and more trouble getting motivation to move and eat let alone do work. I managed to finish up the semester with good grades. 

Unfortunately, my internship went into the summer. I kept getting more nervous and emotional. I was told my initial work was good, but then what I was writing wasn't up to scratch. I tried more research and asking for feedback. I could not figure out the issue. It got so bad I avoided the computer to avoid work and just didn't get up for more than one meal a day for a couple of days. It sent my nerves to raw especially since I was only talking to a couple family members each week over the phone and my roommate was the only one who saw me in person. 

Later, in one of the final meetings, I found out that the person communicating with me had meant something else during our meetings. Like I was writing a guide while they wanted what someone should do with it. Similar topic, but completely different style. I was done. Just done after I found out. I wrote some decent work so they didn't pay for nothing and just let them let me go. I didn't fight to prove anything. Now, I'm not sure what might happen because of that. I was not able to do much past that at that point, but I also don't want to be known for bad work. 

It wasn't the field I am aiming for, but it was also my first real work. I just don't know what might happen because of this. I have never felt so dead emotionally, and I am doing ok now. However, at that point I was just gone. It doesn't justify giving up after a couple months of bad communication, but I just felt so relieved afterwards. I am going into my senior year, and I guess I am just hoping for a perspective on if this will affect me when I graduate."

I've been told that I could get a graduate certificate and be set to look for entry work. 

I'm debating on two different colleges and here is why. I just moved to Raleigh this year. I won't get instate tuition in time for next spring so the earliest I could start with instate tuition is next fall. FYI, it would be at NCSU. I could just cough up the money, but the difference more then double.

The other option I am considering is ASU. My brother got his BS online from them and had a good experience. Instate and out of state is the same cost. Plus they do 8 week classes which actually fits me and the program better. If I started this fall I could be done by the end of next year.

ASU wins out on time and money. 

However, I have a concern. I'm guessing NCSU would get me better local connections. What about possible internships? 

I'm concerned I'll finish the program but have a hard time finding anything. 

Not sure if anyone has any advice on this.

I'd just hate to wait."

I'm currently studying Mechatronics Engineering and plan to graduate spring of 2023. My girlfriend is pursuing her CPA. We want to get out of the US and see what's out there. I feel like the best time to do something like this would be immediately after college because I wont have any kids or have grown any roots. I also think that I would eventually plan on moving back to the states after 3-5 years of being abroad to settle down and live my best dad lifestyle.

I've done a little research into some of the countries and I'm thinking Germany would be a really good fit for me and my career. It seems to have a lot of industry, especially regarding industrial automation. It's also clean, safe, wealthy, and progressive. However, I'm wonder if you could offer up other countries you think would be a good fit for me as well as general working abroad tips, etc.?

Skills 23M - Robot Programming, Coding, PLC Programming, Control Panel Design, Automation Integration and Design, milling, lathing, framing and general construction work. I'm 20 now, but am not planning on moving to Europe for another three years. Currently I have one automation engineering internship under my belt, by the time I graduate I should have two more internships (A different one every summer).

Skills 23F - I'm writing this for my girlfriend, but she is going to be a CPA. She is also going to have worked internships by the time she is done with college.

My preferred country will have:

1. Great Career opportunities
2. Ability to make enough money to save and invest substantially early on. Think FIRE (Financially Independent Retire Early)
3. Easy and cheap public transportation throughout the country and to other parts of Europe. I really don't want to buy a car over there or ship my car there.
4. I currently only speak English and I wouldn't like that to be a large barrier. I am okay with starting to learn a new language now to help with the future move to Europe.
5. Safe
6. Good recreation opportunities, mountain biking specifically!!!!
7. I grew up in North Dakota so I'm not afraid of a cold climate.

Thanks."

 How does one prepare for recruiting for SWE roles?

  
 What is the timeline for recruiting for these positions? 

  
 Since I feel like I won't have enough knowledge until junior year to recruit for tech internships, would that be too late to start my career preparations in tech?  

  
 What are some careers in the intersections of both economics and cs, and what prior experiences/courses are valued for these positions? (like technology analysts at banks and stuff)

  
 How do I bring myself up to speed to other ppl at my school who have wanted to major in cs for a long time? 

  
If I realize that I'm more passionate about the business side of tech, how can I leverage my background in CS in my job search if I end up pursuing a double major?

Teacher 1: Physics, 9/10: She loved me and I got a special gift from her at the end of the school year that she's only given out to 7 other students in 20 years. The only problem is that her English is not the greatest (originally from the USSR haha).

Teacher 2: WHAP 7/10. He definitely enjoyed my presence in class but I did ask for his rec a bit late so that might have affected its quality.

Pretty standard. Not too good, not too bad. Definitely didn't help or hurt me, I think.

**Essays**

I think that my writing skills have always been my strong suit (as demonstrated by writing awards and a lot of scholarships that I applied for and got haha); I really enjoy creative and narrative writing and I think it definitely helped me express my voice in my essays. My personal statement was about a topic very very personal to me and I wonder if it was a bit cliche to the point that it didn't really go through. I probably should have written about something that could resonate a bit more to AO's. My supplementals were mainly focused on my work in the law firm, debate, and my research, and about how I was passionate to see social change within those fields.

* UChicago
* Northwestern
* Vanderbilt

&amp;#x200B;

* *Rejections:*
* Stanford
* Yale (deferred REA)
* Princeton

**Additional Information:**

I think one of the reasons I didn't get into the super ""top"" (HYPMS) schools is that I'm very well-rounded to the point where I didn't have anything stand out for me in particular. Hooks really do make a difference, and even though I was passionate about a small group of things (the work I did at my law firm internship, debate, research, track), overall I think I didn't do enough in those fields to stand out. Also, I don't really feel that my EC's matched my major, in that for the first two years of high school I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do.

Please don't apply to only one safety as I did. Don't shotgun schools as well, because like half of those schools that I applied (Northwestern, WashU, Vanderbilt, Columbia, UChicago, Stanford in particular) I really didn't have an interest in attending if accepted."

I don't want to give you guys my life story, but I'm a 4th year computer science major, going to be finishing in 5 years total at a not-extremely-prestigious state school in Cali. 2 semesters left total. I've never had an internship, and have no projects to put on my resume. Got screwed out of a couple of interviews for this summer because of coronavirus. Basically, my resume is completely bunk and the only thing I have to put on it is that I was president of my social fraternity here on campus (and I'm not even sure if that's worth putting on my resume). Grades aren't bad, I should be graduating with a 3.0 if all goes according to plan.

Few questions:

1. I've been meaning to complete a couple projects in my free time to help bolster my resume. One of which would be a inventory tracking system used by a real company (owned by one of my old fraternity brother alumni), the other would be a portfolio website. Am also starting my senior project next semester and I can add that to my resume. My question is, are projects enough to land me a job? Basically, how screwed am I if I have had 0 internships by the time I graduate? I don't know why but I am doubtful about my ability to get an internship and carry out my school workload at the same time without my GPA tanking for these next 2 semesters.
2. What are some other things I can start doing now to increase my chances of landing a job upon graduation? I was thinking of grinding up some leetcode and staying on top of that, but don't know where else to start besides those aforementioned projects.
3. Should projects I choose in my free time correlate to the career field I want to be in? Or should I do a little of everything? I'm not entirely sure which career field I want to work in job-title wise so I was hoping that a mix of projects would help me figure that out.

Thank you so much in advance for any answers, been feeling a little disheartened lately by my ""late start"" so any advice helps."

huhbxm,11,2020-07-20,[UNIVERSITY] Internships or Part time job? Which is better?,chickencurlyfries,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/huhbxm/university_internships_or_part_time_job_which_is/,"hello! im jus genuinely curious which one would build up your portfolio/which one does company prefers nowadays? someone w multiple part time jobs or internships?

From what i know, there are some short-term contracted part time job which is monthly salary based + your working hour is same as full timers (eg 9am-5pm) However, having a part time job does not secure your main learning objectives. For example, the company will not have an end goal/skill that they would want you to achieve at the end of your contract and you might ended up doing all the 'sai kang' job.

As for internships, companies will be quite clear cut on the learning objectives and most interns need to complete at least 1 projects before they end their internship. (aka lowkey making sure that you learn sth) BUT i also heard from quite a few friends that they didnt do much during their internship??  like they basically has nothing to do and just chill around every time. i think this is because some companies have been constantly collaborating with the school to provide internship so they would still continue to take in interns during non-peak period?

ok even thou we shldnt be talking about the pay rn becus experience is the main thing but intern pay and part time pay is a HUGE difference...... part time pay is almost 2x of intern pay eh

Do let me know which one do you think its a better option for uni student to take during the long holiday! thanks in advance :-)"

I’m currently a senior in CS whose come too far and acquired too much debt to not graduate. I’ve been lucky enough to score internships and the majority of my professors have been very helpful and I’m come lightyears from what I understood about tech 4 years ago. 

The problem is, I’m done with CS. It’s tough to admit, and I don’t want to be done. I’ve had some seriously beautiful ‘Aha’ moments that have brought me that amazing god like feeling we all love. But over the past 6 months I’ve burned out hard. I’ve gotten a therapist and have been off and on meds for almost a year now and nothing seems to help. I’m taking one malware analysis class this summer and despite my best efforts and I can’t even seem to finish ch. 1. And it’s MALWARE. Like the coolest hacker man part of what we do! But since getting into my higher level classes, I constantly feel like I’m behind my peers with knowledge and passion, I feel like for me this was only ever supposed to be a job, where with others it is their whole life. And I feel like the curriculum is tailored to those people. But I like music and games and drinking with friends. This leads me to being fundamentally discouraged with continuing. Am I gonna have to give my whole life to this? I’ve worked at companies long enough to know that your work ends at 5,  but even then most of my coworkers went home and worked on pet projects or studied in their spare time. Idk, basically all of this boils down to the fact that I can no longer get my brain to sit down and learn anymore. It’s like trying to get a toddler to eat broccoli. It just spits it right back out as soon as I have any sort of question or feel like I missed something in a previous class. 

This has lead me to spend the majority of time I should be studying spent playing video games or watching YouTube. Basically anything to avoid the cold reality that I feel like my brain has been traumatized by code and I can’t seem to get past it. I could seriously use some advice. And maybe a mentor. Someone who’s risen past this and can be a coach for me as I continue on. I can’t keep doing this alone it has literally broken me. I cannot express how much any help would mean to me as I’m less than 20 credits from graduation.

Thanks
A burned out, depressed senior


TL;DR

I’m a CS senior whose less than 20 credits from graduating but CS has traumatized/broken my brain. I can’t even crack a CS book open and read. I don’t want to give up, but I can’t keep going on like this. I have already sought out meds/counseling. Plz help."

hul6v1,1,2020-07-20,A big vent of my life,JuicySpaceFox,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hul6v1/a_big_vent_of_my_life/,"(Messy english here sorry my first language isnt english)

&amp;#x200B;

Uhm Hi,

i just wanted to vent some stuff about me and my mental health over the years and i thought this was the best place for that. I been struggling with my mental health probably for 11 years now (im 19 right now) it started with me always being the one that got picked on very early on i dont remeber most of it now but i still remeber how i wanted to just jump off a building and have it done. Over the years i didnt really had a lot of friends but the ones i had were really great except for one that i shouldnt even consider one anymore he abused me mentaly and physicly he stole from me, he lied to me and even sexually used me (i was like 10 at that time and he was like 1-2 years older) i didnt knew what i was doing at that moment but looking back at it its really messing with me. As i hit puberty depression hit me hard and the picking on didnt stop even when i was in class with my best friend. I still remeber the feeling of it this empty feeling making everything not matter. I really hope i never go back to it its something you wish on nobody. In that time i also started to try to shut down my emotions so that i insted of feeling bad atleast feel nothing. It wasnt very succesfull but it probably has done something i still cant put my finger on. After my school years i got into a programm to help me find a job and stuff but i cant im not ready for a job or even an internship im scared of strangers and places i normaly wouldnt be. I dont know how i can explain it with strangers i just feel in danger and something else but places im normaly not in i feel unwelcomed i feel like i shouldnt be there its so strong that i already get too scared when i approch the place/building its like a wall preventing me from going and pushing me away.  Some other things that might be intresting are that i did had therapy once when i was in that depression but the only thing i remeber from it are the word ""if nothing is wrong go away there are others with worse problems"" maybe i didnt open up but saying that shouldnt be right for a therapist. My Parents also werent a big help on all of this. My father died early in 2010 and my mom is sick since birth and cant even go outside. Also i have my Grandma which isnt really great as she seems mentaly also unstable she gets angry over a fork missing and im always the one to blame when something is wrong and when im angry and maybe shouting im just get shut down like i dont have the right to be angry. Luckly im getting help soon i already have an appointment for that in the hospital and plan to take off a year to start healing even tho i planned to countine school but another therapist in that programm i mentiont earlier told me it would be a better idea to take that year off at first i didnt even think of that possiblity but it seems right. But right now i feel like screaming i had an internship today but i just couldnt go i was scared this wall came up ealier than ever it came up on the way (i knew both places tho) i just wanna stop now the possiblity of a break took something off of me but it also made everything im still having on my back heavier than ever. I wanna scream cry punch something and even hurt myself just something to not go and let everything out. Sorry i forgot to mentiont that Suicide ideas and the thought of hurting myself has been following me for a long time now i never went throught with it i only got to the point where i hold the knife againt my arm but i just coulndt but now i dont know when the time comes my self control colapses i feel like hurting myself is easier than needed to go somewhere i dont wanna go. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a huge text thank you if you read until here i really appreciate your intrested. I didnt told everything because its a lot and i would need to sort my mind for that you probably noticed what a mess that text was i struggelt to include everything i was ok with sharing with people on the internet."
hulhfv,15,2020-07-20,Convincing my employer to let me do data analytics?,tashibum,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hulhfv/convincing_my_employer_to_let_me_do_data_analytics/,"Long story short, I just got laid off from a really high paying oil and gas engineering job. Tried to enjoy unemployment, but I got bored VERY fast and ended up finding another job that's still in oil and gas but on the environmental side that pays half as much. Boo. I'm not into that, but the company is nice (like a person is nice).  


Anyways, I was also accepted into Oregon State's MS in Data Analytics and I am dying to apply these things I'm learning to real life. I am hoping I can create my own ""internship"" through my existing employer instead of quitting and doing my degree fulltime. I think it will work out because the data are there (they actually collect quite a bit of data in the field) and I can see what can be done with it and they aren't touching it at all. Like lots of equipment failure stats (could pinpoint failing pipe parts for O&amp;G companies for example), cost-saving analysis REALLY needs to be done (tons of inefficiencies), and really the list goes on. I think could create tangible results for the company from a business building and money-saving standpoint. 

For context, the CEO seems to be VERY paranoid about technology. There is another partner in the company who I work under (and probably why he hired me) is more of the tech guy and he kind of has the last say in things but it's mostly catering to the CEO's anti-tech fears.... though we DO have decent systems for running ArcMaps, there are better ways of going about it. All 18 employees of us are doing the same kind of work and have to SHARE 3 computers that run ArcMaps. Let me tell you the frustration I feel waiting an hour and  to be the next ""first"" person to get in on one. UGH.  And just to be clear, finding inefficiencies and automating anything possible was a HUGE part of my last job, as well as data mining and some analytics, so seeing all these things and not being able to do anything about it is beyond frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My new employer is missing out on a lot of revenue and has a lot of wasteful spending.  I think I can ask to create a new role for myself while I do my Masters Degree in Data Analytics and apply what I learn as I go to real-life scenarios. I already see opportunity in the company but the CEO is paranoid about tech. Has anyone gone this route? Done something similar? How do you prove it's needed without being cockblocked or stepping on someone else's toes?"

hun58k,16,2020-07-20,Masters in ME or more bachelors in EE/CS?,worlds_most_Okst,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/hun58k/masters_in_me_or_more_bachelors_in_eecs/,"I graduated 3 years ago with a mechanical engineering(ME) degree with decent grades, involvement but no internship. Throughout this whole time I have been unable to land an engineering job but have landed other technical jobs that never panned out to full engineering jobs for various reasons. I have kept applying, contacted some people in the field and even had my resume professionally written and optimized. Unfortunately, due to the job market along with several other factor (i.e. experience) have been unable to land a job.

Additionally, over the last year I have realized what I truly wanted to do would be more in the electrical engineering(EE)/computer science(CS) vein with robotics, aviation or, well, computers. I realize aviation is more of a mechanical but still would get more out of it with EE seeing how the world is moving more and more into electrical needs. I was reading several articles regarding job growth and opportunities where they all stated EE and CS as two of the biggest growing careers over the next few decades, the pay isn't to shabby either.

Now, I am unsure as to what I should do and would like some guidance or advice if anyone has some. I would like to go back to school but am unsure if I should return for a Masters in ME or a Bachlors in EE or CS. They both have their reason for doing them, a master would give me a higher education with more competitive edge but the bachelor would give me a degree in something that is projected to grow at an exponential rate with less competition.

Thoughts?

I appreciate any and all help or advice. Thank You!"

This is probably my fault considering I posted so late at nigh, so I am here trying again with the same post. Sorry in advance if you have already seen this.

I need suggestions and advice on which one of these two laptops to buy. I was looking to upgrade and get a new laptop and these two caught my eye. The S340 has an intel core i5 processor with 4 cores, 8 threads, and a 256 GB hard drive and costs around $600. The IdeaPad 3 has an AMD Ryzen 3 3250U processor with 2 cores, 4 threads, and a 512 GB hard drive and costs around $475. I mainly use my laptop for school work and such as well as casual gaming, but no online gaming or too fast paced. I was wondering if I could get thoughts and opinions and some general knowledge since I don't know much about laptops and computers. I had one of out tech guys come into the office I intern at and asked him about these, his suggestion was the S340 because he thought it would be good for my purposes and plus he knows more about the intel core processors and suggested at least an i5. He said he didn't as much about the AMD processors except that he didn't like the cheaper ones and thought if you were gonna use an AMD to go for the higher tier ones.

Some questions I still had are is how important are the number of cores and threads and how much would there be a difference between these two laptops in terms of the number of each core/threads on each one? Would it be worth it to splurge a little more on the S340 if it performs that much better? And would it last longer (In terms of years of use I could get out of it)?

Here are the links to the two laptops specs and other info on Lenovo's website:

IdeaPad S340: [https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/Lenovo-IdeaPad-S340-15IWL/p/81WW0005US](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/Lenovo-IdeaPad-S340-15IWL/p/81WW0005US)

Any assistance with helping me understand the specs and advantages of each laptop are greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance for any help and suggestions you may provide."
huo8yg,17,2020-07-20,Fired for working too much ?,JackAmb,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/huo8yg/fired_for_working_too_much/,"Hi, I've joined this company 8 months ago as an intern then got offered a job as a junior web developer 2 months ago. I joined with 4 other interns and we were all offered contracts.

The other interns (now working as web developers) are working on a rather simple(ish) project where they do what they're told and get paid. 

I, on the other hand, was told given a new project in which I was told I had to act as the product owner ( communicate with the client and understand his needs ), while taking the technical lead on the project (meaning I had to develop everything alone). Normally on such a project, you need a whole team of at least 3 people to pull it off.

At first I was more than happy to see that my boss trusted me this much. A couple of weeks later, my boss calls me unsatisfied and says he's not happy of my progress. I explain to him that it's a huge project that requires a whole team, it's not a simple thing and that I'm working my ass off to accomplish it.  He's kind of angry / disappointed but says it's okay.

A couple of weeks later, he calls me to say he's got one more new project for me, one which I'll be working on.

Needless to say, I'm overwhelmed by all the work, I find myself working more than 8 hours a day and sometimes on the weekend. 

I talk to my boss about it, he keeps saying things like ""I know you can do it"", ""give it your best"", ""you're capable of doing more than that"", etc.

Slowly his encouragements turn to threats as he says stuff like ""I'm disappointed in you, I thought you were better than that"", ""you disappoint me, you're not working enought"".

This morning, he calls me in his office and tells me ""You're not doing enough. Go take the rest of the summer off and maybe I'll let you back in september"" (I won't be paid anything during this time)

Bear in mind that meanwhile, all the other junior developers are working way less than me (probably less than half my work) and are getting paid the same.

**TLDR:** Working my ass off at my new job while other people are barely doing half of what I do. Boss is angry and sends me home (with no paid leave) and expects me to come back in a few months.

What do I do ? Any advice ?"

144 or 120hz screen (I play csgo and valorant)

hus74l,5,2020-07-20,"Is this a shit offer for the Midwest? Also, did this company handle this well?",AkimboJesus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hus74l/is_this_a_shit_offer_for_the_midwest_also_did/,"**Edit:** I should also say my career devs person said this non-compete was standard. Also, this company is fully remote even before Covid. 

**Edit 2:** I would appreciate any upvotes, just because this post is getting buried really fast already. 

I have been programming for a few years, and I'm a recent full stack graduate of a bootcamp (that isn't a garbage one, I promise). I excelled in this camp, and even taught a lot of my friends there who had never coded before so they wouldn't have to drop back a few weeks in the course. I was always considered best in the class, whatever that's worth. I was taught React/Redux, Jquery, Postgresql, and Node/Express. I have not worked in the tech industry. 

I have been on the job hunt since CovID hit. It was devastating to a lot of our grads, but many of us have gone on to find jobs, some of them paying around $52k (considered average). Some of the classmates that really struggled are taking jobs at $15/hr

I was in an interview process with a small company of four people. They have been around for almost ten years, and they are making ""okay"" looking apps (their words) in Python for companies in my city. Pure contract work.  

Our interview went great, my references spoke highly of me, and I had good momentum with the company. One person even asked rhetorically why no one hired me yet. Then I got the python test. I got very stuck on one technical question regarding file IO, and it was noticeably embarrassing. But they eventually asked me to move onto a different question and I did that very quickly. After the interview, I sent them my solutions to the rest just to show I enjoy this work. It's also worth mentioning this test they gave me had unintentional bugs, but there were other reasons I got stuck for so long on that first question. 

The next week I got a call that they don't believe I am really a junior developer. More in between intern and junior. They insisted that they didn't feel comfortable having me on any Python projects because they were all too big. Instead, they want me to do PHP projects, a language I have never even seen before. The CEO wants to teach me it over Skype (because of quarantine), and they will pay me $20/hr. At the end of the call, I said I had to think about it, and then the CEO said **""One more thing. You need to take one last Python test with our CTO before I can even offer you this PHP job officially.""** Exact words. 

This has been very confusing for all of my friends, who are working with much bigger companies on WAY more critical projects, in languages they have never used (and none of them have coded before a few months ago). They find it odd that a company would move me from a language I'm familiar in to a language I have never seen before because their projects are too big. "" As one friend put it, they are acting like I'll ""push something to master and break their whole app forever."" As another friend put it, ""How are you supposed to get experience with big apps, then?"" Even my career devs person, who is of the opinion that I should take any job ASAP, is finding it shitty that they completely changed the job on me last minute. 

So I get ready to take this next Python test. The CTO skypes me with his girlfriend passed out behind him on a couch. No idea what to make of that. This is the first time I've seen him, and throughout the interview, he is noticeably not excited to be working for this company. I'm immediately getting vibes that this place is not what it seems when talking to the CEO. 

The test was designed to be a fully functioning app I haven't seen before, and I had to fix a bug despite being unfamiliar with the app. This seemed, to me, like a way more important test than the small scale technical questions I got before. 

The bug was a pytest condition that was failing ""sometimes."" As in, sometimes all the pytest checks would pass, but if you ran it again, one would suddenly fail. Despite not knowing the specifics of the app, it was all analogous enough to my Javascript fullstack education to make sense. I fixed the bug in 15 minutes (had an hour). I then asked him about the PHP job, and he said ""Yeah, all our Python projects are just too important right now."" He even said he hated PHP and they were moving away from it. So he admits they were going to teach me a language that isn't modern enough for their company long term. 

I let him know I was talking with a few other companies, and he immediately backtracked a little and said the intention wouldn't be to keep me on PHP all that long. 

The offer came in the next day with $20/hr and a non-compete that says I can't code in my state for a year without their permission. I know non-competes are standard in this industry, but I talked to many graduates and a lawyer. None of their non-competes look like this, and the lawyer said ""I wouldn't want my son signing this."" 

**I don't want to inflate my abilities or be ungrateful, but the way I'm feeling about this whole thing is:**

1) The pay seems like shit even for the midwest

2) The company has been around for 10 years and they seem to have no vision for growth. They have 4 people, the same clients, and little to no online presence. I am worried they are just churning through entry level people. 

3) The culture of the company just seems funky, and I'm concerned for a future where my reputation hinges on a CEO that might not know what they are doing. 

4) I have no way to protect myself if this CEO wants to take credit for things I did or wants to slander me. I haven't seen any evidence this might happen other than the glassdoor review and the general elitist vibe. 

Are these valid concerns? Or does this company seem like it's operating normally and I should just take the job and learn PHP?"

I have been mostly lurking on this sub for like a month or so now and surprisingly a lot of good advice comes out of this. So obviously the market isn't too hot now, but I am very lucky to still be in school. I am going for an AAS in Programming, and plan on taking several tests including A+, CCNA, and Sec+ around when I graduate, of course I am going to study for them throughout this time.

I am also in a remote internship for Web Development working with the front end (Currently learning back-end and building upon my front end skills,) so I can also have this as an option. I worked with my school in student life mainly with social media management and such, and also as ambassador. 

Super long term I think, when I am in senior position for IT-related stuff (Information Security focus, I know it will be very difficult to get into,) I think becoming project manager and passing those tests (PMP/CAPM) would be decent option but that is like years from now.

Some resources I am using of course is CISCO's free stuff on their site, Prof Messer's vids, Udemy front-end stuff, freeCodeCamp, TOP, YouTube, and official source code sites for frameworks, messing around with Ubuntu occasionally, my own home network, and I am currently building my GitHub up.

What are your thoughts and opinions with this? Should I bite the bullet and do a BA in CompSci and go from there?

I switched from Psychology to now AAS in Programming. I am sure job prospects will be way better whenever I graduate and stuff. 

I know I am all over lol, but TL;DR I am having web dev stuff and IT both under my belt as options because, well, ""Why not?""

Also: I don't ever plan on going to any CoDiNg bOoTCaMpS because I feel like I'd fare better being self taught.... honestly I feel a lot of bootcamps are just motivational and not giving you practical knowledge... lol"

I'll be graduating in 2021.

My plan is to get Canadian Permanent Residence after I finish undergrad which should be around 3-4 years from now if the rules doesn't change so I may be considered as domestic applicant when applying for masters. That means I'll be working for 2-3 years before applying to masters.

What kind CS schools that I could aim for in Canada ?. I guess top CS school (UofT, waterloo, UBC Vancouver) is out of reach and I could always go back to my school for masters.

Also what kind of school I could expect if I choose to go to Europe or US ?

Experience:

1. 2 summer of undergrad research experience, 1 of them under grant. 1 paper published as of now. Expecting 1 good LOR from a prof. Topic is related to **application of machine learning** but I'm open to any topics for my masters. I know that pure ML is very competitive.
2. 3 Internship, some at prestigious companies in Canada. Software development and as a game dev.

So in college I took an introductory programming class in c++ that scratched the surface of OOB and I am now finishing a Data structures class. I learned all the basics, loops, functions, variables etc...but I'll admit, I still don't fully comprehend how to implement loops and sometimes functions. Before this, I learned the basics of python, so it might be c++ that tripped me up. 

This summer I somehow landed a SE intern position at a great robotics lab. Although I understand the math behind it (I love math) when I am presented with a problem, my mind goes blank. We are also using the opencv library, so I have to google everything. I have trouble coding without googling how other people coded similar problems. As hard as I try to come up with a solution on my own, usually I end up combining a bunch of code excerpts I found on the internet. I was wondering, when presented with a solution, what is the first thing that comes to your mind? Is it supposed to be as simple as ""a loop would work well for this, and then blank function...etc)? I think the main problem I am facing is that I do not know enough (lacking knowledge of OOP and recursion) and that I do not fully understand the basics. Could this be why am I am struggling, and any other ideas for improvement?"

huu8zz,2,2020-07-20,Leaving my Dream School,cookskearney,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/huu8zz/leaving_my_dream_school/,"Just got the bill for my next year of college, and the total cost of attendance has been raised to be $97,600 for the year. I’m a great student, and I received around 35k of scholarships, but that doesn’t put much of a dent into it. I just finished my freshman year at this school, and then ending bill they gave me was 20k more than they had quoted us when I committed to the school. I’m on track to get my bachelors of science of nursing, and I know I will get a good job when I graduate. 

But if I stay at this school, I’ll graduate with at least 100k in debt. I have a meeting with a representative from the school to ask them for more money, but I’ve already appealed online and they didn’t budge. 

I know that unless they give me more money I can’t stay at this school, but I am absolutely heart broken. It is in my dream city, and would offer me an internship with the hospital I have always dreamed of working at once I graduate. I have a lease on an apartment with one of my best friends for next year, and so many more amazing friends and family in the city this school is in. I truly feel like it’s my home. 

I am gutted. Normally when people have to transfer it’s because they don’t have friends, or it isn’t a good fit, or they fail out. None of those things have happened to me, I loved my freshman year. And now I’ll have to uproot my life and probably live at home and transfer to a smaller, less competitive university. I’ll probably have no friends, and if I do I’ll have to start completely from scratch with them. It just sucks. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Or is a college grad with any words of wisdom for me? Anything helps. I’m so embarrassed to have to tell my friends at school and my extended family that I am likely not returning to my dream school."

I am making this post because the situation is dire. Please listen to my situation and suggest a course of action.

On Lewis Capaldi 's Before you Go Official Video, many people had posted their sad stories and I felt particularly sympathetic for this one girl who sounded very down and I suggested if she ever wanted to talk I could lend an ear because she sounded so lonely in her comments.
So that's what she did and she reached out on Insta we started to talk a lot and became good friends too. She seemed a little down and so I asked if she wanted to share why she felt so bad.

Here is the story.
She was a medical student and studied in an university. Her elder sister was getting married and if you know the concept of dowry then you will know that the groom was good but the marriage was very difficult to plan due to dowry demands. On the night of the groom's bachelor party, she had taken a few glasses of wine and was partially drunk. In such a condition, the brother of the groom raped her along with 3 of his friends. She was traumatized but couldn't complaint as she knew that the groom was a good guy and she couldn't risk her sisters marriage. She kept quiet but her grades gradually fell. Also her story was leaked in her college and she was bullied so she had to drop out and take an independent course and went to another party of the country.
She used to help opodartho with depression herself. On the rise to the new town she found a guy chilling near the train door which was open and she thought he was gonna jump off and decided to stop him. He was not going to jump btw he was just smoking. Long story short she started to date this guy and actually felt comfy around him. She was native and the guy was clingy and demanded some writers things in their relationships. He had her tattoo his name on her waist in Urdu. He was aggressive during sex and also got very violent when drunk or angry and beat her at times. She got afraid and got an internship in a differed place.
Sadly she got sick and had to be hospitalized for 3 nights. On night 2 r sister had to go to work and there was no one to look after her and that guy came for the night as her sister still thought they were dating.
When she was in a semi sedated state, the guy tried to force himself into her and tried to rape her but she actually started to make some noise with the nurse bell and drove the guy away before anything could happen.
At this point she has lost faith in the works when after 2 years of staying single she stared to kinda see a guy who drove her to work in the morning. They went along pretty well for half an year and she started to feel better again. But...
She had a roome idol why was spiteful of her and was the ex girlfriend of her current boyfriend (she did not know this). Just to door her she kept in touch with the aggressive one and kid him about her.
Well one day he showed up and found her boyfriend and had a word with him. He showed him some of her intimate pictures and claimed she was cheating on him and had had sec with him recently. Well unfortunately the trick worked and what ensured was a messy breakup.

Today she is suicidal and is hanging on for her younger sisters sake. She plans to kill herself on xyz date. She has flashbacks and she is difficult when she remembers her past. She as of now is too afraid to even talk much. I tried my level best to convince her to live and have kinda managed to give her reason to live already fr now. She h herself doesn't want to live. She says every day is painful no matter how much u try tk distract her. But trust me, deep down she is a very sweet girl. I'm sorry for sharing her story which she prefers not to be shared but I need to know how can i even help her.

Any help will be appreciated. Will keep posted."
huuhtv,1,2020-07-20,"TIFU by losing my friend's dorm key, changing locks will cost me more money than I own",u53rn4m35d0n7m4773r,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/huuhtv/tifu_by_losing_my_friends_dorm_key_changing_locks/,"Not a native speaker, so sorry for any mistakes. I hope this fits the subreddit, I'm not so sure. But it is quite a fuck up, it's f*cking up my life and mental health right now. 


I'm going to college/university and due to corona, this semester has been held completely online. I live alone, about three hours away from my parents, sharing my wifi with my neighbor to split the cost. The wifi was down for about 5 weeks altogether during the semester. My neighbor hasn't been home, so we couldn't figure out what was going on and I would be forced moving back to my parents, if there wasn't a solution ASAP. Going back to my parents would have driven me crazy. I have always struggled with my mental health and my parents played a huge factor in that, hence I first moved out when I was 17(highly uncommon where I grew up). They're not abusive or anything, they actually pay for my apartment, my food, my insurance etc. It's just messed up and not really a part of this story. Just wanted to mention that I would have done a LOT to avoid moving back to my hometown.

Now, due to Corona, many students were going back to their parents, leaving lots of apartments and dorm rooms empty. I took that opportunity and asked a friend if I could get her spare key and study at her dorm. I wasn't feeling comfortable with it, because I would have some sort of responsibility, as to not to lose her key. She said yes, but told me not to lose her keys. I am terribly at NOT losing keys. I'm losing mine every other month, go crazy, and end up finding it two meltdowns later in some coat pocket. However, that's how it is with MY keys, and given how paranoid I can be, although I did have a bad feeling about it, I thought maybe it would be different with someone else's keys.

I had a special place in my apartment where I would put all my keys, so that I couldn't lose them. I am a lazy, chaotic person though, so I'd say the keys actually were there only 80% of the time. Sometimes I'd just leave them in my coat/jeans pocket or my backpack, once my wallet (which I forgot about and went crazy). Now, my wifi has been working again for at least a little over a month. I still have been at my friend's dorm every now and then for a change of scenery and also because I had forgotten a few things. I do not remember the last time I was at her dorm.

So, yesterday a mutual friend of my friend and I asked me if I could let her into our friend's apartment to use her toilet, so I looked for the key of the dorm, only to realize I had zero idea where it was. It wasn't at the place it should have been, neither in my backpack, nor my jacket, nor my car. I panicked, had some anxiety attacks. At some point I decided 2am was late enough for the day, so I went to bed. Today, I started cleaning my apartment (20square meters full of stuff. Almost messie-like, I can't keep it clean for anything), trying to find the key. So far I haven't.

I have been able to find out how much changing the locks will be. Lots of locks will have to be changed if I am unable to find the key. It will cost me 1200€ apparently. I only own about 700€, sometimes 750€ at the end of each month.

I am freaking out. I realize this might not fit here anymore, but I need to vent.
So far, I have told nobody but my best friend. I have neither told my friend, who's key I've lost, nor my parents. If I am unable to find the key, I will have to somehow pay the changing of the locks, obviously, as it is my responsibility. There is no way for me to get a job before mid September, because I'm starting an internship soon, which will have me work 9am-8pm 5 days a week. That means, I would have to borrow the money. I think I would have to ask my parents, but as I have mentioned before, they already are a huge factor in my mental (not so) well-being as it is. They probably wouldn't even have to lend me the money themselves, because I inherited a few hundred € three years ago. I am supposed to get the money when I'm 25(far away from that), but I have already once used some of that money when I needed it for my driver's license, so that rule seems to be bendable if needed.

So maybe me stressing out isn't even about how I will get the money. I think somehow I would be able to get the money. It's about how I will have absolutely no money left. That scares me. My parents judgement scares me. Confessing to my friend that I've lost her key scares me.
I am sorry for bothering y'all, I just really needed to get it all out and maybe, hopefully, getting a comment or two on my situation, by redditors who have some more experience on life than I do.

TL ; DR: Lost the key to my friend's dorm, if I don't find it soon, I will have to pay 1200€ to change the locks, but I own only 700€, so I gotta come up with a solution that doesn't f*ck up my mental health anymore than it already is."

My grades are good (top 5%), I like most of my lectures and have some great plans for future courses to take and seminars to participate in.

When talking to my peers, most of them have quite similar lives. I only know one person doing bigger side projects, one having done an internship and one having contact to companies. I believe this is normal in Germany, as we only have one month freetime per semester, which usually gets used to relax from the stressful exams, meet with friends and family and to do some deferred tasks (moving, planing exchange semester, looking for bachelor thesis, repairing and cleaning things, looking what courses to take next).

But on Reddit here everyone seems to have internships, side projects and time to grind leet code. I know in other countries, students have several months without lectures so maybe this explains things?

I'm also wondering in how far my grades actually matter. It is really draining to grind several weeks for my exams and to do a lot of extra work during the semester to understand everything and to get all bonus points. I could pass my exams with a quarter the work, I just wouldn't have good grades. Though my grades so far helped me out a lot through scholarships and the ability to get the jobs, seminars and courses at my university that I want.

Has someone some insights on how grades influenced them? How do other people find the time for projects and internships?"

I liked computer architecture, but I wasn't even able to get my processor to work (this is in part because I mismanaged my time during online classes, but that's still my fault).

My undergrad was computer science, and I'm currently in a CS master's program.

Looking forward towards a PhD, I'd really like to pursue applications to a specific scientific domain as my passion is in interdisciplinary research. Of course, that'd require me studying up on whichever field, since my academic background is in CS/applied-math.

I'm concerned about how likely it is for me to get into programs such as computational chemistry, bioinformatics, and computational physics. I know most of the novel work in these fields come from people with a background in the scientific domain who learned CS topics on the side... I'd be the reverse.

Can anyone here shed light on how PhD studies look for someone with my interests? My intuition is telling me I should just apply to CS programs that focus on topics of interest to science in general (HPC, numerical analysis, etc.).

Here  is the twenty-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel  free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here  (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I  am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a  comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and  modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML  accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer  engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck  looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If  you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded  systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No,  but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as  open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the  field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That  depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering  jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where  you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to  programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally,  I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely  is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do  I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer? 
   * That's depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to  help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same  can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to  get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

I’m majoring in CS and need a real-talk from the older crowd.

My degree will be a BS in Applied Math: Computer Science at a small liberal arts college. It’s a decent program but they don’t cover things like networks, operations systems, etc. primarily algorithms analysis, data structures, and tons of math. 

I’m a senior this year and am wondering what I can do to better position myself for getting a job. I’ve met with our career center to set up a good resume, but I have yet to land an internship. 

I’ve done a few hackathons, should I do more hackathons to make up for not having a CS internship? Would that even matter to them.

I have an okay GPA, about 3.4 right now. Major GPA is about the same. 

I feel like my only hope is to do big personal projects to stand out, but do those even make a huge difference on my resume? Like, will I actually stand out that much more for building an app or something?

I live in the Bay Area but am open to moving if I landed a job elsewhere.

Any tips would be great, thanks!"

I decided to go into SE because why not! I like using computers aaaaaaand that's pretty much why!I've never programmed anything before. I didn't know shit about anything, I've never cracked open any computer, but I figured I'd learn in class.

**Year 1**: I started programming. it's was fun. I was paired up with my friend for every coding assignment. We learn the basics, it was okay easy to understand, started to struggle mostly because of calculus and algebra (not good in math in general). I started to lose interest. I was still not great at programming, figured eh! year 1, it's normal. We did program a robot for my final project, and I wasn't as helpful as my other team members (who were also my friends) because I struggled with understanding and coding in general. They kind of pushed me aside because the project had to progress (understandable). Oh and I had an ""internship"" (not really.. it was just some people I knew started a company and I joined them as an ""intern"") and people didn't really cared about me, even when I needed help, so I lost interest real quick.

**Year 2**: I felt like I was a burden to my friend. She found some new partner (friends), I was paired up with random people in class. I knew I started losing interest in coding in general because I realized real quick that I was falling behind, like real bad. I failed some classes (not coding related), stopped trying. Friends started to talk none stop about internship. I was getting irritated because I wouldn't want myself as a teammate, why would some random guy pick me over so many great students? That's what I tell myself every time (and still today). For the second yearly project, my friends didn't even considered me to be part of their team. I ended up failing my second project.

So right now, I do not know how to code, I want to do some projects by myself, but opening any kind of IDE gives me anxiety (maybe exaggerating, but you get the point). Therefore I'm not improving at all (I understand that this is the only was to improve). I'm in a serious vicious circle and I can't break out of it.

I participated in two hackathons. The first one was related to AI in a game (hated it!), and our second one was a very basic web page (JS, HTML, CSS) --&gt; still ashamed of what we ended up with after 24 whole hours...

All my friends have internship. I haven't applied yet, because I'm just ashamed of myself as an SE student.

It's stressing me out so much (school, internship, GPA, ...), I often cry myself to sleep thinking about it. I'm debating whether or not I should change my career path (to what??? I don't know! I don't even know why I chose SE!).

I know I shouldn't worry about it, but I just feel like I would disappoint people if I changed my career path (not that they care... I think? I'm just super self-conscious )

**TL;DR  I'm stuck in a vicious circle: not good at coding &gt; gives me anxiety &gt; not coding &gt; etc etc.**

***As people in the industry or people who will be in this industry, were some of you in the same situation? what did you do? do you have any suggestions? does anything i said was normal? I'm seriously stressing out hardcore because it's a 4 year bachelor degree and I'm already midway.***"

hv3k6x,91,2020-07-21,"Beginners guide to reducing costs during your MBA, but still having a good time with the boys",throwaway8429739,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/hv3k6x/beginners_guide_to_reducing_costs_during_your_mba/,"The purposes for writing this is to explain how you can save money, but you may be asking why save money? I’m supposed to make 180k at graduation TC! False. Your 30k bonus is actually 2/3s or less of that after taxes, and your 150k salary is actually 100k in many areas - federal marginal rate is 24% alone at that bracket. That’s more like 130k. Your accrued INTEREST on 200k in loans at 7% is 1200 per month, so that’s 12ish% of your take home pay. In interest alone. In even a great scenario you’re paying 1/5th of EVERYTHING you put in loans towards Interest - not even principal! Plus guess what schools aren’t publishing employment data this year which mean outcomes suck. Lord help you if you lose a job or become disabled. I fudged the numbers a bit but you get the point. 

You can expect to pay 20% on everything you buy with a loan. So go ahead and mentally add 20% to the cost of everything you purchase during an MBA. Your mileage may vary. 

Anyways, once you’ve selected a program and deposited, you will receive a bill that looks like this:

25,000 tuition 1st semester
500 academics fee
250 club fee 
2800 health insurance fee.

Right off the bat you should always try to attack that health insurance fee. Talk to your employer and ask to be placed on an educational leave of absence if you are still employed and are going full time. On LOA you can pay them a nominal fee and keep your health insurance. Alternatively you can shoulder the costs yourself, which the average non employer monthly premium is 440 or so (cheaper). Your school may require a low deductible. Keep in mind schools will not always verify you keep your health insurance. I am not recommending skipping it though, bad idea. Don’t accept this cost for granted though, shop around. Don’t pay sticker. 

Second, attack your housing costs. Most leases will require 12 months, which is a terrible deal. If you leave in December, and don’t stay for the 3 months in the summer (which is highly likely considering you are doing an internship) you are out 4 months of rent, plus you can get screwed on deposits and roommates, etc. Instead you can get a 10 month lease or an Airbnb for a few months. This can save you thousands in rent.

For personal finances, you can pay the suggested amounts on their website. Let’s look at Cornell’s just as an example.

Housing/food - 16k
Books - 1k
Personal expenses - 5k

You will probably pay somewhat closer to the housing and food, but books are a different story. You can save hundreds by buying them from the previous class, using #bookz on ED, searching for PDFs, older editions on eBay or amazon, etc. No need to eat that cost.

For personal expenses watch this for a sense of where to spend on trips and whatnot. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pjiwfHtgvSo. They felt some trips were worth it, others not, estimated food costs, how to save money via house parties, etc. 

Now let’s consider investments. If you have some cash on hand, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend just paying straight on your loans, instead consider this:

You want to reduce risk as much as reasonable, so you can consider the amount of portfolio to place in risk free investments. The risk free rate is something like 4%. Furthermore in the secondary market a risk free investment can be sold for a higher cost during recession, so keep that in mind as well you can get a small bump in your return if the economy crashes.

The purpose of saying this is to point out that you can employ strategies in your investments to help lower your risk. For example, you can place 80% of your portfolio in risk free investments and 20% in highly speculative, and that way in a downturn you will lose money, but significantly less than if you invested 100% in a normal portfolio. And you can expect similar returns in a performing economy.

Furthermore, you can employ other strategies. You can invest your money in the markets and pull parts of your principal out to cover tuition and then ultimately keep your tuition money in risk free investments. This will save you in a recession and allow your money to continue to grow in the stock market - money you can afford to lose since you’re covered on your loans.

The point is it’s not black and white invest or don’t invest. Earning compounded interest and paying simple interest is great. Also get federal loans not private as much as possible.

I’m digressing, but private companies have a ton of power to screw you, and will fragment your loans, charge variable interest, not allow IBR, etc. Avoid where possible. In fact regular unsecured consumer debt might be better because you can bankrupt it! Don’t believe me? Watch this playlist: https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3QKq1qGSvMlteBJRodRf0MK5LtcyBK0J

This post is more of a rough outline, there are so many programs and situations that it’s hard to say anything definitive. Take it with a liberal amount of salt."
hv3qy1,1,2020-07-21,Should i give up on having a real connection with my family?,Kiwami12,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hv3qy1/should_i_give_up_on_having_a_real_connection_with/," 

There's so much to unpack and so much I want to say but i'm going to try to keep this as short as possible. . I'm from the US, and I moved to Japan when I was 19 to enter a language school here. I had entered university in the US, and spent a year mentoring exchange students who came to the US, and mostly listening to their frustrations with the cultural differences they experienced everyday. I stayed up helping them edit their term papers until late at night, hosted events to help everyone feel more comfortable, and soon most of my focus was on being apart of this international community.

It's a long story (i'm one of the few who didn't move to Japan for anime), but because of a half-dozen or so life coincidences, I felt like I was being pushed in the direction of Japan. I started dating a Japanese girl from that international community after a few months, and while I was planning on going to Japan sometime in the future for quite some time, that was the thing that pushed me over the edge to leave that college which was in the middle of nowhere, and go to Japan to learn more about the culture and language. I was facing a fork in the road. I saw all of my friends, my girlfriend, and the thing I really wanted to do leaving with the end of that year, and I just felt like it was time for me to move on as well.

I'm explaining this because my family was understandably surprised and apprehensive about my decision, but what surprised me was just how dismissive they would come to be in the next few months. I decided to drop out, and for the 6 months it took me to get my visa to Japan, they made it their mission to humiliate me at every party, every event, every time I went to visit the dentist, etc. They didn't want me to go, and did whatever they could to stop me. I don't want to go into every story because this post is already getting too long, but the biggest things were that

1: I told them that when I was part of that community, I felt like I was expanding myself. I felt like I was becoming a better person. I want to move to another country like Japan to become somebody more unique and well-rounded. Their response to this was ""in Japan you'll just be another white-boy"".

2: While I admit looking back that it was initially a big factor in me wanting to move, they thought the only reason I was moving to Japan was to be with my girlfriend, and they made sure to make a scene to every person they could about this fact. Every waiter/waitress in the 50 mile vicinity had to know that I was moving to Japan to go live with my Japanese girlfriend. I suppose they were testing me in a way? We broke up over 5 years ago and I'm still here so that clearly wasn't my only reason for coming, although I suppose I can understand their perspective on this. They handled it really immaturely though.

(I just want to say I appreciate anyone who has read this far. I realize this is way too long).

Most first year of living in Japan, they would demand I call them and tell them everything i'm doing, and if I ever had a bad day all I heard was ""well you could just come back home then"". I had a bad date? Cue parents/Sister ""well you know we have girls here too"". If I struggled with the culture in any way : ""I thought you were supposed to know these things by now. I guess you should come home"".

This lead to a huge amount of resentment from me, because what I NEEDED was for somebody to tell me that what I was doing had value, and to keep going. That they were proud of me. Not to come home because they missed me. The longer I have lived here, the stronger I have felt this. To be fair to my parents, I should mention that they were paying for most of my school while I was living here (that being said it was MUCH cheaper than the US. We aren't talking about 30k a year or something insane like that). As a result, I feel guilt any time I feel resentment against them. They made it possible for me to do what I wanted to do quicker, and made me feel terrible about it the entire time I was doing it.

Fast forward 5 years, I went through college here, and now I am working a job doing international marketing, hunkering down during covid. While things have gotten much better over the years, and I look back at some of my own actions and cringe a bit, I still feel like they don't understand the magnitude of the life decision I have taken here, and demand that we have a stronger connection while refusing to listen to me about any of my real experiences. For example, I entered university here a second time, with the goal of taking all of my courses with other students in Japanese. Around my 3rd year I was struggling so much with my courses, papers, part-time job, and looking for internships all in my second language, that I was only sleeping for 4-5 hours a day. When I told my family about this their response was something like ""Oh yea, I remember those days"".

... You...remember those days, of living in a foreign country, as a minority, and taking college courses in a second language you started learning a few years ago...while working a part time job in that language and trying to do job hunting...all while considering cultural differences..while living alone with no safety net around...you really remember that?

This is a pretty accurate metaphor for our entire relationship at this point. I don't need them to say that what I'm doing is special or amazing, but they seem to have this attitude that they have had all of my experiences, with the small difference that I learned Japanese or something? They don't understand how the cultural, language, lifestlye, how that effects every single aspect of my life on a moment to moment basis. And I love it. I don't want to complaing, so I usually don't talk about my life. But then they complain that we don't have some deeper connection. When I open up to them they disregard my experiences by saying ""that isn't as unique as you think it is"", or ""i've done the same thing"" or something along those lines. They said the same thing when I moved. I moved from Osaka, Japan to Tokyo, which is about 6 hours away by car. I had to figure out the logistics of moving all of my furniture, finding a new apartment while in Osaka and then taking a day trip to Tokyo to sign papers, dealing with tons of discrimination because i'm not Japanese, renewing my visa and sending in those documents to the realtor, a dozen more steps like that etc... and again they said ""oh yea I remember moving it was rough"" . They're comparing moving 30 minutes away in their own country, to me moving 6 hours away in another country for a new job.

I don't know, they probably don't mean to sound so dismissive. And i'm really trying to just let them say what they want and let them be happy but...I don't know, maybe it's covid but it's been pretty lonely living like this for so many years. I had friends who supported me here but since moving to Tokyo and being stuck in a 20 square meter apartment for 6 months during all of this, it's starting to really get to me. I just work and call them and it's starting to make me lose my mind a bit.

So...at this point I just say thank you to them, try to be respectful about any advice they give me, and hunker down and accept that i'm alone in this. Until I make some new friends in this new city at least.

This was so long I know. It's unorganized and emotional, but maybe getting some different perspectives would help? Thanks for your time."

I am considering Angela Yu's course (working on her iOS course too atm and its fucking great).

Also what sort of  projects will look good on my resume?

A bit about myself:  
I only graduated roughly a week ago (July 21 when I'm posting this and I officially graduated in July 15) but I am already insanely stressed about getting a job. Since April 2020 I have applied to about 50-60 jobs and only 3 got back to me. 1 of them is the FDM Group but they suck from the reviews I read, pay really low (which is okay for me tbh being just out of college) but there is also a 2 yr contract you can't breach (and if you do you pay $30K) and you need to move to Toronto/Montreal while I'm based in Vancouver and prefer staying in Van. 

PS: I have no internship experience."

I managed to secure another internship, ten times more interesting than the one I got kicked from. That gave me a newfound wave of productivity and creativity which felt amazing. The high culminated today where I got what I thought was a glimpse of a hopeful future; moving into another home in the city, getting new pets, and even being accepted into yet another and far more interesting internship after I'm done with the current one...

But I know the pattern my life takes. It goes up, and then down, and then up, and then down. Over the years both have grown more extreme. Only that I didn't know the low would hit so quick...

I just got an email reply from my university for my gap year request. It's easy to guess what they said.

I... can't go. Not enough money, not enough experience, and the fricking COVID is why I had to ask them. I had REASONS. I had PROOF. And somehow that's still not enough.

And thus, I have to say goodbye to my dream and my future. There's nowhere else I can go; I've put all my eggs in one basket and dropped it a half year ago. They've seen me, they didn't take me, they see me again and they won't take me. This one took me, and I turned it down; they're going to spare me the work of doing that next year by turning *me* down.

Why waste the time? There's nothing left to do. What am I even doing these internships for? As I said, no higher education = no job = no money = no success. Just going to be stuck doing nothing, being useless.

I don't think I'll go to work tomorrow. Would tonight be the night? Am I brave enough?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: being the coward with social anxiety I am I was forced to go to work today. I just talked to my mom about this whole deal and she told me to stfu, go to hell, that she doesn't love me and no one else does either"

I am new to reddit and new to Python and Machine Learning; I  would love to soon get myself to the level of doing projects with you  guys, the big dogs! Right now, I am doing an internship with the Dept of  Homeland Security, focused on Developing a Threat Indicator Driven  Finite State Machine. It involves a lot a lot a lot of Machine Learning!  The eventual goal is for me to develop a Knowledge Graph of the Cyber  Threat Intelligence (CTI) classified in the STIX language in order to  automate the process of detecting malware and Advanced Persistent  Threats (APT). But I am not quite there :( Right now, I am slightly  struggling with comprehending all of the parts of GraphSage Link  Prediction using the Ktrain Wrapper.

This is the Jupyter Tutorial I am using: [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amaiya/ktrain/blob/master/examples/graphs/cora\_link\_prediction-GraphSAGE.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amaiya/ktrain/blob/master/examples/graphs/cora_link_prediction-GraphSAGE.ipynb)

A large number of my questions arise around the following:

\*\* Sampled 527 positive and 527 negative edges. \*\*

\*\* Sampled 475 positive and 475 negative edges. \*\*

I  gather that the sampling occurs in order to avoid the problems  associated with an extremely large dataset but I am not sure exactly how  it works. It appears to me that the Validation Set is, in this case,  10% of the original data, and the Training Set is about 81% of the  Original?

How does the sampling  work? Why is it only the original and validation that get sampled and  not the training set? Most importantly, as this is what my mentor  specifically requested, if I display a graph of the Validation Set, will  it display both Negative and Positive Links/Edges?"

I have dealt with depression for most of my life, which has a lot to do with this. I'm in my last internship at a big N, and I have felt exhausted this entire time, even though I am taking time to do self care(working out, eating well, etc). I didn't notice how much the time off helped until I had a family emergency and I didn't work for 4 days. After that I felt like I could focus for a bit. I have tried the pomodoro technique as well, but I generally don't have the energy to keep working sustainably. This wasn't the case last summer where I was working at a startup and could program 8-11 hours a day without a problem. 

I think that a good way to get around this is to just work 4 days a week instead, but I am not sure. Any suggestions?"

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in life, and looking for a potential path/admission chances, etc.

I am a bit vague on details for identity purposes :)

**Goal:** Potentially get an MBA

**Background**

23F

**Education**

Undergrad: R1 University, Physics, GPA: 2.86

* I had a lot of family health issues around this time, and I could not keep my focus on school. Somehow, my extensive research background impressed my graduate school, and I got in (see below)

Graduate (MS, present): R1 University (different from undergrad), Physics, GPA: 4.0

* This is my current GPA, I am expected to graduate next May. Not too many classes, mostly master thesis work now.
* Won a research fellowship to cover tuition, worked with NASA for a semester as well

**Other**

* my research work is very computational, all of my previous internships in UG and MS  were research based
* I run a pretty successful Etsy shop selling my artwork and other handcrafted goods, with over \~800 sales after 1.5 years (not sure if this is useful for application purposes)
* minor experience with policy advocacy for STEM

**Scores**

GRE: 335 

* perfect quant score

GMAT (practice): 750

* I had a lot of alone time during the peak of COVID, somehow managed to pull this off. I am waiting to take the actual exam.

**Story**

When I started my masters, I knew I loved physics but I wasn't sure if I wanted to go into academia. Industry was also an option, but then I realized I enjoyed managing and working with people. I decided I wanted to have an administrative STEM job, or go into the investment management industry for technology and STEM. In today's age where private corporations (e.g. SpaceX) are beginning pop up rapidly over government-funded institutions, I realized there was a lot of room for administrative roles for people who can understand the scientists but handle the business/finance end. This is where I want to go.  

**Goal**

As you can see, I am a bit all over the place in what I want to do. For the longest time, my goal was physics PhD--&gt; academia. Now, I am in a little crisis. There are also three things I think are holding me back right now:

* a more curated story (I need to find exactly WHAT my long term job goal is)
* my undergraduate GPA
* lack of work experience

I am graduating in May, which means now is the time to apply to jobs to get the crucial experience if I ever want to get into selective programs. I am wondering what would be my best options after I graduate to give me the best chance to get into the best schools possible? MIT Sloan (I know, a huge reach) seemed incredibly attractive due to their flexible elective and STEM-infused program, and is probably my top choice. Yale and Northwestern also have some STEM-MBA-type programs that are also peaking my interest. 

Do you think that, with the right experience, I would have a shot at these schools? I am aware that UG GPA is a big deal, but I was hopefully able to prove my true abilities in graduate school."

I'm a materials science masters student graduating in December, got my undergrad in Chemical Engineering. I'm interested in actually becoming a quantitative trader/developer, and don't know how to break in. I've always assumed I'd like core engineering better, but I recently discovered this field like in March and am super interested in breaking in.

I have a lot of Python experience with all the scientific packages (numpy, scipy, tensorflow, pandas etc), like 8 years worth and one of my masters projects was actually building a Neural Net model to predict spectra with a minimal amount of data for live monitoring of a process. I also have Java experience, but at more of a hobbyist level. I've also had 3 engineering internships, all of them more data oriented but still at engineering companies (think Intel/TSMC/Samsung). I'm pretty good with stats (did a whole class in molecular simulations and math of machine learning and I've applied it for my lab/industry) and am actually learning more advanced stats right now.

I was wondering what I should do to break into quant finance, particularly this late, or if its even likely to get interviews given my lack of finance internships.  My main question is what should I do/focus on to get interviews and land a quant developer/trading job?

Thanks!"

I’m worried now that I am not nearly prepared enough for a career in this industry when I graduate, both in general knowledge and experience. 

Given how things are going in my city, the chances of an internship before I graduate are slim. I’m thinking I’ll either have to do grad school or take a more local, less specialized job. I’m concerned that I will lose hireability in larger companies/ FAANG type/ higher paying positions after spending a year or so with the less specialized job for experience. Not sure if these fears are baseless, but switching majors so last second has brought about a constant wave of anxiety.

5. National Merit Semifinalist: for scoring 1510 out of 1520 on PSAT

**Letters of Recommendation**

Physics Teacher: let me read what she wrote, fairly generic but still very strong, 8/10

English Teacher/Philosophy Club Sponsor: also let me read, *very* strong and specifically talked about my achievements and interests in literature/philosophy, 10/10

Robotics Mentor: asked him to speak specifically about my leadership abilities and commitments to community service, did not read it myself but I'm confident he wrote a very complimentary letter, 8-9/10

**Interviews**

Only had interviews for HYPS: H+P were my first two interviews, I didn't really vibe with the interviewers (they were both very straight white guys lol) and I felt that they dominated much of the conversation and that I wasn't really ""being myself""; Y+S interviews both went really well, Y interviewer was an English major and we were able to talk about literature and such endlessly and really got along well, S interviewer was an incredibly intelligent PhD and our conversation covered economics, public policy, literature, and my involvement with community service.

**Essays**

I think that my essays were overall quite strong and a very important factor in my success. My common app was about traits I learned from each of my parents and how I adopted and applied towards community service through robotics and advocacy and towards learning about literature and philosophy. I feel like this was my weakest essay, mainly because my writing abilities improved significantly throughout the process. I spent a huge amount of time working on all of my essays and was very satisfied with most of them. I also used the Additional Information essay to talk about my role on the robotics team, as I felt that it merited clarification, specifically focusing on tangible and measurable achievement (money raised, people impacted, etc).

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* Yale (likely letter) (committed - Boola Boola!)
* Stanford
* UChicago (waitlist -&gt; accept)
* Columbia (likely letter)
* WashU
* Pomona
* Vanderbilt
* UCLA
* UC Berkeley
* UT Austin (Plan II)

*Waitlists:*

* Harvard (REA -&gt; Deferred -&gt; Waitlist Offer -&gt; did not accept spot on waitlist)

*Rejections:*

* Princeton

**Reflection**

While my ethnicity probably did significantly help me get into these schools, I don't think it was the most important element in my application. It's important to note that most URM applicants, even at my academic level, don't get into hyper-competitive schools. I think more important were my essays and how I ""presented"" myself overall. Throughout my application, I tried to convey a specific narrative about myself to the AOs: that I am an ethnically and academically diverse student, committed to social and political advocacy, and passionate about literature, philosophy, and the humanities at large.

I think the college application process is a wonderful opportunity for students to take the time to reflect on their interests, passions, and experiences. I learned a lot about myself by writing these essays; I encourage others to try to do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

i just finished my 3rd year Maschine engineering (out of 4years)

since the quarantine began, i have seriously improved my German which stands now at A2-B1. A couple of months ago i decided to start learning coding(Python/data science/maschine learning) but delayed it. because İ wanted to finish learning German first(goal is B1-B2).

&amp;#x200B;

 but lately i am thinking this remaining 2 months of summer might be all the free time i got to learn any thing of value that is not being tought in my curriculum

on the other hand i am gonna be having an online semster course in italy(but not going to italy for obvious reasons)fully online... which most likely will leave my upcoming first semester with a relatively bigger free time to learn stuff on the side because i will only be learning three subjects online from italy(9-12 credits per subject)

&amp;#x200B;

after that comes my last semester in which we are expected to do an internship at a company.which i would assume would not leave me with a lot of time for my self.

that leaves me with the option of this summer and the summer after i graduate.after which i am expected to go back to my own country.which is less developed and wouldnt have the that access to resources as i have now.if i went back to my country

&amp;#x200B;

so my question is ,is it even realistic to try to learn one or more of Python/data science/maschine learning?

should i wait a couple of months and risk never having a free time again in favor of having 100% focus or start now and try to manage both at the same time"

Anyway, when our parents come home, we are usually finished with our work, (around 5) and basically bored, and this is the time that I usually exercise and do other stuff. By the time I am finished with everything, it’s usually 6PM, we eat dinner, then 6:30. My siblings usually spend the rest of the day in their rooms doing things after dinner is over, (IDK what), so I am just left all alone with my Mom, but she usually watches a movie or is on her phone watching something, so everybody is relaxing. 

This the ideal time for me to hop on my PC and go play with friends, but my parents won’t allow me. They only let me get on at 9PM and then I have to be off by 11PM, and sometimes that time gets cut short because my parents want me to watch movies or hang out with them, because my dad works really late, so that’s when he gets home. It does annoy me though, because my parents always interrupt my time, and my siblings get to stay in their rooms ALL DAY. But even though I paid for my PC, the monitor, and everything in that setup, they still put time limits and get mad when I try to argue about why they get to put restrictions on something with my OWN money. 

I try to ask them to let me do whatever I want when I finish all my work for the day, so that way I can at least spend time with my friends and then spend time with my family at night, but they always say stuff like, “You don’t need to be playing that game all the time”, and when I say that I barely even play, they say stuff like, “Oh so now you are talking back to me?”, and I never get to fairly reason with them. And it’s not like they have a thing against everything I do that’s not “productive”, it’s just gaming, because I can mindlessly binge a whole Netflix series for 6-7 hours and my parents wouldn’t say anything, but when I’m on the game at  11:07, they get mad and ground me for a week. (I’m not kidding they actually took away my PC for a week). 

I’m not asking for sympathy or anything, I just want to know how to approach my parents with this topic, and be able to reason with them fairly without them getting mad."
hvdpdq,3,2020-07-21,Junior Development Job in Germany,smiring,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hvdpdq/junior_development_job_in_germany/,"Hello Guys,

I graduated in computer science (master) with a final grade of 1.3 (3.7 gpa) this march. During my studies I had an six month internship as an software engineer at the world largest ecommerce company. Before my master degree I was already employed as an software engineer for 2.5 years. Besides my professional and educational background I have always been exploring different technologies and domains in personal projects, wrote bots, games, a small os kernel etc. I am not the most social person, but I am definetly not weird and have a normal appearence.

I have been on job search for four months now and I am not getting the response I am hoping for, and frankly I am running out of ideas.

Here is what I have been doing:

- searching and applying for interesting startups
- applying to well known international companies
- applying for companies on the big career websites/platforms (stepstone, indeed, monster)

I am applying for (junior) development jobs C/C++, python and Java (I have experience in all of those languages), as well as Data Sciene/Machine Learning Engineer positions (this was the main focus in my master).

Things I have noticed about the jobs:
- junior positions are very scarce
- 90% positions are web dev jobs
- junior data science/machine learning jobs are non existent
- a big portion of jobs are software consulting firms that feel a bit shady
- most jobs have some very specific requirements and required experience
- there is a great misalignment between required experience and the skill set of what a experienced graduate might have
- startups are usually not hiring juniors at all

After applying, what happens is:
- majority is basically no answer
- some give you a direct rejection
- very few directly send you a code test without ever personally talk to you
- or you get an actual interview

Given that junior job ads are scarce, I actually end up with very few interviews, even if I have been continously lowering my bar on what companies I am applying for. 

Noboby seems to be willing to hire a smart person with some experience if he/she is not 100% proficient in their whole tech stack, which in my experience is always learnable within a few weeks.

What is your experience? Am I doing something obviously wrong? What are ways you get in touch wirh companies? How do you find companies?"

hve8t9,1,2020-07-21,How to deal with impostor syndrome when it's hurting my career?,rihannaluna,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hve8t9/how_to_deal_with_impostor_syndrome_when_its/,"I am a recent college graduate who just started her first ""real"" job as a software engineer at aerospace &amp; defense company. At 21 years old, I make over 100K and work on crazy, important, challenging code. I have been feeling extremely undeserving of this and like it is just my privilege and luck, and not my intelligence or experiences, that have allowed me to get to this point.

Some background on my accomplishments:

\-I've been smart for as long as I can remember. As a child, I was put in gifted programs, advanced classes, etc.

\-I went to an elite, private university where I studied both Computer Science and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies. I ended with a 3.7 GPA.

\-I have an IQ of 166.

\-I have published a 25-page paper in a pretty impressive academic journal (ACM TOCS) on computer systems for which I did research using a grant from the National Science Foundation. I was the head undergraduate researcher on the team, despite being the only female.

\-I have had multiple internships with various software companies and startups. I've been TAs for two different courses (one of which was one of the most advanced courses at the school).

\-I received multiple job offers for full-time and was able to take my pick of really whatever I wanted. Where I work now very clearly wanted me to work for them. They flew me down to their headquarters (which was very far from me), put me up in a luxury hotel for 2 nights with any accommodations/food I could desire, took me on a tour of their headquarters, and gave me offers for three different locations. No one else I know of working for this company has had that experience aside from those who were there with me.

\-I had to go through many rounds of technical interviews to get jobs. Of course, I didn't do well on all of them. But I did well on most of them, which is how I got offers.

Reasons why I think my accomplishments aren't good enough:

\-I was smart as a child naturally, but that is not enough to mean that I am still smart. Am I one of those adults who is stuck on their childhood accomplishments? Was I over-glorified as a child and am now cocky about it?

\-I only ended college with a high GPA because Gender Studies is really easy and boosted it. I got mostly As in those classes so balancing a 4.0 Gender GPA with a 3.4 CS GPA is how I ended up with a 3.7.

\-I took that IQ test when I was in like elementary school. How is it still valid? Is it still valid?

\-I have only been given impressive positions because I am a female and they needed diversity.

\-The technical interviews were insanely easy. There were things I learned in my first semester of college. I was only asked like 2 questions that went beyond freshman year knowledge. Does this mean I am smart or that the questions were just easy?

\-Most importantly: I kind of glided by in college. I feel like I didn't put that much work into my assignments and took the easy way out. If there was a group project where there was a coding section and a writing section, I always did the writing. If there was an insignificant homework that would take me hours but wouldn't impact my grade, I didn't do it. If my friends had an uncreative assignment from a previous semester, I would base my ideas off of theirs (I did not often completely copy it but I definitely used their ideas). I never went to office hours. I took the easiest classes that I could (this doesn't mean all of my classes were easy- there were hard requirements. I just took easy electives). I never understood things more deeply than I needed to. I studied off of friends' old exams. I did everything as quickly as possible. I didn't do readings that I didn't have to do. I waited until the night before an exam to study. I never put my full effort into learning because I wanted to spend my time in college enjoying it, which I do not regret (college was the best four years of my life and I wouldn't change a thing). And the amount of work that I would have to do in order to really do what was asked of me would have meant that there was no time to enjoy myself. Did I not learn enough because of this? Am I giving myself less credit than I deserve? Clearly I still know some things, but do I know enough?

Some background on where I think my impostor syndrome comes from:

\-I grew up very wealthy. My family never had to worry about money, both of my parents worked on Wall Street and are incredibly smart, and I was able to afford any opportunity I could desire. I am very thankful for this, but sometimes it leads me to believe that it is just my privilege that has caused my success. I acknowledge that there are often cycles of privilege in which those who can afford good education, tutoring, school supplies, mental health care, basic needs, etc. and don't need to work or deal with family drama are more successful in the long run. I sometimes think that my success is just because of my privilege. I know that part of it definitely is, but I don't think it all is. Right?

\-I am a woman in a field dominated by men. I have always been the only woman in the room at every job I've ever had that relates to my field. I am often assigned to the more creative or easier tasks on first glance because that's what people assume I'm good at, seemingly because of my gender. People also often explain things to me that I already know and understand. And people are always shocked by what I do.

\-I'm also like relatively pretty and normal- I was in a sorority in college, I partied, I had lots of friends. Outside of computer science, my interests are not particularly nerdy. I don't really look or act like a typical software engineer, so I don't really feel like I am one.

\-I've struggled a lot with my mental health. I have depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADHD and was anorexic for most of my teenage life. They are all under control now but there are some lingering difficulties from those times.

\-I was in an extremely abusive relationship for my many of formative years. He was not only physically and sexually abusive, but also mentally abusive. He would regularly tell me that I wasn't as smart as I believed I am, that I was lucky he loved me, etc. This made me doubt a lot of the things I was confident about.

My issue:

I'm not sure if I'm really an impostor or if I just have impostor syndrome. But these thoughts are making work difficult. I am pretty confused and feel like no one has really told me what I'm supposed to be doing. And I am so afraid to ask questions that seem dumb. So I just don't ask questions and try to figure things out on my own. That gets pretty discouraging and I become unmotivated quickly. This kind of thing used to happen in my math classes in high school as I was in class with juniors as a freshman. So I never asked questions when I was confused because I didn't want to seem dumb but then all of my questions would go unanswered and I would fall behind. I don't want this to happen to me again at work because the repercussions are much more serious. I could jeopardize my job by falling behind (which is something I really do not want to do when the job market is so terrible). I could also jeopardize lives if I mess up because I work on an aircraft defense mechanism. The code I'm editing is when lethality does not equal zero (aka I write the code for what happens if you are at risk of being killed). That's pretty serious.

Please help:

Am I an impostor or not? How do I deal with this? How do I stay motivated when I feel like I'm going to be fired at any minute (this is not possible because I don't even have real tasks yet)? How do I ask questions without feeling like everyone is going to judge me for having them? Who can I talk to about this at work?"
hveb5d,1,2020-07-21,Suggestions for small and unique projects?,DisgorgeVEVO,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/hveb5d/suggestions_for_small_and_unique_projects/,"Background on me, feel free to skip; I learned programming in high school, making games and applications in C# and Python. I’m now a senior in college where we most do Java applications with the occasional C++ or something random. In my personal projects I focus on websites with and emphasis on vanilla JS (I use bootstrap just because it makes life easier). Right now I’m doing an internship with Ruby in Rails (which I’m awful at but it’s still fun). 

Anyway, I’d love some small projects that I can spend a few days on that are another website, calculator, etc. I made a discord bot  using discord.py recently and that was a ton of fun. Anything similar? As in, it’s mostly programming based but not one of the normal things you would do. 


Anything cool project idea? I’ve thought about doing a William Osman-esk robot but I’m worried I’d spend too long working on hardware problem (also don’t what to do). I’ve considered following a short Unity course and making a game too. Just something different. 

It’s pretty important that it’s not terribly long. I don’t need another project I spend a month on and then never touch again lol. The language isn’t that important, I’d be happy adding a new language to my GitHub, plus school has gotten me use to jumping around a ton."

This year, my mother insisted that it was a special occasion, being an old relative's hundredth birthday.

Now, to be honest, I'm not really close with that person so I don't truly care much about her birthday. I am currently working all day long (I have an internship, online due to coronavirus) and have no holidays until possibly February 2021 and I don't feel like dealing with my family in the evenings in a space that is not the usual one, nor my crazy grandmother, nor with the family outings on weekends. I won't have my own room there so even to sleep I wouldn't be alone.

Also I know what it's like to live on my own, and having been confined with them since March, I kinda miss it. I just want a little space, to cook for myself, learn my languages and not feeling guilty for staying in my room.

Since I am an adult, my mother asked me some time ago if I wanted to come with and I said ""I don't really know"" at first because I knew she wouldn't like it. I finally told her this evening, she said ""I know, X told me. I told you to tell me as soon as you had an idea."", I answered that I didn't dare to tell her and she just said ""you're an adult, you do whatever you want."" but she isn't too happy about it. 

So now I feel like an ungrateful selfish \*sshole. Anyway, should I stand my ground since she asked me and I just gave a honest answer ?  or should I take her feelings into account ?"

I recently signed an offer at the end of my internship to join one of the MBB’s after I graduate. I found out that the same company has given out a full-time offer to a guy who has previously sexually harassed me (aggressive groping, not stopping when asked to, stalking). Not only that, but I’ve had multiple university companions who’ve had very similar experiences with him. 

Naturally, I’m disgusted with the thought of having to work in the same company as this guy. In addition, his tendencies for harassment are pretty well-known in MBB’s biggest target school and major in my city (we study the same subject in the same university in Europe).

What are my options here? Who should I try to talk about this at my MBB if anyone?"
hvfxcz,22,2020-07-21,Message from Dean Hummels (Krannert Dean) regarding fall courses,oxflux,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/hvfxcz/message_from_dean_hummels_krannert_dean_regarding/,"I recognize that the below is mainly intended for Krannert students or those taking Krannert courses, but it may provide some insight into how the other colleges will be adapting courses to be in accordance with the Protect Purdue plan.

&gt;To:  Krannert Undergraduate Students
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Subject: What to expect for Fall 2020 courses
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Most of you have let us know that you want to be on campus.  And we are eager for your return.  But campus this fall will be different from what you have experienced to this point in your pursuit of your Purdue degree.  The reason is that we have pledged to keep our students, staff and faculty as safe as possible without going completely remote.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In the next couple of days, you will have your final course schedules for the Fall Semester and most contain some online course offerings.   Why is that?  To protect the health of high-risk instructors, some are teaching with an online format only.  Other faculty teach such large numbers of students, it is not feasible to meet social distancing requirements while being in a classroom.  These courses are available in online format only.  Finally, it was necessary to reserve some teaching capacity to serve students who have opted for a fully online semester. Subject to these constraints our objective is to provide you with the best, and most interactive, residential experience we can.  Of the 81 distinct undergraduate courses offered by Krannert this fall, only seven are totally online.  Of the 190 different sections of Krannert courses, only 35 sections are offered online.   
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For the courses and sections offered with a residential format, requirements for social distancing in the classroom may not allow all students in a class to physically meet for every class session.  You may be expected to come to class for every scheduled session.  But you also might find that you complete course assignments online on some days and attend class to participate in discussion, teamwork, or case analysis on alternate days.  An example is a course with a TTH power hour schedule. Students may be alphabetically assigned to groups such that half of students come to class on Tuesday and the other half attends in person on Thursday. On the days when you are not meeting in person, you may be completing assignments online or preparing for the upcoming in-person session with readings or case analysis.   Details will be specific to each course and communicated to you by individual faculty.  These pedagogical decisions will be based on the unique nature of that course and our faculty’s best judgement about how to maximize your learning experience.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, some of you will find that your final course schedule includes more online courses than you desired, particularly when taking courses across campus.  We encourage you to work with your academic advisor to adjust your schedule to get to something that feels more comfortable for you.   All Krannert majors include multiple UCC choices and many general elective courses.  While an initial choice may be only available online, other options will be available to meet in the classroom.   Be creative, be patient and together we can create the schedule that works best for you.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What about the rest of your campus experience?   Faculty are eager to meet with you in office hours to assist your learning.  We have asked them to expand their availability to students this term, but in general these meetings will occur via Zoom.   Student clubs will be active, and are preparing now with the help of Purdue Student Government to maximize the student experience while hewing to the tenants of the Protect Purdue Pledge.   Our case competition community will run a robust lineup of competitions complete with expanded alumni mentoring.   The Krannert Professional Development Center has been working hard to provide expanded access to career coaching.  We anticipate students will find it even easier to connect with great companies for internships and full time positions via our highly effective Virtual Career Fairs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The COVID world requires us all to be resilient in the face of adversity and we have asked our instructors to prepare resilient courses.  These courses will remain highly effective if faculty become ill and someone else needs to take over, if a student needs to take time away from the classroom, or even if we see a repeat of Spring 2020.  All of this design is oriented around the goal of keeping our students, faculty, and staff safe while providing the richest possible residential experience.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Let us know if you have questions or concerns.  We are ready to listen and work with you to make your Fall 2020 semester the very best that it can be.  
&gt;
&gt;Boiler Up!

I have some professional technical experience through an internship but plan to pursue product or project management. 

 I don’t want to go a full technical route (I will if there’s no other viable options though) and regret not going for a PM internship when I had the chance. Now it’s almost time to start applying to jobs and I’m divided on what I should pursue. 

There’s 3 options I’m considering: 
1) Pursue APM programs. These are incredibly competitive though and considering I don’t have previous PM experience I don’t have high hopes for this
2) Go for a PM internship which might or might not lead to a full time offer (nothing on hand I would have to apply to positions now) 
3) Forget about PM for now and pursue SE/Dev-Ops roles. 

Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated!"

At face value, I think the decision is obvious: take the security role! But I have a few concerns that I want to address before I feel comfortable signing any offer:

1. My prior industry experience has been in generalist software engineering roles. My strengths lie in crypto (mostly through graduate level classes), pentesting (through war games), and malware analysis/reversing/exploit development (through personal projects). The AppSec role is mostly doing web app security, which is an area within security where I'm weakest but certainly not incompetent. I'm terrified that I'll show up to work and be way out of my depth, although I don't doubt my ability to learn quickly on the job.
2. The company is big but the application security engineering team is quite small, &lt;5 people. Unfortunately I get the impression that this company does not place a big emphasis on security of their product as they are heavily focused on growth right now, and so security engineers are perceived as barriers which can slow down their development cycle.
3. What happens if I want to pivot out of the security engineering role and move towards more general backend SWE roles? At this point, my only experience with non-security SWE work will have been my 3 internships. I fear that after 2-3 years in a security role , my internships will become much less relevant to getting a SWE interview. Furthermore, I fear that as a security engineer in a specialized role I'll lose out on knowledge of industry best-practices that SWEs typically pick up in their positions.
4. There seems to be a lot of variation between security roles at tech companies. I've seen ""Information Security Analyst"" roles which seem to be ""checkbox compliance"" roles which require little technical legwork, and I've also seen ""IT Security"" type jobs. I am trying to avoid like the plague. I'm mostly interested in ""Application Security Engineer"" and ""Software Engineer in Security"" roles; but at this point, it's unclear to me that there is a difference between the two. Is there any difference?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."

New to the sub here but I do follow /r/netsec and think I fell into a potential Cyber Security issue. I am going to keep this anonymized as possible since it's still ongoing but I was doing some work at my internship (I'm a Veteran with 15+ years of Net/Sys/Cyber experience) and after disconnecting from my VPN I realized I was able to ping/port scan/nmap another private subnet from my home network without being connected to a VPN. I restarted my computer and router several times to see if it was a fluke and contacted my colleagues to see if they owned any of the subnets and low and behold none of them said it was them. I contacted my ISP and on the first call they hung up on me. The second call resulted in being transferred to the security department. Three and a half hours later after e-mail documentation of NMAP/IP Scan/misc logs and I am still able to ping the private network across the internet. 

They are a major ISP and I have contacted their Security team as well as their social media team. Not sure where to go next but obviously the vulnerability is still exposed. 

I am being ambiguous out of caution but I don't know how to contact anyone higher or if I will even be able to find out the cause of a private subnet leaking out to the public internet. This seems ridiculous for such a large company and I'm dismayed that the first person I contacted straight up hung up on me.

Thoughts?"

I currently attend a non-ivy state university and started my senior year courses this summer.

I am already done with my most important courses like Data Structures &amp; Algorithms and OOP and I am mostly left with my advanced level math classes.

I pick this degree for CS courses and really don't care about Linear Algebra, Diff Eq, or Calculus III and they are very challenging for me as well.

At this point, I rather work on my portfolio and make some cool projects in order to get SoftDev internship in my last summer instead of studying math all day all night to make an A/B on these courses.

My current GPA is 3.76 and if I maintain it, I can graduate my CS degree with High Honors. If I say f\* it and just get C's and D's, lowest my GPA can drop is 3.2 since I have just 2 semesters left

My question is how much employers care about graduating with an honors degree if they care any, or it is just better for me to focus on my projects and portfolio to impress recruiters and study ""Cracking the coding interview"" instead?"

Hi Everyone,

I see people in my domain getting laid off and struggling to find tech jobs due to a lack of coding experience or failing in technical interviews.

The situation is not good for college students too especially 2nd or 3rd-year students looking for an internship.

So, I have decided to help people prepare in their coding interviews by practicing lots of questions while covering the basics.

What to expect -&gt; We will start with the basic data structures and common algorithms first to prepare a base and then later take on good challenging questions.

About me -&gt; Attend the session and judge my skillset. Don't want to brag about myself. I have taught some people in my college days and they did switch from Service-based to product-based companies.

I can promise that if you follow things sincerely and have a good amount of patience and practice, you will be able to crack at least Tier 2 product based company interviews. (I won't say Google and Facebook as they require much more than that)

Note -&gt; had this idea in my mind for a long time but seeing a similar post on Reddit made me take any action on the thought.

Please DM for more details."

I don't know what to do.",SoftballNDrawing,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hvuoe2/im_grasping_at_straws_my_school_wont_let_me_come/," 

Hey all,

I'm struggling right now. I admit, I am not fluent in understanding finances and loans but I don't spend extra money on anything and only buy things after considering all options. Thus, why I am asking for advice here.

I live in Chicago, IL., and am a 21-year-old female trying to pursue a computer science bachelor's degree.

*What's happened so far--*

**FALL/WINTER 2019:**

* I had a surprise visit to the hospital in September 2019. I made a post on Reddit that someone saw as concerning, so they called the police. Long story short, ended up in the hospital against my will and had no way of catching up with school.
* I took medical leave from school, and newly started therapy and some new medications. Luckily still had insurance from school. Did not get any refund despite only attending 2-3 weeks.
* Living off of savings, I was just trying to get mentally healthy again. Also, started practicing drawing.

**SPRING 2020:**

* In Jan 2020, I moved out with my boyfriend to get out of an unhealthy living arrangement with my parents. He pays the rent while I try to get my shit together. I do most of the housework and cooking while he earns money.
* early March 2020: Landed a job in loan processing (I know, ironic since I still know nothing about loans, I am a computer science major)
* A week later, COVID-19 makes me work from home after only a week of training. They end up putting my job on hold for a week, then hiring me back. They fired my boss.
* After another month, before the quarantine in Illinois loosened up, they told me I had to come in or they were letting me go. I needed the money, but I can't put my boyfriend and myself at risk. Health is more important, so I was let go.
* I try to get onto unemployment, but they were refusing me, and they were going to use my income from when I worked retail a year previously. (I would get 68/week)

**SUMMER 2020:**

* I begin trying to sell art commissions to earn money. I managed to sell one for 35 dollars, which got my hopes up. Still trying to sell art commissions now.
* I wrote to my school to become reinstated. I got them the proper health documentation but I still had money that I owed the school.
* They told me they can put it on an institutional loan but that I still won't be allowed to reinstate and register for classes until the debt is fully paid off.
* Of course, to kick me when I am down, my phone bricks itself. I have no way to make phone calls.

**FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**

* In the bank: $1,548.94
* Ambulance Bill (In collections): \~$1200
* Hospital Bill (In collections): \~$750 (Paid off 4,000 of it)
* School Debt: $2,943.92
* 2019 Late Tax fee (In collections): \~$200.00
* I have no credit card debt.
* Credit Score: 679-695

*School insurance runs out by the end of this summer. I will have no insurance to help me with meds.*

**Health** **costs w/o insurance:**

* Medications (For Depression, anxiety, insomnia/nightmares, and ADHD) (Sertraline, Trazadone, Vyvanse) - $510.78/month
* per individual session or group session: $30-$150/week

**Education I have:**

* Associates in Engineering Science (2 years college) and a
* QA software internship from the summer of 2019.

I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this."

I likely will not know until after Fall 2020 semester, however, I would like to start applying to jobs/internships now. 

However, I am not sure how to go about this. If my graduation is delayed, I would like to be applying to summer 2021 internships. But if my graduation is not delayed, I should be applying to new grad roles. 

I was thinking about applying to both roles, however, I am not sure how this is perceived at most companies. I am particularly interested in the big tech companies. I suspect this is not something they would like. Honestly, I have to look out for myself though so I am thinking about sending two applications, but under 2 different email addresses. 

The problem is I do not know if this is enough to give me a unique identity for application purposes at some companies. I know some simply use email addresses, but I can certainly see others being more advanced and my parse my application for my github username. Since I cannot simply make a new github with all my other's history, this may be an issue. 

How should I go about this? Do companies like those in FAANG only use your email address, or do they use your github? 

Now, I realize things my get a little more hairy when I get further into the interview process, so my plan would be to withdraw from the other application if I am far into the interview process of one (new grad or intern)."

hvytr3,10,2020-07-22,Can this accommodate my work schedule?,2NT4RK,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/hvytr3/can_this_accommodate_my_work_schedule/,"Hi all! I was just admitted for the Fall 2020 quarter and am super excited to begin my career switch!

I have never taken online classes before and am curious about how flexible the format is in terms lectures, homework, and exams. I know the program is geared towards adults working full time jobs, though I do not work a typical 9-5 schedule. I'm currently an overnight pharmacist working 7 on / 7 off, meaning I work 70 hours one week and am free the next. I was thinking that I'd dedicate my free weeks to catch up, get ahead on coursework, and work on side projects, as I basically have no free time to do so during my work weeks (might have some downtime at work on weekends but that's about it). But I don't know how accommodating the classes are for this type of schedule. I'd imagine that lectures are recorded, but will there ever be a time where homework is assigned and due that same week, or scheduled times I must sit for proctored exams that only take place over a week-long period?

Then there's the question of how manageable the coursework is. Coming from pharmacy, I have minimal background in programming (took AP Computer Science in high school, currently brushing up with Harvard's CS50x, made a few small games/websites when I was younger), though I tend to do very well in school and I do consider myself a fast and passionate learner when it comes to coding.

My goal is to complete the program in 2 years and hopefully land an internship next summer, and by that time I will have quit my current job for sure in order to dedicate myself 100% to this career change. I hate my current job and am fortunate enough to be in a position where I am able to quit right now if I really wanted to (living with parents, debt-free, no kids / financial obligations, sizable savings etc), but I figured I'd keep working as a source of side income for as long as I am able to. But I would absolutely be willing to try reducing my work hours or outright quit if necessary for this program.

Anyone else working an atypical schedule that can weigh in?"

I'm an incoming visiting researcher at Berkeley (specifically [SCET](https://scet.berkeley.edu/) to work on an AI project). I'm also an advisor at a hardware food tech startup where we're applying to [Berkeley's SkyDeck accelerator](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/).

Has anyone here been through the program (ideally as part of the [~20 startups in the cohort](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/program/#ch-p), which is what we're aiming for)? Would you please have a few min to get on a call?

I've been through Techstars NYC previously, so very familiar with startups and the accelerator model. SkyDeck seems like an extended version of Techstars/YC (6 months vs 3), and I have a few specific questions about the program.

If you haven't been part of SkyDeck, I'm still curious-- do you hear about SkyDeck or their startups often around campus? Does SkyDeck have a good rep within Berkeley such that positions / internships at SkyDeck companies attract good talent from Berkeley?

Thank you!"

hw3qi6,8,2020-07-22,Stuck in internship,throwaway648601,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/hw3qi6/stuck_in_internship/,"I’m nearing the end of my virtual internship, but I wanted to rant about how it’s been going so far. I got the internship months ago and was thrilled that I would have something on my resume. I expected to be doing software related stuff as the only technical skill I have is coding and that was my leverage during the interview. But once I started the internship, I realized that I wouldn’t need to know just coding, but also about defense technologies that I had never learned before. I become lost VERY QUICKLY. The first couple of weeks I frantically tried to learn as much as I could, but then I plateaued after realizing that there was no way I’d ever learn it all. I haven’t taken classes on the related topics before either, so as you can imagine I’ve been pretty useless. I’ve written a couple of lines of code, but the majority of my summer has just been learning the fundamentals to even start to understand what my team is working on. I just feel so stupid during the meetings and wished they had never hired me in the first place!! I could have done something else with my time and they could have hired someone more qualified. I’m upset that I’m coming away from this internship having learned nothing and didn’t get to expand on the skills I already had. It’s been feeling like drinking from a firehose. I’m embarrassed that I have nothing to contribute and that I haven’t gained anything from the internship. I’m considering ending the internship early (in two weeks), would this be unprofessional? I already reported that I would end late August, but considering how things are going it would probably be best to end earlier. Any advice or stories you guys have to share would be really helpful! Just feeling really stuck and confused right now."
hw44qi,1,2020-07-22,How can I improve my resume and improve my outlook for getting an international job?,WENDYSTHO,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hw44qi/how_can_i_improve_my_resume_and_improve_my/,"Hey guys. I’m planning on going back to school and finishing my degree in International Business. I have a story, and history that had gotten me to where I am now, in a not so impressive spot. However, I’ve felt the kick in the butt to make something of myself, and am looking for outsider perspectives and advice on how to go up. May be a bit of a word jumble as I’ve got quite a bit on my mind. Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and offer a hand, I appreciate it greatly!

I’m 26 years old, and have about 85 credits, am going for an international business degree. Stopped going to school two years ago. Stopped because I was living in a ski town (was actually driving 4 hours twice a week to school for a semester, and then for another semester staying half the week in the school town, the other 2 hours away in the ski town), had a serious relationship that I was trying to make work (I was in this relationship throughout all my time in college), and was not doing well in school and kind of figured School wasn’t for me. 

I’ve been out of the relationship for about a year and a half now, and am really feeling the drive to go back and finish my degree. I’m about 3 semesters away. 
I know it’ll be a grind, having to work and take 5 classes to graduate in 3 semesters, but I am determined to finish. Not having a relationship taking up my time, and especially not living so far away from the university, I think set me up greatly for doing much better this time around. I’ve also had the realization that if I don’t get something  going now, I won’t ever. I’m also excited about my career path; I have a love for foreign culture, especially Latin American culture; I speak Spanish at a c1 level, have traveled extensively throughout South America, have many friends abroad, and love being and immersing myself in foreign culture. My dream job would be living abroad, especially in a spanish-speaking country. Part of my motivation in going back to school is my dream of getting an international job that allows me to travel, and even better, live, in a foreign country. This is why I decided to pursue international business.

Here are some of the doubts I’m having: 
First of all, I’m wondering if “international business” is too general. Looking at internships and jobs that are tied to the field, they are all tied to something more specific, whether it be accounting, marketing, finance, IT, HR, O&amp;D, supply chain, etc. Will simply a degree in ‘international business’ without a more specific focus, be enough to get me a job? 

Also, I know that I’ll need to do an internship. But I don’t have much to put on my resume. My experience working at a nice restaurant in a ski town for 3 years; the fact that I’ve traveled and lived in argentina for six months (for love, did a whole lot of nothing while there), and my Spanish skills. All of those seem pretty trivial.  I want to get an internship, but I don’t have marketing skills, finance, computer, etc. I’m studying general international business.  My gpa is also currently a 2.5, quite low (although I expect I will do much better in school this time around than ever before, and this will go up). 

When I get back, I am planning on joining some clubs at the school, at the very least spanish club, and hopefully some other ones as well. I’m going to look into volunteering (is this a good idea).

Any advice you all can give me? Do I stand a chance? What is my best outlook to go out there and be successful? Thank you again folks!"
hw4ppx,3,2020-07-22,Advice for a Mech Egr w/low GPA trying to get into the Industry,Love-Reign,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/hw4ppx/advice_for_a_mech_egr_wlow_gpa_trying_to_get_into/,"Hello all (this is a cross post), 

I recently graduated as a Mechanical Engineer (December 2018) with a 2.8 GPA for courses taken at UCF (where I graduated from) and a 2.7 GPA overall. 

I made a lot of mistakes along the way trying to figure out the best route for me. I transferred schools 3 times and knew nothing about transfer shock or that your old GPA does NOT cushion you at the new school. Just like that, I went from a 3.7 to a 2.3 and severely damaged my record. By the time I got to my last school, I was far away from home managing a FT job to support myself while being a FT engineering student and I struggled. Not because I didn't know what I was doing but my attention was split. Idk what I was thinking but it's the path I took and I am owning it. 7 years later, I finally graduated! But what do I now?

I wish I had an internship, I wish I had participated in a co-op but reality is, it didn't work out for me. After graduation, I found out I was expecting a baby but I continued to apply for jobs. Throughout my pregnancy I was going to interviews, slowly losing faith and finally I got an opportunity to accept a teaching position. So I try to align myself with things that are STEM related in the meanwhile. 

My goal or hope is to find something where I can get experience in the industry around my day job as a teacher. I'm willing to do anything whether it be a part time job after work and/or on the weekends, flex work, or even work for free.... just to get my feet through the door. I am open to all advice because I understand/feel that I am at a little disadvantage because of my low GPA and lack of on-the-job experience but I'm willing to put in elbow grease.

So far I haven't come across an internship opportunity that doesn't require me to be a current student. What options do I realistically have to achieve this goal? What can I do to start getting experience before getting into industry full time?

Thank you in advance."

In my current position as a Tier II data network engineer most of the work on any given day involves creating tickets for field techs to resolve layer 1 issues, working with users to verify that issues with end devices or servers are not  network related, and basic configs on switches. Occasionally I get to work on more involved issues that are usually not widespread. The most interesting work that I've been doing lately is working on a project to reconfigure  some site routers for DMVPN.  I'm not on the team that normally does projects; though I'm better at the project work than anyone else on that team is.  When the DMVPN project is completed, I will most likely have more downtime than I already do. Quite often, I feel overpaid given the low complexity of most of the work that I do. Does anyone else who was in or knows someone that is in a similar situation? 

On the opposite spectrum, I know someone that worked as a part-time Windows and Linux Systems Admin and made only $13 an hour. He even did some relatively heavy scripting in Bash and Powershell. They're now a security analyst at a large corporation. I made $11 an hour as an entry level part-time desktop tech. They pay gap sounds unfair for the guy that worked as an admin.  For each of us it was our first IT jobs. 

On the bright side of things to contracting firm that I'm with and the networking team (both bosses and coworkers) are very nice compared to when I worked as an intern at Cisco. The corporation I work is in a hiring freeze right now. Though someone senior recently left due to family reasons and there are several other network engineers that will retire within the next 5 years.  If the low complexity work makes up the bulk of what I do for the next year or two, I might consider pursuing a position with a different corporation and contracting firm. Has anyone here made a tough choice to leave a well paid position with a good team to pursue a more skilled position, even if it happens to pay only slightly more?"

For sophomores, they will introduce us into Java which I did a little in high school but I never mastered it. Even in freshman year, I was able to pass the C++ courses without fear of failing but I definitely took a lot more time to complete assignments and exams only to receive decent grades (B/B+). I don't think I'm a bad student, I have the desire to do well, study, and try and get the good grades... but code doesn't always stick in my brain after seeing it for the first time. Meanwhile, some students are finishing our big projects in a few hours while I take a few days.

Now I'm in one of those slumps where I wanna try and catch up a little on Java before classes start but I hardly know C++ very well either, I don't know where to start in brushing up on Java, and I don't know if it'll necessarily be good to know the basics of multiple languages and not be knowledgeable in at least one language completely.

Also, when do you know it's a good time to get into Leetcode. Every CS kid drools over how important Leetcode is to be successful but after looking through some of the problems, i'm not sure I know enough to get started yet...

**TL;DR**  I want to succeed in CS but am overwhelmed by the competition who already have years of experience over me. Does it get better? How long did it take until you felt comfortable in your coding abilities?"

My last 2 jobs have been near extreme luck. They were both minimum wage jobs that would hire anyone they want and just filter out people in the process as both were tech support and had high employee turnover rate. I left the first one has they lied about the working hours and the details of the job, the second let a lot of people go, myself included, before going out of business when Covid hit.

I've been given a lot of viewpoints in the past 3 months of job finding. I've been struggling to find a job that didn't have absurd requirements that I didn't meet. I'm also very limited in what jobs I can do as I currently have an illness that's still being diagnosed that prevents me from moving around too much. Considering current world events as well as my health, I'm absolutely kinda in a bad spot here when it comes to what jobs I can do and what I can't. I might apply for this unpaid internship to get my foot in the door but I don't know if that's the best option.

I'm a software developer. I've been working on projects on github for 4 years now, and I even have my own University Certificate, but not a bachelors degree, and a respectable GPA of 3.0. However, every time I do my daily job search, every single position that exists requires a bachelor's degree, even if it's for a junior position, or some requirement that I cannot meet.

(Canada, small/medium sized city, not Toronto/vancity/Montreal)
First a background of me. I have recently finished a Bachelors in Software Engineering and have been working as a Technical Analyst for the past two years in a government organization within the IT department. My salary is currently around $65k with two years of experience (plus another year of internships within the same company). I am hoping to see if anyone would be able to point me in the right direction. My goal is to reach 100k+ within the next 4-5 years. While I have a bachelors in software engg, I’m not planning to become a developer or programmer as I don’t like pure programming. With my technical analyst experience, I can work up my way to a supervisor or manager position, in which way I would pull 100k+, but that would also take me about 6-7 years though. I could also try my luck getting some certs and applying for database admin jobs (my current job is mostly db) or cloud engineering. Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction? I know for sure I don’t want to be a software engineer (for now at least)/web dev/pure programmer (otherwise I would’ve went to r/cscareerquestions).

Thanks in advance,
Cheers!"

I need advice for how to finish my project on time and retain my sanity. Has anyone else had a similar experience?,Goodbye-Blue-Sky,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/hwhcy0/its_5pm_i_have_the_first_draft_of_my_ma_thesis/,"I struggled immensely with my mental health during quarantine, and my internship took a back seat in my list of priorities. I don't think I did a single bit of work from March until the end of June. I'm finally getting better and feeling healthy again, but I'm majorly stressing out because I have a lot of deadlines coming up and I'm cramming it all into a very short time frame.

Here's the situation:

My internship ends on the 31st of July (Next Friday), and I cannot get an extension. I was supposed to end on the 17th of July, and I've already been granted an extension to the 31st. I even planned a vacation that starts on August 1st with my girlfriend just to light a fire under my ass and not let me waste my summer.

I promised my lab that I'd give them a draft of my thesis tomorrow (Friday, July 24th) and give my final presentation via google hangouts. I've been working pretty diligently this week, ~6-7 hours per day (though I still procrastinated a little bit too much) and I finally finished my analysis last night, but I hardly have any writing done. This morning I managed to complete 4 full pages of writing, but I'm still on my materials and methods section and I also have to make and practice my presentation.

Now, tomorrow isn't my due date, as I still have another week to write before I turn in a final product (July 31st), but I made a promise to my lab group and to myself that I'd have a completed draft ready for tomorrow. If I miss this deadline, I feel it will reflect even more poorly on myself and will seriously hinder the amount of time I have to edit my report. My advisor already doesn't seem to be very happy with me, and has basically given up on me because it took so long for me to even begin making serious progress on my project. Not having a draft ready only makes things worse.

Additionally, I'm a bit sleep deprived from getting less than 6 hours a night the past few nights, and want to prioritize my health since I still have 8 days before my final product is due.

I need some guidance. 

Do I bite the bullet and continue working as much as possible today and potentially pull an all-nighter to finish this? Or should I work for a few more hours and prioritize sleep so that I can give a great presentation tomorrow morning? I'm thinking that option 2 is the way to go, but I know I'm going to be disappointing my advisor and myself by not having this draft completed, and I probably will become even more stressed about the upcoming week because I'll have reduced time for editing. Also, how do I manage my relationship with my advisor during this time period?

tl;dr Due to poor mental health I procrastinated on my internship for months. Now I only have until July 31st to finish my thesis and I cannot get an extension. I promised my lab a draft and to give my final presentation tomorrow, but I haven't started my presentation and I only have 4 pages of writing done. I need help getting through this period.

Thanks for reading!"

It’s turned into something that has consumed me. I did an internship at a church that ended up turning into a cult like organization that manipulated me when I was Young (about 20-21) and I ended up paying them to do the internship. When it was all said and done I was paying them around $300 a month to be “discipled” and go on missions trips. The last five years have been hell and I haven’t been able to get out. 

Basically this church had me convinced that if I worked really hard and got involved then I could get into ministry at the time because I was raised religious and truly believed in Christianity I went with it. At the end of a two year internship it turned out to be nothing and I didn’t get anything out of it and what I learned was not accredited.  After that I went to school and found another dead end as I saw firsthand what the condition of academia in America right now. I’m still in a place where I’ve only narrow down a couple options I’ve had a dream of pursuing a music career for years but because I’ve been tied down to the church and my parents expectations to go to school and my own fears of not being good enough I’ve never pursued it. With the virus and everything going on just as I’m getting out of college right now I am at a place where there’s no jobs left almost I haven’t been able to get a job at fucking Costco or Whole Foods and I have a degree. 

On top of all of this the last 6 months of my life I dated this girl and we were great for each other and she was there for me at a hard time but because I was using drugs and got depressed without admitting it to myself I ended up acting different from who I really am 
And hurting her. She eventually left recently and so now I I am lonely pretty broke and don’t know which way to turn. Like I just honestly don’t know what the right route is anymore. Thoughts on what to do?"

Dave had a lot of redeeming qualities, he is smart, helpful, and kind, but I’ve hit my limit.

Dave has never had a job outside of 6 months working at a grocery store, so his parents have always supported him. His mom buys him a Disneyland pass each year and puts money on his Starbucks card every week.

Dave describes himself as a full-time student, although he’s been going to community college part time for the last 4 years. He sits in Starbucks 5 days a week, sipping expensive drinks and supposedly studying 30-40 hours.

When I ask Dave how his classes are going, he tells me the exams are too easy and he knows more than the professor. He’ll say things like “maybe I should just teach the course next year”.

On the other hand, Dave often complains about how he hates living with his dad. The first few times, I offered to help him look into part-time jobs so he could save to move out. Dave scoffed and laughed this off like the idea was ludicrous. He would talk about how he was stretched too thin with his courseload, and that he really cared about learning the material, he didn’t want to lie and cheat his way through school like his peers who were working students.

This was crappy of him to say; I worked through my bachelor’s and master’s programs. Instead of getting upset, I calmly pointed out that lots of people work through school, myself included, and we’re not all liars and cheaters. I also pointed out that jobs and internships are not an abnormal part of the college experience.

Dave got so upset that he refused to talk to me for nearly a month, then he wrote me a 3 page letter lamenting about how every day is a struggle not to collapse beneath the burdens of his course load AND helping his mom with the weekly grocery shopping AND occasionally helping make dinner.

This was the last straw, and I haven’t spoken to him since. I really hope Dave makes some progress down the road, but I can’t be friends with a balding, nearly middle-aged man who has almost never worked a day in his life and talks down to those who have, while the majority of his time seems to be spent at Disneyland, farmer’s markets, and harassing the baristas at Starbucks.

hwj2v0,0,2020-07-23,Critique my CV. Advice needed for student in BA. Quant. Fin. (Canadian) looking for internships &amp; Top US/EU Grad School,Jonai1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/hwj2v0/critique_my_cv_advice_needed_for_student_in_ba/,"Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking for some direction as a 3rd year (1.5 years left) Mathematical &amp; Computational Finance student at Concordia University. (Program: [http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/mathematical-computational-finance.html](http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/mathematical-computational-finance.html) )

Long story short, initially I was going to choose McGill over Concordia however they did not have a Quant finance program. Three years later and with no relevant work experience I am really keen and getting a little anxious about not having enough relevant work experience by the time I graduate. Whether its anything quant related, or IB/S&amp;T, I really want to get my feet wet. I had a promising internship this summer in a boutique IB in Toronto but that all fell apart due to COVID.

A couple of months ago I was told by an advisor at my university that I should get some certificates/licenses on my CV to add some ""juice"" to buy time until I get more experience. Since then I have become a CFA candidate for Feb 2021, completed my Bloomberg Market Concept Course (BMC), and in the process of WSP. 

Some of the things I have been focussing on this summer

1. Applying for various internships in IB/S&amp;T/ any quant role for Summer 2021.
2. Studying for my CFA
3. **I need advice for this one:** Applying for the KWPMP program. It is very similar to **UBC Sauder PMF.** It is basically a co-op for Capital Markets while studying and managing a portfolio of around $3 million with other students while getting seminars from professionals in the industry. The downside to joining this program is that it would delay my graduation of my bachelor's by 1.5 years. Here is the link for those interested or need more info: [https://www.concordia.ca/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/kenneth-woods-portfolio.html](https://www.concordia.ca/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/kenneth-woods-portfolio.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

For post-undergrad, if I can get into a top Masters program I see myself pursuing an MF or perhaps even an MFE. The decision partially relies on the work experience that I can get because for the last couple of years I haven't had much hands-on work experience. Some of the schools I have been thinking of are Carnegie, Princeton, Berkeley, LSE, Columbia etc.. I know coming from a 'non-target' university will be less advantageous for me but I am very driven and motivated to put in the work for my goals.  (**I'll try to have my full CFA by the time I apply for my Masters, I'd think it would give me a slight edge (of course I would still need to do well on a GMAT)).**

It's understandable in many regards since I am a first year student without any prior experience and only Java as programming language in my CV, and the competition was ruthless. However regardless of how disappointing and frustrating this experience was , I still have to look foward.

I have heard many stories about networking events held in Concordia that aren't exclusive to the Coop institute . I also heard that there are multiple student associations that help you develop projects and meet possible employers.

What are your advices for me ? how should I go about  my internship research from now? In the following year I would like to maximize my chances with projects/networking etc as a non Coop student , if you did go through that route without being in Coop and succeeded your advice would be greatly appreciated!"
hwjiw6,1,2020-07-23,"What are some enjoyable, fulfilling, and intellectually stimulating careers?",Br0nxB0mb3rs,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hwjiw6/what_are_some_enjoyable_fulfilling_and/,"Hey everyone, I'm a 22-year-old college graduate of the University of Maryland. I just graduated back in May with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications and American Studies, and I'm really struggling to pick a career path.

Back in high school, I fell in love with marketing. I loved--and still appreciate--the ability to incorporate creativity into my work. I excelled in my marketing courses and clubs, and had thought that's what I wanted to study in college. I even had two marketing internships in New York City during my summers in college.

While I enjoyed both internships, during my junior year of college I experienced somewhat of an enlightenment: I wanted to find a career that was fulfilling, and would allow me to help people in need. Growing up, I watched my dad stay at a job where he was miserable for close to two decades. He hated what he did and who he did it for, and from a young age I knew that I had to do something I loved. Conversely, my mom is a special education teacher and administrator, and for the most part loves what she does. Virtually everything she says about her career and jobs over the years have been positive.

Anyway, during my senior year of high school (2015-2016), I became intrigued by politics in large part because of my AP Government class--also, how could the 2016 election not captivate you--lol. As time went on, my interest in politics intensified, and I've been following it pretty religiously for a few years now. I don't want to get too political, but I am extremely passionate about prevalent socio-economic issues such as educational inequality, healthcare, income inequality, and so on. Furthermore, I really enjoy reading, and I love writing, having written and published a few political opinion pieces my last semester of college.

At this point, I've narrowed my options down to three career paths: becoming a teacher, a professor, or a lawyer. However, each of the three bring a bunch of questions marks, and it's been increasingly difficult for me to commit to one route and make a decision.

Becoming a teacher sounds appealing, as I would be able to do fulfilling work and help children learn. I was a camp counselor for a few years, and enjoy working with children, so that's also a plus. If I take this path, I'd like to teach social studies, but would also consider doing English. Additionally, there would be the potential for me down the line to possibly go into education administration or maybe even education policy. However, there are also a few downsides: Firstly, I feel like teaching high school isn't extremely intellectually stimulating. Secondly, I don't mean for this to sound conceited, but I think I have the ability to do more than being a high school teacher. Thirdly, I have no teaching experience, as I wasn't an education major. And lastly, in most parts of the country, the salary for teachers isn't too great.

Becoming a professor also sounds intriguing, as I would also be able to do fulfilling work and help young adults learn. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in college, and I think I'd love engulfing myself in high level content which I'm interested in. Again, I love to read and write, and I also don't mind research--at least at the undergraduate level. If I were to become a professor, I think I'm leaning towards political science/government and politics, although I'm also considering other subjects like Communications and Public Policy. The downsides here are that PhD programs can take anywhere from 4 to 6 years, and the future of college classrooms are relatively unknown. Before the pandemic, universities were already scaling down on hiring full-time professors, instead choosing to go the cheaper route and hire adjunct professors. After the pandemic, I'm sure face-to-face classes will bounce back in popularity, however, there's certainly a possibility more and more classes remain online, meaning there will be a need for less and less professors.

Lastly, becoming a lawyer sounds extremely rewarding, but also seems the most intimidating. Since I was a student for 16 years, I have a pretty good idea of what teaching and professing are like. However, I have little to no experience with law; I just know that lawyers read, write, and argue--all of which I enjoy. Again, this sounds like an extremely fulfilling career path, and I would have the potential to really make a difference in the lives of people I work with. Moreover, it would be extremely intellectually stimulating, as lawyers are always learning. The downsides are that law school is extremely intense--and expensive--and that I don't think I would enjoy the lifestyle of working 60-70 hours a week (and sometimes even more than that). And while I think I have the potential to be a strong litigator, the prospect arguing in front of a room full of people--with such high stakes on the line--is rather anxiety provoking.

Thanks in advance for any and all feedback!

TL;DR: I just graduated from college and want a career that is fulfilling, that will give me an opportunity to help people, and preferably, one that is intellectually stimulating. I've narrowed my choices down to becoming a teacher, a professor, or a lawyer, but am having trouble committing to one of the three. All three would require additional schooling."
hwjquc,5,2020-07-23,Skepticism about an internship position,idkjay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hwjquc/skepticism_about_an_internship_position/,"Hi everyone, I'm posting this for a friend because she's a bit shy to ask herself and will be directing your responses to her and vice versa:

I'm a recent grad of a full stack web development bootcamp and I recently started an interview process that I went in with the mindset of getting experience for it but turns out they’re gunning me through this process and as I think on it more I’m not sure why I’m feeling the way I am so I figure I’ll ask you all.

It’s a paid internship with minimum wage for the area. I figure it’s something on my resume, it’s again, minimum pay but something and the work sounds ridiculously easy. The other intern I spoke to basically said there’s almost zero code involved, at best they’re swapping text for email templates, adjusting the font and at worst playing with padding. So I figure at worst I can still look for a job while doing this for the next six months (since I feel bad about just dropping it if I find something better).

But the more this long-winded interview process they’re taking me goes on, the more my gut is telling me no. The first guy I originally spoke to basically admitted that the internship was a way for them to get a development team without having to actually pay for one. Since the interns are the only ones that deal with this ‘coding’ if you could call it that. Second was they said that most of their income was based off live seminars they held but once the pandemic hit, they obviously couldn’t continue and their CEO didn’t want to just “move everything online like the other businesses” which I kind of got the feeling was more or less because they didn’t know how. Like I said the most coding involved is HTML/CSS, not a scrap of anything I learned in bootcamp.

He also went on to say that they’re now going to be doing a marketing internship which makes me wonder if that’s another way to get around paying for a marketing team. Since he made it clear money was tight and minimum wage was all I’d be paid.

So, while I get it’s something on my resume, it’s at least something small income wise, and the work is easy enough I can pursue something else I’m still extremely iffy on whether or not to take it. I was originally going to just accept for those reasons but my gut has been backpedaling pretty hard so I figured I’d ask all of you what your opinions and thoughts are on it. I’m aware I can take it and just jump ship when I get a better offer but that feels like a worst case scenario for me.

What's more is that I found out that 5 alum from my bootcamp had gone through this internship and looking on their linkedin's, 4 of those 5 don't even work in the field they had gone to the bootcamp in the first place for. So I'm questioning if the experience here is even worth having on my resume since I want to actually do real programming for a career, be it full stack, front-end, or back-end. What would you guys advise?"
hwk6aj,7,2020-07-23,"EE127, CS70, Stat134 Fall",capitan_presidente,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hwk6aj/ee127_cs70_stat134_fall/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm now seriously considering dropping CS70. That means that I would be taking all 3 of these courses over Fall 2020 (EE127, CS70, Stat134). There really is no other way, since I'm a transfer student I have about 3 semesters left. I have a choice of either biting the bullet and potentially getting a B- in this course now, or taking these 3 techs in the fall. I've taken both EECS16a\\b and 61a\\b (I've averaged a B+ in the 61 series and a B in the 16 series). I've already tried taking Stat134 in the Spring but I NP'ed it because I got distracted at the beginning of the semester (so I fell behind markedly) and had a really bad mental health crisis in the middle of the semester.

My goal is ultimately grad school at Cal.  Here are my pro's and cons for dropping CS70, then: 

Pros: 

* Material is taught at a slower pace
* I've already covered more than half of the material
* Stat134's first half basically covers CS70's second half
* If I keep up with the class after dropping, I've basically covered the first half of Stats134 thrice (and thus will be better prepared for CS70's second half), so my chances of doing well go up.
* If I decide not to keep up with the class, I can focus on getting good SWE internships for next summer.
* GPA is 3.15 currently. Dropping means that I have a better shot of including CS70 in the upwards trend that grad schools look for if you start off bad.

Cons: 

* It's all math, and I've shown pretty consistently that I struggle with it at this level. It takes me a long time to fully understand a single CS70 note (around 3 hours/note).
* That's 3 techs *at the same time*, so I can expect to definitely struggle.
* One of the listed prereqs for EECS127 is the probability portion of CS70, so if I don't keep up with the material I might be at a disadvantage for both 127 and 134.
* All of this finagling with courses and grades might just be a giant distraction when I should really be focusing on personal projects for SWE jobs (since it is totally possible that I'm not cut out for Berkeley EECS PhD).

Things that I have going for me: 

* Past year of doing so/so has given me a lot of lesson about how to properly study for a class.
* My mental health has improved markedly thanks to my meditation practice.

Please be as harsh as you think need be! Thank you."

I was just wondering when is a good time to start applying for them? Would applying by the end of August be a little too late for the companies whose apps have already opened? 

The reason I say end August is because I feel I need a month to prepare for technical interviews. 

Any help would be appreciated!"

                             COLD OPEN
     
    FADE IN:
     
    INT. ARCHAEOLOGY LAB - CHICAGO FIELD MUSEUM - DAY
     
    A massive SHIPPING CRATE (stamped ""Fragile"" in English, 
    Turkish, and Arabic) slides off a forklift with a THUD.  
    DELIVERY MEN in coveralls pry off the lid and pull down 
    the sides with crowbars, revealing a packed pile of hay; 
    then they make way for some ARCHAEOLOGISTS in white lab-coats.
     
    We are in a bright, clean, state-of-the-art laboratory.  One 
    of the lab workers brushes away some hay; the object underneath 
    is a single half-ton boulder, covered in ancient scratches and 
    markings: Celtic ogham, a few Norse runes.
     
                             ARCHAEOLOGIST
                   Ancient Celtic.  Where did they 
                   find this?
     
    Dr. DOUGLAS KIRKWOOD (70s) appears: tweed coat, bow-tie, 
    spectacles, scraggly beard.  British, soft-spoken, bottled 
    enthusiasm.  He peers at the marks in the stone.
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                        (absently, engrossed)
                   Palmyra.  It was unearthed after 
                   ISIL brought down the Roman temples.  
                   Bloody barbarians.
     
                             ARCHAEOLOGIST
                   Doctor Kirkwood!
                        (close, whispering)
                   Did this come off the black market?
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   So what if it did?  Better here 
                   than in a rubble-heap.  A cultural 
                   treasure, lost to the world forever!
                        (giddy again)
                   But think about what this means!  
                   Celtic lapidary, from a Roman ruin 
                   in Syria!  I can't wait to find out 
                   what it says!
     
                             ARCHAEOLOGIST
                   So, can you read any of it?
     
    Kirkwood peers at the stone again.
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   Erm, no.  But I have a friend at 
                   the University of Chicago -- an old 
                   student of mine, in fact, a Doctor 
                   McTeague -- who could help us.
                        (eager)
                   I have to place a phone call.
     
    He runs off excitedly, still spry for an old guy.
     
    INT. LOBBY - CHICAGO FIELD MUSEUM - DAY
     
    ""Sue"", the famous T. rex skeleton, overlooks a noisy crowd 
    of families and student tour-groups.
     
    Dr. WILLIAM McTEAGUE, 32, dodges between children and tour- 
    guides who barely notice him.  Average build, bit of a 
    nebbish, he manages to give off an air of ""geek"" without the 
    glasses or pocket protector -- just bluejeans and a khaki
    vest over flannel, stereotypical archaeologist.  
     
    Dr. Kirkwood is waiting by the dino skeleton, rocking on his 
    heels, impatient, ecstatic.  Will spots him and pushes 
    through the crowd.
     
                             WILL
                   Professor Kirkwood!
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   William, my boy!  Good to see you!
     
    Emphatic handshake.  Kirkwood leads Will to a quiet corner.  
    They walk past exhibit wings.
     
                             WILL
                   So what's this about a Roman rune- 
                   stone, or whatever?  You sounded so 
                   excited on the phone, I couldn't --
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   Yes, yes!  Just wait until you see 
                   it!  Truly remarkable!
     
    The professor grabs Will's arm, bodily drags him away.
     
    INT. ARCHAEOLOGY LAB - DAY
     
    The rune-stone stands bare in the middle of the lab, all the 
    shipping detritus gone.  Some 4 feet wide and 5 high, it's 
    completely covered in markings, lines of text in haphazard 
    directions that squeeze tightly together and fill the surface
    of the rock.
     
    One of the LAB INTERNS, female, cleans the lapidary with a 
    small brush, while another, male, systematically takes 
    rubbings of the text, one line at a time.
     
    Will emerges from behind the rock, magnifying glass in hand, 
    and gives a low whistle.
     
                             WILL
                   Doc, you weren't kidding!  This is 
                   -- I mean, if it's genuine --
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   I know!  I know!  Now, tell me, do 
                   you think you can translate it?
     
    Will stands back from the stone, looks it up and down.  
    Uncertain, he scratches the back of his head.
     
                             WILL
                   We'll see.  I'll need some books 
                   from my office.
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   I'll have them brought right over.  
                   Whatever else you need in the mean-
                   while, you've got it!
     
                             WILL
                        (overwhelmed)
                   I'll get started right away, then.
     
                             KIRKWOOD
                   Wonderful!  I knew I could count on 
                   you, lad.
     
    Kirkwood runs off again.  Will stops the intern making the 
    rubbings to get his attention.
     
                             WILL
                   Hey.  Hi.  Uh, it looks like I'm 
                   gonna be here a while.  Where do 
                   you guys keep the coffee?
     
    The intern doesn't look up, but cocks a thumb over his 
    shoulder, indicating a side-office.  Will mumbles a half-
    hearted ""thanks"", takes one more dubious look at the rune-
    stone, shuffles off.
     
                                                 FADE OUT.
     
                   END OF COLD OPEN

I have found the perfect internship and the introduction talk went really well with them. They have sent me an assignment which I need to complete before  monday to show them I am fit for the job.

In the assignment I have to use Node.js, Vue.js and Nuxt.js, which I have never worked with before. During my last two years of computer science, I have been using Python, C#, F#, Android and Unity. I also have prior experience in PHP and know my way around with HTML/CSS/JS.

I have started by watching tutorial video's about Vue.js, but I am feeling very overwhelmed by all of the information, since it is a different approach of coding than what I am used to. Also, I feel very impatient, because I really just want to start coding the assignment and see how far I can get, but I get the feeling that I will rush things and get frustrated.

I hope someone can help me get a more straight path in my head, because I feel all over the place right now. I really want to pass the assignment and start my internship period at their company, because it is exactly what I am looking for in an internship.

Thanks for reading."

I was going to classes after work, which is teaching computer science at a private school. Now that I have my degree, and the craziness that is covid/schools opening, I've been actively looking for a new job - one that is actually using my degrees. I've been applying to jobs for about 2 weeks now, and haven't heard back from anyone. 

I feel like part of my issue is my resume, so I've been trying to edit it. The issue I'm running into is not knowing how to spin this teaching experience in my favor. Currently, I have the following : 

* Introduced and developed AP computer science curriculum to the school to prepare students for college-level courses and pass the AP exam 
* Responsible for maintaining and upgrading computers in the lab for student use 
* Plan and create interactive and interesting lesson plans including introductory material, notes, lectures, and assessments for approximately 150 students throughout each school year
* Maintain regular communications with parents and counselors on the progress of the students
* Attend educational workshops, professional development training, and other professional growth activities 

I know these are not great, but it's difficult because my only other experience is an internship from 2016. I feel like I'm qualified for an entry-level position, so if anyone has any advice or tips (or to even tell me I'm not qualified) I would really appreciate it!"

My major is computer engineering. I have a background in many things including IT &amp; Marketing. I have never worked for free before. While my work force background is diverse I am really interested in jobs in either IT or Marketing. The problem is most want a bachelors or the ones I applied for didn't take me. I interviewed for 2 internships. Didn’t get the first one. However, they called me and offered me a better position that is a combination of IT &amp; Marketing. One is a start up and it’s unpaid however, there is potential pay/ bonuses. Every time they sign a deal or like a specific goal is made because of us. We make 5% of whatever they make. So like 10,000-100,000 we’d get 5% of that. Another is unpaid but is a more known company and while its unpaid if I get it the skills would for sure help me in the marketing world and get more jobs. I’ve never worked unpaid and need money at the moment but I’m not sure what to do. Should I accept these internships? Are they worth it? How do they work? Is it legal to not pay? Thanks!"

hwpe8d,560,2020-07-23,I found my old disposable camera. There are photos on it I don’t remember taking,RobertMort,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hwpe8d/i_found_my_old_disposable_camera_there_are_photos/,"While moving, I found an old disposable camera. It was stashed away in the drawer of an old dresser that I hadn’t opened in years.

“Ha. Remember these things?” I passed the camera to my wife. She flipped it over in her hands, in awe.

“Wow. A disposable camera. How old do you think it is?”

“Probably from the late ‘90s, when we moved here.” I clicked back the dial, but the big fat **0** came up. No photos left on it. “Do you think there’s any place that will still develop it?”

A quick Google search revealed that Walgreens and other pharmacies still developed disposable cameras. So that afternoon, we got in the car and dropped off the camera. A few hours later I picked up the big fat envelope of photos.

We sat down at the kitchen table. Heart thrumming with excitement, I flipped it open.

The very first photo was of my wife. Diane. I smiled when I saw her pretty young face, but as I pulled the photo out of the envelope, my smile widened to a grin. It was a photo of her pregnant—cradling a big belly in a floral dress, smiling down at it.

“This must’ve been when you were pregnant with Michael.” I handed her the photo.

“Oh, how cute!” She grinned. “Man, they grow up fast, don’t they?”

Michael had just graduated college. He was living with us for a few months, as he worked at an unpaid internship with the mayor. I looked at the photo of Diane, her face grainy and blurred compared to the ultra-crisp photos of today’s smartphones, and felt a twang of sadness. *I miss those days. Young, in love, our whole lives ahead of us… when Michael was a little baby who needed us, instead of a young adult who locked himself in his room all day…*

I flipped to the next photo.

My heart plummeted.

It was a photo of us in the hospital. Diane was lying on the bed, and I was next to her, gripping her hand. For a second, I thought it must’ve been a photo from Michael’s birth. But the expressions on our faces clearly told me otherwise. Her face was twisted in grief, her eyes rimmed with red from hours of crying. My face was still, as if carved in stone. Trying to be stoic, be strong for my wife, but failing.

And in her arms, underneath a bundle of cloth, was a little baby.

But it was far too small.

The blood drained out of my face. *How… how was this photo taken?* I remembered the day we brought Michael home. A full-term, large baby at eight pounds, six ounces, nineteen inches long. But Diane and I never had another pregnancy. He was our only child.

*Whose baby is this?*

And then the other, horrible realization:

*It’s way too small to have lived.*

Diane’s eyes fell on the photo. She let out a muffled squeak, and then took it from me, hands trembling. “Oh, my God…”

I flipped to the next photo.

A photo of Diane and I. My arm was around her shoulders, and we were smiling. But there was sadness behind our eyes. Pain. Diane was no longer pregnant, and she looked skinny. Too skinny. Drawn.

My hands trembled as I flipped through the photos faster. There were several of us like that; at social events, or at the park. The pain behind our eyes. Skin and bones.

I slid the next photo away—and my heart stopped.

A photo of Diane in the hospital. Holding a baby. A beautiful, fat, full-term baby wrapped in a swaddling blanket. She was grinning, the pain gone from her face. I had my arms around her, beaming, beaming like a proud father.

But there was a problem.

The newborn had no umbilical cord. No stump, no remnant, just a perfect bellybutton.

Diane’s eyes met mine. Something passed between us. A horrible realization. She reached out and gripped my hand, squeezing it as tight as she could, until red marks bloomed across my fingers.

*Thump, thump, thump.* Footsteps thudded down the stairs, and then Michael swung into the kitchen. His smile quickly faded as he saw the photos in our hands. Replaced by an expression of anger, of fury, of hate.

“You shouldn’t have seen those,” he said."
hwqims,1,2020-07-23,Struggling to adapt,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hwqims/struggling_to_adapt/,"So I graduated from college a year ago. I noticed that whenever it was the summer and I would work at my internship my mental health would decline a lot due to a toxic work environment and an office lifestyle. Whenever I would return to school, any symptoms of anxiety would go away. However once I graduated I began working at the place I was interning and my mental health has predictively gone down. When I think of what I lost from not being in college, it was:
- a sense of community 
- a sense of purpose from involvement in student organizations
-my social life

If I was at a job that I was interested in, I think things would be better. However, I’m overall just thankful that I’m working now. I’m trying to find ways to find the things I’m missing from college but it seems the most mainstream source of a strong community after school is religious organizations. However I’m not really religious. So I’m wondering if any of y’all have been able to find a sense of community outside or religion/school and how you got into it"

I recently (this week) got turned down for a dev lead position on my team due to another candidate having more coding experience.

Note- culturally In the company, people talk to the head boss about raises as we have an open-door policy. He’s usually been pretty flexible with them and I personally known people who’ve done this.

Question:

While it is challenging, you get what you put in, and you want to make sure those years paid off. I wanted to share some tips that worked for me (and also tips that I wish I followed).

\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\* I understand that each person is faced with their own unique circumstances, and not everything works for everyone. These tips are just general, I hope someone finds them useful, but I understand if not. \*\*END DISCLAIMER\*\*

First, take time to get to know the area. Where everything is located, how you'll go through your daily routine. Do your research on your college's website - look at different organizations and activities, pick a few that you'd like to try out.

(I am not qualified to give mental health advice, but I would just raise the suggestion that you address any issues that you may be dealing with. Make sure you're mentally prepared to take good care of yourself and devote the effort needed to succeed. Unresolved mental health issues can really hold one back. See if there is a trustworthy, affordable counselor on campus. If that's not an option, the one thing I can suggest is to reduce your toxic friendships.)

Start developing good habits, like regular organized studying, communicating with professors (attending office hours, proper email etiquette) , taking good care of yourself (sleep, healthy food, exercise, de-stressing), and connecting with new people. The sooner you get used to taking charge and being organized, the easier it will be for you to make time for new, enriching activities.

I compiled a list of study tips ([https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back\_to\_school\_homework\_studying\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back_to_school_homework_studying_tips/)).

Get yourself into the right #mindset. **Learn, work, connect, opportunity.** You (likely) went to college in order to learn and succeed, so work hard and be on the lookout for connections and opportunities! Don't try to rush to get your degree done! While grades are important, experience and initiative are more significant in advancing your career.

If you have a specific career goal in mind, read about what it takes to stand out as an applicant, and start figuring out how you'll fit these activities in your schedule. For example as a Medical school applicant

If you aren't set on a specific goal, you should try different activities, and see what resonates with you. Don't disqualify yourself or assume that you aren't interested in a certain profession UNTIL you get some exposure to the field. It might be more fun than it sounds!

HOWEVER, it is possible that you're initially set on a certain job, but then lose interest. Just make sure you try something that's outside of your main interest.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Get involved in organizations, and try a leadership position. You will be able to connect with people with similar goals and ask them questions. A leadership position will test you and the experience will highlight you as a job applicant.

If you are unsure of your goals, try figuring out some possible professions, or at least eliminating ones that you really don't like. Try **job shadowing and/or volunteering** in different fields. Doing this helped me eliminate engineering and pharmacy school...a job may be very different in person compared to the description.

Try to work somewhere, at least part-time, on or near campus. Working will help you prove that you're dependable and a good employee. Not to mention $$$ comes in handy!

Try **undergraduate research**, at least try a semester! You can connect with professors and classmates, learn skills, and boost your CV/resume.

Apply for summer **internships.**

This might sound cliche but give yourself a break and have fun sometimes. If people invite you out for a fun activity, join them once in a while! Party party just be careful!

I work for a very large semiconductor company making great money.


I know a little Git, but I actually haven't had a job in where I used it (even at my internship I didn't use it because my internship project was a solo kind of project).


Anyway, we use ClearCase at my job (it was developed by IBM) in Red Hat Linux. Some of the key things we do in ClearCase are check in / check out, rebasing, delivering, and so forth. We do not mention anything about forking or anything so I'm curious how different is ClearCase from Git is. If I were to get another job in a few years in where we use Git, would I know the same concepts or no ?"

I was really depressed and burnt out in high school, and so I waited 2 years to go to college (idk, I guess I was hoping my depression would go away?). When I finally went, I failed HARD even though I loved college. I got a 0.5 gpa my first semester. 

I got diagnosed and put on adderall after my freshman year and it changed everything and nothing. I understood myself better and the meds helped, but I had 0 coping mechanisms so even though I excelled at work and finding internships and learning, I still did poorly academically. 

At the end of my junior year, a combination of my grades and family issues led me to choose to go out in medical leave. Since 2018, I’ve been home helping my mom raise my now 2 year old sister and I’ve been off meds since then.  Since I never wanted a car, and I wanted to move to a big city after graduation, I never got my license or bought a car. Since I sort of let my mom emotionally manipulate me into raising her child, I live at home. 

I don’t mind it that much!! I want to help. But I’m sick of my mom acting like I’m just a lazy bum, and of my 16 year old sister telling me “you’re 25 and I have a car before you isn’t that funny?” And constantly making snarky comments about being a first generation college student (she absolutely isn’t; my mom has an associates degree and is an RN). 

The thing that really gets my goat is that I’m 80% sure she has adhd too, bc she has a lot of the same issues I struggle with, and I’m trying to help her but she still acts like a complete dick. 

I know the environment I’m in isn’t great for me, and I want to move out, but I keep telling myself I need to do it in order — license, car, better job, then apartment. And I had this great big plan to be out by December, but now I can’t get into the DMV until September. 

I feel like my situation would be very much improved by getting my own place, getting treatment and getting back on my meds, but finding a doctor makes me so anxious. 

I’m sorry for the length, I’m just frustrated and no one else in my life really understands"

I was wondering how strong my profile is rn for MS CSE application, and what all should I do to make it better? 


Undergrad: 
- (graduating 2021) B.Tech CSE student
- GPA of 8.2/10 from India.

Currently, my profile would include the following: 
- 1 one year Data Science RA experience under college professor 
- 3 corporate/startup technical internships(Frontend dev, Ui-Ux dev) 
- 1 mentee experience under Amazon
- 1 IEEE published research paper on Image Processing 

Co-curricular:
- 6 month volunteer experience at CRY (Child Rights and You)
- Coordinator for an International Streetplay Festival.
- Active member of dramatics club for 3 years. 

I am preparing and hoping for atleast 2 more research papers, along with a term paper, before I graduate but surely I wouldn’t be able to add to my application as those go out this year end. 

Also, I am preparing for GRE and my score on practice tests lies in the range 310-320.

I am getting very anxious about my application and everything as a few people I know who are also prepping for MS are doing 3 external research internships and have 2 research papers under review at springer, and I feel I am just wasting away my time gaining work exp. 

Also, please suggest some good universities I should/would look into for applying, as well as any tips/suggestions you might have for me. 

Thanks"

And I feel like I haven't learnt anything in my engineering so far. I have always got good marks and performed well, but I feel I have no practical knowledge to apply. I can't solve one technical problem or analysis problem. I feel I only knew how to pass the exams, and people think I'm intelligent because of it, but I'm not. Already don't remember 90% of stuff from my curriculum.

Tried to learn coding during the lockdown, but it just doesn't sit in my head. I've tried so many times so hard, but I don't seem to be able to grasp it. 

I tried venturing into creative fields which involve some of my interests. For example tried writing articles for a football website and even though one got featured. I struggle to keep coming up with them. Most of the things I cover are what others already do, there's no USP to my stuff. 
Got a part time unpaid internship as a food blogger too, and again, same struggle. I'm just not creative enough. I try so hard for so long, but can't come up with anything interesting or unique. 
I feel I'm not creative enough for the non-technical jobs, but not analytical enough for the technical jobs. I try to work hard to change it, but it doesn't come off no matter what.

I'm so scared that I'm going to be unemployed, because I have no skills. My resume is all over the place and I have direction whatsoever. I feel like I've wasted my university life too. Also, everyone has so high hopes of me since I've always been good at academics, but only ik how dumb I am.i struggle even at basic maths or aptitude at times, so I really question how I'd work as a engineer! Only thing good I have is probably my memory, because of which I somehow manage good scores. Feel like I would have to settle for a small retail job, after my parents spent so much for my college education. Esp. given the current market state.

I do not know how to procede, and have no one to confide to or ask advice from. I'm just completely lost and scared and anxious everyday now. No amound of hardwork seems to pay off, maybe coz I'm just dumb. I still have lockdown going on, but don't know how to use it effectively. Feel like I end up whiling away time."

I've been working here for over a year. Originally, it was a 3-month internship, but it kept getting renewed. Each time it was renewed, I was never asked if I wanted it - but I was grateful and accepted regardless. I didn't get a ""contract break"" (and only found out what that was last month). I've only taken two days off - one for being sick.

Over the past 11 or so months, I've been feeling more depressed at my job. My coworkers constantly bully and belittle me for various reasons - I overshared at the beginning of my internship because I thought ""oh boy, I -an introvert- made some friends. Gosh golly"". I've never regretted anything more in my life.

My internship ends this month and there had been little talk about extending it. Which I was grateful for. I've been looking for employment- I've got an interview a few days after the contract ends. So, that was that. Until this week. 

Earlier, my boss asked if I'd want to stay on and I said I really wanted to see what other opportunities are out there. But this week, another coworker told me to renew it. And then yesterday, after work hours, another coworker insisted I renew my contract.

I don't want to, obviously, but these back-to-back convos are making it seem as if I'm obligated to. Here, I don't have any benefits - not even minor incentives. Where I'm interviewing at, I'll probably get paid the same amount (if not less) but I'd be working remotely and much happier.

Also, I'm in a place where I'm struggling financially for school.  But, this is my first job and I have 2-3 breakdowns per week. Its turned me off from corporate life entirely. Please help me:

Do I extend this internship for better pay, or leave for my own mental health? Thank you.

EDIT: thx for your comments. I'd just like to reiterate that I do NOT want to to continue working here, unless absolutely necessary!"

Yet I would either find TAs who believed I was milking for answers, even though seeing TAs were the second to last resort followed by office hours. Spending a large majority of my free time working on assignments. Constantly feeling helpless because I can't find some solutions to issues to my problems either online, from TAs, in the textbook, or waiting outside in long lines to see the professor. Submitting uncompleted assignments because I ran out of time. Only having a few hours to study for exams because I have programming assignments due that are also worth a huge part of my grade. Also no, I didn't procrastinate or wait until last minute for assignments, I used my time to work on assignments that needed to get done, prioritizing the ones that were due soon. I felt like part of me passing some classes was just luck, either I got an easier professor, or I met someone who was willing to help. Most of the time, everything felt really cut throat because none of my peers would want to help, because if I did better, that means they could get a lower grade due to the curve...  


After graduating I felt like my degree wasn't deserved. I felt like maybe I didn't belong in the major. I tried learning some things on my own, or using new technology, finding myself getting frustrated at things not working, flashing back to college days remembering how much of a failure I felt and thinking I am still a failure...even though I am only doing programming because I want to be less of a failure...but I end up dropping them and spending my free time playing games or browsing the internet because I am happier then doing a project and thinking about how much I suck. Lots of times I think if I ever go back to college, I would want to go in another field instead of graduate school for CS.  


I got lucky with my job, it was an internship I got through my brother and then got hired once I got my degree. But I don't feel like it's deserved...before covid I was commuting 2 hours one way for 2 years because I felt like no one else would hire me, nor did I feel like I had the knowledge to get past an interview when I got them. I felt like I didn't deserve the job, I feel like I don't know enough to contribute and make any impact, and I don't go searching for other jobs to expand my knowledge of because of my self doubt.  


I look at my peers and they are really knowledgeable, and some of them don't even have a degree...  


Do you relate, and what's your story?"
hx4aze,5,2020-07-24,Contemplating my CS career choices,asinn99,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/hx4aze/contemplating_my_cs_career_choices/,"I'm a CS student, and I've been contemplating whether I want to go to grad school after my bachelor's. I'd rather get relevant experience, which has a lot more value than degrees. 

Knowing that I will be done with school after graduation, is my GPA less relevant? I have a decent 3.2GPA, and I've been trying to raise it as high as possible the last year because I was aiming to go to grad school. This put a lot of stress on me, especially whenever I got a bad midterm grade. While I consider myself to be a good student, I struggle sometimes with being a full time student, and part time working around 20 hours a week. 

I've been told that as a CS major, I should focus more on side projects and internships. That would mean less time spent on schooling, but enough to get a decent grade (nothing outstanding).

Knowing that I have no intent on pursuing grad school anymore, is this a good mindset to follow?"

Is there anything to change? I am still not convinced on the case or motherboard as I am trying to find one that is fully compatible with all different types of USB and whatnot. Any advice on how to make it cheaper without sacrificing performance would be greatly appreciated.

hx5bxw,1,2020-07-24,The dream is dead; advice on selling second-hand pc parts?,thevideogameguy2,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/hx5bxw/the_dream_is_dead_advice_on_selling_secondhand_pc/,"Built my first rig way back in high school, couldn't live without her so even took her to college (in another country! that's how much I needed her). After being displaced by covid and needing to move around for internships and quarantines, and likely needing to be on the move a lot in the future, I almost never can use her anymore and am trying to sell her off second-hand. What's the best way to do that?

1. Should I sell each component separately? I, unfortunately, don't have the original packaging, so this seems a little difficult.
2. Should I sell the whole thing at once, as a tower? This seems easiest, but some components are way less dated than others (the 2 extra SSDs), so not sure if I'll get a good value.

Specs:

Ryzen 3 1200 (Custom OC'd to stable amount)

B350 Motherboard

GTX 1060 6GB

8x2 GB RAM

2TB HDD

128 GB Boot SSD

500 GB SSD

I'm thinking of selling it only with the boot SSD and 8 GB RAM, and keeping the 2 other storage drives and the extra 8 gigs for any potential future rigs. Any advice at all is appreciated."
hx6576,2,2020-07-24,I fear for my little sister,nothereforyourbs,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/hx6576/i_fear_for_my_little_sister/,"My little sister acts like she’s so much better than me. She acts like I’m lazy although I’m a full time student with zero bills to pay. I don’t HAVE to work right now. She chooses to work at a shitty retail job although she scored thousands of dollars from Unemployment just for working a SINGLE shift before Covid started. She brags about having so much money in her savings and looks down on me because I don’t. While she was hopping retail jobs during high school last year, I was in college making money through my internship. Yeah, it’s not going to get me thousands of dollars. But it was a nice parting gift from a life I thought I was going to have. She didn’t even NEED to file for unemployment. She just did to have spending money when she goes to college. Cool.. but now that school 
probably isn’t happening in the fall, what now? She complains about that damn job every fucking day as if she HAS to work there. I always remind her that she does not in fact HAVE to work considering her savings and the fact that she will be home. But no, she shits on me because I’m not stressing myself out with a below minimum wage job I don’t need. First of all, I am two years older than her with a DEGREE. We aren’t applying to the same jobs. I’m about to finish a 3 year bachelor program but I’M the one who is lazy and has money handed to me because my school is slowly reimbursing me for unused housing fees??? 

Don’t even get me started about her pathetic relationships. I love her. I really do. But she has HORRIBLE taste in men. This is the same girl who got a presidential scholarship to the top and only school she applied to. The same girl who’s literally won awards for her intelligence and graduated a year early. She lets them disrespect her and compromises her sexual health for their selfish needs. When I give her the advice every big sister should give, she puts me down. Brings up my lack of relationship experience and all of the shitty things men did to me despite it. I’m still a college student who’s lived more than her. I started partying and clubbing before her. I’ve had sex before her. I KNOW how fucking boys our age and men much older than us work. I’m not an unsocialized idiot. But apparently, since I didn’t commit myself to the kinds of fuckboys she chases after, I’M unexeperienced? I only want the best for her. I don’t want her to end up pregnant, with STD’s, and broken hearted over some guy who hasn’t even achieved half of what she has. All of the lessons I share with her are for HER benefit. For her to throw those vulnerable moments back in my face kind of hurts. My mom does the same thing. I want to protect and guide her. She doesn’t respect me. She brags about all the sex she has in-spite of me, all the boys she dates, and all of the thousands of dollars she didn’t earn. It’s as if she forgets that before covid hit, my internship offered me a job with benefits and a salary. It’s like she forgets that I had life plans too. Although this situation sucks, I am content with how things are going now. I am content being celibate too. I have every opportunity to fuck and suck but I choose not to. I’d rather GRADUATE for the second time this year and start my professional life. After seeing hers and my parent’s relationships, I WANT to be single. By the time she starts school, I’ll be finished and working on my Masters. 

I keep asking myself if I’m jealous of her just check myself and that’s never the case. I don’t want her life. I’ve lived a life similar to hers 2 years ago. Wild, irresponsible, validation seeking. She’s brought it to a whole entirely other level tho. A level that has caused significant tears in our sisterhood. Away at college in a big city, I learned pretty quickly that I need to protect my body and energy. I have to focus on my education. I have to find validation and happiness within myself. Those are lessons I had to learn myself in a number of many different ways. Although many sucked, I am thankful to have experienced those events to have the knowledge I do now. Unfortunately, if she stays home this fall, she won’t have the luxury of learning those lessons. Hell, she won’t even listen to me and my older sister. Nothing can get through to her. Not even when I hit my breaking point and beat her ass a month ago. I’ve been wanting college to humble her so badly but once again, she’ll probably proceed through more milestones of her life unpaused. She has a very immature and scary perception of life. It deeply frightens me. I don’t ever want anything bad to happen to her, but it seems as if that’s the wake up call that will truly make her do better."

While I know this is a whiles away, I have my sites set on applying to a PHD program at a top 4 CS university in ML/AI (MIT, Stanford, CMU, Berkley). I was wondering if you guys could shed some light on a possible path to get there (other than maintaining a high GPA and getting a good GRE?).

When did you start doing research? When did you start getting publications? Important EC's? Summer internships vs summer research? Any ""feeder"" summer programs? I know that doing AI/ML research as an undergraduate can be particularly difficulty, so when would it be feasible for me to get started with that? What kind of things do successful applicants do during their four years as an undergrad?

Note: Getting into a top PHD program is obviously not my main focus for the next four years, and I am aware my interests/career goals may change. Nevertheless this is a goal I have and I would appreciate any advice on ways I can work towards realizing it."

hx7nfa,5,2020-07-24,Succeeding/Choosing a career when you're unsure! (high school),waterpik007,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/hx7nfa/succeedingchoosing_a_career_when_youre_unsure/,"Disclaimer: These are just some ideas I put together, and some of the post is based on my own life experience. If you find this useful that's great! If not, I understand. This post is mostly aimed towards high school students. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Your Mindset:

Please don't get fixated on only one career path unless you are absolutely sure. While it is important to have goals, keep an open mind and take advantage of opportunities as they come.

If you're having difficulty ""finding your passion"", don't sweat it! Just observe, ask questions, try various activities and see what stands out to you.

Don't put yourself down or think that you wouldn't be good at something. Try first!

Get used to doing research ahead of time - look into available opportunities, job applications, study tips, etc!

Don't hesitate to speak with teachers, professors, guidance counselors, advisors, professionals, generally people with substantial experience who can give you suggestions.

Please be polite, listen to what people have to say.

Take good care of yourself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Starting with... High School. FYI I say a lot about preparing for college. Even if you aren't sure about going, it's still better to be prepared and save yourself some money in case you end up attending. These tips are all suggestions, it's up to you to prioritize your time and energy towards your own goals.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*College prep-*

Captain Obvious, try to get good grades. Study well (I compiled a list of study tips [https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back\_to\_school\_homework\_studying\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back_to_school_homework_studying_tips/)), and communicate with your teachers and classmates.

TIME MANAGEMENT CHECK! Get a good amount of homework done in class/at school, start projects far ahead of time so you can ask questions, start studying for tests ahead of time so you don't get overwhelmed. Really do whatever works for you, but make sure you have time for activities besides homework and studying! If you do alright with online learning, see if you can take online classes. This will give you flexibility and let you work at your own pace!

See what opportunities your school has- some activities are fun and/or boost your resume!

Look into AP classes, or any other ways you can get college credit in high school. Ask your guidance counselor, In some cases a foreign language can be useful. Consider taking the CLEP exam, you can study for it and test out of college credits (I tested out of 16 Spanish credits... gracias Profe!). For easier exams, you could purchase the textbook (through a social media group) and self-study.

See if you need to take the ACT or SAT, study and take it! This will help you apply for scholarships!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Career prep-*

Try to start **working and/or volunteering** while in high school. If it's too tough to fit in your schedule, at least volunteer once a week and try to work over the summer/first few weeks of school.

At this point, just work wherever is reasonably safe, don't be picky. You should gain some work experience, prove that you are a reliable/honest employee, and hopefully establish a decent work relationship with your supervisor. so they can write you letters of recommendation for more advanced jobs. (Oh, and the money comes in handy).

You could probably be choosier with volunteering if you have a specific interest (I always liked science, and I started by volunteering in a science museum). You can search for volunteering opportunities near you, or research different organizations near you and see if they're taking volunteers.

Even if you don't land your ideal volunteer position at first, some experience is better than none, so just try to get involved somewhere reasonable. Keep in mind once you accumulate some experience you can apply to other places.

Also, try **job shadowing** a few different professionals. I've found this extremely helpful, as jobs can seem very different in person compared to their description.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Career/Educational Planning-*

Plan ahead - I recommend looking at jobs you're potentially interested in, job shadowing, researching the education and experience requirements. Do you need trade school? Do you need university - what level, Associate's, Bachelor's, Graduate? If you're interested in a competitive profession, research what experience you need to gain an edge above other applicants.

How are you going to pay for your education? Will you apply for scholarships? Did you &amp; your family save some money for that purpose? Will you work through school? Take out loans? Any combination of the above?

In some cases, you can be flexible! Let's say you want to work in the medical field, but you're not sure where exactly. You could earn a certification to work as a phlebotomist or EKG tech, work there for some time, and if you end up wanting a higher education you can use some of your money to pay for classes. Or, you can just try something different altogether, you shouldn't feel stuck. Even if your new idea doesn't work out, you will already have a pretty decent job with your certification.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, here are some tips for college...

(as in high school) Consider online classes if that's your thing! Especially the ones that allow you to work at your own pace. One time I finished a class in 2 weeks because I didn't want to pay for the access code. That freed up a LOT of time.

Job shadow!

Get involved in clubs and societies. If you have time, even try a leadership position.

Try to get internships over the summer.

Get involved in research in your department! This is an outstanding opportunity to develop professional connections and learn desirable skills.

Attend career fairs!

Don't necessarily rush to graduate, it's better to take a year longer and gain more experience so you're a good prospective employee. There are various opportunities available only to current students, so it would be hard to gain that experience after graduation.

I know there are a ton of posts like this and they are annoying, but I would like a bit of guidance regarding what Bioinformatics or CompBio PhD programs to shoot for and more or less what my chances are at getting in so here are some stats about me:

1. Rising senior at UC Berkeley
2. Chemical Biology and Data Science double major with a Data Science concentration of Computational Biology Methods
3. GPA: 3.4 cumulative, 3.5 in Data Science coursework
4. GRE (unofficial scores): 167Q and 165V. I'll get my official scores and AW in about 2 weeks.
5. Research: 2 years in lab at Cal where I've worked on 3 projects, 2 of which have been computational: Proteomics and building an epigenetic clock using neural networks. The past 3 summers, I have also been doing summer research internships at Stanford Medical School where I've worked on 2 computational projects and 1 wet lab.
6. Publications: None, but I will probably have a methods manuscript about the Proteomics project sent to journals by the time I apply.

My thoughts: I am pretty happy with my research experience. My concerns are my GPA and the fact I have not officially been published.

What are your thoughts? Will appreciate all comments, program suggestions, and constructive criticism."

hx9r5t,9,2020-07-24,Rejected from every single summer internship...,RoseCouture,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/hx9r5t/rejected_from_every_single_summer_internship/,"Hello everyone,

I’m writing this post out of sheer frustration and wondering if anyone has any words of advice at all. 

I am studying BSc Economics at a Russell Group university, about to go into final year and on track to achieve a First. This summer I applied to about 15 internships, mostly for startups/tech/marketing roles. For each and every single one I tailored my CV and took time to research the company and write a dedicated cover letter (yes it did take me hours combined to apply to all of these...). I’m studying a solid degree, thankfully doing really well academically and have past work experiences as well, so I thought I’d at least secure one role. 

I was called back to interview for 11 companies, out of the remaining 4 I applied to, 2 wrote me a personalised rejection that my experience seemed good but they’ve chosen other candidates and 2 I didn’t hear back from at all. 
With the interviews, the exact same thing happened in almost all but one. The interview would go really well, I’d finish feeling optimistic and then a few days later I’d receive that dreaded email that I’d interviewed really well, they were so impressed with me and my achievements and that it was a close call  between me and the final candidate but unfortunately I hadn’t been chosen. This happened ten times. Ten times the cycle repeated. I felt like I was going crazy that it’d be literally an identical outcome each time. 
I asked them for further feedback after my rejections and most don’t reply, but those that did said there was nothing negative they could say about me and it was simply a case of the other candidate just having a “slight edge.” I wish it was a case of poor interview technique or just something tangible that I could actually improve upon! I really am not sure where I’m going wrong. 

Today I received my last rejection and I’m so fed up and frustrated!! I tried incredibly hard and I understand that this is just life but it’s so disheartening to receive rejection after rejection. Now I’ll be in the same position as those who did not even try despite planning from the beginning of this year to avoid being in the very situation I find myself in now. I’m also very worried about how difficult it’ll be to secure a grad job without a proper internship."

If you're having difficulty ""finding your passion"", don't sweat it! Just observe, ask questions, try various activities and see what stands out to you.

Don't put yourself down or think that you wouldn't be good at something. Try first!

Get used to doing research ahead of time - look into available opportunities, job applications, study tips, etc!

Don't hesitate to speak with teachers, professors, guidance counselors, advisors, professionals, generally people with substantial experience who can give you suggestions.

Please be polite, listen to what people have to say.

Take good care of yourself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Starting with... High School. FYI I say a lot about preparing for college. Even if you aren't sure about going, it's still better to be prepared and save yourself some money in case you end up attending. These tips are all suggestions, it's up to you to prioritize your time and energy towards your own goals.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*College prep-*

Captain Obvious, try to get good grades. Study well (I compiled a list of study tips [https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back\_to\_school\_homework\_studying\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back_to_school_homework_studying_tips/)), and communicate with your teachers and classmates.

TIME MANAGEMENT CHECK! Get a good amount of homework done in class/at school, start projects far ahead of time so you can ask questions, start studying for tests ahead of time so you don't get overwhelmed. Really do whatever works for you, but make sure you have time for activities besides homework and studying! If you do alright with online learning, see if you can take online classes. This will give you flexibility and let you work at your own pace!

See what opportunities your school has- some activities are fun and/or boost your resume!

Look into AP classes, or any other ways you can get college credit in high school. Ask your guidance counselor, In some cases a foreign language can be useful. Consider taking the CLEP exam, you can study for it and test out of college credits (I tested out of 16 Spanish credits... gracias Profe!). For easier exams, you could purchase the textbook (through a social media group) and self-study.

See if you need to take the ACT or SAT, study and take it! This will help you apply for scholarships!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Career prep-*

Try to start **working and/or volunteering** while in high school. If it's too tough to fit in your schedule, at least volunteer once a week and try to work over the summer/first few weeks of school.

At this point, just work wherever is reasonably safe, don't be picky. You should gain some work experience, prove that you are a reliable/honest employee, and hopefully establish a decent work relationship with your supervisor. so they can write you letters of recommendation for more advanced jobs. (Oh, and the money comes in handy).

You could probably be choosier with volunteering if you have a specific interest (I always liked science, and I started by volunteering in a science museum). You can search for volunteering opportunities near you, or research different organizations near you and see if they're taking volunteers.

Even if you don't land your ideal volunteer position at first, some experience is better than none, so just try to get involved somewhere reasonable. Keep in mind once you accumulate some experience you can apply to other places.

Also, try **job shadowing** a few different professionals. I've found this extremely helpful, as jobs can seem very different in person compared to their description.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Career/Educational Planning-*

Plan ahead - I recommend looking at jobs you're potentially interested in, job shadowing, researching the education and experience requirements. Do you need trade school? Do you need university - what level, Associate's, Bachelor's, Graduate? If you're interested in a competitive profession, research what experience you need to gain an edge above other applicants.

How are you going to pay for your education? Will you apply for scholarships? Did you &amp; your family save some money for that purpose? Will you work through school? Take out loans? Any combination of the above?

In some cases, you can be flexible! Let's say you want to work in the medical field, but you're not sure where exactly. You could earn a certification to work as a phlebotomist or EKG tech, work there for some time, and if you end up wanting a higher education you can use some of your money to pay for classes. Or, you can just try something different altogether, you shouldn't feel stuck. Even if your new idea doesn't work out, you will already have a pretty decent job with your certification.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, here are some tips for college...

(as in high school) Consider online classes if that's your thing! Especially the ones that allow you to work at your own pace. One time I finished a class in 2 weeks because I didn't want to pay for the access code. That freed up a LOT of time.

Job shadow!

Get involved in clubs and societies. If you have time, even try a leadership position.

Try to get internships over the summer.

Get involved in research in your department! This is an outstanding opportunity to develop professional connections and learn desirable skills.

Attend career fairs!

Don't necessarily rush to graduate, it's better to take a year longer and gain more experience so you're a good prospective employee. There are various opportunities available only to current students, so it would be hard to gain that experience after graduation.

hxa5bj,128,2020-07-24,i need help understanding cs basics so i can help my boyfriend feel better about his abilities,throwaway288552790,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hxa5bj/i_need_help_understanding_cs_basics_so_i_can_help/,"i don’t know if this is the right subreddit or not but i thought i’d give it a shot. posting from mobile so i apologize if anything reads weird.

we are both college students but my boyfriend is a computer science major and i am a social science major. i have no clue about programming or coding or computers in general other than when i used to change the colors of my tumblr blogs in the code. usually this is fine; he will explain what he’s working on as simply as he can and i will do my best to understand. 

however, he is nearing his senior year and is beginning to work on applying to jobs, internships, etc. he is also currently working part time for our school doing research. most days it goes great, but he has some days where he can’t figure something out and it can send him into a really negative state. just today, he had to do a quiz (or some test thing?) for an internship he had applied to. from what i can understand, it was 3 questions and he didn’t do very well in his mind. he can be very hard on himself and since i don’t know anything about programming, i don’t know if there’s such a thing as like partial credit? if that makes sense? he had a hard time talking about it but what he had said was that he was upset with himself because the questions had to do with freshman level stuff. 

my thought was that, at least in my experience, sometimes when you start learn more advanced stuff, you can forget the basics. sort of like in math when as you begin to learn the harder stuff, you may forget to add or subtract something because you’re too focused on the harder parts (is that a thing for other people? it was the best comparison i could think of). 

he kept saying that he must not be any good at programming if he forgot the basic stuff. i tried to tell him that 1. he is good at it or else he wouldn’t have been selected to work on the research project for the last few semesters and 2. you were caught surprise by the test and probably didn’t do as well because you were stressed out. 

i feel like i wasn’t able to help him because i couldn’t actually reassure his abilities. so i guess my question is: can someone explain the basics of programming to me? not even like actual tools, more like the thought process and abilities used in programming? for example, is there only one way to do certain programs or is it more individual? is it possible to get one part of a code correct and another wrong, or is it only ever right or wrong with no leeway? 

or, can anyone else testify to the idea that sometimes you forget the basics and make little mistakes in the code? i feel like he thinks that every programmer has to get everything right all the time, and it’d be nice if i could show him that other programmers make mistakes too and still thrive in the professional world.

i’m sorry if none of this makes sense, i just want to be able to reassure his confidence in programming and i don’t know how to do that. any advice at all is welcome."

I just finished my lower division CS courses, and wanted to look into applying for internships. However, my resume is really tooled toward previous work experience (read: food service), so I'm in the process of rewriting it. Aside from some knowledge in classes and GPA, I don't have much that's computer science related to put on my resume. Does anyone have any advice, articles or resources that could help me out?

I have a few decent ec's like that I've done for 2 years, 4 years, and 7 years respectively.  (2 are non CS) 

The 2 year and 4 year ones could be considered ""filler"" ones since everyone does it and the 7 year one is my main ec which I've been doing since 5th grade and the 7 year one can be essentially split into multiple ec's since I've done various things to help this community and participated competitvely in this.

The only cs thing I did was being on the programming team for ftc/frc robotics (2yr).

I have a 3.68 uw and a 4.01 w so its an eh in terms of grades and the only official thing thats mildly eye catching on my transcript is me finishing mvc/lin alg by the time i submit apps. And my sat is a 1420 and I cant change it bc of corona.

My cs stuff is all in self taught web development where my main projects are me building in MERN.  I self taught myself with about 5 udemy courses (webdev/data-structures) and 5+ Coursera courses( fields of theoretical cs) and my work is all on github along with my solo personal projects.

I didnt really care to apply for internships or compete in cs. Instead I chose to build lots of stuff over 1.5 years instead of doing usaco/internships/programming club. Is there like a way to display my work to the colleges listed below/ or explain the solo work i did because in web dev, seeing is believing and it could benefit my app if I had pictures.

How the hell am I ever gonna land a job when the demands are so high. I am literally sacrificing sleep to learn new languages and work on personal projects but when I look at these postings, it makes me think I will never be able to have these skills simply because being a full time student, having a job and learning things on the side just cannot be done at a fast enough pace by me.

However, that's a topic of discussion for another time.


I came across this specific comment, and it really resonated with me:


""But what if there's nothing you will even enjoy? At least without going to school for a ridiculous and unaffordable amount of time (like 8+ years). And unfortunately I'm not a genius or incredibly smart so I can't compete in programs like that, I would just be miserable. I have no idea what to do, I don't like any potential careers and it's depressing as fuck that I'll just have to kinda randomly pick something and be bored out of my mind spending most of my life doing it for the next 4 decades.""


Here's my personal journey so far as an ""adult"" and an explanation of why I share this attitude.


- I dropped out of four year college straight out of high school because I was unmedicated, and that ruined everything. First semester was fine but afterwards I pretty much stopped going to class, isolated myself in my room, got insanely depressed, mental breakdowns, the works.


- Moved back in with parents, moved to a different state. I wanted a fresh start so this seemed great. I decided to try a trade, industrial maintenance. Now, this was a bad decision in hindsight because I was 20 years old and never really worked in depth with tools and machinery, but at the encouragement


- About halfway through my internship I became medicated again (had to fight my parents tooth and nail for it which I still definitely resent them for), but I felt like I was too far behind for it to matter anymore. I managed to graduate community college with an associate's degree, and got a $25 dollar an hour job at a brake pad factory in maintenance. Good, good pay that let me move out for the first time and bought myself some nice things, but the 12 hour shifts, mandatory overtime in which I never got more than a Sunday off the daily work I """"did"""" was always so complicated, uncomfortable and nerve-wracking because the people on the production line would just stare and make me make stupid decisions and mistakes. Worst case scenario they would offer advice on how to do my job (which I admittedly may have needed but unsolicited crap still sucks), or just straight up be rude to me. I lasted a mere 6 months before the stress was too much I simply quit with no fallback.


- I've been working food service since then, which, while satisfying, also feels stressful and exhausting. The pay is just not good enough either, even if the job gives you good tips.


- My natural talents and hobbies do not have any real world application. I'm good at music and singing, but finding a consistent, well-paying job in that field is quite difficult from what I can imagine. Video games might be the one thing I've spent all my life doing the most, but I'm not interested in being a developer/producer/publisher, and unless you are insanely attractive, funny, or skilled, its VERY hard to become a successful streamer. My best classes in high school were English and History, but unless you want to be a teacher (which is one of the most disrespected and disregarded careers in America), there pretty much isn't a realistic job for you. Another thing I'm good at is impersonations, but no one really cares about that outside of a 1 minute novelty.


I'm just so overwhelmed and trying not to panic about a future that involves me just burning out on everything, working shitty jobs that I hate and other worst case scenario nightmares that just make everything feel worse than it really is.


Can anybody offer some advice or suggestions? Are we simply in the same boat?


I'm starting I'm just going to despise every job I work at, no matter what, which really doesn't help the feeling.


Thanks, sorry for the wall of text."

**Demographics:** Rising senior. Middle class White female. Fairly competitive highschool in Georgia.

mother is a cancer patient, both parents are college drop outs. 

**Intended Major:** Not quite sure yet. Perhaps a communications major.  

**SAT:** Have not taken it yet, but I will at the beginning of August. I honestly have no idea how I'll perform, but I will likely take it as often as I can until I reach a 1500. 

**Cumulative GPA (Weighted):** 97.7

**Cumulative GPA (Unweighted):** 4.208

**Class Rank:** I’m currently #13 out of 232.

**Coursework:** 
  2 APs sophomore year: APES (3) and APUSH (3). 4 APs Junior year: AP Psych (5), AP Gov (5), AP Lang (5), AP Bio (Haven't received my score yet due to email submission :( )

I Will be taking AP Calc AB next year, but I'm afraid that my schedule won't be rigorous enough. I haven't got my schedule yet so the only classes that I know for certain that I will be taking are AP Calc, Adv Physics, and Mandarin online since it's not offered at my school. Would love some advice!

**Awards:** AP Scholar with Honor (2020), Nominated for GHP (2020), I was nominated for quite a bit of other stuff but I haven't really been one to get many awards. Will that be detrimental to my application? lmao maybe i can write in my essays that im a try hard failure. 

**ECs:**

1. Started a writing foundation (9th- to now) It focuses on introducing writing competitions to local students and fundraising in order to donate to nonprofit organizations that reach out to improve literacy in underdeveloped countries. We also focus on fundraising to help improve the language arts departments in local schools. I constructed the website for it and it has been mentioned in a local paper.
2. Language Arts Tutor (10th-now) I teach grammar and creative writing to elementary-level children at a local private school.
3. Muay Thai (since 7th grade) I practiced the art of Muay Thai for quite some time. I haven't been involved in any competitive fights as of yet.
4. Last year I set up a clothing business in which I thrift for clothing, repurpose them or rework them, and then sell them. I've designed and sold a pair of shoes as well in the process. My favorite part was marketing the whole thing :)
5. Since sophomore year, I've been writing to inmates and learning their stories. I've reached out to a local newspaper and have had the stories of the inmates published in small segments. After my brother was arrested, I became extremely motivated to know about the inside of the prison system and inside of the minds of those that inhabit it. 
6. I published a short story ebook. I was super passionate about it, but I'm not sure if it'll stand out on applications due to the ease with which anyone can publish an ebook. I definitely need advice on this. :)
7. Intern for my father's city council campaign (10th)
8. The marketing director of a photography company started by my father. (10th-present). (I'm not sure if I should tell the colleges that it was my father's business or leave it fairly vague).
9. (11th-present) Social Media Coordinator of my school's environmental club.
10. Member of SGA (9th-present), NHS (9th-present), TSA (9th-10th; went to state twice). These don't really seem to have any relevance in my spike, and I didn't hold any leadership positions in them, so I'm a bit hesitant about whether or not I should include any of them on my common app. 

**Essays/LORs:** I'm pretty confident in my writing and creativity, as am I confident in my teacher recommendations :)

**Schools:** I'm really interested in NYC colleges; Rochester, Columbia, Pace, NYU, but UChicago has also been on my mind recently. I know that the majority of the ones I have listed are likely reaches for me, so I definitely want some advice on what my target schools should be!! I'm also super drawn to colleges out of the country, but I think I'll leave that for another post. :)"

I have to either go through one year of internship or scientific initiation to graduate (I can also choose to do neither, but it's probably a bit harder that way). The problem is that internships here pay very poorly and take so much time that I'd have to put my studies second and delay my graduation a bit. And I pretty much don't care about networking, since I'm planning to leave the country as soon as possible.

I have no idea how much one year of experience as an intern would matter when trying to land a graduate job in EU. Does it technically count as one year of ""work experience""? Or are most companies just gonna completely disregard one year of internship in Brazil?

I'm guessing that, regardless, scienfic initiation would be completely useless? It would be way more chill to go through, though, I think. Choosing it might help me graduate one semester early.

I guess the most important question is, does this choice even matter at all, do companies care about these things in EU? And if so, what would you personally recommend?

How do I get my foot in the door?,Umbra321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hxdfi5/graduated_cum_laude_but_feel_completely/,"Title pretty much sums it up. I went through four years of university at NYU and just recently graduated in the top 15% of the college of arts and sciences as a whole in the computer science program. I always did well throughout school, and I deeply love coding, but now that I’m out of school I feel completely demoralized.

I have applied to probably 100 software development positions and have yet to have had a single interview, despite the fact that my college’s resume grader rates my resume above 90%. I’m watching the people I tutored through classes throughout school get jobs and move on with their lives and I just feel stuck. I have ADHD and it was undiagnosed until a year ago. Now that I am taking medication my levels of self motivation have risen greatly (am spending 4+ hours a day reviewing linear algebra and teaching myself machine learning on top of hour long blocks for a personal website, javafx program, guitar, and Japanese language learning) but I feel like I can’t make up for never having had an internship or any actual work experience. Despite the fact that I am extremely adapt at college level CS, I am the first to admit that I have 0 industry knowledge and find myself struggling to even figure out how to create and structure a graphical application that doesn’t run on command line. I want so desperately to get over this hurdle, and I have such a passion for learning, but my heart aches realizing that it just doesn’t matter. No one is going to teach me, and I’m really struggling to find resources to teach myself outside of being taught in an internship or job.

I feel like every job I apply to wants 5+ years of work experience and knowledge of 10+ different frameworks I’ve never worked with. These are just the entry level positions. Applying for jobs daily has been so stressful because just looking at those requirements makes me feel like I’ve completely failed during my time at college to make myself at all marketable to the workforce. I didn’t struggle with pointers when I switched from java to c. Dynamic programming immediately made sense. I’ve literally built a basic naive bayes classification algorithm for class in under 4 hours. I know that I can do this stuff with the right resources, but I don’t even know where to begin. There are so many CS concepts that college didn’t teach me and I spend so much of my time trying to find any kind of useful resource to teach this stuff to me. I started to build a javafx application so that I could have something to spruce up my github with, but I got to a point where I needed more than one page and realized I had no idea how to structure the project with multiple pages and controllers. I have spent more time trying to find a decent guideline than I have actually coding. 

I guess I just wanted to know if there was anyone out there feeling like me right now. I just don’t know how to get my foot in the door. I love this field, and I want to be able to use it to do good, continue learning, and hopefully amass a decent amount of money that I can liberally donate to those who need it more than I do. Thank you for reading, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. These last few weeks have been taxing on my mental health. Really wish I hadn’t graduated into an economic recession with 60k plus dollars worth of student loans and little support from my immediate family."

I'm currently a student in the Johns Hopkins Bioinformatics MS and I'm finding it very disappointing. My undergrad degree is in Biology and until enrolling in the MS I didn't have any programming/computer science training. The classes I've taken through the Engineering program (data structures, algorithms) have been decent (I am a big fan of Eleanor Chlan) and the classes through the AAP school (biology courses including Molecular Biology, Introduction to Bioinformatics, and now epigenetics), have been very standard courses, except for Introduction to Bioinformatics which was terrible (the ""lectures"" were typed notes riddled with spelling errors, I was given a viral sequence as my chosen sequence for the semester which meant that I couldn't do many of the assignments which were geared towards Eukaryotic sequences, and many of the websites we were told to use for analyses hadn't been updated since the late '90s). I also can not seem to reach my advisor, who doesn't answer his emails. I had been hoping to do research with a professor and/or participate in the internship they advertised as options during the information session, but that's going to be hard without some direction from my advisor. Finally, I'm waitlisted for the only few classes from the program that other people on Reddit have mentioned as being any good (Gene Expression Data Analysis and Visualization and Bioinformatics: Tools for Genome Analysis), with no indication of when/if I'll get off the waitlist (again, because my advisor doesn't answer emails). Sorry for all of that...suffice to say I'm panicked that I'm throwing my money into a hole. I feel bad because I should have known that this program was sketchy when it didn't require GRE or letters or recommendation, and statistics is an OPTIONAL class (what?) 

I know a lot of posts here are related to how you don't need a Master's degree to do bioinformatics and there is much you can learn by working on a project independently; however I'm just really overwhelmed and I really feel like I need a mathematically rigorous program to get me started so I can really understand how to work with large datasets in biology, understand things like modelling and machine learning, as well as to get the perspective from professors who active researchers in the field of computational biology. And also formal career-related classes, networking opportunities, and research experience/opportunity to write a thesis all seem like they would help me get off the ground in terms of finding a job.

Anyway, does anyone know if transferring to a different, better MS program is an option? And if so, which would you recommend? (FYI I started out at JHU so I could complete online while working but I would rather go full time to an in person MS program at this point since they seem more likely to be better). Thanks for reading this and I really appreciate the help!"

I always hear that a business administration/business major whether it’s specialization is in finance, marketing, MIS, supply chain, etc all require networking/connections. But are getting internships PURELY based on your connections and how well you’re able to present or network with professionals? I know sometimes they might want some soft skills but to me it feels like business majors don’t typically need a prior set of skills beforehand when applying and it almost feels like all you need is to have a lot of friends. The same applies for getting jobs after college which typically comes from internship experience anyway. 

Like for engineering it’s not all connections because they do wanna see some prior experiences in clubs with designing, CAD, using software and etc"

At the end of the internship I talked with the manager about it and he told me that he prefers to code instead of managing people. It turns out that he's been a manager for 2  years, which allowed me to understand where he was coming from. I advised him that my goal is to transition towards Technical Program Management or Product Management within the next few years, his response was ""You know you can make the same amount of money as a software dev"". I was given a return offer as Senior Softw. Eng. to return to Austin under him, to which I accepted. Fast forward 9 months, which is a month before my start date, my relocation gets cancelled and the start date gets pushed back 4 months. I haven't heard from the manger since my internship and I've noticed that he randomly checks my linkedin at midnight. 

A few weeks ago a recruiter from another company reached out about a position with their company and how they are onboarding immediately and remotely. I decided to interview to see what they are looking for. The position turns out to be better aligned with my career goals of TPM, but the title is ""Software Developer"" as I'll have to do TPM work and Dev work. Compared to the offer in Austin it pays 30k more as base salary and 15k more as a sign on bonus, but I may have to move to seattle next year depending on the pandemic and have to communicate with the India Office in the evening.

In deciding which to go with I would like to ask:

Does the Title matter? ""Senior Software Engineer"" vs ""Software Developer""

May anyone share their experience working unconventional hours or on calls with those in India?

I prefer the Seattle offer, but I would prefer to live in Austin. The Seattle company has an office in Austin, so If I go with them I plan to request to move to Austin after a few years. Anyone done something similar?"

I hope to hear some advice from here

1) is it better to go into MSc Bioinformatics and take more elective courses on IT skills such as ML, Algorit, Data mining? Or to go into data science which opens to more job opportunities? 

2) any recommended university for MSc  in europe, asia pacific region?

I'm unsure if this is the right space to post it, but let me just start by saying that just a few days I thought of ending my life. I know what I'm going to do, and how I'm going to do it so that it will end quickly. I don't know what I'm seeking for here. Money? Advice? Words of encouragement? I really don't know. Perhaps anything. Perhaps nothing.

\- First official depression prognosis started since high school from bullying in 2007. Internalised homosexual tendencies.

\- Pre-college studies affected/delayed by a year, sexually assualted when doing national service where I was. Kept quiet because I'm a guy and it was by another man. Got properly diagnosed with general and social anxiety disorder. It happened too long ago, but scarred me deeply. I kept quiet and just kept it in.

\- Travelled alone for a bit and was okay, but university came, and felt like I was in the wrong place. Had multiple leaves of absences because I wasn't coping. Met some friends for life who kept me alive, met more than didn't stay. However, accummulated a high amount of student loan because of this. Currently on hiatus from university, even when I just turned 29 2 weeks ago.

\- Met the man of my life in university, went through 6 years and a lot of shit together. He was my beacon and support for the longest time. However, this guy left me because he felt like I wasn't going anywhere (which was because of inaction or lack of achievements caused by my depression) and he lost feelings for me. He was unable to empathize with my depression because of the way he was brought up, and saw it as laziness or just plain wasting my life away. He broke up with me late november in 2019 and I'm still not over him. This experience still has a leading impact on my mental stability. I ended up doing many stupid things after (some while heavily intoxicated), and I can say for certain that I sabotaged any lingering bridges between the both of us. He's not a bad person.

\- Family are not supportive of my sexual identity. As an asian family, there were high hopes and expectations on studies and success. Also we were mid-low class and we don't have much financial sustainability. My parents, they are not bad people. They work hard, but they are not highly educated. I had to learn a lot of things on my own. I have been supporting myself for the longest time, even if I still stay with my parents. We don't communicate much, the times we do are usually very abrasive, and I feel mostly isolated and alone.

\- Found my passion for the arts and drive in the media/broadcast tv industry through several career opportunities in the forms of external ad-hoc internships during the times when I was looking for something to do while on leave of absences. However, the lack of an official paper qualifications led them all going nowhere. The last stint ended in end of April when Covid got serious and I was let go because I was expendable. Ultimately, much experience, but very little income, and with my age, I'm unable to compete for entry level jobs with fresh graduates with the right qualifications. Besides, I have a lot of debts and no money to start another diploma or degree elsewhere, which is something at the back of my mind but never able to achieve. I have maybe $2k usd to my name in terms of expendable cash.

\- It has been roughly 3 months since I'm unemployed and not doing anything, and while I'm still on hiatus from university, I have to decide by the end of the year if I was to continue or terminate my matriculation. I'm in my final year, but I'm severely tormented with the idea of forcing myself through for something that I am not wishing to do in the future, and that it will take a further toll on my mental health. But if I leave, it would be years and money wasted. I have

\- Right now I'm juggling between part time work but even those are scarce and few, heavily strenous and I feel like it's not enriching. I've been sending out resumes and applications but always met with rejection. I tried seeking remote jobs as well like ways to sustain making money online, but always hitting a wall. I'm basically powering through just to earn some money to sustain myself, and it has been a struggle everyday.

\- I never thought I was unintelligent, but I think my low level of confidence, my inferiority complex, abandonment issues with the breakup, isolation from my family, my financial burdens and the hopelessness of not being able to go anywhere in life with so much potential, has caused me a lot of mental anguish. I struggle with sleep everyday, and I wake up everyday feeling worse, wishing I did better. I'd like to think if I was given another opportunity or more resources in life, I will have done much better and to never fall into this state. Alas, everything is always better in hindsight.

\- It's easy to say that you're comparing oranges to apples, but when I look at my peers or close friends around me, most if not all of them are in a better place than me. Maybe they were born in a better environment, maybe they have met supportive people in their lives, maybe they all chose wiser with what they wanted to do in life, and here I am, feeling stuck and incredously bopeless. I know, there is definitely someone out there who has it worse off than me, but the darkness is so overpowering that I do not know how to continue with life. I wonder everyday when is the day I will finally have the courage to choose to go so that I can relieve myself from this pain. I'm not okay. I wonder if you, reading this, have any resources or pearls of wisdom for me."

I don't know if this is appropriate for here but my question is Ireland specific. 

I recently completed my M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering with a thesis was focused on using Java to develop an AR App for manufacturing and thouroughly enjoyed it more than any other project over the course of my degree. Between that and an awful mechanical engineering internship, that got me thinking and I realised I like nothing about being a mechanical engineer from salaries, locations and job satisfaction. After some research, I want to pivot into SWE or more preferrably product development/product management. 

I'm looking at possible routes and I'm currently doing CS50 and a Coursera Java course to get a better foundation but I still feel like it won't be enough. So what I'm asking is whether a [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) Computer Science conversion degree in UCD would be worth doing (16 months) to be better regarded for roles since it would be a primarlily CS degree? Is there any weekend CS bootcamps worth doing? Is there anything similar in mainland europe with a more stomachable fee than UCD?   


My only problem would be doing another masters so soon after this one and dropping another 9k for it as I have a good grad job lined up while my classmates have none and a few grand debt to pay.

Has anyone here gone a similiar route from Mech Eng into SWE/Product?

This broke my brother's heart as his aim was to mention this project in his resume.

Currently my brother is waiting for another side project in a lab(he completed his degree this may) under the same professor. He waited for the official paper allowing him to stay in the US as after 90 days from graduation he would be deported if he doesn't gets a job/joins a lab. He came to know yesterday that HR is not responsible for this delay(this happend in a company where he did his intern) and that his professor is doing this. He also said that the professor wants to present the project in front of government officials (project is funded by US gov.) Meaning that my brother won't get any recognition even now.

My brother even cleared an interview for job in US department of energy (via the help of professor).
The problem was that there weren't any vacancy in his state and he had to go washington DC for job.
The board members had forwarded their interview results to DC via professor. But the professor has rejected this because he simply didn't know anybody there and would not be able to do PhD(my brother earlier had an idea to PhD) if he had joined the job.
He basically completely screwed over my brother

Later I went back to community college and just got my Computer Maintence degree in Biomedical Tech and Networking. (I am aiming for bio tech)


 I did an internship at a hospital but not for long bc of covid.

People have called, but many places are on pause due to covid (or maybe my resume sucks) I feel my years of experience is very off putting and although future interviews make me feel like i have imposters syndrome, I don't even get call backs. I really do think I know my stuff though.

Hate my current job bc the pay is too low and i really just want to start my career asap. I graduated a couple months ago. :( 

TLDR; should I up my years of experience? How to i get a cert without a job for cheap? Lol"

Most jobs, from my understanding, require references that are ideally former supervisors in related roles. 

Well, I have only really worked at my one current company for my entire career thus far, and even was an intern here beforehand. Across this time, I've had only two managers; one is no longer at the company, and I'm certain will be willing to give me a reference. The other is my current manager. 

Since I've never actually been asked to provide job references before, I have a few questions going into my job search:

**How many references are candidates usually asked to provide?** Are they required to be supervisors in relevant roles (ie those on my resume)?

**When do companies usually ask candidates to provide references in the recruitment process?** Is this usually after an offer has been extended, or before? If it's the latter, I'm hesitant to tip off my current manager about my job search if I'm not guaranteed an offer yet. But I'm not sure who I could ask in his place if asked for multiple references.

**How long is too long for asking a former employer for a reference?** I did have another manager I could potentially ask during an old internship, half a decade ago.  We were on good terms, so it is probably really stupid of me to have neglected a professional relationship, but I haven't made an effort to stay in touch with her since. Would it be rude/unprofessional for me to reach out *now* asking for a reference? I just don't want to come off as unprofessional, like I only care reach out when I need something (even though I guess that's what I'm doing). Or is doing so considered acceptable?

**What's the general etiquette around asking people for references?** Do I reach out every time I'm interviewing with a new company and tell them ""company X might contact you"" or do I just ask them once to be a general reference, and assume they may expect multiple different companies to reach out to them without me giving them a heads up for each specific case? 

Any advice would be much appreciated."

I'm skeptical of it being worth doing. Currently the only benefit I see from it is getting actual work experience since I have never held a job before. I do have decent IT knowledge which I think is a little more than the average CS student because I'm obsessed with learning about old technology standards, building PCs, modifying my Windows OS, using virtual machines, etc.


I do plan on going into web development after I finish my degree, and I think I am close to having the knowledge of a professional front end developer when it comes to HTML and CSS. 

Here's an example of my work:

https://2bit.neocities.org (My site isn't very mobile friendly yet, but I have made some webpages that are.)


I think learning more IT than I need to is kind of a waste of time when I could be learning more CS. I was reading here that employers in CS mainly don't care about IT certs since I thought about getting an IT cert to put on a future resume for a software engineering job. I know this job will teach me how to function in a working environment though. If I work there for three months, I think it could be worth it, but nothing beyond that. I'm going to have a few gaps in my curriculum where I can't do full course load because I saved all my CS classes for last (I'm transferring from community college). I think by next year I should be able to do an internship in CS, and I am thinking I might as well intern there as a first job as opposed to IT. 


What are your thoughts?"

I am wanting to find someone that is just genuinely in love with programming. They could be novice or intermediate. I am not a high level programmer by no means.

A little bit of my background:

I know java and C# the best but have been slowly making the change to python. (once you know one language you basically know them all) I had a .Net Developer Intern and then moved on to the company i am at now which is more java oriented. I would prefer someone that would want to learn more about python but I'd also be perfectly happy working at a higher level with C# and Java. I am still in college and I just completed my mobile app 1 in java (android studio) and my mobile app 2 is in c# (xamarin) so I am always using both languages, my school just doesnt offer python, well online since im a full time online student

I'd prefer someone on the east coast just because of time zone but anything within the US would be perfectly fine as well. 

Feel free to ask anyquestions below, and i would prefer to use discord for comms/screensharing.

I am  currently an software engineering intern at a faang company, and am set  to start an 8 month internship at a startup doing computer vision in  September. In addition, I have a conference paper that will be published  in October.

How much of a  disadvantage would it be to apply in late September or October rather  than August? If I apply later I have the opportunity to highlight the  internship at a startup as well as a publication on my cv (and in an  interview).

I will try to be short as possible.

I studied hardcore Shipbuilding and Ocean engineering but when I finished I knew that I didn't want to do that job so somehow I landed a job as an Jr. SEO Analyst and got into digital marketing. After working there for 5 months I didn't like the job a lot so I switched to online advertisement management position (google ads, facebook ads, google analytics etc). I have worked there for around 15 months.

During my time in online ads I felt like a digital blue collar while working in a digital marketing agency so I wanted to improve myself and my self confidence with a Masters so by hard work and luck I got accepted to second best MBA program in my country with 100% scholarship.

Now the MBA is finished but I am not sure what to do with my career. Because of my past, digital marketing jobs fit my profile but I feel like I also want to swiTch to more business/strategy/finance side of things.

For example I saw a job post in Glassdoor, it was for finance executives and it was about selling global loans and it says that it doesn't have a specific working time and depending on the performance you can make about $200k to $600k a year which is mind blowing for Turkey especially. So how can I switch to jobs that I don't have an internship or background (for example business development, finance analyst, strategy analyst etc)

And I know that my mind is so confused, so also maybe you can offer me a way or a source to help me with knowing what I want better and narrow down my choices.

hxz5el,4,2020-07-25,Georgetown vs Northeastern,MirrorFellow,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hxz5el/georgetown_vs_northeastern/,"Hi folks,

I just got in off the extended-extended waitlist for Georgetown, and I'm having a little bit of trouble deciding whether I should go to Georgetown or the school that I am currently committed to, Northeastern University. I'm a psych major who's looking to become a psychiatrist, so I'm also pre-med. There are pros and cons to both schools, and it's becoming a little stressful to make a decision (the fact that I have to have the decision in by Monday doesn't necessarily help). I was wondering if you guys could give me your guidance as to what I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

Northeastern:

Pros  
\- $19K Scholarship  
\- Co-op program - obviously internships are very important at Georgetown but to my knowledge there isn't anything as integrated as the Northeastern co-op program  
\- Very very flexible in case I decide I want to change my major  
\- I'm already very much set to go at Northeastern - classes mapped out, etc. It's going to be difficult to have to redo literally everything if I switch to Georgetown this abruptly.  
\- Very small, and probably doesn't affect anything, but have two very close friends that are going with me to Northeastern, and a different friend's brother, who is a year older than us, also goes there. It's kind of nice to have a built in social group going into college, and to have a friend who already knows what's going on with the school - someone I can go to if I ever have any questions or ever encounter any problems.  


Cons  
\- Northeastern is a great school, and has pretty good recognition, but it's just not on the level of Georgetown  
\- Boston is great, I love Boston and I'm more familiar with Boston, it's the quintessential college town and I love that, but in terms of academic and career opportunities it just doesn't compare with DC.  
\- I think that Georgetown is handling the COVID situation just a tad better than Northeastern is  


Georgetown

Pros  
\- Prestige. As I stated before, Northeastern is great and has good recognition, but it's just not on the level of Georgetown.  
\- DC is a phenomenal city with great opportunities for internships, as well as being home to a bunch of great institutions  
\- Georgetown has a medical school and a hospital, and since I'm looking to apply to med school that's huge.  
\- A lot smaller than Northeastern. To put it bluntly, Northeastern is a giant school, and although I feel I could still do well in that environment, it can be a little bit overwhelming at times. I kind of feel like Georgetown is the perfect size.  
\- Another small thing, but the Georgetown campus and the Georgetown neighborhood are pretty gorgeous.  


Cons  
\- Much more expensive. I'd be turning down about $80,000, which is not chump change. I have a younger sister who's going into junior year and looking at similar colleges, so, that $80,000 could help her, and my family.  
\- I've always heard that Georgetown is extremely political. To put it bluntly, my personal mantra with regard to the political sphere is ""politics poisons everything"". I very much like to keep my political beliefs to myself, and I really don't want to get involved in political discussions. It's not that I couldn't handle that, but I would really prefer to not be in a hugely political environment.  
\- It's going to stink having to restart, especially in such a short time - not only with regard to me already being set at Northeastern and having chose my classes and met my advisors and such, but socially as well. As stated before, it's nice to be going into college with a set social group  
\- It's a bit harder to get to from where I live than Northeastern. Not huge, but it'd be nice to be a little bit closer to home.  
\- Another small thing, but I feel like if I jump ship from Northeastern right now I'd be burning a bridge for students from my high school who want to apply in the future. I've seen it happen with my own two eyes with other schools, and I really don't want to be ""that guy"".  


I'm really having trouble with this, so I would appreciate any input you guys have. Thank you so much for your help in advance."

hxzu5c,4,2020-07-25,My internship doesn’t know I just got a second internship opportunity and idk if I should tell them,environstudent,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/hxzu5c/my_internship_doesnt_know_i_just_got_a_second/,"Hello fellow engineering students. I am reaching out to any engineering students or anyone that may have any feedback on my current situation. Here is a small background of my situation so you get an idea of what is happening. So I have been interning for a City for 8 months already. 

Before accepting the job offer the City mentioned how the internship was going to be a 1 year internship. I never asked what would happen after the 1 year was over since it didn’t really cross my head until now. About a month ago I got a call for another job offer that I applied for a year ago and how the position opened up and they asked if I was still interested. I told them I would need a day or two to think about it where I thought that it would be a good idea to have a backup since I am not sure what is going to happen after the one year is over with my current internship. 

I was a bit unsure at first since I am currently doing summer school where I am taking fluid mechanics, mechanics of materials and internship class to receive credit. I was also working 3 days and doing full 8 hour shifts each day. I asked some of my close engineering friends for advice on whether to take this job offer which was a great opportunity since this internship would like to keep me until I graduate and after I graduate offer me a full time which is why I wanted to accept the offer. 

After I talked to my friends they told me to go for it that it wasn’t going to be easy. This is the first time I have worked two jobs while also going to school and it has been a bit stressful since my current internship does not know that I have another job. I asked my current job if I would be able to reduce my hours from 3 days (24 hours) to 2 days (16 hours) to be able to make it work for my new internship. The plan was to work at my first internship on Mondays and Wednesday’s. Work on Tuesdays before class and Friday. I have class on Tuesdays and Thursday from 2:45-4:50PM &amp; 5-7:05PM. 

Before accepting the offer at my new internship they were able to work with me since they know that I am doing another internship at the moment and they are being flexible by allowing me to work 12 hours at moment but are expecting me to work 20 hours once my current internship is over which is in 4 months. 

I wanted to ask those who have maybe been in a similar situation as mine of whether I should tell my current internship that I got another job. I been very indecisive of whether I should tell them or not since I believe if I do it is going to make them think I am going to leave them or ruin my reputation overall. My bff who is interning at moment believes that I should tell them to avoid any problems in the future and so my current internship can work with me/ be more understanding. I agree with her but I am afraid they are going to get upset or get the wrong idea since I am going to have to choose one but I am going to have to think about that once the time comes."

This summer I have a SWE internship (mostly full stack) where I've been learning node, react, and typescript. I'm nowhere near proficient in them, but I'm loving it. I've also been interested in fluent ui (microsoft's creation). With these newfound skills growing, and my graduation from college upcoming next spring, I would like to create a website (functional for both mobile and desktop) to show off some skills, largely learning along the way. I want to go through the entire process from no code to hosting it somewhere (possibly aws, github, whatever is best). Essentially, my idea is to make a productivity site for myself that I would use and also benefit others and my resume. 

1. What are the best frameworks/languages/stacks to use for this? What's most desired and marketable?
2. Where can I find useful resources for going about this process? I can pretty easily develop simple features in my current job's codebase, but merely because it's well designed and starting from scratch is much more complicated and I would have no idea where to start

I once took about 3 days of re-reading and typing out code just to get through 1 page when I was learning arrays. 

by by the way i'm reading from my textbook, ""C++ from Control Structures to Objects by Gaddis"" and this a very beginner-friendly textbook plus i'll watch tutorials on youtube here and there.

My ex broke up with me in April 2020 . During our 3 year relationship, I supported her idea that she wanted to post on RedditGW to increase her body confidence and sexuality. To me, sincerely, it was no harm. She used to do burlesque and pole dancing for a hobby and side job. Plus, it felt cool that I could help her take some of the photos and videos from location scouting, lingerie choices, backdrop, composition to poses etc. It became a thing that every hotel or nice scenic spot we found, we would attempt a photo for her Reddit career. The boundaries that I told her was just to be smart about it (no face, no obvious things that can tie her back to her normal life, mutual secrecy of this in the beginning, so no one we know finds out and I dont want to be in it). She happily agreed and did fairly well and throughout the entire relationship. Everything was fine and things were up and up. Sweet upvotes were rolling in, boys! (for her but hey)

Around late last year, she wanted to start an Only Fans account. She says she just wanted to move her RedditGW efforts there and try to earn some money. She is in university trying to get into the police force and any extra income would benefit her alot. She has an internship that doesnt pay well (now in 2020, that internship is no more because of the pandemic). I said sure. Her content (including her Reddit) was always soft core and some BDSM stuff with her sex toys and lingerie (kinda like your typical softcore GW poster). Honestly, she was more confident with her body now and she felt great. I was sincerely happy for her and I was subscribed to all of her stuff to show my support (liking every post etc. She told me she felt great that she finally had someone that supported her ideas). Her Only Fans took off and she kept me updated sparingly as in how much she made or how many followers she had. Both of us were celebrating her success. I made it clear that all the money she made is hers to keep but she promised to use it to help pay for her schooling or family stuff.

Come March 2020, she stopped updating and she kinda felt awkward about updating me on her progress. She apparently got outside help from someone without telling me to help her optimize her Only Fans for more exposure and followers. I was shocked and had a discussion with her on the boundaries we had set. Two months prior to the breakup she mentioned that she became more daring in her Only Fans creations by showing her face in pictures and stream and having stuff in the background that easily shows who she was and where she lived near by. I reminded her to be smart about it (so nothing can be physically traced back to her) but she assertively reminded me that this is her stuff and it is under her control. Come April, the break up happened. She broke up with me by phone because we cant meet up due to the her dad said no to the quarantine conditions at the time (honestly, her dad of all reasons? I still think that's a pathetic excuse to not do a face to face breakup after being together but I digress). She then blocks me on all social media and phone.

Last week, my friend asked me to go check twitter on my phone because of a Trump tweet or something really funny. I redownloaded twitter and checked it when I was home. Accidentally, I stumbled on my feed/wall and the first thing I saw was her Only Fans twitter account that I followed long time ago. The next part is still somewhat traumatizing me til this day. The latest post was her and her best friend \[26/M\] in doggy position with the tweet promoting the teaser of the video on her OnlyFans. My entire insides felt like it dropped and time stood still. This best friend was the dude I had been helping, driving around, consoled him regarding his suicide attempt and treated like a brother throughout the entire relationship. I immediately unfollowed the twitter account, deleted the app and turned my phone off. I opened my journal (that's how I deal with the breakup and process my emotions during) to just pour out what I accidentally saw. The best friend was also dating another girl by the way. I dont know the status of that relationship if both of them were poly or something.

I called my two closest people that know about the whole thing the next day. They told me basically she is her own person and if she wants to make literally hardcore porn or more, I cant really do anything about it. Both her and him are consenting adults who probably don't see the repurcussion of their actions yet or are aware of it but the money is probably too good. They calmed me down and here I am today.

**How is OP doing?** My mental headspace is I do still miss my ex and i want the best for her but it comes and goes like waves. To see that (and that being my first time seeing my ex again since the breakup), was not a ideal to say the least. Part of me says fuck it, pay the OnlyFans anonymously to see how ""bad"" it is and how her growth has been on the platform. The other rational side of me says, why inflict myself with this form of self harm and she chose to do this (with or without me) to herself. I do sometimes think and worry about how this is going to probably backfire in a couple of years down the road when she finally graduates and is working.

As for me, I'm focusing on the career that Im in. Initially, I took the position in my job/career in 2018 (during the relationship) because it was the best option to provide a stable foundation and to show her parents that I'm secure and serious about her. Thinking back as I'm writing this, if the pandemic didnt happen, we would have gone to Asia in May and I would have bought a ring and probably proposed to her after the trip. Probably dodged a bullet there. As I mentioned, my journalling allows me to process all my emotions throughout this breakup and pandemic. I feel like I am miles ahead of what and who I was in Apri thanks to it.

Now my question to all of you is, do you have any advice to provide to me for processing this? or to move on etc? Any advice is much appreciated. I have reoccuring thoughts that I did this to her. If I had said no to the RedditGW thing, we probably would have still been dating or something. I was told she would have done it regardless if I said no. Yet, part of me blames myself for her spiralling down this path. Im not lost but confused after I saw that. I don't plan to confront her or him on the issue as I ""feel"" it isn'y my problem to begin with. Am I the asshole boyfriend for not supporting her enough or correctly?

**Reddit, I will not give out any information about her OnlyFans or username. No, I don't plan to anonymously inform her work place or family about her OnlyFans. No, I dont want anything to do with revenge porn or whatever.**

**this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons**"

I love algorithmic programming. I've created a few GUI based applications and I liked it. I want to learn low-level stuff operating system, compilers, embedded systems etc. For example, I like game dev but I don't like using unity because it takes all the hard stuff like vector maths out.
The problem is nearly every internship in my area is in Web Dev. There are few jobs in non web stack but mostly of FAANG. I have started studying Data Structure and Algorithms but I doubt I would be able to reach a level crack FAANG.

So covid came and I started working home for three months. I wasn't being productive because my University amped up the amount of work and it's difficulty, and my priority is stop paying that shit first. I'm not worried since there are two people in my sector and I'm the only one that messes with this code since my boss never touched it. In June they called us back, the numbers were too little and apparently controlled on my state.

Then my stupid president happened and the cases raised like crazy. We kept working all through June with the office with almost no one in with. The owner then sent us home by the end of June saying it was too dangerous.

The cases are rising rapidly in my state, then the lady that is home since the beginning of it all says we will come back on Monday. It's so dumb. Our work is the same wherever, actually I'm working better since I get plus four hours without commute, meaning sleeping better, eating better and better mood. But no we need to come back. I live with my mother that is an old lady with diabetes. A dangerous case.

They just want me there to see me working. But do you know what is dumb? They don't give a duck about our job. I don't have someone to go to when something happens, I have to learn by myself, and when I say something it's just ignored. It pisses me off how in their little minds it's ""oh, they've got to be here to work well"".

I mean no. The worst of all is they wanna hire me, and okay, good I need the benefits for my father but I will have to work 44 hours a week on top of studying full time, all so maybe I can realize my biggest dream of getting out of my mom's house.

There's no need for that much time of work when most of time they almost give us no job but we extend it so they don't say ""why are you not working"". And despite this we can't do nothing. I was once reprimanded for staying in the bathroom for too long ( I usually stay there for about ten to fifteen minutes),  talking to others for too long and going to the bathroom without marking I got out of labor time first. 

I fucking hate this world man."

hy2jna,11,2020-07-26,"[IWantOut] 22M USA -&gt; France, Student",StrongNews9,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/hy2jna/iwantout_22m_usa_france_student/,"Hi all, 

I'm hoping this does not become a wall of text, but I want to do my best to provide as many details as possible to help you all. I am starting a one year MA program in Economics at my local American university (generic state school) this fall. I graduated in Spring with a bachelor's in economics and a bachelor's in French. I do want to study a more specific field of economics or related subject, but I do not wish to pursue a full PhD. I've been looking at French universities because a) I enjoyed myself during my study abroad year (fall 2018-spring 2019) in France, b) I would like to try working and living in France more permanently, and c) it's far less expensive than in the US. From what I understand, getting accepted to public universities shouldn't be a problem. I have good grades at my American university, and I did pretty well in my econ classes in France. I passed one L2, one L3, two M1 classes, and failed a L1 accounting class. I passed the DALF C1 before I left, so language is not a problem. However, I am concerned about if it's even possible for me to go again, and I have some questions about steps I can take to establish myself more permanently if it is.

I have three main questions: 

1. I had to overstay my student visa when I was there to finish the school year, let me explain. When I applied for my visa, I did all the necessary paperwork, had all the correct documents, did everything Campus France wanted, etc. The worker at the visa center even thanked me for having everything ready. I received my passport about one week before departure (late August), but instead of being valid through June like I intended, my visa was only valid through late February. I still have no idea how the hell this happened. My documents from my US university, my landlord, the form the agent at the visa center signed, everything said I would be there at least through June! It was too late to change anything, so I left to do the fall semester as planned. I went to the prefecture, which said that I would need to fly back to the United States to redo the entire visa application for the spring. With how long the process is, it would be impossible for me to arrive back on time for spring classes, so I stayed to complete my school year. Except for a one week trip to Germany for Christmas (when my visa was still valid), I never left France, though I did take the train to other cities a few times. For the flight back to America, the officer noticed the expired visa, and asked if I had any plans to return in the immediate future. I said no, and she handed me my passport. I don't think she stamped it, typed into a computer, nothing. My question is: if I were to apply to a master's program in France, is my visa application going directly into a trash can because of my previous visa nightmare? An expat I met in my classes told me that the bureaucracy often gets in its own way, so unless I was arrested or got caught at a border crossing (which is why I never left France until my flight back to America), the government could effectively be unaware that I overstayed. I also arrived in France from a connecting flight in Iceland instead of a flight directly from the US. Does this change how my movement was tracked/entered in the system? 
2. Assuming my visa is not a problem, I am having trouble with the master's programs I can apply for through Campus France. I know the difference between M1 and M2. This is difficult to explain, so I'll use Lyon 2's \[Economy of the Environment, Energy, and Transportation master's program\]([https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/master-1-economie-de-l-environnement-de-l-energie-et-des-transports-1](https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/master-1-economie-de-l-environnement-de-l-energie-et-des-transports-1)) for example. The link I have is for the M1 that everybody in the program takes their first year. In the second year, students can choose between 3 specialized M2 tracks to finish their master's. On Campus France, only the \[M2 options\]([http://cataloguelm.campusfrance.org/master/#/program/1050235](http://cataloguelm.campusfrance.org/master/#/program/1050235)) appear. Would I be signing up for a two year or one year program? I just want to confirm that, if I were to apply to this program for example, then I would apply for the specific M2 track I want, but I would take both the M1 and M2 years and NOT go directly into the M2 year. I ask because the vast majority of the master's programs I've found are structured in the same way. There will be a general M1 that everybody takes, then students select their M2 course, but Campus France only offers application for the M2 tracks. I would like to try working abroad in France, so a required internship as part of the degree program (which I know is very common in France) would go a long way, and it seems that these internships almost always take place in the spring/summer between M1 and M2. I don't want to miss out if this is the way I go.
3. On that note, are internships in a French program realistic for a foreigner? The expat that I met in one of my master's classes got one fairly easily, but he was married to a French woman and had previous work experience in the US so he had an advantage in that regard. I know you can work on a student visa, but the hours are limited (don't remember the exact number). Is there any possible exception for students who need to work more hours if an internship is required for their studies? Or are foreign students completely hosed if they can't find an internship outside of France? 

Merci d'avance :)"

hy6jj3,2,2020-07-26,Weird teacher student dynamic in my school. What should I do?,strawberrysandtea,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hy6jj3/weird_teacher_student_dynamic_in_my_school_what/,"About a year ago I started going to a private maths tutoring service with some of my friends(around the age of 17). Everything went great at first. The teacher(21m) was nice and some of our marks even improved. 

Then (3 months ago) it was told to us that our private tutor would come to our school for a teacher internship? Basically he would teach in our school for a year but only with guidance of one of the real teachers. 

At first I thought nothing of it. I thought that he would maybe teach lower classes and not the 11th and 12th grade as he wasn’t even finished studying. 

WELL I was wrong. Now this person teaches me and some of my friends in maths and physics, but that’s not the main problem, even though that was kinda weird too. Because no one of the other teachers knew that we already knew the person on a not school environmental level if you know what I mean. 

When the private tutor came to our school two weird things happened: there was a rumor about a girl in my class( that was later found to be true) that her friend group and the private tutor were partying together and that the girl and the pt were more than friends ( or at least that he liked her more than friends)

And 

people that I sometimes would  hang out with (my bigger friend group)suddenly started to include him in our friend groups activities like birthday parties , trips to lakes etc. normal stuff people our age do. That got to the point where he would be seen as a normal friend you could get drunk with but at the same time he would be our teacher that would give us homework. 

I started feeling really uncomfortable about the whole situation, because well ,in my opinion it was just inappropriate for him to hang out in such ways with his students. So I asked my closest friends and they said they feel the same way. 

I don’t know what to do about all of this, because the rest of my friend group doesn’t seem to have a problem about all of this. But I feel more and more uncomfortable when he is around all the time for example when people get drunk or maybe curse on some of our teachers. 

I don’t want to be that bad person that messes up all the fun, but feel like he should know that it’s inappropriate. Any advice?"

I am wanting to go into the CS career domain through either software engineer or developer and am wondering whether it is plausible.

So in my placement I worked closely with the software engineers, following the same lifecycle model, the same version control and configuration management as well as adopting agile and lean methodologies. Obviously I didn't do any software engineering per say but I would hope my experience there would help me in some sense.

As my course doesn't do much programming (only Arduino) I have enrolled on an additional module 'Full-Stack Development with C#', where I have spent the last 3-4 months going through a C# bootcamp getting ready for that. I would also say I am pretty solid at python as well.

My aim is to use this C# course as well as tailoring my dissertation towards software development to help boost my  chances of landing a graduate/junior developer role (along with a portfolio of personal projects). 

My question to the members of this sub-reddit is whether in the UK, this would be enough experience to land a job (preferably as a .Net developer) or would I need to gain additional formal qualifications?

I can potentially undertake a master's course in Advanced Computer Science but that all depends again whether my degree and experiences will be enough for me to enroll on it.

What do people think? What can I do to better my chances? I know the industry is competitive as it is and I am only making it hard by not having the 'correct' degree.

Any help would be amazing!"

If I could keep the price in the $1200-$1300 range that would be perfect but if there's something I don't want to pass up I'd be willing to spend a bit more. All of this is being purchased in the US.

With some help with my dad I got an possible build set up so any suggestions as far as what to add/change/remove would be greatly appreciated.

hy933i,1,2020-07-26,"Are Python certifications like PCAP, PCPP-32-1, and PCPP-32-2 useful for recent graduates with no professional experience?",zimmer550king,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/hy933i/are_python_certifications_like_pcap_pcpp321_and/,"Hello. I am about to graduate from my Master's program. My degree isn't in computer science but I had to do a lot of CS and Software-related stuff. This involved writing a lot of C++ and Python code. In fact, I wrote many applications in Python. I started programming in Python a year ago and am pretty confident in my skills. 

However, given that I am going to graduate with no professional experience (I have internship experience), will Python certifications like PCAP, PCPP-32-1, and PCPP-32-2 help me stand out? I heard that if you have many people with the same amount of experience writing Python code, then certifications can definitely be the deal-breaker when it comes to jobs.

I would like some advice regarding this stuff. I mostly write code related to computer vision applications and neural networks (PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.). In the future, I plan on applying for a PhD but I also want to keep my options open (I am also trying to look for a job). Are Python certifications useful for someone in my particular position? What kind of certifications would be useful? Am I better off expanding my portfolio of projects? Some well-rounded advice regarding this would be appreciated, thanks!"
hyalg5,164,2020-07-26,An open letter to students anxious about their EC profile from a rising senior regretting decisions,CallMeMake96,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/hyalg5/an_open_letter_to_students_anxious_about_their_ec/,"I usually just lurk this sub, but as of late I've been noticing quite a few ""chance a rising X anxious about their ECs"" type posts where the person has *incredible* academics, but didn't quite rescue Uganda from poverty last summer.  A lot of students, insecure high-achieving ones especially will come on this sub, see all the fluffed resume and feel like shit. That used to be and if that's you, I hope what I'm about to say will make you feel a bit better. 

1. Realize that the top chanceme's you see represent the top Nth percent of all applicants. Let's try estimate N. First you have to care enough about top colleges to have found this sub, meaning you're already high-achieving. Let's say that puts you in the top 25% of all students. Then, you have to have a profile fluffed enough that you would feel comfortable sharing it on this sub. Let's say that puts you at the top 25% of users in this sub. Then your profile would have to be good enough that it would make the front page of the sub. Let's say that's top 10% of posts posted on this sub. Do the math and you get that students on the front page are probably somewhere in the 0.6 percent of all applicants in terms of competitiveness for college. For context, if you applied the same percentile to IQ distribution, that would be like having an IQ in the 135-140 range; well beyond ""superior"" and at ""gifted."" **So don't fret about you not being born a genius, rich, or both. Do the best with what you have.** Brings me to my second point.
2. Colleges are more holistic than you think. If you go to a rural suburb school, not having enough bioinformatics AI mentalhealth rocketry research internships won't hurt you as much as it would  hurt someone who goes to a boarding school in an urban area. Same goes for socioeconomic class difference. Most internships are from parental connections; if you're not in the upper-middle or upper-class this won't hurt you as much either. *In fact,* I'd argue a lot of students with very good looking profiles would not look as good compared to other profiles in the same income range. What matters most is **how far you have come relative to where you have started.** 
3. ECs are kind of.....shit on. In the disclosed factors Harvard uses as criterias for admissions. ECs are the least valuable compared to Athletics, Academics, and Personality Rating. So focus on what you can focus on. If you're already getting straight As with maybe a few B's, focus on having better essays. It takes more time, energy, and effort to get one letter grade higher as you approach the 4.0 range. Instead, spend that time thinking about essays, and by that I mean think about yourself and who you are as a person. Don't be like me writing essays now, realizing my entire personality revolves around colleges and careers. Go be a person before you be competitive. Talk to your sisters, spend time with your friends. Not only will it help when you write an essay and know how to sound like a real person, you'll get to *be* a real person, which in a way is a rarer quality than being a student-ran non-profit founder these days.

Having said that, I'm not saying *don't* work on your ECs. Don't do it at the expense of your integrity or other facets of your life. And definitely don't do that then come on chanceme trying to find validation because it's the only thing you have left in life going for you (aka me). Don't do an EC because your friends are doing it. Don't do an EC because your parents or counselors tell you to. Do it because you enjoy it. If you're justifying to yourself ""well its an investment for my future career,"" ask if you even want that future career. Think about the times you have been happiest in life and if it has anything to do with that career. With that in mind, here's some resources for improving your EC profile if you have time left to do it. 

\- r/chanceme kind of obvious, but when I started this shitty journey, this was where I got inspiration for a lot of my ECs. Very good because you can talk to person directly, ask for resources, and see how they're marketing themselves. And since you're already here, congratulations, you're technically being productive. 

\- [StudentPort](https://discord.gg/gCmhbCU) Discord. Semi-active discord server for finding ECs I started (yeah yeah shameless promotion i know). You'll find omega nerds running, joining, and recruiting for orgs, start-ups, or some other project there. You can always DM them and ask to join as an exec if you're up for it. People also post internship opps, competitions and useful resources on there. A few of them are big and pretty damn legit. 

\- [YMG](https://www.instagram.com/youngminds.global/) Instagram. Kinda like studentport but on instagram. Useful for when you feel like being somewhat productive while you're on instagram. Just follow them and then you'll see any new orgs that pops up you might wanna join or collab with. They also have a discord, but main activity is on instagram where they have 2K followers.

\- [RoundPier.com](https://RoundPier.com) They're a worse version of linkedin for highschoolers where students post looking for ECs or to advertise ECs. Their UX is ass, but workable and they're basically a website version of YMG and StudentPort. They're also probably the biggest out of any resources here (maybe excluding chanceme).

\- [NPOCore.com](https://NPOCore.com) Scratch what I said about roundpier, if you want to use a dedicated website/platform use npocore. I don't know how a sixteen year old designed a better site in a month than a wholeass start up in four years. They're basically streamlined to be for finding student ran orgs. They're also an SaaS company, so they're an EC opportunity on their own. 

That's all I could think of right now, if you have any suggestions dump it in the comment and i might edit this to include that or some shit"
hybzc1,74,2020-07-26,"It was an odd law school internship. If you've ever moved in to a new apartment, or taken up a new job, or bought something weird online and been greeted by a strange set of frightening ""rules"" you should thank me for my handy work. But this was my worst case.",DBTraven,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hybzc1/it_was_an_odd_law_school_internship_if_youve_ever/,"When I set myself on this path of godawful cram sessions and hungover moot courts it was because I imagined myself as some witty, articulate crusader for justice. I was in my teens when the wave of streaming service true crime documentaries made me fall in love with defence attorneys and so I set myself on a career path without so much as simply googling “what do public defenders earn”?

But I got to Law School without my bubble getting burst and as my first year rolled to a close I was actually getting to like it. Sure some of my buddies in Communications were whiling away their hours going to ragers and getting laid while I was memorising case law and my friends in Engineering were deciding which 6 figure industry they liked best I was googling the lowest interest pay-day loan spots for my living expenses, at least I had the moral high ground so that was something?

Professor Leahy was a slightly strange guy. I remember my first Contract Law class with him he opened up with an anecdote about negotiating a contract dispute between the spectators and the producers on an orgy porn set which lead into a lengthy diatribe about the legal and philosophical definition of “labour”. Regardless I liked him and I did well in his class so he emailed me one day to see him in his office I wasn’t too concerned. I was elated when he told he had fixed up an intern position for me in a little office in town for the summer and it would even pay a small cost of living stipend. From early on all the professors impressed on us how vital internships were and said without them we’d miss any opportunity to become a hotshot lawyer and instead be “chasing the slowest ambulance around town”. The fact that he said I was get to see “some really unusual stuff” was just a bonus. At the time I thought he meant complicated murder cases. I didn’t know then that if there were dead people involved in the cases I worked they got that way long before I arrived on the scene.

When I arrived for my first day at the office I was shocked to find not some grand building that projected authority and erudition but the remains of a little family butcher shop in a run down part of town. The glass window out front still had metal trays that I guess used to display hunks of meat and sausage links to curious customer passing by, but now stood dull, dusty and empty below a sign that said “Blavatsky &amp; Faustus Legal Services”. I was a bit puzzled to say the least but my confusion was just beginning.

I stepped inside to find a smartly dressed Hispanic woman sitting behind the glass-topped counter, who I now know as Maria. A phone sat in front of here on the hook but she called out to the air “May I take a message?”. As I got closer I realised her eyes were rolled back in her head, which was tilted back slightly, and for a moment, in the all the confusion, I thought of watching WWE as a kid and how the Undertaker would always give me the creeps. Then suddenly , with a sound like crackling autumn leaves, she began to rapidly jot down words on a yellow legal pad in front of her. When she finished up she gripped the pencil with her fist and pressed her thumb against the top half. The pencil snapped and she absent-mindedly chucked the bottom half over her left shoulder.

As I was catching my breath her eyes rolled back, dark hazel, and she regarded me with a look of surprise.

“Oh sorry, you must be Daniel” she said, then after a pause “I was with a client. You can find your desk on floor 2 and a half, the documents for review should be there and the lead attorney will be in touch in case he needs anything specifically”.

Devoid of any idea about how exactly I should react I merely took her curt suggestion. I strolled towards the old, wide elevator behind her, pulled back the little metal gate in front of it and stepped inside. When I glanced at the buttons there I saw that I hadn’t misheard her. The numbers didn’t go up in even increments. At the bottom was “P”, as opposed to the ground floor or basement, and all up the row of buttons they marched in odd, fractional numbers. *1.14, 2.5, 3.76….* and so on. I was beginning to wonder if they were playing some prank on me, hazing the new guy, but the buttons showed no sign of recent alteration. So I hit the button marked 2.5 and the elevator chugged into life.

What I arrived to seemed more comforting and familiar. Rows of little cubicles with phones and computers and a handful of paralegals clacking and chatting away. When I saw the desk with my name scorched in to the wood I thought it was an unusual touch, but those were coming thick and fist so I just plopped myself right down. When I opened the manilla folder I found something that might strike a lot of you as familiar. It was what we call, in the business, “a workplace incident”.

**Rules For the Oakridge Drive Industrial Complex, ordered from least to most severe, let all Nightwatchmen and similar take heed.**

**1. If a car horn honks outside of the Glue Galore building at 2.03 am, knock twice on the front door and walk away**

**2. Do reuse rechargable batteries in flashlights more than twice**

**3. If the water in the downstairs sink of the security office turns red on a Wednesday, take off in your car and email the boss**

I’m sure you all know the type, but it was news to me at the time. The defendant,  a ‘*Wailing Woman’* had been charged with “improper retribution upon breach of contract” relating to a “sanity robbing”. I wouldn’t fully comprehend what the latter meant until I spied the defendant, drooling in his chair, sitting in the cavernous courtroom beneath the subway station months later. His wife had taken the case on his behalf and the head defence attorney sat his side of the room fidgeting with a Ouija board, a voice not his own spilling from his mouth.

So you figure I bolt out of this place right? If it isn’t just some scam then it’s something way over my head and non-existent pay grade. But you underestimate my desire to make a career for myself and I figure in those first couple of months, before I’ve seen any of the nameless things that hide in the dark, I can get a reference letter out of these weirdos without too much hard work. Thinking back to this now, summer coming to a close and evenings getting darker as I’m about to stare the worst of it right in the face, I could slap myself.

“Residential” was all Paul Blavatsky said as he slid the file across my desk . The bespectacled, button nosed lawyer had become my “babysitter” shortly after I started. He dragged me from case to case and forced me into the menial grunt work while he took the stand with little of the grace and aplomb that marked his father’s  style.  This was one of those days where I offered some meagre pushback to Paul shunting yet more work my way, as opposed to just kissing ass. How dearly I wish I had pushed back harder.

“I’m still working on that elevator thing I don’t know if I have time for all this.”

“You’re going to make time for it. This is a big payday. Exciting stuff. I need you to get started on discovery tomorrow”.

“But I’ve got a weekend job. You know I can’t work weekends”.

Paul snarled and shoved his glasses up the bride of his nose, as if trying to get a better look at the dog crap underneath his shoe.

“You do it or you kiss that reference letter goodbye. I’ll be having a word with my father”.

I sighed in resigned defeat. Not only was “big payday” in a joke in the place where they forgot to pay my little gas stipend half the time, I was now going to miss a day of actual paid work to hoof around to some guys hell house. Paul strolled away, delighted at once more crushing one of meagre attempts at resistance.

The house was gorgeous, like some platonic ideal of rural get away. The path there wound up a long country rode covered over my a canopy of trees that made the sunlight drizzle through them like honey. There was hardly anything around for miles and the country estate stood like a fortress for an opulent king. Two stone gargoyles stood at the gate, one clutching a scepter and the other a harp. I couldn’t help but keep eye contact with them as I was buzzed in and drove up to the ornate front door.

The man that answered the door was not who I expected. I guess I expected salt-and-pepper hair in a smoking jacket or something but I got a guy who looked like the closest he might get to lounge wear would be sweat pants and a drug rug.  His beard was long and wiry and his eyes were surrounded by dark blotches.

I was just about to introduce myself when I felt his hands grab me and through me into the foyer of the house with a desperate strength. My satchel full of documents and devices helped to break my fall and prevented me from cracking my head on the hardwood floor. Before I could react the front door was slamming shut and by the time I got to my feet I could hear the man calling through the door in a voice like his vocal chords had been run through a cheese grater.

“I’m sorry! I’m so so sorry!”

Then the crunching of wild feet sprinting on gravel.

My heart leapt into my throat and my legs moved on their own. I skipped over trying the ornate door knob, which I knew would be useless, and threw myself at the door, shoulder-first. I slammed into it and it shook, but didn’t give. Bouncing off I turned my momentum into an immediate ricochet of fists and grunts which proved equally impotent. It was only when I paused to catch my breath that I heard the sobbing beside me. I turned to find a pretty young woman with blond hair cradling something and weeping. When my eyes adjusted after a moment I discovered she was holding her own pregnant belly. She choked out a few words under racking sobs.

“He told me he’d let me out...”.

I just stood there, still processing my new situation, unsure if I should try to offer the woman some comfort. Before I could figure out what to do she was beckoning me a large room beside the foyer which appeared to be a parlour. At the back end there was a large, beautiful painting of a man on horesback. An ordinary sort of “This is my great great great grandfather” portrait you might expect to find in some antiquated country manor like this.  

The room was brightly light and when I stepped in I turned to face the near floor-to-ceiling windows that allowed the light to spill in. Filled with rage, terror and desperation I grabbed a stool to my right and hurled it full force off the glass, where it bounced off with a drumbeat sound. It came flying back with some force so my eyes whipped to the woman to make sure she was alright only to find she was no longer standing near me. She was the end of the room, standing by the painting, where she had peeled the canvas back from the frame to reveal a yellowed parchment beneath the would rule our lives with its blocky lettering for the days to come.

**Commandments for the Occupants of Waybury Manor**  

**1. Only two shall walk the halls, within these old and storied walls**

**2. Though Jack Frost’s breath may prove a vandal, ensure no flames can warm this mantle**

**3. Before entering to take a bath, knock three times or face my wrath**

My eyes glazed over at the sight of just the sort of thing I’d seen hundreds of times before. They were definitely an old set of rules, they bore no sign of the usual lengthy specificity and complication that was the mark of such contracts in recent years. It meant they must predate the 16th founding of our slice of the legal arts by one Dr Faustus and his tricky contract with a demon. But it was the final commandment that really made me grimace

**Though her face be sweet and mild, let none dwell here that bears a child**

I met the woman’s reddened eyes now and she got clearly see the glint of recognition in mine.

“You have to help me” she cried.

That’s when, gritting my teeth and grinding my nails into my palms, I went to work

Unsurprisingly the house lacked a lot of the ordinary tools of the trade: ouija boards, sacred lamps, or summoning salt. So in order to meet the aggrieved party I had to improvise. The pregnant women, whose name was Lauren, was in fact a Kindergarten teacher and so had a handy supply of arts and crafts supplies in the master bedroom. Inside one of her tupperware containers I found just what I was looking for: a set of brightly coloured, fuzzy pipe cleaners. Beaning them at right angles toward the bottom I held them out straight like guns in my sweaty palms and began to pace the long silent hallways of the old house.

Dowsing is a primitive method of calling out the occult and undead but in a pinch it will generally do. It had none safe distance of a ouija board or the stopping power of the summoning circle but desperate times tend to call for desperate measures. As I tread the creaking boards I cursed myself for bringing little but legal documentation and a tablet computer to the scene but my anger at myself was quickly supplanted by a fear oozing its way up my throat as I began to hear a scraping sound from the ceiling above me.  

I paused and looked up, attempting to discern the source or nature of the sound but had no look. It wasn’t long before the pipe cleaners began to sway and overlap, malignantly tickling my fingers in a way that made my palms only sweat more profusely. Eventually my brain worked its way through the knots of fear it had tangled itself up in and, unravelling to clear thought at least, I knew what the scraping on the roof sounded like.

It was a claw.

I bolted down the stairs in a storm of hammering feet and flung myself into the farmhouse kitchen where Lauren was sat in an armchair, watching a small television in the corner. She was held rapt in its glow and the stream of tears seemed to have finally stopped. Her gaze was absorbed by the television which play only the dirty snow of chattering static.

“You have to tell me when you first found...the rules”. I tried desperately to keep the sound of fearful pleading out of my voice, but I couldn’t help but crack on the last two words. She responded to me, slack-jawed, without looking away from the static.  

“The very first day we came into the house”

“And when did you get pregnant?”

“Maybe a couple of weeks after”

I cursed to myself. Even worried about my escape I still wanted to think about building a case, but it looked like that old stand by or “lack of sufficient foreknowledge” had gone out the window.

Just then the scraping on the ceiling intensified and for that reason I thought Lauren had leapt out of her chair in surprise. It was only when I noticed that her facial expression hadn’t changed a bit and she continued to stare obsessively at the static that I realised other forces might be at play. She was crawling on her hands and knees, across old and chipped flagstone, to get to the tv across the room. I began grinding my teeth as it puzzled over what to do. It was only when she pressed her eyes to the screen and I heard the sizzle of their beginning to liquefy that my legs acted for me and I threw my improvised dowsing rods aside.

It took all of my strength to pull her away and force her onto her back, where she lay there with her pregnant belly like an overturned turtle, squeezing her eyes shut . I had fallen onto my backside too and the flagstones were cold against my palms. What a horrible spirit to disallow fires in a house with such cold stone. My eyes turned up toward the television and my stomach lurch with nausea while my head pounded in anger. I averted my eyes from the substance like burnt egg blotting out the field of static.

That’s when I heard the door swing open.

I rose to my feet and dashed toward the front hallway,  There I saw the door miraculously ajar and the beautiful summer evening on the other side. My legs raced toward it but shortly before I could get there it slammed shut, as if taunting me. It was only laying slumped against the door, out of breath that I realised something was off about the outside. One of the gargoyles was missing from atop the gatepost at the entrance. The scraping on the ceiling was now joined by an inhuman screech which pierced my eardrums and caused me to go to the ground.  Footsteps and children’s laughter now accompanied the scraping, coming from the upstairs somewhere. Gathering myself I decided it was time to truly deal with the entity at last.

There are many ways to summon the otherworldly spirits. Some of which I’ve listed alright and all of which come with their own advantages and disadvantages usually selected to a particular case. But there is one method spoken of in whispers by those who ply this trade. Paul told me of it the first time I went to do some investigation and discovery at an “affected location” as we referred to it. At the time I was still on the fence as to whether we were addressing something real or just scamming nut jobs out of money so I took it with a grain of salt. But I figured I might have encountered a situation where it was my only hope.

I strode to the downstairs bathroom, located in what looked like a little cupboard underneath the stairs. I pulled on a chain and the little lightbulb flickered on illuminated a dirty old mirror. I shut the door with a thud and looked at the pale panic painted in a pallor all over my face. I spoked the words in Latin that Paul thought and tapped my foot nervously as I waited.

The lightbulb blew and darkness descended, showering shards of glass in my hair like lethal dandruff. Still I stayed rooted to the spot, staring at the reflection I could no longer see. I tried to keep my composure as a blood-red light began to seep up from the bottom of the mirror to the top, bathing the room in an eerie glow, and illuminating the edges of the mirror transform into the texture of human flesh and bone. My reflection had been replaced with that of a woman, whose hair was reduced to a series of frizzy patches on her bald head and whose teeth stuck like yellowed 2 by 4s from the soiled earth of black gums. She had no eyes to speak of.  

I began the negotiations in a trembling voice but, relying on my legal mind, wrapped things up with only some clattering and wailing and a couple of bright new scratch marks on my cheek. The new agreement was not all that different from the one that had lasted centuries in stilted rhyme behind the portrait, except for a brand new line added to secure mine and Lauren’s release. It read:

**Commit my name where tales are read, so I might live in mortal heads**

I’ve moved on these days, making the big bucks in a metropolitan law firm you’ve probably heard of. But if you have any trouble I hear there’s a place you can go, where the smell of raw flesh still hangs in the air in the run down part of town."
hyc2dd,2,2020-07-26,Aerospace Systems Engineering student to CS Career (UK),equilibrium0212,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hyc2dd/aerospace_systems_engineering_student_to_cs/,"So as the title suggests, I am currently an Aerospace Systems Engineering student in the UK (about to go into my final year) who has completed a 12-month placement as a Systems Engineering intern at a leading aerospace company. 

I am wanting to go into the CS career domain through either software engineer or developer and am wondering whether it is plausible.

So in my placement I worked closely with the software engineers, following the same lifecycle model, the same version control and configuration management as well as adopting agile and lean methodologies. Obviously I didn't do any software engineering per say but I would hope my experience there would help me in some sense.

As my course doesn't do much programming (only Arduino) I have enrolled on an additional module 'Full-Stack Development with C#', where I have spent the last 3-4 months going through a C# bootcamp getting ready for that. I would also say I am pretty solid at python as well.

My aim is to use this C# course as well as tailoring my dissertation towards software development to help boost my  chances of landing a graduate/junior developer role (along with a portfolio of personal projects). 

My question to the members of this sub-reddit is whether in the UK, this would be enough experience to land a job (preferably as a .Net developer) or would I need to gain additional formal qualifications?

I can potentially undertake a master's course in Advanced Computer Science but that all depends again whether my degree and experiences will be enough for me to enroll on it.

What do people think? What can I do to better my chances? I know the industry is competitive as it is and I am only making it hard by not having the 'correct' degree.

Any help would be amazing!"

hyco02,1,2020-07-26,Should I bother applying to top Computer Science MS programs?,Training_Conclusion,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/hyco02/should_i_bother_applying_to_top_computer_science/,"I just finished taking the GRE and am slightly disappointed with my score (163 Q 158 V) because I am hoping to get admitted to a top Computer Science MS program like Stanford. I am hoping you guys could take a look at the specs of my application and let me know if I should bother applying to programs like Stanford, California Institute of Technology, or similar programs.

I am getting my BS in computer science and am planning on graduating Spring 2021. I have a 3.99 overall GPA and 4.0 major based GPA. As I’ve mentioned, I just got 163 Q and 158 V score on the GRE. I was a part of a fairly competitive internship at Goldman Sachs during the summer of 2019. I have a bit of professional student software development experience. I am also planning on getting a letter of recommendation from the chancellor of the first university I attended.

Would my application be considered at all from any of the top programs? I know I’m certainly not one of the top applicants, but if I would at least be considered do you guys think I’d have a shot at getting in? Application fees are expensive and I don’t want to waste my money.. Thanks!"
hycqsk,1,2020-07-26,Struggling with C++ is this normal?,theCakeWasntALie,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/hycqsk/struggling_with_c_is_this_normal/," freshmen cs major here. obviously c++ isn't a very good beginner-friendly language and its normal to struggle in it. What I mean is, it's taking me a long time to learn material in c++. For example, recently I have moved onto pointers and i'm probably dedicating about 8 hours a day (im on summer break) to get through reading just 1-2 pages. I once took about 3 days of re-reading and typing out code just to get through 1 page when I was learning arrays.

by by the way i'm reading from my textbook, ""C++ from Control Structures to Objects by Gaddis"" and this a very beginner-friendly textbook plus i'll watch tutorials on youtube here and there.

just today I've been sitting down on my computer for 10 hours and I have worked through about 3 pages of pointers and I still don't fully understand this one very small part i'm reading

Is this normal or am I just too slow and should pick up a different technique to learning? I want to be able to know enough to be able to apply for internships next summer. How feasible is this at my rate?"

Now, I have 1 year of experience as a web dev, was working on angular.

Resigned from the company because didn't see any progress, it was a startup and they weren't very helpful, also I thought i would take a 6 month break, since we have to do a internship in the last sem. 

But now, in order to help around the house. I've decided to start looking for a job.

TCS is hiring and alot of my friends have considered it and are looking forward for the process. 
I want to as well, but some peers have told me to start from smaller companies and not jump for big one's like TCS. 

Please tell me what I should do?

Thanks in advance."

Am I pretty much screwed? Should I shift my efforts from building self projects and developing algorithms skills to self learning these CS topics?"
hye2wz,0,2020-07-26,There is a better way. RHCSA + MCSA Server + Azure/AWS + Python,moonlander33,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hye2wz/there_is_a_better_way_rhcsa_mcsa_server_azureaws/,"I've been studying IT on off for over a year and half. No certs, but I have a decent understanding about the topology of the industry and I've come at this enough times where there isn't much of a learning curve. I'm not overwhelmed with tech, certs, etc I've collected all the free resources I will ever need. And in doing all that I didn't believe in the path that I was following. I've looked and studied for CompTIA certs, reading through free textbooks on the A+, Net+, Sec+. And I kept wondering where is the application, the labs here? It's all theoretical, and abstract knowledge with lots of overlap. I decided CompTIA is not for me in regards to any certification.

I spent time studying for the CCNA, and although there are practical lab simulators/emulators available packet tracer/Gns3 and other products out there. I couldn't help but wonder what a day in the life of a NetAdmin actually does. And often the Networking departments have downsized and this is a jack of all trades role, often with more needs of system administrators, than network admins. So that's where Microsoft, Linux, &amp; Servers become more of the focus than routing and switching. Say the company is now incorporating more cloud technologies, now they need even less of networking specialized individuals.
More likely to higher a Linux/MS, cloud intern, and just have them get the networking certificate with Azure or AWS.

Cloud engineers are the new system and network admins.
Not enough people are seeing or saying this!!!! 

Learn some python and now you can be apart of some Development roles -Devops -Automation.
Or become a back end/ database engineer.
Want to try out security? You now have the most diverse foundation and will make learning C for malware analysis that much easier. You'll be familiar with windows, and Linux systems.
Not enough people are saying this!!!!
I don't think I'll be getting my CCNA. If it comes to resumes for entry level positions, and lots of people are saying they can't find a networking job with CCNA.
I'd rather skip it and able to apply to more jobs, and have more productive skills with a Linux, MS &amp; Cloud certs, and get a cloud networking cert like in AWS."
hye67l,252,2020-07-26,Every three months my daughter and I have to move. I think it might be time to tell her why. Chapter 2,BicolourArt6801,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hye67l/every_three_months_my_daughter_and_i_have_to_move/,"[Chapter 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hxt1f4/every_three_months_my_daughter_and_i_have_to_move/) 

They didn't believe us at the station, but they didn't think any of us were capable of doing what had been done to Scott and Gary, so after a few hours of questioning and waiting around, we were free to go on the condition that we stayed in town until the investigation was complete. I was relieved, but Sam was terrified. She didn't want to leave the station, even though Katie and I agreed that it wasn't any safer there than at our dorm. It wasn't until we saw the creature at the far side of the street that Sam was willing to believe us, and we hustled out of there and took a bus all the way across the city. Katie estimated that the creature - even I was convinced it wasn't human by this point - could only travel at around two miles an hour, so as long as we didn't stay in one place for too long, we'd be fine.

We got off the bus at a mall, and the first thing I did was buy Sam some new clothes. I'd fallen asleep in my clothes so I at least had my wallet, and poor Sam only had my hoodie and a pair of pants she'd been given at the station. Once we'd gotten that taken care of, I treated us all to some junk food at the food court, and we found a table in a quiet corner where we could eat and talk.

Sam was quiet. I couldn't blame her. Scott was my best friend, but Sam was absolutely head over heels in love with him. Scott had even talked about getting married after graduation, and he'd never been that serious about anyone before.

Not that it mattered now.

Katie was the complete opposite of her friend. As soon as we had found a table, she got up to make a phone call, and when she came back, she had some interesting news to share.

""Turns out Gary hadn't been out there for long before that thing found you and Scott,"" she said. ""I just found out from Mary - she works the front desk on Sundays - that he'd gone out for a smoke maybe twenty minutes before noon.""

That didn't surprise me. Gary was a bit of an insomniac, so he was always up before the rest of us.

""How did it find us?"" Sam whispered.

""I don't know, but it seems to take the most straightforward path that it can,"" Katie replied. ""What gets me is how it got into your room in the first place. If it could do that, it should have been able to get into the car.""

""Maybe it needs an invitation,"" I suggested.

""I didn't fucking invite it into my room this morning,"" Sam snapped at me.

""Well, yeah, but you didn't lock your door, did you? Maybe it knows that unlocked dorm rooms are basically open invitations.""

""But how would it have gotten into the building?"" Katie pointed out. ""You have to have a student ID to get into the dorms, and that thing sure as hell isn't a student.""

It was quiet for a moment as we all thought, then Sam spoke up.

""I think... when we were trying to leave, I kept looking back at it. I couldn't help it. I know I should have just focused on getting out, but...""

""Hey, it's cool, you were in shock,"" I reassured her.

""Yeah, none of us were really thinking clearly,"" Katie agreed.

I smiled at her. ""You were.""

""Shut up.""

""My point is,"" Sam continued, glaring at both of us for interrupting. ""That thing... I didn't see the doors open. It just, like, walked through them. Like it was a ghost, or something.""

""Really? It sure looked solid to me when it was-"" I cut myself off. I didn't want to finish that sentence.

""Well, it probably wanted to be solid then,"" Katie said. ""But then why didn't it just... phase through the car, or something?""

""Could be something to do with that warehouse,"" I suggested. ""Lots of ghost stories talk about creatures that are bound to the land they live on, or can only do certain things when certain criteria is met.""

""Wow, I'm surprised you actually know something for once,"" Sam muttered. I was used to her shit-talking me, and normally I would have done the same right back to her, but a stern look from Katie put me in my place. Now was not the time to start petty arguments.

""I've been looking into this stuff since I was a kid,"" I said instead. ""I wanted to know everything I could about the paranormal so I could argue back when people tried to convince me ghosts were real.""

Sam rolled her eyes. ""How lovely.""

""Ever hear of anything like this before?"" Katie asked.

I shook my head. ""No. There's similarities to some other beings, but no real matches that I can think of.""

Katie sighed. ""I figured.""

""You don't seem too worried about this,"" I pointed out.

""Oh, she's worried. She's just a lot better at putting on a brave face than me,"" Sam said, smiling at her friend. Katie smiled back, then took a long sip of her strawberry shake.

""Right. So, we know this thing can walk through walls, and we know it can kill. Nobody else seems to be able to see it, but we can.""

""It only seems to be interested in us, too,"" I added. ""Maybe because we disturbed its resting place?""

Katie nodded. ""That's what I'm thinking.""

""So what do we do now? Do we lure it back to the warehouse?""

""We could try. I have a car we could use.""

""But we'd have to get back to the dorms, and that... thing... has got to be somewhere between here and there, right? What if we run into it?""

Katie pulled something out of her pocket and laid it on the table. It was a brochure that had a map of the local bus system. ""I picked this up when we got off the bus. That thing's been following us pretty directly, so I think if we go around this way..."" She traced her finger along a purple line on the map, which was a circular route that would take us almost all the way back to the dorm. ""...We'll have plenty of space between us and that thing.""

I nodded. ""Makes sense.""

""But how do we know where it is?"" Sam asked.

""We don't. We just have to guess until we see it again,"" Katie replied.

Sam shivered. ""I don't like this.""

I sighed. ""Me neither, but it's better than just running around and hoping it doesn't catch up.""

""It'll be okay,"" Katie said reassuringly. ""I'll leave my keys in the car and you can stay inside the whole time. We'll stay close and park the car so we can peel out of there in a second if we need to.""

""What if it blocks the road?"" Sam asked.

""Then we run it over.""

I laughed. ""Damn, you didn't even hesitate.""

Katie smiled, but her eyes were serious. ""I don't like anyone putting my friends in danger. Especially not Sam.""

""How'd you two meet, anyway?"" I asked. I'd never really gotten to know either of them beyond a few conversations about music and tv and the like.

""First grade,"" Sam answered. ""She punched a third grader who stole my backpack.""

""It had a unicorn on it and that fucker was going to throw it in the mud,"" Katie growled. ""Plus, Sam was crying, and he was laughing at her. I just saw red, and next thing I know, this kid's sprawled out on the pavement with a black eye.""

""She's been looking out for me ever since,"" Sam laughed.

""Damn. I'm glad I've never pissed you off like that,"" I remarked.

""I mean, you've come pretty close a few times,"" Katie replied casually as she took another sip of her shake. ""So, we doing this?""

Sam nodded reluctantly. ""I don't want to, but if it means getting rid of that thing, I guess I'm in.""

I finished my drink and stood. ""Me, too. Maybe we'll run into it on the way out there and you can test how it does against your car.""

\----------

Our plan didn't work. We did lure it back to the warehouse, but when it arrived, it phased right through the warehouse and kept coming towards us. Katie waited for a bit to see what it would do, ignoring Sam's desperate pleas to get us out of there, but it wasn't until it started phasing through the trunk of her Subaru that she stepped on the gas and tore out of that parking lot. The creature, thankfully, remained where it was, but it still followed us. Katie drove slowly down the road, and it kept following, so eventually she sped up and took us back to town.

The next few weeks were horrible. None of us bothered going to class. Katie was focused on researching that warehouse's history, I was looking up everything I could about paranormal entities, and Sam was... well, she was in mourning. Every night the three of us would pile into Katie's car and as far as we could out of the city, trying to lure the creature away from the university so we could do our work in peace. We passed by it a few times, and Katie would always have to swerve to avoid it, but we were getting a good grip on its behavior.

None of us were doing very well in our classes. Sam decided to drop out after a couple of weeks, and Katie and I soon followed suit. Nobody seemed too surprised about me or Sam, but Katie dropping out came as a shock to most of her classmates and teachers. We found a place to rent on the other side of town, and Katie began developing a system to keep track of the creature.

She really was brilliant. Her system worked really well, and it would have been perfect if she'd known one crucial little detail. Unfortunately, by the time we learned about that detail, it was too late.

I'd just gotten back from a trip to the store when I found Katie pacing frantically outside the apartment building. She saw me pull up and ran over. She looked like she was about to cry.

""Tim, something's wrong. That thing isn't where it's supposed to be and I forgot my key and Sam isn't opening the door.""

My heart sank. ""Shit. Where was it supposed to be?""

""It was supposed to be following me when I went to the library but I didn't pass it on my way back and I haven't seen it since we went on a coffee run this morning,"" Katie explained as we bounded up the stairs to our apartment.

""Were you closest?""

""Yes, I walked right past it when I left for the library and I could have sworn it was following me.""

My stomach was twisting in knots. We got to our floor and sprinted down the hall. I jammed the key in the door and twisted it, then roughly shoved it open and ran to Sam's room.

""Sam! Sam, you okay in there?"" I called out, banging frantically on her door.

No response.

""She's not in the bathroom,"" Katie told me as I turned the knob and pushed the door open. I didn't reply. I was too busy staring at the mess in front of me.

""No. No no no no no no no, Sam...""

Katie pushed past me and ran to what was left of her best friend. I followed, intending on pulling her back and away from the creature that had done this, but it was nowhere to be seen.

""Where the fuck did it go?"" I screamed as Katie collapsed by Sam's lifeless corpse.

Katie's voice was filled with rage and grief. ""I don't know! It wasn't supposed to be!"" she cried. ""It should have been a block from the library when I left!""

""Well, it definitely came here!"" I looked down at Sam, whose eyes stared blankly at the ceiling, and slammed my fist against the wall. ""Fucking damn it!""

""She didn't make it out of her room,"" Katie sobbed. ""That thing didn't even give her a chance to escape! Why didn't it follow me? How was I wrong? Why did I just leave her here to die alone and afraid?""

I went to the window and looked outside. The thing was walking across the parking lot towards us.

""Katie, we have to leave.""

She shook her head. ""No. I can't just leave her like this.""

""Katie, she's gone, and that thing's coming right back here for us. We have to go. Now.""

Katie let out a heart-wrenching sob. She brushed some hair out of Sam's face, then turned and walked out the door. I followed, stopping briefly to call 911 and report a murder at our address. Katie was parked on the other side of the building, so we could get away pretty easily.

Katie didn't drive us to the police station. She just handed me her keys and got into the passenger seat. We didn't speak until I'd parked in front of the station.

""What are we going to tell them?"" she asked.

I shrugged. ""The truth, I guess. We were both out running errands and found her like that when we came back.""

""They're going to investigate us again. If they keep us in a prison overnight-""

""I won't let that happen.""

""But-""

""I'll call my dad and have him bail us out if I have to. He has a damn good lawyer. We'll be fine.""

Katie took a deep, shuddering breath and nodded. I gave her a reassuring smile and we got out of the car.

\---------

We were able to leave the station in time to avoid another encounter with the creature, but just barely. Once again, we were the top suspects in the death of our friend, but this time around there was security footage that proved we hadn't been there when Sam was killed. I tried again to explain about the creature that was haunting us, but the result was about the same as the last time. I didn't push it too hard since I didn't want either of us to get committed. Being sent to a mental hospital was a guaranteed death sentence.

We were able to get a hotel room across town, and I let Katie sleep while I kept watch. She'd been in a sort of daze ever since we arrived at the police station. I tried to get her to eat before passing out, but for the most part, I just let her be. I still remembered how hard it was for me to lose Scott and Gary.

When the creature was about a block away, I left the room and started walking towards it. It changed its course as I approached, turning with each step so that it was always coming straight for me. I ignored the uneasy feeling I got when I glanced at its eyes and walked straight past it. I didn't know what I was going to do, but I wanted to give Katie a chance to rest. If that meant walking through the night with this thing on my tail, then so be it.

I had been walking for an hour when I heard a car horn behind me. I turned around and saw Katie driving down the road, about halfway between me and the creature. I stopped and waited for her to catch up. She pulled up beside me and gestured for me to get in. I glanced at the creature one more time, then climbed into the passenger seat.

""What the fuck are you doing?"" she asked as we drove off. The creature had changed its course slightly and was now walking in the road.

""I thought you could some extra sleep,"" I replied.

""So you just left me by myself without even a note? What if something had happened to you?""

""I'm sorry, I was just trying to be helpful.""

Katie was quiet for a moment. ""I appreciate the gesture, but it's not safe for us to split up anymore. That thing could have turned around at any time and just left you to keep walking like an idiot.""

My face flushed a bit. ""I was keeping an eye on it! If it had turned around I would've gone back and got its attention again!""

""Still, I was wrong about how it behaved before. It didn't go after me when I went to the library, and even when I drove right by it, it didn't even seem to notice me.""

""Maybe it's just not interested in you,"" I suggested.

""That doesn't make sense. I was there with you guys, remember? I saw that thing right outside Scott's car.""

She had a point. I turned and looked out the rear view mirror. The thing was pretty far away now, but it was still following us.

Then, I felt my entire body jerk forward. I probably would have hit my head on the dashboard if I hadn't been wearing my seatbelt. I sat back and looked to Katie, whose hands were gripping the steering wheel so hard that her knuckles had turned white.

""What is it?"" I asked. Katie looked over at me, her eyes wide.

""Tim... I only saw part of it,"" she said.

I frowned. ""What?""

""Its eyes, Tim. You guys all saw them, remember? But I didn't.""

""So? You've probably seen them plenty of times since then.""

""No, I haven't. I've been making it a point not to look.""

I frowned. ""Why?""

""Because it just seemed like a bad idea.""

I was quiet. It didn't make sense. How could she have never seen this thing's face? We'd passed by it so many times in the past couple months. How could she not have made eye contact even once?

The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized she was right. She hadn't been able to see it that first night, and it had been facing away from her when it was killing Scott. Then she'd kept her back to it when we were outside the dorm, and I couldn't remember any single time when I'd seen her really looking at the thing. Was eye contact really the thing that triggered it?

I thought back to that first night. It had ignored all three of us until I'd circled around and thrown a rock at it. I thought it was the rock that got its attention, but what if it was the fact that we looked right at each other? And then both Scott and Gary had said they'd looked at its eyes when they'd gotten in the car...

""But it's chased after you before, hasn't it? I mean, your system worked up until...""

I didn't want to finish that sentence.

""Yeah, but most of the time I was with either you or Sam, or one of you was closer than me,"" Katie said.

""But that means you're safe, right? You don't have to worry about this thing anymore!""

Katie was quiet. ""I guess so.""

I glanced over at her. ""You don't sound too happy about it.""

""Sam's dead, Tim. She was fucking murdered because I was too stupid to realize it wasn't coming after me. If I'd known-""

""Don't even start, Katie. You were doing the best you could with almost nothing to go off of.""

""But-""

""Katie. Do you think we'd have even made it this far without you? You're the one who noticed how it followed us. You're the one who realized it always goes after whoever's closest, you're the one who calculated its walking speed... you fucking figured everything out while me and Sam were still trying to wrap our heads around this thing's existence. You can't beat yourself up over this. You're doing the best you can.""

It was quiet in the car for a while. I heard a few sniffles from Katie, then, as we pulled onto the highway, I could hear a quiet, ""Thank you.""

\-------------

I thought about taking off on my own that night, but Katie rejected the idea before I could even say it. She used my own argument against me, telling me that I'd be dead meat without her, and she was tired of people dying. I couldn't really argue against that, and I had grown pretty fond of her, so I accepted her help. We took turns sleeping so that one of us could always keep an eye out for the creature, and when we were finally told that we could leave the city, we moved to my dad's house in Dallas. I introduced Katie as my girlfriend, and my dad was so happy that I'd finally started a serious relationship that he bought it immediately. I convinced him that I was too traumatized to go back to college after what had happened to my friends, and I had enough classes under my belt that one of his friends was willing to hire me as an intern. Katie got a job as a secretary at my dad's company, but she was promoted almost immediately when they realized just how good she was at engineering.

We traveled out of town every weekend to slow the creature's progress to Dallas, but it was still coming for me. Katie would drive along the path she guessed it would take after work in the evenings, and one day she found it, almost exactly where she thought she would, walking straight through the fences that blocked its path to my dad's house. At that point, I'd convinced my dad that I really needed to take a vacation in Europe, so I was on my way to the airport by the time it would have arrived. Katie kept track of it for as long as she could, and she calculated that it would be in Spain about 100 days after I left Dallas. Assuming it could cross the ocean, at least.

I enjoyed my time in Europe, though it was impossible to shake the feeling that that creature was going to sneak up on me. Katie joined me in Barcelona towards the end of the third month, and she used my travel plans to estimate where the creature should be at this point. Sure enough, it was right where she thought it would be.

I was starting to relax a bit. This thing was relentless, but at least it was predictable. If I could get a job that let me work from home, I could still make this work.

We traveled to Germany together and enjoyed ourselves as much as we could as we waited for the creature to catch up to me. I booked us on a flight back to Dallas that would leave two days before the creature got to Berlin. When we arrived back home, Katie circled a date on my calendar. It was the day I'd have to start keeping an eye out again.

Through all this time, we were starting to learn a lot about each other. We had to play like we were a couple for my dad's sake, and I never heard the end of how great Katie was for me, how she had changed me for the better, how much I'd grown since that horrible tragedy...

He was right, though. I had changed. I never partied anymore - getting blackout drunk had been too much of a risk with that creature around - and my attitude towards women had changed after spending so much time with Katie. Sam, too, had been a huge influence, and I found myself wishing she could have known me like this instead of the shithead I'd been in college. I also found myself thinking about religion - if this creature could exist then so could other things I'd thought impossible before - and I hoped that there was a heaven where Sam and Scott could stay together forever. Or at least until they got sick of each other.

One day, Katie came into my bedroom (we'd been in separate rooms at my dad's insistence, though he didn't seem too fussed about whether we actually followed his rules) while I was watching TV. She sat down next to me and we watched cartoons together for a while before she said something that I'd been thinking about a lot.

""So... are we a couple?""

""Well, my dad sure thinks we are,"" I replied. ""It's been getting easier to pretend, though.""

""Yeah. It's a lot easier to pretend now,"" Katie agreed. ""I feel like I barely have to put on an act nowadays.""

I smiled and put my arm around her shoulders. ""Me, too.""

Katie cuddled up next to me, resting her head on my chest, and we sat there for a while, just enjoying the moment. Then she sat up and looked at me.

""What do you think about dropping the act and doing this for real?""

I'll be honest, I did not react very smoothly. I'd hoped for this, but I knew what Katie had thought of me back in college and I was sure she still felt that way on some level. I sat back and stared at her, trying to stammer out a reply but failing miserably. She laughed.

""Come on, I thought you were cool. Why are you acting like such a dork right now?""

""W-w-what? I'm not! You just... I just... really?""

""What do you mean, really?""

I took a moment to compose myself. ""I mean, are you really serious about this? I can still remember you calling me a self-absorbed man-whore.""

Katie laughed. ""Well, yeah. You were a self-absorbed man-whore. But that's not who you are now.""

""Then who am I?""

""You're the man who talked a lot of shit but stepped up when we needed you. You lost your best friend and did everything you could to make sure his girl was safe. You kept me going when all I wanted to do was give up and die. You... you've turned into a good person. Somehow. And I want to spend my life with you.""

""I do, but that can still happen. Your dad said there's a few opportunities he could look into for me.""

TL;DR then the full story, thanks.

TL;DR Struggled to get into coding, but eventually got above average at it, really enjoyed it for a while. After a while, went from excited to go home to work on personal projects until my laptop battery dies to I don't even want to think of coding outside of the bare minimum I need for work/school.

\---------------------------------------------------------

I started my journey in high school. In two years of learning I was only good enough for a 1 on the AP Test (score from 1-5, like LOL bad). I studied all summer to prepare myself for college.

College started, and the first 2 years I found free-time. I used said time to keep working on my own skills, and along the way fell in love. My passion went into personal projects and it helped me get an internship at the end of year 2.

That internship summer was the best summer of my life. Working at the job by day, working on my own thing at night. Got extended, and still found free-time with work &amp; school combo.

However, I noticed I just did not want to work on my free time projects like I did before even though I had more time.

It got worse the following spring. School took all my time at first, but Covid really saved my semester. However it did not help finding the feeling I lost for coding earlier in the year.

Now we're deep into summer, it's gotten to a point I'd of never imagined. That daunting feeling of not wanting to code never went away. I just do my job at work then play games now. I feel like my once coveted hobby and passion has been stripped from me.

Anyone else have this happen? Or is experiencing this?

I am currently pursuing my first software internship as a data automation intern! I just realized there are various tasks in my work scope that can be improved with developing the relevant software! For a start, I've developed this Excel Macro that updates the Excel logbook to track the statuses of certain file checks &amp; updates. The only thing that Excel doesn't quite cut it for me is the insertion of pictures, which we will have to paste inside the Excel logbook once in a while, when the file checks &amp; updates fail.

So I was looking to create a Python desktop/web app (idk which would be better, but all our files are on the company's network drive). I was thinking of creating a Python app that has the ability to log the failed file checks &amp; updates, like you could click a button to open up a text window &amp; then paste the picture in, along with text description of the failure. 

Does anyone have a recommendation for what database to use to store these pictures? 

Apart from the pictures, I was thinking it would be nifty if we could have a GUI button in the application that calls the Excel Macro. And if we can view the rows of update statuses, or the different worksheets from the Excel workbook within the Python application itself! (idk if we can do this? )

Here are a few pics to give you guys a rough idea of what the Excel worksheet already looks like!

So I applied to a major company in my country and they requested me to complete a medical checkup with them before proceeding to the job interviews. I am typing this just as things are happening. 

So the important thing to note here is that I have a phobia of needles and there's going to be a blood test in the checkup, so that was already stressing me like crazy so I had my mom drive me there. Now the email I got instructed me to bring a passport sized photo and my ID and to be there before 7AM. So I woke up at 6, got ready in a rush and since I recently had my all my clothes shipped from my university accommodation, I only had two pants, one 3/4 and one trouser. But I couldn't find my trouser anywhere so I opted for the 3/4 as it was only a medical checkup (Spoilers: Bad decision). Then I managed to get in the car and when I arrived I realized I forgot my wallet which has my ID. 

But since I did an internship there before and since the email said the ID was to hand in my phone to security as no phones are allowed there I figured it will be fine. 

As I went to the security office, I informed the guy that I was here for the checkup and he told me to wait. Then I realized I also forgot the photos as well. At this point the stress of my phobia was not even coming close to the stress induced from my fuck-ups. Several people started to enter the office and commented on my pants and said that it's not appropriate and I tried to explain my situation only for them to sign and walk away. 

Then the security guy told me to come and he asked for my ID and then I told him I forgot it in the car and that I was dropped off. Then I got told off about my pants as it's not professional and he told me to call whoever dropped me off to get me my things. And here I am waiting awkwardly in the security office as people keep staring at my pants waiting for my parents to bring my things. 

I wanna die at this point, and there is the blood test too.

TL;DR I forgot to bring my id, passport photo, and wore 3/4 pants to a medical check-up at a company I am applying for that I know are very professional."

This news shook me to my core and I am seriously scared now. I was thinking that Software engineering field might be a good option to take during this pandemic, and hence I am putting my all effort in coding. During Feb-April 2020, I was in interview process with few big tech companies but later they closed the whole interview process for this year :( Initially, I was focusing on ETL developer and got a call for that but currently, I am focusing on core programming stuff. Because I think it is quite difficult to get a call as a ETL developer during this pandemic time.

I’m currently in a master’s program studying data analysis as I was not exposed to this while in undergrad. I majored in something entirely different. My school is offering me the option to select the standard thesis route or internship route. I’m barely starting out my courses in data analysis, so I figured thesis would be better in the long run because some positions that I’d previously applied for required research. In addition, my school isn’t offering a lot of networking opportunities; it’ll be on my own. It seemed a bit risky because while I am working in some data analysis, it is not specific to the requirements my school is looking for. 

I’m wondering if I made a mistake selecting the thesis route. My advisor is possibly going to offer me the opportunity to work as a research assistant for another faculty, though. 

Since I selected the thesis route instead of a professional one, will that hinder me in the future?"

I see people with International ranks in Olympiads, founder and president of 3 clubs, National quiz winner etc. I’d like to compare myself to other extracurricular profiles like these, hence the post. I’m a high school senior, and now I want to decide whether to focus all my time on improving my GPA and Sat subject test scores, or pursue some extracurriculars along with it too. If my ECs are good enough, I’ll focus entirely on my scores. 

Background- I’m applying for a business major to business/finance T10s. Indian Male, 1540 SAT, top 10% of the class in high school. 

1. Extracurricular activity- I run an E-commerce store where I sell custom manufactured products. I’ve raised $9500 in Crowdfunding, and done $26,000 revenue in 2.5 years with a 40% profit margin, no paid advertising. My operations/responsibilities included- Website building, Graphic design, Marketing, content creation (photos and long and short form videos), handling (outsourced) Manufacturing, inventory management and (outsourced) shipping. There was an initial investment of $100 by my parents, which I returned. 

I also have a YouTube channel, which I converted into this business. I’ve sold 3 physical products, and 7 digital download tutorials. In total I’ve sold 5200 physical units, and 300 paid online downloads.

2. Apart from this I have a volunteering internship with a national NGO. 
 
3. I did a covid-19 charity project for which I raised 2500$ through crowdfunding, and distributed 1800 Face masks, 1200 sanitizers, 1000 Kilos of rice and pulses, to needy neighborhoods, families, and the Police department of my city. 

4. I did a 4 month Investing/trading internship with a startup, and ended as their top performer ever and received an LOR. 

5. I Write articles for Medium on topics including BLM, feminism, corruption, etc. 

6. 2 self published Economics research papers 


How does this compare to other applicants who get into Ivy Leagues and T10s? I’m genuinely very curious, eager to hear what you think. Thanks for reading till the end!"

hyptbf,2,2020-07-27,I need career advice: It's been exactly 1 year since I graduated university and I am yet to find a CS job; what do I do?,throwaway-CSC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hyptbf/i_need_career_advice_its_been_exactly_1_year/,"**TLDR**: Feeling demotivated. It's been exactly 1 year since I graduated university. I am yet to find a CS job, perhaps because of my own laziness, perhaps because of the situation. What do I have to do to land my first CS job now, in this time when developer job #s are already being reduced (see #1 post on this subreddit right now)? 

I am posting on a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I live in Canada. I graduated in the summer of 2019 with a BSc in CS from a semi-big university in Canada, with a minor in math (almost double major in math/CS). My GPA was mediocre because of how lazy and unserious I was about university (last 2 years, 3.0, overall, I believe 2.5). If  it helps, my last year's GPA was 3.7, because I really tryharded in the last year. I received no internships in university.

Since then, I have worked an IT summer (2019) job not directly related to CS, and I received paid training for a potential developer job in early 2020, but I never got accepted to the job as I did not match their expected level at the end of the training, in the interviews.

Since that training ended, in February 2020, my failure to get the job and personal issues (one of them being: my long-term girlfriend broke up with me in a really bad and toxic manner, it made me extremely demotivated and depressed for a while), I have been extremely demotivated, and never had the will or discipline to code anything, study CTCI, do Leetcode, work on personal projects, or anything. I spent most of this time just playing video games or doing other non helpful things, because I was really down. I live with my parents since the training ended. In the training, I learned more about SQL, Java, Bash and Linux, and I was trying to work hard in it.

I am finally coming out of this phase and I realize the fact that I have no job, and that I want to get one as a developer. I want to turn my life around. But I am not sure how to go about this.

I applied to around 100 jobs after graduating (I know it's not many), and I stopped when I got this potential job ""offer"" (wasn't an offer as I thought it was, as after the training ended I was  left with nothing).  I applied to most of the jobs on Indeed. The training was  acquired by a recruiter who approached me on Linkedin.

I realize that I need a good Resume, I have to be good at algorithms and datastructures and follow CTCI, do Leetcode, have a good Linkedin, etc.  But honestly, it feels fucking sickening mass applying to jobs (most of which require 2+ years of experience), customizing my Resume for each job in specific, and having a really low response rate. I hate it a lot, but obviously I don't have any option.

I am not good at Leetcode. I am not good at Algorithms and Data Structures (I am mediocre at best). I have a few personal projects, all from when I was in university and from 2019, but none from 2020. My Github has have had no activity over the last few months. I don't have any personal project I am working on right now. I haven't coded in a few months.  I don't have any internship experience, and no CS related work experience. My GPA in university was average. I still feel this is what I want to do with my life; something related to coding, computers, development, etc. I may have temporarily lost my passion because of the circumstances, but I am confident I can regain it. One of my main interests in CS is Data Science, but it's very hard to get a job as a data scientist being in the position I am in right now. I feel demotivated.

Can someone please make a complete list of things I have to do right now in order to get my first developer job? I know I fucked up and it's made worse because I feel demotivated right now and it's going to be incredibly difficult to do all the things I need to do now, but I am willing to.  I don't want to waste any more time, considering it's been almost a year to the dot without me getting my first developer job. What is everything I have to do to get my first developer job? I tried looking on the wiki and on older CSC , but I still feel lost."

hyrv5x,3,2020-07-27,Need a laptop for school thats usable for gaming.,Mancubus0,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/hyrv5x/need_a_laptop_for_school_thats_usable_for_gaming/," I have posted before but Id like to get some more reactions from different people.

So   Im going to coding school and I need a laptop for that.  But I want  one  that has alot of RAM and is also compatible for gaming. My budget  is up  to 1100 USD/Euros. Preferably one that is available in the   Netherlands/Europe since thats where Im buying it.

* Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase.\*\*around 1000Euros/USD , The Netherlands.
* Are you open to refurbs/used?\*\*New
* How   would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build   quality, performance, and battery life?\*\*Performance &gt; battery life   &gt; everything else
* How   important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*Id like it to be able to use it inside a train when traveling. Screen needs to be big enough for games however.
* Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*Not really. Just not extremely small.
* Are   you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which   programs/games you desire to run.\*\*I want to be able to run some games like skyrim modded and fallout 4 and code without lag.
* If   you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what   settings and FPS do you want?\*\*The Witcher 3, modded skyrim and fallout 4  on high settings 60fps or as close as possible.

Im looking for the following specs:

\-  16 GB RAM

\-  not a shared memory graphics card

\- at least 250 GB intern memory

\- minimum i5 processor

\- Would like a SSD build in it but not necessary

My  pick atm would be Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14 16GB RAM with Ryzen 4700. Would  love to hear your guys thoughts on that one and your own suggestions! Cheers."

hysx2q,1,2020-07-27,Is the I.T. area a good path for a recently graduated mechanical engineer?,secretPT90,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/hysx2q/is_the_it_area_a_good_path_for_a_recently/,"I'm a 22 years old male that recently graduated in a bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (about one year ago) and currently taking a master in an area of Thermal Energy (HVAC, etc.). 

Just a few months after I graduated from my bachelor I was offered an internship in IT company to be a consulting/support technician of CMMS software and I accepted it (it's for 9 months). 

In the present I'm not doing much in the intership (~~maybe because of Covid-19~~) and I'm starting to think if this is a good path for my career since I'm a mechanical engineer and this area it's more for an IT person  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . All of my  job colleagues are from the IT area, and they all say that “I shouldn't be here” (in a good way) because it's a completely different area then the one I studied for. 

I liked what I learned (like programming languages such as SQL/JavaScript/JSON/.NET even though I had to learn by myself with a BIG help of the Internet \^-\^)  and I understand that this is the future of engineering  (I think it is, since it's what it's taught now days...). I like reading code and understaing the logic of things so this new area fascinates! but I'm so uncertain of what I want for the future.  
I would like to see the world but I also want to have a decent job (not saying that the others aren't, I already worked in many retailers companies like supermarkerts/restaurants/wine stores and I have a huge respect to those people who work in those jobs) but a career of a engineer seems so complicated.

Any thougths if I should go abroad (Currently in Portugal)? Or should I remaing in this company for a little longer? If this intership is good for the curriculum and will companies give a thumbs up when seeing this? Any other tips?

I want to thank everyone that read this until the end! :)  
P.S.: Sorry for any grammar error!!! :)

Edit: Today I had a feeling that the CMMS will be discontinued and that are showing me new areas( logistics, etc.) 
Also any opinions if I should change workinh area?"

Currently over the break I have been studying some Cracking The Coding Interview, however I am relatively struggling, I have come  to the stark realisation that my algorithm class was not relatively helpful in preparing me for technical interviews(even though I did score relatively high in it).

The problem is, I need some guidance on how to approach Cracking the Coding Interview problems.What I am doing right now is.

1. Trying to find a naive approach if possible
2. Take a look at the hints
3. If I am not able to find a optimal approach, I check the internet, for a solution, I then get the general idea of the solution and then attempt to code it up myself.
4. If I still cannot code it up on my own, I take a look at the answers.

I also have a leetcode account but my plan, is to tackle CTCI first, I am really worried at my lack of knowledge when attempting to solve this algorithmic questions.

Secondly am I aiming too high, by wanting to intern a tech firm/big 4, my first internship was at a big 4 consulting company  and I have  a distinciton wam(75+) from a top 3 school in my country(I am from Sydney, so you figure it out which school it is) , I have some relatively decent projects using some decent web frameworks [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), Spring, Django. Its just that my algorithmic toolbox is relatively empty.

Last week I got a message from another company (bigger and in a different market) in LI asking if I could do an interview/was interested (they were probably just spam screening since my LI profile isn't really attractive). I did a phone call and a coding test and they want to talk more later this week.

Tl;dr/My question is: If I get an offer from a new company, how could I go on to talk with my current employer about this? Is there a way to ask for a raise from an offer or is it kinda dickey? Is 3 years in the same place enough to go for another job for new experiences?

I'm a rising junior in college and I currently have an (unpaid) internship at a very small startup that I've been doing for 2 months. I only have a few weeks left but I'm feeling quite stuck in everything - in addition, my mentors aren't incredibly useful and I feel like I've just been BS'ing the last 2 months.  It doesn't help that I'm not \*amazing\* at programming to start off with. At this point, I've just been making it through each week just to have some professional CS experience on my resume... is this bad?

I know that side projects are really important on a CS resume, and I've been thinking about dropping the internship to learning other CS stuff that I'm interested in, like HTML/CSS/Javascript. However, I'm not sure if my resume will ""look bad"" if I've only done a couple months of this internship. 

Do you guys have any feedback? If you were in this position, what would you do?

Thanks!"

Hey everyone,


I am a 27 y/o female currently working on my application for fall 2021. 

My goal has always been to get into consulting which has been something I want to do from a very long time.

**MBA Info**

Why I want an MBA: I want to use my current experience and basically start working in consulting . Its high time in my career that I make a shift and for that an MBA is needed as my work visa is coming to an end in November.

Why I want one now: I worked in US for about 4 years and now my work visa is coming to an end I have gathered some good experience and  want to now use this time in finishing my education and gaining some skills .

Target schools: Kellogg, Fuqua, Ross, Booth, OSU, Darden , HBS (just a dream school just like trying my luck in a lottery game), UNC, Rotterdam

**Background**

* Work experience: 4 years
* Extra curriculars and other experience: Worked for a non-profit organization helping victims of sex trafficing to make a life again.
* Undergrad school/major: Computer Science from non-target T20 indian engineering school
* Race/nationality: Indian
* Sex: Female

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 760 (48 Q, 48 V, 8 IR) 
* Undergrad GPA: 3.7 (was top 3 in class) graduated in 2015

My goal at this point in to try and move into consulting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work experience: My work experience is all over as I was married right out of college and then moved to europe and then US and seperated 9 months ago. I am on a J-2 dependent visa.

2015 : Jan - June: Software Intern for a non target consulting company.

2015 November -2016: moved to Europe on a tourist visa and then moved to US in November 2016 and got my work visa in March and got my first job , Sales consultant for a real estate company.

2017 March- October 2017 - Sales consultant at a real estate company . Work visa ended so I applied again and it takes 3-5 months to come.

November 2017- December 2017- Temp. Business proposal consultant for a startup in India so was working remotely as a volunteer.

January 2018 - April 2020- Sales Consultant for automation and robotic product for a Mid level distributor in Ohio mainly working in the Automotive market. 

Digital marketing Project lead - Launched a marketing project in the company and kept expanding it to other location fo the company.

Post acquitsition system Integeration - Worked in the M&amp; A team and helped them in the ERP integeration for all the new acquistion. I worked for PE owned company. Travelled to different companies helping in integeration.

I was working in all these roles simultaneously as I wanted to make use of every opportunity I got and most of the times I asked for them and got to work in them which added a lot to my experience.

 I was going to work as a Project manager for M&amp;A but to get a visa I needed a business degree .

Got laid off in April after covid -19 hit the company very very hard. I have been trying to get back in the job market and searching but its not that easy and I am falling sick again and again so I fear going to work as most places are expecting me to come in which now I am ready to go once I get the job, Also my visa runs out in October so I am not getting jobs due to that as well.  

I get an year to year visa which goes from October to October and most times my work authorization take 3-5 month to come

Please let me know if this profile is good enough for Kellogg, Booth, Darden . These are my target school.  

Also what other schools I can go for that helps me to get into consulting later on?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much."

The Java project allows the user to input a football team scores for each game, and does numerous calculations based on average points scored and allowed. It also incorporates an insertion sort and binary search algorithm. I am currently writing its GUI in JavaFX.

My Python project is a federal government budget program, where users can enter the amount of money they want to spend for each federal program. Calculations will then be made to calculate how over budget they are, how much deficit spending is, create program spending categories through a hashmap, etc. I just started this project, so I haven't gotten to its GUI yet.

hz0zco,9,2020-07-27,"I can't sustain a passion for anything long-term, and therefore can't excel at anything",mitare,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hz0zco/i_cant_sustain_a_passion_for_anything_longterm/,"**TL;DR** I'm someone who can really excel at something if I'm passionate about it. But I can't seem to sustain my passion for anything long-term, so I plateau and eventually underperform.

_Posting this again since it was mistakenly removed earlier, removing the ambiguous language that sounded diagnosis-seeking._

I work in artificial intelligence. When I first got into it during my undergrad, I got _really_ into it. I was obsessive. I read and studied and learned to build stuff on my own time. I was really good at it and impressed a lot of people with how quickly I was able to gain a mastery of the fundamentals of the field. This early momentum propelled me to lots of early successes – I built a good network of people working in the industry in my area, got some good internships on my resume, and got into a really competitive master's program.

But that initial spurt only lasted so long. Gradually, my interested waned from fiery passion to sizzling coals. I've now finished my master's and am at my first full-time job, and I have been majorly underperforming – I'm at risk of losing the job in the next month or so if I can't figure out how to turn it around. This is really frustrating because on the face of it, it's the perfect job. It's at a really well-renowned startup in my field, it's super flexible, and it allows me to work squarely within my interests. I should be stoked about the work I'm doing day-to-day, but for some reason I'm not.

Part of the problem is just that the job is extremely unstructured – no deadlines, no assigned projects, no regular checkins with my boss, nothing. I have to figure out ways to contribute to my team's goals on my own and follow through. Obviously not great for someone with ADHD (in fact, my underperformance at my job is what propelled me to finally go and get tested). But, despite the lack of structure, I feel that I really lack the excitement and passion for my work that I had a few years back. Sure, my job requires initiative and self-drive, but when I'm really excited about something, I'm nothing if not self-driven.

This is not the first time this has happened in my life. I was raised a Mormon, and when I was 19 I went on a church mission to an area with a very difficult language which I had to learn. In the beginning, I was _stoked_. I was really looking forward to learning this language. Unlike most, I started studying on my own as soon as I got my assignment, and by the time I arrived at the so-called ""Missionary Training Center"" two months later, I already had a major head-start over my peers. When I arrived in my country of service, fellow missionaries and natives alike were amazed at how good I was at the language considering I had just arrived. In the first couple of months there, I continued to excel and grow in my abilities. But then, my excitement began to fade into banal normalcy and I plateaud. By the end of my 2-year mission, I was still _pretty good_ at the language compared to others – as with AI, my initial momentum carried me a long way – but there were also many who had surpassed me in fluency.

I really struggle with this. A former partner once told me that I can master anything if I set my mind to it. But I don't seem to have any mastery over the things my mind is set to. I can get really excited about something and have several months (or even a year, in the case of AI) where I can obsess about it and, on the day to day, have a much easier time getting myself into a hyperfocused state. But then I plateau. I can be good at something _if and only if_ I can be passionate about it, but I can't seem to make myself be passionate about anything unless a perfect storm occurs, and even then it only lasts for a limited time. I feel like I should be able to get it together and just will myself to put the same energy into my work as I did in the early days, but it doesn't seem to work that way.

I feel locked out of achieving my own potential. Like I'm racing a car that uses the whole tank of fuel in the first lap to great effect, but then slowly coasts to the finish line. I feel like I should be blowing everyone at my job away, or at least holding my own. Instead, I am on probation.

I just got diagnosed with ADHD and should start taking Adderall or something soon. I'm hopeful that will help, but think it would be naive of me to assume that will solve all my problems.

Does anyone have advice for sustaining passion for something even after the early excitement wanes? Am I overattributing to ADHD and this is just a normal life thing? I really care about succeeding in my career and feel like I'm screwing up the good trajectory I set myself on in the beginning. In short, I'm fed up with myself and feel helpless about the possibility of doing better."

From November to April I have been working as a consulting intern in a Big 4 company that didn't renewed my contract because of the upcoming crisis scenario and the subsequent lacking of projects and activities to staff me and other of the team on. 

Since that moment I have been unemployed. During the lockdown I have been searching around for a job opportunity but almost no company in Italy were hiring and going abroad to look for a job was not an option because of the travel limitations.

Now, after the reopening of the country and the resumption of activities the situation seems to be a little bit better, with company that started interviewing again. So I am looking around for a job, sending CV and applying on linkedin, but with no great  results. 

I understand that I am not using a well structured way of searching for a job so I would like some suggestions to increase my opportunities to land a job. 

\- I am mainly using Linkedin, but maybe I am limiting my opportunities not considering other useful sites. Do you think there are other interesting sites to use?

\- I was thinking to make a list of companies I would like to work in and try to send a spontaneous application on their sites. Anyway I have read around that spontaneous applications are not useful and only a waste of time. Do you think it is a move that could bring some result?

\- I am opened also to go working abroad in other EU countries, but I don't know how to move to find a job abroad and I feel limited by my lacking of knowledge of the local language, since I know only english and italian. Could be a good strategy  to be noticed to go in the country I would like to work and go directly at companies HQ to leave my curriculum there? Otherwise how could I move to overcome the difficulties tied to the lacking of local language?

\- I was thinking to try some online course to increase my skills and become more attractive for the HR. What do you think could be good courses or platforms to learn business and finance topics?

Any advice to help me learn how to move in the job search world would be a great help."

Tldr: what are some way to find a intership with 0 experience in the field i am working towards?"

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from a public university in California. The reason I started studying CS was to become a Software Engineer. I had dreams of working at FAANG and at the time I didn't realize how foolish that was. As I got closer to graduating and started to apply for internships and jobs I began to realize how competitive the field was. I was a middle-of-the-pack CS student at public university. I never had a shot at FAANG.

I was originally set to graduate in December 2019, but decided to take an extra semester and graduate in the spring because I could not find a Software Engineering job. That turned out to be a mistake because I graduated during the peak of Covid-19. I officially graduated in May. I have applied to over 700 positions since July 27th, 2019. I am currently unemployed.

I decided to keep track of all my job applications because I knew I would have to apply to a lot of positions and I needed a way to organize them.

I'm posting now as a postmortem to my Software Engineering job search. Hopefully you can learn something from this, and if not maybe it will at least be entertaining.

#**Data**
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7pS1LQ_aF_AbCm-7CHOZ4EAmnf1c7TmQVqw7m0f53I/edit?usp=sharing) is the raw data I collected. [Here](https://imgur.com/fVgorm6) is a pie chart breakdown of the outcomes.


I kept track of: The company name, the position title, the position location, the date that I applied on, the final outcome, whether or not I got an interview, and the platform on which I applied. 

Looking back I should have kept track on the date of rejection to figure out the average time it takes to get a response. There are probably other useful data points I could've collected to. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this.

#**Resume &amp; Cover Letter**

I've made many changes to my resume over the course of the year. I'll post a few different versions here, though this is not an exhaustive list. 

[V1](https://imgur.com/FluOaoc)

[V2](https://imgur.com/PASQ7ne)

[Current Resume](https://imgur.com/Zw8DAQg)

There hasn't been any increase in responses to my resume as I've changed it. 

I've used a couple different cover letter formats, but I didn't take pictures of them over time. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/FVqx2ZZ) is the current cover letter format that I use.  I haven't noticed any increase in response when using a cover letter vs. not using one.

#**Responses**

* Before I began keeping track of my job applications, I was applying to internships my junior year. I applied for ~70 or so and was rejected or ghosted by them all. At the time, I thought 70 applications was a lot.

* During late October of 2019, I got my first response. I did well in a phone screen and then moved to the technical portion. I dropped an easy question because I took the interview at the end of the day. It was also my first technical interview so I was nervous and found it hard to think. Lesson learned. Take your interviews at a time of day when you're sharp and ready (in the morning for me).

* I've received a few coding tests that automatically get sent out to candidates. I usually do okay on those, but not stellar. Not good enough to get a job apparently.

* In June I interviewed with a local company and it went well. I passed the behavioral and the technical portion and was told I was being moved to the final interview stage where I would sit down with senior HR and management. When I followed up with them a week later the recruiter told me that they were ""pausing"" the position.

#**My ""Software Engineering"" experience**


**Job Offer**

If you were to go through my spreadsheet you'd see that I actually got an offer! I removed the companies name from the spreadsheet so as to not dox them since my experience there was very negative.

Late December of 2019 I applied for a Software Engineering job on Indeed. The listing was for a full time SWE and the pay was listed as 4,000 - 7,000/mo. The CEO got in touch with me and I interviewed the same day I applied. The interview went well and he offered me an ""internship"" as a contractor for $17.50/hr. 

I knew it was a bad offer, especially for California, but I accepted because I was desperate and foolish.

Within a week of working there I knew the job wasn't Software Engineering and that I was getting ripped off. In the first two weeks I was there, I didn't see any of the ""engineers"" write a single line of code. 

I was working along side the other ""engineers"" getting deliverables out to clients. The other ""engineers"" were making 60k+/yr salaried and I was making less than 30k/yr as a contractor. I'm pretty sure its illegal in California to hire someone as a contractor to do the same work an employee is doing (look at AB5), but that's beside the point. 

I stayed because it was experience I could put on my resume. At the end of March half of the company, myself included, was laid off due to covid. 

**HPE Internship Offer**

In late February I applied for and was interviewed for a summer internship with HPE. There were two rounds, one behavioral and one technical and I did well in both. The recruiter called me and offered me the position verbally and I accepted. 10 minutes later she called me back and asked me if I would be returning to school for Fall 2020. I said no, because I had planned to graduate in May. She rescinded the internship offer and I was right back where I started.

If this ever happens to you I recommend you lie. 

#**Conclusion**

Software Engineering isn't for everyone. I started my degree very hopeful and optimistic and now I am the opposite. If I knew it would be like this, I wouldn't have gone to college.

I'm not sure what my next steps are, but I know that I am done with Computer Science and Software Engineering. I just don't have the heart anymore.

 I'm considering going back to school to study some kind of engineering.

I hope you can gain some insight from this post and if not you may at least find the data cool to look at, or my story fun to read.

Thank you."
hz62ik,1,2020-07-27,Personal advice about transferring as an undergrad?,-Crux-,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/hz62ik/personal_advice_about_transferring_as_an_undergrad/,"Hello, I'm currently about to enter my junior year of undergrad and I'm looking for some advice and/or information about transferring and how that might affect my prospective application to grad school. A lot of this is has to do with my personal situation, so I'm not really looking for definite answers as much as how you view it from your own perspective. Thanks for any help you can offer.

First, I'll explain my situation. I'm from a state in the middle of the country (sorry to be vague) with a pretty good state school (top 150). All through grade school I knew I wanted to go out-of-state for undergrad. So I applied and was accepted as an honors student to a research university in a big city on the east coast (top 75) which is known for its networking opportunities. It's worth noting that this school is private and extremely expensive (~50k/year on top of a scholarship), though I am receiving financial support from my parents. However, since coming to this university, I've been pretty lonely. I haven't really made any friends and I've failed to network very well in the 2 years I've been here. I'm majoring in a STEM subject and I hope to eventually go to a top grad school. I don't know if I will attempt this straight out of undergrad, but it's certainly something I want to pursue.

Up until March of this year I was pretty set on remaining at my university for all 4 years. Despite my loneliness, I knew it offered the best career opportunities available to me in terms of internships and networking (though I hadn't yet been taking advantage of them), and I also really like the city it's in. Then the school sent everyone home for quarantine under the assumption that schools would reopen in the fall. However, they recently announced that they'd be going fully online for the fall semester, and I don't even know if they'll be able to reopen in the spring. So at this point, I don't know whether it's possible or even worthwhile to plan on returning to my university and then find friends and network with the 1-1.5 years I'll have left. I have a good GPA (~3.7) but I haven't really met anyone who I'd want to write letters of rec for me, nor have I had any real research experience yet. Not to mention the price we're paying for online classes.

My other option would be to take my fall online classes at home and transfer to my state school in the spring. The benefits of this are that I'd be closer to dozens of friends who I'm pretty close with from high school, it would be roughly half the price and I'd have better housing accommodations, and I'd likely still be able to join an honors program and maintain a good GPA. Their research opportunities are good, but not as good as my current university. However, I wouldn't have nearly as many networking opportunities and I would be losing the name prestige of the school I currently attend.

How might transferring reflect on my prospective grad school applications? What else could I be losing by transferring out of my current university? Could I still get into a program at a top school if I were to transfer? Would it be less likely? Any answers to these questions or other advice/perspectives would be greatly appreciated. I can't decide which option is best for me, and I'd like to know what people with admissions experience think of my situation."

&amp;#x200B;

Every now and then I see posts on this subreddit describing when someone has failed a class, or gets really overwhelmed with everything in an engineering program. I just want to share a quick story.

I graduated high school in 2009 top 10 in my class. I was a good student and school really came easy to me. I wanted to get an engineering degree just like my dad and I started applying to colleges. I got accepted to the only college I applied to and began my studies that fall. Little did I know that my college career would span 11 years and completely change my life in every single way.

I learned quickly that while I excelled in school, I sucked at life and life came knocking. I realized after that first semester that I literally had no friends, and the friends I thought I had, weren't really my friends. I slipped into a deep depression that lasted years. I failed classes, full semesters, and eventually almost ended my life entirely because the pressure of life and school was so much. I took years off and pretty much re-took every single engineering class twice. 

Fast forward 11 years, I graduated this year with my Electrical Engineering degree at a 2.4 GPA and today I was just offered a position at Northrop Grumman for $80,000 a year. Even as I was getting close to graduation, I was still anxious that my GPA would disqualify me from any sort of successful engineering position even though I know that my GPA did not reflect my capabilities accurately, I didn't think I would ever get that chance. 

My advice to all of you is if this is something you really want to do, and you have ""The Knack,"" don't give up. Take advantage of every opportunity given to you, I was able to complete 2 full internships and a co-op to gain the proper experience that allowed me to make up for my crappy GPA and I am forever grateful to those managers who took a chance on me. But don't give up, play the game, and keep going. Take the bruises and the beatings, but keep your eye on the goal and put in the work. It will pay off. Today has been one of the best days of my life knowing that for the past 11 years, not only did I have to re-define what it meant to be me, it prepared me to take on this next step. So, from the 29 year old guy re-taking the intro to circuits class for the 3rd time, know that your GPA does not reflect who you are and make sure you find the time to spend on yourself so that when this is all over, you aren't just an empty shell with an engineering degree, you're actually an engineer who can go about and change the world. 

Good luck and may the   √ -1 always be j."

hzdixr,1,2020-07-28,Looking around for unpaid SaaS internships?,MilToCivWork,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hzdixr/looking_around_for_unpaid_saas_internships/,"Hello /r/jobs,

Sorry in advance for the wall of text...

I am making an inquiry here as to the feasibility of finding an unpaid internship in the SaaS industry. I am coming from having been in the military working for 6 years as a communications / IT officer, and then working 1.5 years between being a contractor and government civilian- also in technical roles.

I want to work remotely in the future, and as I did technical work in my previous life, I figured a SaaS company would be a good fit. Of course, everyone wants X years of experience for literally every role (including entry-level tech support for proprietary software). Could I potentially find a reputable established company / up-and-coming startup company that would offer me an unpaid ""internship?""

\- I am not hurting financially, so to an extent just getting the experience I can use later on a resume is worth more than being paid. Not that I am opposed to getting paid somehow, I just think I'm more likely to find something this way. I legitimately also would probably enjoy doing things like learning new software skills, writing documentation, and helping people solve technical problems. I would be thinking along the lines of a 3-6 month initial ""internship"" period.

\- I have other things I am trying to accomplish with my time right now. I am currently working my way through a Salesforce Administrator certification program, and plan to attend a software engineering Bootcamp. I had funding to attend approved through the Veterans Affairs, but opted not to use it due to COVID-19 hitting hard and shutting in-person stuff down. I would prefer not to take that particular course online if possible- even if that means putting it off for a few months.

I also have 36 months of GI Bill that I will use at some point, and have considered just getting that done, but, again... I don't want to do it online, and COVID-19 has created a lot of uncertainty about schools being able to open and remain open for in-person classes.

Ultimately I would like to gain experience that I can use towards obtaining a job at a later date. I wouldn't be opposed to an ""intern-to-hire"" type situation after a certain amount of time either, but I know that's almost certain to not be a likely scenario."

I'm better than most of my peers at stats and programming, but I am by no means great, and certainly nowhere near someone who has had the extensive maths training that biostatisticians usually do. I am competent, so it's unlikely I'll be let go short-term for performance issues, but after 4 years in this role, I am definitely stagnating. I've been unhappy for a while, and since I don't anticipate moving up in the next \~2 years (combination of cost-cutting and bad timing), I'm looking for a change.

My background is a little unusual for this type of position. I have a Ph.D. from the psych department of a second-tier University here in the city, with a thesis on computational neuroscience that sat at the intersection of computational modeling, neurobiology, psychology, and behavioural economics. I then did a postdoctoral fellowship for 4 years in the 'States, in a neurophysiology lab. While a postdoc, I also did a summer Management Consulting internship and led a data science team in an IRL (i.e. not Kaggle) competition. My wife and I moved back here about 4 years ago; she got a once-in-a-lifetime dream job, and our 14-month-old daughter is about to start at a very good government-subsidized daycare. Relocation is not an option.

I have looked into and applied for many data science, business intelligence, project management, and even biostatistician positions at other organizations in the city, but have either been rejected outright or my application was silently rejected (i.e., radio silence for weeks). I've had a few people look at my resume, and they don't really have any additional comments for me. This has me wondering 3 things:

1. Is there something I am missing in my background (or a red flag *in* my background) that is making me such an unattractive candidate? What essential thing is missing or hurdle present?
2. What other career options are available to someone with my background who actually enjoys team work and investigation? I am honestly at a loss here.
3. Am I just stuck in this job until continued cost cutting puts me on the chopping block?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just... I don't understand.

**TL;DR**: What are the realistic options available for a quantitatively-minded neuroscience Ph.D. in a large Canadian city?"

Here is the twenty-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

hzht53,9,2020-07-28,College... *A Discussion*,cincinnatiz,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/hzht53/college_a_discussion/,"What’s up y’all! 

So I saw an article the other day randomly about how college is just so so so important for the tech economy, especially if you want to be an entrepreneur. And it really got me thinking.. Is it really even worth it anymore? 

I dropped out of college. I had basically a full ride. I was paying just over $3k/yr at a $60k/yr school. The first month I was there, I sold the small marketing company I had started when I was 16. Between the marketing company and other side things I was doing, I was making far more than any professor on campus and definitely had a lot more saved after the acquisition. 

My friend went to USC and dropped out first year and now works at Tesla HQ as a Computer Engineer. He’s 20...

Another friend didn’t even go to college, he now has a startup and works at Google which he’s about to quit. 

Myself, a long with the friends listed above, went to private schooling all our lives. In private schooling, it’s engraved into us to go to a “good” college, get a “good safe job” at a big company, and maybe buy a boat or the cheapest Rolex you can buy. And if you don’t do that.. Well, you’re crazy.

But then I talk to “Digital Marketing Majors” at these “good colleges” and they have no idea what ROAS means. Or I talk “Entrepreneurship majors” and they don’t know anything about seed funding or have never been taught about the importance of culture..

Not to mention students today graduate with crippling debt and 9% interest rates. 

Literally the most successful people I’ve met who are business owners, they all didn’t finish college. Sure, I know people who have went to school and worked their way up the corporate ladder, but I’m talking about business owners.

I’m not saying by any means if you don’t go to college, you’ll be automatically successful. But I’ve found when you take education into your own hands and you’re backed up against a wall, you are setting yourself up for success. When you go all in, and understand it’s either you win or lose everything, you usually figure it out. 

I feel as if in today’s society, if you want to be a business owner or work in startup culture, you maybe should re-consider going to college and instead go all in on your own business, internships, Co-ops, etc.

What do you guys think? I want to have a real conversation!"

hzjyhe,1,2020-07-28,[IWantOut]25M AudioEngineerAndOther USA-&gt;Denmark,whatajacks,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/hzjyhe/iwantout25m_audioengineerandother_usadenmark/,"Hey guys,

So I think this sub is just awesome. I really can't believe how active and helpful it is. I love following people's story and seeing all the helpful and realistic responses to people's relocation goals. This sub is part of the reason I went and got a unique education and studied and lived in Denmark at a højskole last year. I had an incredible experience and learned so much and met some great people. I also just lived there for the summer last year after højskole was over and that was lovely, nothing better than CPH in the summertime (especially when you’ve lived there for multiple winters). I've posted here before but I was a bit vague, so now I'm just going to be super straight forward and list all the possible attributes I have that MAY serve some sort of way to obtain a certain kind of Danish visa. Like I'll just say everything I've got, and then maybe somebody can help point my energies in the best direction towards the path of least resistance for obtaining a Danish visa in the next year or two. If I need to work a little extra hard in an area to build it up to a point of then passing for a certain visa requirement, I'm totally down to do that, but it would be nice to know which path makes the most sense.

\- I speak a fair amount of Danish, but wouldn't say 100% fluent. My pronunciation is awful living in Chicago and only reading or listening to Danish on TV shows and music but not being able to use it daily like I could when I was living there.

\- I've lived in Denmark off and on for like 3 years in total. Visiting for some months as a teenager, then studying abroad for 6 months and staying for another 3 in college, then visiting again for a few months years later a few different times, then living there for another 8 months again for højskole and just living.

\- I have probably a financial cushion in savings of about 3 months of a normal 25 year olds living style here in Chicago (I know Copenhagen is more expensive. Though Aarhus is more affordable). Should I get into financial specifics? Idk if that matters. But I have a decent amount to make the move and float around for probably 3 months in an American city, and maybe 1.5-2 months in Denmark, if that makes sense. Also - I have plenty of Danish friends in both CPH and Aarhus and Odense I could stay with for a few weeks if need be, while I look for an apartment, job etc.

\- I have a bachelors degree in Environmental Management from a Big Ten school.

\-I'm scheduled to take the LSAT for the hell of it next month because I'm considering a new career path/more schooling and want to see how I do.

\- I am currently a studio assistant engineer at a huge studio in Chicago that does both music and post production (Not meaning to name drop - I just get coffee and coil cables and move mics essentially, like I'm so low on the totem pole, but they work with artists like Billie Eilish, Lady gaga, Chance the Rapper, Mavis Staples, they've done Michael Jackson stuff like big big names and then in post they do stuff for massive company's ads Chase, American Express, Netflix, voice overs and dubbing for massive budget marvel movies etc etc). And I only share this because I know though I'm pretty low ranking here, if I can flip this into being an asset that I have worked with super high budget clients to a Danish audio company, it's impressive on paper - as a millennial American who is trained in good looking resumes and 'on paper' qualifications I know the significance of that. That being said, I am confident in my abilities and I am skilled to some degree of professionalism and have learned a lot - like I got selected to be 5 one of out of 250 candidates for a reason. Also I have sat in on all these session with Top 40 artists and Netflix and giant ad companies, like I sit and keep my mouth shut, but I'm still in the room learning and helping with the clients.

\- I am a musician who has original music and I say this because I know in certain countries (The Netherlands, Berlin Artist visa etc) you can use that as your reason for a visa, if you declare it as a small business and have details of income streams and potential shows etc etc. I met an Australian in CPH this past year who took songs from his Bandcamp and Soundcloud and touring information to get a small business visa in Denmark and was living and working there. I believe he also had sideline employment but a) he was Australian they have working holiday with DK b) he may have been working 'in the black' or 'under the table' for the sideline employment, I just don't know

\-I am trained in and can do live sound at a venue (I know the big venues in Copenhagen - Vega, Lille Vega, Pumpehuset, Den Grøn Hall in Christiania, and more). My audio engineering teacher (lydteknik) from højskole who I'm very close with actually used to be the sound guy at Vega in like the late 90s and I'm sure would write a glowing review of my abilities for that job.

\- I have some modeling experience (God I hate saying this one. It seems so incredibly vain, and I really don't like to put this on here, but I have looked up stories and I personally know an American from NYC who got there on a OP1 visa for 'unique and specialized talent' to Denmark as a male model. I only did this at a friends suggestion for a bit in CPH and then in Chicago because I needed money and was busting my ass as a server at a restaurant). I'm not signed to any agency, but I think with a bit more pushing here in the next 6 months I could make that happen. Again this point feels so ... vain to me, and I'm really embarrassed to share it, but ya gotta work with what ya got I guess...

\- I attended a højskole in Jutland and studied audio engineering there, which I believe is part of what helped me land this job in Chicago as an assistant engineer at a major studio. I learned a lot and built a decent resume.

\-I have experience as a freelance music teacher teaching kids lessons off of Craigslist for guitar, piano as well as in a smaller business music school part time.

\- I have worked as a counselor for Autistic children during summer camps and really enjoyed this work and would be happy to work in this sort of childcare again or as an au pair for a child with special needs.

\- I studied Environmental Science of the Arctic while I was living in Denmark as a study abroad student in college and have some connections at my study abroad school still - I've applied twice a year since I finished for a job there and had no luck.

\- I worked on a Danish family farm last summer and they had this whole focus on sustainable growing and organic stuff. That connection is still there outside Aarhus and they said they'd be happy to help in any way for me to get a visa. They are also declared a small business according to the Danish gov't and sell their produce and honey and dairy to places in Aarhus. Perhaps they could hire me as an employee for a visa?

\- I am willing to go to more schooling but I just don't know in what - and this brings a whole subset of questions along with it 1) can I work sideline employment to support myself as a student, since I am not eligible for SU support as an American 2) can you switch degree programs without switching visas 3) does a masters degree (I know Danes generally are more likely to have advanced degrees than Americans and to compete in the job market post graduation I really would need a masters) have to relate to my previous Bachelors degree? I would be okay with studying more Environmental Science and working in that field, especially in Denmark, but clearly I have taken a more music/audio engineering job path since I finished university here, so I worry about if my application would even be approved to study a masters in a Environmental Science.

\- I have basic administrative assistant/office experience after working as an administrative assistant at a Stone and Granite distribution company in Chicago for a year.

\- I have worked an internship in Environmental Safety for a large university - hazardous waste disposal, water quality, indoor air quality, runoff remediation.

\- I speak a decent amount of Spanish too, less than Danish, but if need be I could get this skill up, and there's no shortage of Spanish speaking friends I have here in Chicago to practice with or tutors to pay as well as TV, Movies, songs with Spanish to listen and learn from.

\- I have no problem waiting tables, cooking, manual labor, landscaping - I've done all of those before. Work is work in my mind and if it's a means to an end (paying rent) frankly idc what it is that I'm doing. I get a lot of personal fulfillment from my music and my friends and I don't care so much - at this stage in my life- what I'm doing to pay my bills.

\- I would start a personal business no problem, but I have no experience doing this and worry about what I would even do. While working at a restaurant in Copenhagen this past year I threw around the idea with a Danish coworker and friend who has experience running a food truck of just opening up one of those and making some sort of American themed food truck with food I know how to make (From my experience Danes just eat that up hahah. Like a big burger with bacon on it and some ""American"" chicken and waffles or something. As long as I use Økologisk ingredients I imagine it could be very popular. I look at places like the BBQ restaurant Warpigs in CPH and see how popular it is there when that's just an average American BBQ restaurant here with good beer, but Danes love it so much like it's a very big deal there. Same with the American themed Burger gas station place in Vesterbro.) And I don't mean to discount how challenging it is to run a successful small business, even a food truck, I know that is a very hard task and requires 60+ hr work weeks and nights and weekend work etc. I don't want to seem condescending. I have worked in food trucks and at restaurants and I know it's hard work. Plus I have  lot to learn about the financial side of a small business and I'm not discounting that.

\- Speaking of that restaurant, I have multiple connections with restaurants and plenty of restaurant experience some of which in CPH. The owner of Warpigs is actually from Chicago and grew up right where I grew up. I've spoken with them and they said they'd love to hire me full time but I need a proper visa so they don't get in trouble. I have other connections at other restaurants/bars/shops in Copenhagen and a few in Aarhus, but they all say the same thing. Is there anyway to work a visa out of a job like that in the service industry? What if I get some sort of 'managerial' role at one of these service industry jobs?

\- I am open to living elsewhere in Europe. I have no ancestry close enough in lineage to get dual citizenship, I'm 3rd generation Irish American, 3rd generation Slovenian American, and 3rd generation German American. Neither of my parents hold other passports besides American, though they could both get Irish if they wanted to, and I'm fairly certain my mom could get Slovenian. I'd like to live in Scandinavia/Northern Europe and my second choice would be Berlin, which I have visited and really like, if not CPH or Aarhus. I have started to look into DAFT and moving to The Netherlands, but I've never even been there so it seems absurd to say.

I know that is a lot. But I think the people on this sub are just great, and just once I wanna put it all out on the table and see what you guys think. It's sort of a crossroads time in my life, and with the pandemic shutting things down here, and getting furloughed from one of my jobs, I've had a lot of time to save money and just consider what I want to do and where I want to go now. I didn't hold anything back so I'm hoping that you guys can critique and encourage where you see the path of least resistance for me to make this move. Thank you for reading all this and thank you for participating in this sub! :)

EDIT;




Okay I am getting a lot of response that I was just naive in posting this and I would just like to add that none of this is unfounded in reality. Like I literally know an American who got there on an OP1 visa as a model, I know a young American who didn't have the degree related to the job on the positive list on NyIDanmark.com (Journalism degree with a job offer in tech and education) and got a positive list visa, I know someone who is there on an ""Artist visa"" or something of the sort from Australia - so while I appreciate the participation I think it's such a bummer that this has been downvoted and dismissed in a way just for asking questions, when I really like this sub! It feels like just because my Title isn't a STEM degree people have these preconceptions and because of my tone and because I'm an American trying to go to Scandinavia (a cliche on this sub, probably) it got super downvoted. I'd also just like to point out that I have spent a lot of time on NyIDanmark.com and I ask these questions and I feel like I come off as very naive - but look at two of the jobs ON THE POSITIVE LIST

141200: Restaurant manager

Requirement: At least three years education at bachelor level

142010: Store manager

Requirement: At least three years education at bachelor level

Straight from the website. So I know, I come across as naive, but what I said about being offered a managerial position at two restaurants in CPH and a clothing store - AND the fact that I have years of experience doing that, is why I asked. And yes I know maybe I'd need to go to get a degree in hospitality management or culinary school Fine! then tell me that, but maybe a certificate program from a reputable culinary school would suffice for a 'degree' in this situation since I think we can all agree - colleges are more likely to offer 4 year bachelors in Engineering, Science, Humanities etc. than food preparation. I have a 4 years Bachelors of Environmental Management degree and I took MANAGEMENT classes in it, so while it related to the Environment perhaps that degree in conjunction with YEARS of service industry work in restaurants and a literal job offer from a restaurant in CPH for a MANAGERIAL position would be enough to get me that visa technically. I know I am shooting in the dark, but if someone said hey that does sound possible, and here's where you can check what 'level' of certification you need SPECIFICALLY for food preparation and hospitality management to qualify that would be so helpful, instead of just being shot down for the tone of my post or what people think of my ambitions here. Like this post has 0 upvotes and a lot of participation. I don't know why people would vote this down other than that I come across as naive and presumptuous - when really I have done some research and am just using this as a source for further information from informed American (or non EU) -&gt; Danish expats.

EDIT 2


Also here's another job on the Positive List https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Applying/Work/Positive%20list 

213200: Farming adviser
Requirement: At least three years education at bachelor level 

Listed under Natural Science and engineering.
I studied Natural Science and have a 4 years Bachelor degree in it AND studied it at a study abroad in Denmark AND have a job offer to be a farm employee from a small business in Aarhus. So like I just want to point out - it's looking at the positive list that brought me here and made me post this - I'm not just making this all up."

However, I've spent this entire summer trying to build a SaaS product that's very close to monetization.

For big tech companies I know that work experience is basically a requirement at this point and I feel like I'm at a disadvantage. I don't have that many users or customers as of right now but once I advertise it later this week and next week, I'm hoping that will change. Really wanted to list it under experience because I worked very hard to get it up and running and I'm afraid that if I put it under projects, it would be seen as just another weekend / class project or something with not much value.

Would listing my project under ""Experience"" be valid in my scenario?"

hzmmpq,2,2020-07-28,[LF ADVICE] 2020 Graduate - IT Interest,troopaloop311,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hzmmpq/lf_advice_2020_graduate_it_interest/,"I have a few questions about the state of job searching rn. I would like to hear the perspectives of people in a similar position, as well as those who have had success. 

I am a Business Computer Information Systems major, and I graduated in May from the University of North Texas. Woot woot! Real quick I want to state that I haven't had an internship, and that I have been driving Uber to make money. I have been through about 4 interview processes in the semester before for internships, but they never worked out. On the bright side, I've at least had some experience with in person interviews.

Since March I have been applying online to companies with an interest in mostly business analyst / consultant or developer roles. Up until late May I was mostly using sites like Glassdoor, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter to find and apply to jobs. At that point I had applied to \~70 places and heard back from 1/3 saying either they were no longer hiring, or that I was not a right fit. The rest I never got a response from, so out of all of those application I didn't even land an interview.

After May I decided to switch up my strategy. I noticed that most of the applications I had sent (especially on ZipRecruiter) were some version of ""quick applications."" I basically would automatically apply with whatever information I filled out on my profile. That whole aspect seemed off to me. Now whenever I apply I try to do it through the company website. I also have added a template cover letter which I can tweak for each company I apply to. Furthermore, after I apply I go to LinkedIn to try and connect with a recruiter for the company I applied to.  I've had some success with replies, but again for the most part they've said they aren't hiring, or the spot has been filled. People keep telling me that networking is the best way to secure a job, so I am trying to use LinkedIn more.

This past month I have yet again altered my strategy. I have switched my focus towards obtaining a Salesforce administrator certification. As of right now I feel like this is my best chance at landing a job. Working through the Trailhead to gain badges and ultimately give me an edge with ""experience"" and knowledge of this specific tool seems better than continuing to apply. It is actually pretty interesting, and I feel like I understand the tool more and more each day.

So... I guess the reason for this post is to see what other strategies everyone has been using, and to hear peoples stories. I'd like to think there is more I can do than just thinking ""this is the worst job market since the recession or even the great depression."" Also, I believe that this industry shouldn't be quite as impacted, and there should still be jobs. It is a hell of a time to graduate, but I keep telling myself ""all I need is one.""

 Is this a bad strategy? What else can I do to make myself stand out? How else can I be more personal?"
hzmolj,1,2020-07-28,What should i focus on studying?,GodSlayer225,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hzmolj/what_should_i_focus_on_studying/,"I'm entering my third year bachelors of computer science. 
I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node JS), Python, and Java really well. 

My goal is to get an internship in software or web development, but I'm really lost.

I have some experience with shell scripting and C from uni courses. I've made simple console programs and messed around with some web frameworks but haven't made a full website yet.

As I get more into web development, i realize that I find front end really boring and would rather just focus on the back end

I haven't done an internship or had any professional programming experience yet, and I feel pressured to know all these frameworks and languages since that's what is listed under qualifications of job postings.

To improve ive come to 2 conclusions: I should probably focus on hacker rank, get better at writing efficient algorithms to get through coding interviews and improve my skills in general, and I should probably make some more personal projects to put on my resume to show employers I know how to code.


I've made like 10 different small projects that aren't really impressive (very simple algorithms where I make use of an existing API) for example discord bots, web scrapers, to do list and tic tac toe application with React, a poker algorithm that detects what hand you have

When I practice hacker rank and get to the ones labeled medium difficulty, I find them really difficult, some of them I can't solve without googling and it makes me second guess whether I'm smart enough to become a developer.


With so much information out there and many YouTube/udemy tutorials, I feel overwhelmed with all the stuff I feel like I need to know especially after looking at internship qualifications, what should I focus my time on?"

I have just graduated from a Bsc in computer science from a good London University with a First Class. I had a job offer with a decent pay but I have had to take a step back amidst the current situation and my concerns on the future viability of the company. With the job hiring also down, I therefore applied for an Msc in Advanced Software Engineering at a Top London University and I luckily got offered a place. So I am now just considering completing that in the coming year and hoping that the job market would return to normal with more job opportunities. Moreover, my decision to do this also has to do with my future aspiration in doing a Phd, albeit at later time and my Msc helps laying the foundation for that. 

My question is, what would be the best job level to apply for once I complete my masters, e.g. junior, graduate or mid-level, given my following background:

- Completed 4 Months internship
- Worked on few ( open source and personal) Github projects
- I can do most leetcode ( easy and medium) questions
- Active user on Stackoverflow with well over 400+ answers 
- I have good experience in Java, Python, Golang, Docker, Django and have projects to show for it. 

Any help, advice would be appreciated."

hzowhg,0,2020-07-28,Should I try the LeetCode grind if I won't have a lot of available time?,Bleant,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hzowhg/should_i_try_the_leetcode_grind_if_i_wont_have_a/,"TL;DR With an hour a day from monday to friday and two a day in saturday and sunday, is it worth it?

Hello! I'm a brazillian CS undergraduate, set to finish my course by the end of 2021. My graduation project will be in Machine Learning / Data Science, and, even though it's a hot topic, my interest in this area is genuine. Since living conditions in Brazil aren't that nice, I want to leave, probably to Portugal, but possibly to Canada, or other countries with companies where I could be hired. So, in order to have the skills for an interview, as well as an attractive resume, I'm planning to study using both Kaggle and LeetCode.

My internship uses up six hours of my day, and my course, which is about to resume from the pause due to the outbreak, takes four hours. If I use twelve hours of my day, that leaves two hours that I'd want to split evenly between Kaggle and LeetCode. During the weekends, I think ten hours of work each day is reasonable, so six of those would go to my course, and four to split between Kaggle and LeetCode.

The thing is that I've been pretty slow to solve LeetCode questions, even easy ones sometimes take me over an hour. So I wonder if trying to grind would have actual benefits, or if I would end up solving the questions eventually without becoming faster and better.

I'm pretty insecure about my question solving skills, but I've got to at least try.

Thanks for reading, some input would be really important to me!"

I'm a sophomore from Kennesaw State trying to transfer into GT as a mechanical engineering major. I would really like to try and apply to GTRI for a co-op or internship next spring or summer, and I had a question when I was looking at the requirements in the openings.

&gt;REQUIRED MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS  
&gt;  
&gt;**Co-op**  
&gt;  
&gt;• Pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or Physics  
• Must be registered for co-op credit with your university  
• Must have a 3.0 or higher cumulative GPA

Are these qualifications flexible, as in can a mechanical engineering major apply if they have some relevant experience? I read that students can get hired with slightly lower GPA, but since the reddit posts seemed kinda old so if anyone that has recently worked/got hired as a co-op/intern at GTRI could maybe shed some insight on how strict the reqs are, I would appreciate it."

hzt4ob,0,2020-07-28,Taking courses at local CC after graduating BS,r0650n_,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/hzt4ob/taking_courses_at_local_cc_after_graduating_bs/,"Hi all,

I graduated with BS in Computer Engineering from UIUC with 2.85 overall GPA. I did transfer to UIUC from one of the City Colleges of Chicago (a community college (CC)). I did not care too much about my grades at UIUC, however my high transfer GPA from CCC helped to salvage my overall graduation GPA (again, 2.85). I did poorly on some CS courses, namely  Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ as well as Introduction to Algorithms and Models of Computation.

I have no problems getting strong recommendation letters (I lead many extracurricular activities and participated in internships while at UIUC), my SoP will be strong and I will have no problems explaining low GPA (I think).

I landed a job before graduation (I actually failed Introduction to Algorithms and Models of Computation before graduating, and had to retake it while working full time at the same job that I accepted the offer from) at one of the biggest defense contractors in the US. I am working as Systems Engineer (2+ years), however I am literally a software engineer on that team programming (C++, C# and Python) all day every day.

Point here is that there is no positive trend toward the end of my degree. Such that I would do better in technical classes like you typically see in some applicants. Therefore, I was wondering if taking a C++ Data Structures as well as Objects and Algorithms class at the local community college before I apply to OMSCS would make any sense? I would show that I can work full time and take courses and succeed (I am planning on getting A's for both courses). 

OR 

maybe that's not going to work well and I should just explain my low grades."
hztlgi,9,2020-07-28,"I'm (21 M) a scientific genius but an emotional mess, I want my life to end ASAP",pecrumty,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hztlgi/im_21_m_a_scientific_genius_but_an_emotional_mess/,"Somewhere in the northeast of Mexico.

I have been wanting to post here for quite a while, I just created this account because I noticed that some ""friends"" were aware of my other one. 

I just wanted to share my thoughts with someone and I found this sub to be the perfect place. 

This is the first time that I'm sharing this publicly and I'm not a good writer, so beware.

I feel really depressed since I was raped six years ago. He used a long thin stick (less than 10 mm) (a tool of the sport I practiced) to pinch my anus, which left bruises and cuts down there which eventually turned into hemorrhoids. These hemorrhoids healed at the beginning of this year. When I tried to reach out my parents 6 years ago they didn't believe me, and when I finally got them to take me to a hospital, doctors said that I was making it all up. He was my coach, so I tried to reach the authorities of the place where I practiced this sport, they didn't believe me, hence, I was forced to leave the sport. 

All these events caused me anxiety and depression which I can't handle anymore.

My anxiety messed up everything I loved, I can't tell my family that I'm taking psychological therapy because it's kind of a taboo where I live, my (ex)girlfriend (who I met practicing this sport) (she doesn't know the reasons of my anxiety) dumped our 6 year relationship (over text, during quarantine) hating me for my anxiety, the ""friends"" I seem to make betray me with meaningless things that end up hurting my feelings a lot. I have been struggling making friends because I lost my confidence (Yet I know many people from all over the world).

I'm a scientific genius, I've got my IQ scores and all that stuff that backs me up and I know my potential. I did the IB in high school, I build robots, I like programming, I am an intern in a top tech company, I have many science awards, I got accepted into MIT (but I didn't attend because I wanted to stay on a safe place with my family and (now ex)girlfriend, I was feeling really bad back then), numbers  (yes 1,2,3..) talk to me, etc... But all of this is meaningless because my anxiety has turned me into a weak person.

I tried suicide at least 4 times already, but sadly, I failed every one of them. From drinking bleach, to jumping from a bridge (to water, maybe it wasn't that much of a try). 

I was diagnosed with AML (a type of leukemia) a couple of months ago. At first I was relieved with the news of being sick, I thought that it would be an easy way to end my life, at least better than having to do it by myself. But I'm in remission now and I'm improving a lot, in a couple of weeks I will finish my treatment. Which makes me think that it might be a life lesson that is trying to teach me that it's not my time yet.

As of today, I haven't had many scientific contributions, I have published some papers and I have developed some open source projects, I have a robotics team and a Ted Talk which has inspired a lot of people, but it isn't that much. I know my potential, if I continue with my academic path, I'm sure that I will be a top scientist, one of those that are awarded with important medals and prizes. My fear is that if I continue living, I will become more and more indispensable in the society, thus, it will be harder to leave. People will miss me for what I do (but not for who I am). So I want to end this suffering soon. I don't care about recognition, I just want love, friends and love, but I can't seem to find any. 

I really dislike what society is becoming, people fight over everything, I don't want to be part of this anymore. I know I'm being selfish by wanting to end my life and by placing my personal issues before the world issues that are currently happening. But I already shared a lot and I don't want to be here anymore.

I'm still open, I might find something/someone/myself soon, but I'm getting tired of waiting/doing.

So I'm looking for the perfect time, It has to be soon, otherwise it will be too late to be forgotten.

I found this web developer internship job listing and got in contact with the CEO because the company was pretty small (about 10 or less people). I went through an interview with the CEO and then the CTO. Once I got a call back saying I was accepted, I realized they never once brought up pay to me. So I asked if I would be compensated in which the CEO replied it was unpaid for 3 months. After 3 months I would be paid full time. If I showed good work ethic earlier on, I could be paid earlier. The expected work hours are 9-5pm, M-F. Also, I don’t get any college credit or anything from this, just ~experience~.

I was thrown into working without any training and basically made websites by myself while the CTO was only there if I needed help. The development team is made up of the CTO, me and another intern, who I assume is also unpaid. I ended up emailing the CEO today and asked to be compensated because I work hard and past work hours on projects sometimes. Also since there’s a pandemic, money is an issue right now. He ended up replying saying that I started on 5/18/2020, so on 8/18/2020 they would make a decision about my pay. Which means I still have to continue to wait and not even be sure I’ll get paid at that mark. 

It’s important to note they hired about 3 or 4 more “interns” after me. Which means there are about 5-6 interns in total while the company itself only has about 10 or so employees total. Half of the company is pretty much free labor employees. 

I also never signed any contract when I was hired. The only thing I signed was an NDA but that was unrelated.

My question is, is this internship illegal? Could I possibly hire an attorney to sue and get money?"
hzv6df,1,2020-07-29,In Need of Some Serious Career/Life Advice,legit_ringo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hzv6df/in_need_of_some_serious_careerlife_advice/,"Hey everyone! So, I’m just gonna jump right into this. I’m a 20 year old rising college senior, soon to be 21. I started off as a Physics major, quickly changed to a Computer Science major, and now have seemingly settled in as a Math major with Comp Sci minor. I still live with my parents, as I commute to my college which is only 20 minutes away (or at least I used to before corona). I’m unemployed and most of my income comes from occasionally selling stuff online or doing the odd DoorDash type job every once in a while.

As is the case with many people in college nowadays, I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m spending all of this time getting a degree in something I may or may not actually enjoy. It feels like I’m just floating down this river that was laid out for me by others and I’m slowly approaching a waterfall that I’ve only just now realized is there.

Again, as is the case for many of us, I was simply expected to go to college and it seemed like the easiest option, so I went with it because, why not? Sure I questioned it, and honestly even thought that it wouldn’t get me anywhere, but I thought that since it has gotten so many people somewhere, then I was probably wrong.

But now, I’m reaching a breaking point. And more than that, I feel extremely guilty, lazy, and selfish for taking so much time thinking about this and not taking action. My girlfriend is in a much more difficult situation right now. She’s stuck at home with her mentally abusive parents who are gonna kick her out if she’s not moved out by November. And while that may seem totally understandable to some of you considering she’s 20 years old, her 24 year old brother still lives at home as well and her parents don’t seem to care when he moves out. They’re awful people and I want to do as much as I can to get her out of that situation. She’s able to spend the night at my house sometimes, buts that’s not a viable long-term solution. She has a part-time job (not in college and never went to college) and is struggling to save up money, especially since her parents don’t provide food or really any basic necessities for her either.

I feel like I’m being selfish and lazy mainly because I haven’t had an internship, I don’t know what I want to do with this degree, and I can’t even bring myself to get a part time job. I worked at an ice cream shop for about 6 years, from 8th grade to my freshman year of college, and it completely consumed my life. No matter how hard I try, I can’t bring myself to get another retail job, or really any job where I can’t be my own boss. I can’t stand having to interact with people all day and rely on coworkers in order to get everything done. I don’t know where to go from here.

We need to get an apartment by November or else she’s probably going to have to move to Colorado to live with her grandparents. The apartment we have been looking at for quite some time costs $1,400-$1,600 per month, which is below average where I live. We’ll probably split the cost evenly, unless one of us makes a lot more money than the other, which means about $750 per month. Let’s round that up to $900 per month for groceries, subscriptions, savings, etc. That means I need to start making at least $225 per week very soon, as does she. And we really only have 2 months because I think we need to put a deposit down for the apartment a month before moving in.

Now that we have all the main information out of the way, what I’ve really come here to ask for is some advice on what my options are here. I really cannot see myself being happy having a retail job again, or really any job where I’m not my own boss. Are there any realistic options by which I can be my own boss, or at least do things on my own and on my own schedule, and still make the amount of money I listed above pretty much right away? Or is my only option here really just to get a retail job or paid internship? Or, is there another option that I'm missing?

I know this is an easy decision for most people: just get a retail job. But I think that if I do that, it is going to completely consume my life like it did in the past and I’m not going to be able to really enjoy anything. That’s not worth it to me. I know that I probably sound like a lazy, spoiled brat here, but i just don’t know what to do. I should be grateful that I even have the opportunities that I have, but I don’t want to end up living a miserable life.

Anyways, I’ll stop rambling on now. If anyone has any advice whatsoever, I would greatly appreciate it.

TL/DR: I’m a college student and I need to move out with my girlfriend by November. Apartment cost is $1400-$1600 per month. I’ve worked at retail for years, and it consumes my life, so I don’t know if I can do that again. Does anyone know of a job that allows me to be my own boss, or at least have control over my own schedule and not have to work with/around other people, that I would be able to start making at least \~$225 per week right away? Or is my only option to suck it up and get a retail job or internship? Or is there another option I'm not thinking of?"

Im sure it varies company to company but what is your general feel for how it works? How does your company do it?

I ask because if i was trying to game it and i knew I had to get past HR I would focus on making sure my programming languages and technical skills were highlighted above everything else however if the developers and engineers get a large say then personal projects would play a bigger role.

I'm probably not even 75th percentile even in terms of grades. I do have one really good EC in Business but it probably won't help me when I app for CS. My ECs relating to CS are probably not that good (Robotics team member with iffy participation, and not even a programmer, eDX course in AI, Informal Internship), so my only hope is to sway them with my essays. Is this even possible? Stanford has been my dream school ever since I was young and I hate that I didn't take my first 2 years of high school seriously enough."

Hope you guys are well.

I'm looking for an unbias opinion hopefully you guys can help.   


My situation   
I'm currently a Finance major at a top 5 business school in Canada.   
I also currently work as a Commercial real estate broker at a top firm.  My business is doing fairly well and I'm making a handsome income.   
I'm also a Private equity investor where I buy properties and a portion of established companies. 

  
I'm also a mature student, 21 (was a pre-med for the first 2yrs of my uni life and switched). 

I don't want to switch majors because I worked way too hard to get into this program. 

**Undergrad major options I have:**

*A) Double Major in CS + BBA (specialization in Management Info. Systems + Finance)* 

**note**: Management info systems (MIS) is  where we use python heavily to build databases and analytical tools for business purposes.   
***CONS***: I'll graduate by 27 

*B) BBA major + CS minor + Stats minor (5 courses per minor)*  

***Pros***: I'll finish my degree by age 26

**Why do I want to pursue CS:**   
I plan on landing a Data analytics internship at a firm like Palantir Tech where I can build and use data to make informed business decisions.   
   OR become a tech consultant at a firm like Palantir.   


I want to be able to manipulate data intimately so that I can invest my money better and someday build a fintech firm.

I plan on going to 12 Hackathons, and routinely code. 

After graduation:  
Investment banking at a top 5 firm - 2yrs

Consultant @ Mckinsey - 2yrs

Deployment strategist or Data engineer @ Palantir Tech. - 3yrs 

Private Equity guy - 5 yrs.

Update 1: Called HR and the phone was off - expected because he said he’d be busy all day the rest of the week. Emailed saying basically what I mentioned Ed above and waiting for a reply. Funnily enough also had a phone screen for my #1 job right after posting this, and have an interview soon 🤷‍♀️

Original Post:

Background on me: May 2020 ME grad, 3.9 GPA, Spring 2020 internship to full-time in June. A lot of experience, projects, and leadership. Current pay at Company A is 70k, and I’m looking for a new job because this current one has plans to relocate to NY in October. 

I received an offer letter from a great company (Company B) in the nuclear sector that I’m willing to relocate for, but the pay is less than what I expected - 67k. I’d much rather it be at least 70k. I received another job offer from Company C yesterday for 73k in my current city, but I am not interested in the position at all. 

I want Company B and I want to negotiate to get at least a 70k salary. I’ve never negotiated a salary before so I’m looking for really any advice. The HR rep I’ve been emailing/calling has told me he is very busy over the next three days with training and may be difficult to reach via phone. I’m planning to do one of the following:

A. Call him first. If he answers, tell him I’m very glad to have received the offer, then say “The compensation is lower than I expected to be offered. I was expecting a salary within the range of 73k-75k, as my current pay is in the low 70ks and my counter offers reflect similar. Is this reasonable for you?” If he does not answer, send him an email asking for a convenient time to talk. 

B. Email him first and ask for a call time, then say what I have above. 

C. Email him saying what I said above, and tell him I’m more than willing to discuss on the phone. 

I think it’s better to have a salary negotiation over the phone, but I’m not sure if I should email/call first. Please give me advice, thank you!"

I am fifteen and I live in pakistan. My home life has always been rocky, mostly due to my father who is emotionally abusive towards me and my mother, but now in quarantine he's refusing to go to work as well. To top that off, he also started construction in our house into which he is spending all our savings. recently, around two weeks ago, he started another project inside our house that has the house in complete chaos. My mom is a nice person for the most part, but she is extremely prone to getting upset/ overreacting over everything. Anyway, for the past few months she's been even more angry than she usually is, and considering she blows up at me or my sister at least once a day (and by blowing up I mean she full on starts screaming, never failing to remind me exactly how utterly USELESS I am and how I'm terrible at everything, just all of that) It's not fun having that multiple times a day. She is also sort of self centered, but I can understand that given that she is also a person who is sick of my father basically driving us bankrupt because he can't fucking spend like an adult. 
I've been having suicidal thoughts for three years now; and it was getting better around last year, but this year has been particularly terrible, even before quarantine started. In fact I actually like quarantine because it's put a hold on all of the exams I'm supposed to take and get As on. The only downside is having my father constantly around thd house as he is very prone to suddenly going off, esp at me and my mother. He has/will never say ANYTHING to my younger sister who is basically an angel in his eyes despite doing way less than I do and virtually spending every minute of her life on her phone watching kpop videos. In fact, both of my parents are completely obsessed with her new hobby - dancing - and while I'm glad they're being supportive I feel sort of left out when no one cares about anything I do. For some insight I do illustrations, mainly character art and while I personally hate what I draw, my view was changed recently since I almost got an internship at an animation studio (which is my end goal) that actually works with people from fucking ghibli. You can search up the glassworker, the movie the studio is currently working on if you're ineterested - ANYWAY so the only reason I didn't get in is because I'm still studying aaannd they need fulltime workers. Told me to absolutely come back after highschool, and honestly it was pretty cool anyway since they don't call most people for interviews - technicallty, out of hundreds of applications they get, they considered me. Even among adults and not just delusional children. It made me feel like maybe I was actualy good at this. It made me feel like I was worth something, even a little bit. But after a while everyone just forgot about it again. I know this probably sounds like I'm an attention seeking brat and maybe I am. But the thing is; they'll give my sister so much attention and they both LOVE her kpop dancing, which is, no offense to her, frankly not even that great. I once tried showing a drawing of mine to my father and HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT before telling me I could do better. He clearly prefers her over me, and always has. when I was younger he used to be extremely shitty and pushed around and even hit my mother FOR NO REASON. he just wants to fucking control everybody, and oh, around that time he also used to threaten to kill me, constantly remind me that I was worthless, selfish and basically a brat. I remember once when I was around ten we were at a carnival of some sort and I was alone with him when he asked me to take a picture of him. Anyway, apparently I didn't take a picture that he considered good so he blew up right then and there. Tried to take another one but that wasn't good either. I remember being terrified and scared, and also embarassed because it was a public place and he was screaming at me VERY loudly. I was more embarassed because I was crying, though. Anyway this went on until finally he just grabbed me and told me he was going to fucking push me over the railing (the carnival thingy was in this hotel directly above the sea or whatever and we were walking alongside the edge) and he continues asking me about how If I was so useless should he push me over and kill me? Oh, he was getting more upset because I, a ten year old, was crying due to him screaming at me about how utterly useless I was in the middle of a carnival. Anyway, he obviously didn't actually kill me but sometimes I wish he HAD. After this he suddenly decided to be all better and made me ride a boat with him all alone as if what had happened previously hadn't been traumatizing enough. I never told my mother about this because I didn't want her to fight with my dad over it, but around a year ago when I did she said it wasn't a big deal. Well, it was a fucking big deal to me.
Anyway right now they're fighting again (as usual, when are they not.) and it's mostly my dad's fault. Anyway I've gotten used to it to a point where it doesn't bother me too much, buf I am so fucking sick of it never getting better. Where I live nobody can actually intervene and we can't call for help. We live in my mom's parents house, with my dad, and he won't leave. The last time my mom tried to kick him out of the house/brought up divorve he locked her in a room with a knife, and from what she told me, tried to kill himself.
murdering him actually isn't an option as I am physically much weaker than him, and trust me I really want to fucking kill him. I'm basically just splurting stuff out here so I haven't listed everything he's done, but he's terrifying, emotionally abusive AND physically abusive to my mother. My only option is to kill myself which I've pretty much been decided on for months. I'm kind of dumb and couldn't figure out how, though, but now it's different. I've also been self harming since I was younger and although I told my mom a few years ago her reaction made me feel ashamed for making her worry. I'd stopped doing that for at least a year but now I'm relapsing. 
She also thinks I'm too sensitive and just being dramatic if I mention wanting to die/suicidal thoughts. She doesn't take me seriously because I'm a teenager and apparently am ""too sensitive"" 
my dad also says this and he's told me so many fucking times that I'll never be able to do anything with my life because I'm too sensitive. He's probably right. I also have no motivation so study and give my o levels (on which I have to get straight As) and no plans/ hopes for the future. I don't want to graduate, get married, and take care of kids. I also don't want to have some boring job I know I'll never like. 
I'm worried that if I kill myself my dad will become even more unstable and take it out on my mom and sister. 
My only option is to kill him and then myself, or kill myself. I literally have fucking nothing to live for. No friends who actually value me, no one who thinks I'm worth it. No hopes or plans for the future. 
Anyway, sorry for making this so fucking long. I'm sure no one will read this, and you probably won't care. I really needed to get it off my chest though. Also I apologize for my messy english, it's not my first language. If you read all of this, thanks.
EDIT: also, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post. This is my first time here."

Hey everyone,

I've been seeing a lot of negative posts on here recently, and it kinda sucks since a lot of how I moved up has been partially due to the resources and inspiring stories I've seen on here. Like most of you, I have also been laid off early on as a direct result of covid-19 hiring freeze/workforce cut, but then I ended up with a very good role at a Big N company. With that said, I want to give back to this community and hopefully inspire/help some of you who are struggling to find jobs in this rough time by sharing a story of how I ""made"" it.

**Background:**

A brief background of myself is that I am a 23 year old asian male who graduated from a public university (it is quite reputable though) with a \~2.3 GPA in CS. I also graduated a semester late due to failing one of my final upper-level class on my final year, which definitely hurt my job-hunting prospect a bit since it was difficult to explain this to my potential employers. Given my stats, it seemed like I had little to no chance of landing a role, let alone a role at a Big N company, and yet, here I am. With that said, here is my story and how I did it.

**First Job-Hunt:**

Unsurprisingly, job-hunting as a senior was quite difficult due to my low GPA compared to my peers. I also lacked the knowledge/skill-set/experience that a lot of companies were expecting new-grads to gain since I only had one relevant internship at a non-tech company. The first job I took was a contractor position where I was paid $25/hr, which was fairly comfortable given my cost of living. It was the only offer I received out of the countless applications I sent out during my senior year, and even that job was very hard for me to obtain. After doing well on the on-site interview, I was asked for my transcript and to complete a take-home coding assignment, I was almost ghosted due to my GPA, and I had to keep emailing the director in regards to the position. After many weeks of exchanging emails, he finally agreed to hire me as a temporary worker after seeing my take-home coding assignment (yes, those are actually worth doing if you really need the job).

**Second Job-Hunt:**

As my contract was nearing the end, I went back on the job-hunt again. I had a conversation with my manager and he thought I did well enough to convert to full-time. However, when covid started happening, I knew I was at risk of being let go, and sure enough, it happened the day before my interview with my current company (not within my manager's control). Despite the bad timing, I didn't let it get to my head and performed well on the interview. This was also my only offer out of the hundreds of applications I sent out, and it's better than anything I thought I'd ever get, given my background. I didn't even bother negotiating as I was very happy with the 300% salary increase and it was already a very generous offer compared to the others at my level at the same company.

**Steps I took:**

First and foremost, I reviewed my data structures and algorithm. I went through a study guide that has since then been taken down (unfortunately), but the second best guide would be the Crack the Coding Interview. I read this mostly for the lessons it provided on each topics.

Edit:  [https://workflowy.com/s/study-guide/RD5kZ682pWX5oxiE](https://workflowy.com/s/study-guide/RD5kZ682pWX5oxiE) is the link to the study guide, shoutout to u/throwinaway101010 for finding it!

Once I was brushed up on my DS+A, I started networking. I reached out to a lot of my friends, family friends, family friend coworkers, strangers on discord (shout out to CS Career Hackers) and recruiters. I asked them questions like what they look for in candidates, what do I need to improve on and if they can refer me. I used those feedback to improve myself to the point where I'm at right now. In fact, my current role came from a referral from a stranger on discord, so definitely try to leverage as much networking as you can, even if there's a slim chance of it working out!

Another important thing was to keep improving my resume. I listed my skills, work experience/accomplishments, education (no GPA lol), 2 side projects (one was a hackathon app and another was a game I created with my friends). I also asked many friends and strangers to review my resume and built up on the feedback they provided, and it eventually paid off as I got to the stage where more recruiters were giving me callbacks.

Finally, I did a lot of mock interviews. I tried to schedule about 2-3 mock interviews a week, and slowly ramped up as my final interview was coming up. This only took about 1-2 hours a day, which wasn't much for me since it just meant 2-3 less games of league. Again, I mocked with as many of my relevant connections as I knew, as well as the people on discord. I built up on the feedback I received to improve my interviewing skills. I became better at communicating my thought process, handling edge cases, coming up with near-optimal solutions to problems I haven't seen before and asking clarifying questions. I am very grateful for their time as I felt this was my biggest contributing factor to how I did well for the interview. By the time I reached my on-site interview, it just felt like another mock interview at that point. I also reviewed the company values and came up with 5-6 stories prepared that demonstrated those values in a clear, concise manner. I highly recommend people do more mock interviews instead of just solo leetcode, as it'll give you exposure to how other people answer questions and what you're lacking in.

**Conclusion:**

Please don't be discouraged when applying for jobs. I know how it felt, I was literally in that spot a couple months ago, but I never gave up. I kept improving myself and I achieved what I didn't think was possible for me in the past. There are companies that are still hiring new talents, you just have to keep looking.

Also, don't get obsessed over the Big N hype either (don't think that any job that isn't Big N is worthless). I wasn't primarily targeting Big N, but when I saw someone recruiting for it on discord, I just went for it. I was very much comfortable at my old job and content with the amount I was making, but the circumstance forced me to job hop, unfortunately.

Keep moving forward, and don't get too let down by rejections, I've faced many rejections from companies I got call-backs from and I just brush if off and keep applying/trying.

Also, keep in mind that this is a marathon, not a sprint. As long as you consistently improve, you will eventually be where you want to be in due time, whether it's a position at a new company or a promotion at your current one.

In conclusion, if I, an Asian male with a 2.3 GPA at a public university, can land a job at a Big N company through perseverance , then I'm sure all of you can find something you'll be happy with by not giving up.

Thank you for reading,

Roy

**Note:**

The main reason behind my low GPA is mostly due to my inability to do well on exams, but I firmly believe that exam-taking holds no weight on how good of an employee the student will be. I did well on projects and assignments that were more relevant to real world work experience. However, that's a discussion for another time, lol."

I am interested in applying for the masters of statistics programs, but I am worried that I don't have enough stats/math to be accepted into the program. I was wondering if anyone knows if it is possible to be accepted and succeed in stats grad programs if you are not from a stats/math major. I am hoping to do a course based one with an internship, rather than a thesis based one.

Some of the related courses I have taken/will be taking in my undergrad include:

*MATH COURSES :* First year linear algebra, first and second year calculus, ordinary differential equations

*STATS COURSES:* Intro to statistics, probability I, statistics and probability II, applied methods in statistics I, R for data science

*COMP SCI COURSES:* Intro to computing science I and II

I am also completing a biology research thesis and I am an introductory stats tutor.

I was also wondering if my application would be less successful if most of my references are from bio profs rather than math/stats profs.

It would be great to hear if anyone has heard of anyone being accepted into stats grad programs without majoring in math/stats. I would also be interested to hear any courses that people would recommend I take to improve my chance of getting accepted, or courses that would help to prepare me.

**Extracurriculars:**

* I am an intern at Visual Technologies LLC. I have helped in 4 projects regarding computer science for outside companies. This is one of my biggest achievements as a real company was willing to work with me and we ended up doing 4 projects together helping me grow every second of me working with them. After two successful projects with them, I was given some responsibilities such as following up with clients and other things. This gave me a sense of accomplishment because this would mean that they saw qualities in me that they would look for in a “normal aged” programmer/consultant.
* 2020 - I have worked for Cutco for about 3 months in which I have learned many skills for marketing. I have been promoted and over $3000 in sales. Other details mentioned earlier.
* 2019-2020- For UIL math we program our calculators to make tests easier for us. Last year I was one of the top coders for UIL math right after my seniors. I made programs that were complex. Although I didn't create many programs, I made programs that other programs were not able to create the year before because they were termed as “too hard”. Me being able to code those programs gave me the stance as a well-known programmer for UIL Math - an achievement in itself.
* 2016 - 2021 has offered free tutoring to many students who strive to be better but cannot afford fees. I have given at least 80 hours of free tutoring (not for school)
* 2020 - I have also worked for Ambit and have managed a successful team of over 50 members as I am a regional consultant for the company. I am in the top 10% of the company according to my boss, but I don't know whether this is true or not. I can certainly say that more than half of the people working do not make it to the level I am at. This company is an electricity company, and I have capitalized on selling our service to apartment complexes. I have also helped many high schoolers needing a job to find success in this business.
* 2020- I volunteered to make a system for the school called “Corona Tutors”. This is a platform where students can anonymously ask questions and receive answers from other students who want service hours. This fixes many problems: this eases the extreme dependence of teachers being online 24/7, this makes sure that students are getting their questions answered, this also allows students who want to help society. This is an official Prosper resource on their webpage which students can use at their will.
* 2017-2020- I have been a volunteer at ICNA Relief committed about 2 hours each week, and puts me right over 300 hours of community service. We as a group have made a rationing system where we try to fairly distribute goods and other goods as per people's needs. We help with anything from getting food to getting families a laptop for their kid's education.
* My love for business goes very far. In 7th grade, fidget spinners were very popular and amazon took 3 months to ship them. This was perfect for a mini business, so I bought a fidget spinner directly through the supplier (AliExpress) and got my shipment. Not only did I retail them I also wholesale them in the mall to any store that was allowed to sell them. I came profitable from this business, but it was not the money that made this great, it was the contact I got through this business. - 2016
* 2020 - I resold brand new bikes with a high markup. One day scrolling through Facebook marketplace I realized that some bikes were being sold for almost 2x their price at Walmart. (During COVID) I simply contacted my contacts and was able to get about 200-250 brand new bikes. Since this was a very big investment I had five partners with me, and we marked them up according to market price a month later (150% return on investment)
* 2020 - When school ended, I started to get a lot of Forex trading ads, so I chose to take a look into what it was. Forex trading is a currency exchange and is highly risky. When I started to learn about it I started to see that there were groups called “signal groups”. These groups told you when to trade what and claimed that they have a 99% accuracy on their trades being profitable. Instead of trading, I chose to get in contact with famous traders and offer them a lucrative cut for simply sending a message in a group chat about what they are trading. For one month I tested the service and then put it into action for the public. The program kept working until all traders were able to work and then it was shut off making sure that more one was a loss.
* 2020 I have written a book/report that I have published it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DNFT66V/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Yugam+Goyal&amp;qid=1595886630&amp;sr=8-1). This report took me 200+ hours to make. As we learn in school, there is a rise in global warming, and it is our job to find alternative ways of fuel and stop the rise in global warming. I took an already done research - well in parts in college language- and made it into a more understandable report considering almost every aspect of the situation. I covered everything from the experimental design to how we can use the waste product in everyday life to how we can scale this project to how even a high schooler can make a difference by simply taking initiative and presenting this idea to their school. This report allowed me to take complex language and make it into an everyday language report. I showed my report to many people in the community and it was very satisfying to hear from their parents when they said “my son is going to present this idea to his school because they mostly have a lot of oil”. The report is about converting waste cooking oil to biodiesel.
* 2015 - 2020 - I have helped my mom in her business called “BLANK (don't want to say) Designs Collection”. Simply by watching her sell and trying it myself I acquired skills that I use to this day not only for business but simply for communicating. Currently, I am a social media and online sales handler for the company.
* 2018 - 2020 - I have been a part of Mu Alpha Theta for two year tutoring students for Math. Last year I was one of the top tutors for Mrs.Wood for algebra 2. I went there every time I did have an eagle time activity.
* 2020 - I recently joined the Science Honor society; we have helped the science fair in their activities.

i07hmz,2,2020-07-29,"Unemployed 20 Year Old College Student and I Can Only See Myself Being My Own Boss, and I Need a Steady Inflow of Money ASAP",legit_ringo,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/i07hmz/unemployed_20_year_old_college_student_and_i_can/,"Hey everyone! So, I’m just gonna jump right into this. I’m a 20 year old rising college senior, soon to be 21. I started off as a Physics major, quickly changed to a Computer Science major, and now have seemingly settled in as a Math major with Comp Sci minor. I still live with my parents, as I commute to my college which is only 20 minutes away (or at least I used to before corona). I’m unemployed and most of my income comes from occassionally selling stuff online or doing the odd DoorDash type job every once in a while.

As is the case with many people in college nowadays, I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m spending all of this time getting a degree in something I may or may not actually enjoy. It feels like I’m just floating down this river that was laid out for me by others and I’m slowly approaching a waterfall that I’ve only just now realized is there.

Again, as is the case for many of us, I was simply expected to go to college and it seemed like the easiest option, so I went with it because, why not? Sure I questioned it, and honestly even thought that it wouldn’t get me anywhere, but I thought that since it has gotten so many people somewhere, then I was probably wrong.

But now, I’m reaching a breaking point. And more than that, I feel extremely guilty, lazy, and selfish for taking so much time thinking about this and not taking action. My girlfriend is in a much more difficult situation right now. She’s stuck at home with her mentally abusive parents who are gonna kick her out if she’s not moved out by November. And while that may seem totally understandable to some of you considering she’s 20 years old, her 24 year old brother still lives at home as well and her parents don’t seem to care when he moves out. They’re awful people and I want to do as much as I can to get her out of that situation. She’s able to spend the night at my house sometimes, buts that’s not a viable long-term solution. She has a part-time job (not in college and never went to college) and is struggling to save up money, especially since her parents don’t provide food or really any basic necessities for her either.

I feel like I’m being selfish and lazy mainly because I haven’t had an internship, I don’t know what I want to do with this degree, and I can’t even bring myself to get a part time job. I worked at an ice cream shop for about 6 years, from 8th grade to my freshman year of college, and it completely consumed my life. No matter how hard I try, I can’t bring myself to get another retail job, or really any job where I can’t be my own boss. I can’t stand having to interact with people all day and rely on coworkers in order to get everything done. I don’t know where to go from here.

We need to get an apartment by November or else she’s probably going to have to move to Colorado to live with her grandparents. The apartment we have been looking at for quite some time costs $1,400-$1,600 per month, which is below average where I live. We’ll probably split the cost evenly, unless one of us makes a lot more money than the other, which means about $750 per month. Let’s round that up to $900 per month for groceries, subscriptions, savings, etc. That means I need to start making at least $225 per week very soon, as does she. And we really only have 2 months because I think we need to put a deposit down for the apartment a month before moving in.

Now that we have all the main information out of the way, what I’ve really come here to ask for is some advice on what my options are here. I really cannot see myself being happy having a retail job again, or really any job where I’m not my own boss. Are there any realistic options by which I can be my own boss, or at least do things on my own and on my own schedule, and still make the amount of money I listed above pretty much right away? Or is my only option here really just to get a retail job or paid internship?

I know this is an easy decision for most people: just get a retail job. But I think that if I do that, it is going to completely consume my life like it did in the past and I’m not going to be able to really enjoy anything. That’s not worth it to me. I know that I probably sound like a lazy, spoiled brat here, but i just don’t know what to do. I should be grateful that I even have the opportunities that I have, but I don’t want to end up living a miserable life.

Anyways, I’ll stop rambling on now. If anyone has any advice whatsoever, I would greatly appreciate it.

TL/DR: I’m a college student and I need to move out with my girlfriend by November. Apartment cost is $1400-$1600 per month. I’ve worked at retail for years, and it consumes my life, so I don’t know if I can do that again. Does anyone know of a job that allows me to be my own boss, or at least have control over my own schedule and not have to work with/around other people, that I would be able to start making at least ~$225 per week right away? Or is my only option to suck it up and get a retail job?"

I am debating what would be the best use of my time:

1. Apply to as many internships as possible

2. Try to write a more complex project and apply to full time positions

3. Take spring quarter off in order to delay my graduation until December 2021 in order to be considered for more internships. Financially it would cost me the same as graduating in Spring 2021, and if it's what I need to do in order to have a job by the end of graduation it seems logical.

I was wondering what I should do."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
What was your career path like from college to present? What was your main discipline? How does one begin to make a career in F1?|A long and boring answer (I apologise in advance): 
 |I studied Maths and Engineering, Economics &amp; Management at the University of Oxford and was lucky that I could persuade my professors to let me do a final year project with a F1 team. Getting a project was slightly harder and I was a bit sneaky by sending letters marked ""Confidential"" and ""Private"" to the team principals - long story short, Williams offered me the chance to write their strategy software from scratch which is what I had pitched.
 |I worked at Williams for 6 months and loved it, had a really great boss who knew racing inside out and that I learnt a lot from. I was offered a job, but I wanted to go back to university to finish my degree and when I had there wasn't the job that I wanted (strategy).
 |I ended up working for a small engineering and management consultancy which taught me so much about being self-sufficient and problem-solving before moving into finance of various kinds and beginning to qualify as an actuary - I learnt a lot about modelling and quantitative analysis. I moved to Australia and had literally just gotten my citizenship when I received a call from Williams asking me if I wanted the strategy job.
 |It was an offer I couldn't refuse, so I left Australia pretty quickly, went back to sign my contract and the person who had offered me the job had left Williams by the time I arrived in the UK. Long story short they still hired me eventually and I went on to be a Trackside Strategist a couple of weeks later with no experience whatsoever - thrown in at the deep end. I ended up running the Strategy team at Williams before moving to Force India (at the time) a couple of years after joining Williams to try and take on a larger role.
 |Unfortunately, Force India were going through some tough times and I (somewhat naively at the time due to how bad things seemed like they would get) decided to try and move and ended up at McLaren as Fernando's strategist - in hindsight, this was a great move for me personally.
 |From there I was promoted to be Head of Strategy and then to Head of Strategy and Sporting.
 | 
​ |In terms of how to start a career in F1 - I won't lie - it's difficult. Perseverance is key, many of us thought at the time we were applying/being turned down that we would never make it in - but you have to keep trying. Internships and placements are a great way to start to get your foot in the door (but are themselves not easy to obtain), as are the various things you can do to gain useful experience or skills (which I have listed in other answers here).
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
What are some of the most expensive parts of the F1 car? When an F1 car crashes, what parts are bound to be irreversibly damaged? Thanks for this AMA|In honesty the ""meatier"" bits tend to be the ones you don't really want to damage, for example, the powerunit or the gearbox. Front wings are often damaged and can also be very expensive to replace but are often fixed/salvaged.
^(the below question has been split into five, enumerated)|
I'm a ""software engineer"" (supposedly... don't really deserve such a title imo) so I'm curious about the software you guys use for strategy. Tyre strategy for example - I assume you have models where you plug in the pace of a given compound at a given track temperature and fuel load etc, plus how that pace degrades over time etc. And then presumably you run that model umpteen times for all the combinations of 1 stop / 2 stop / starting with prime / starting with option / hot day / mild day etc to decide the likely best strategy. So my questions are: 1. anything I've said so far that's totally wrong?|Sneaking 5 questions in - efficient. Nothing you've put is totally wrong at all. There are many approaches to modelling and optimising strategy and the one you suggest isn't at all crazy. The number of permutations ends up being quite high, very quickly though...
2. is this bespoke software written by internal coders for each team or do you use some off-the-shelf / open-source platform (matlab, R etc) or both?|We use bespoke software written in-house, although we may use platforms like MATLAB to write some of the code.
3. what kind of stack/languages are you using?|It varies depending on use case, I personally will range from C++ to Javascript/Node to C# and maybe some Python.
4. what other things besides tyre strategy do you have this kind of software for? is it one big sophisticated piece of software that can model every ""what if"" (tyres, weather, safety cars etc) in one go, or lots of smaller bits of software for different aspects?|Because things interact and interplay so heavily in the strategy space you'll tend to want to model everything together in one tool.
5. to what extent is this software used real-time during races? like are you constantly updating these type of models with actual lap-time / tyre temps etc during a race, to get continually more accurate predictions of how your or your competitors stints will go? or maybe the process of turning raw data into useful decisions is too slow for that to be realistic under the hectic conditions, so instead you're more about absorbing the learnings in between races to improve your 'instincts'?|The software can and is used real-time during races. I plan to answer some of the other questions relating to this as well, so may provide some more detail in one of those if you're interested, but there is still a large element of human expertise as well as the modelling and although I can't talk too much about the balance between the two areas as it would give too much away - both are important.
Hey Randy So I’m currently studying Aerospace Engineering and my aspiration is be a f1 trackside Engineer. I was wondering if there was anything I could do to make myself stand out or supplement my application when applying for grad jobs next year? Also would it be harder for me as a female? Are there many females in the Engineer teams?|Excellent - I'd like to answer the point about gender first! There are fewer females on the engineering side of F1 than men and unfortunately I think this reflects the recent situation with the number of females in STEM and particularly engineering subjects at university.
 |This is changing and there are some very talented female engineers in F1 and at McLaren and especially in the younger cohorts, which to me suggests that things are moving in the right direction. I can't say how hard it may be because you're a female - all I can say is that your gender should not affect the opportunities available - it may be harder in the sense that there may not be as many female teammates as male teammates for you.
 |In terms of what kind of things you can do to improve your chances of getting into F1 - here are a few ideas, I have to say none of these are necessary, they are examples of the kinds of things that may help - but we will take people with/without these (many of these things I have not done myself):
 |1. Internships and placements do exist in F1 and lower formulae and can be very useful to get your foot through the door.
 |2. Professional motorsport experience, albeit difficult to come by, can be really useful.
 |3. Involvement with Formula Student, there are many areas to get involved in these teams.
 |4. Taking something that you enjoy to a good/high level, it doesn't matter what it is, whether its playing sport, baking, research, etc.
 |5. Working in and/or leading a team.
 |6. An understanding of F1 and motorsport in general.
 |7. Demonstration your smartness and ingenuity, proactive nature and any other factors you think would hold you in good stead for a job in F1.
What is your view on Ferrari's strategies over the past few years? What are they doing wrong?|I've wanted to answer this question since you posted it (and others asked similar) but have wanted to make sure I communicated exactly what I thought, apologies for the delay.
 |We track our performance in strategy and have some methods for tracking other teams as well. We actually spend a considerable time doing this as its a valuable learning opportunity. Strategy is a strange beast, as you can't really outperform your natural car position without fortune or the mistakes of others - neither of which you can control (much...) - so in essence you are always trying not to ""underperform"" rather than every ""overperforming"".
 |You also, I strongly believe, cannot judge a strategy on the outcome - I don't think our strategy for the podium in Brazil 2019 was anything special compared to our strategy in races where we may have finished well outside of the points with both cars in recent years.
 |However, both of these factors make it easier to get a poor opinion of teams, especially top teams, from the ""outside"" - because they can't finish much higher than their ""natural"" position, but they can finish much lower and because mistakes should be more prevalent than successes, because successes are just achieving what is ""natural"" (which is really hard to do).
 |It's even bad inside the sport, when I moved teams one of the first things we did was run through races that the new team thought I had gotten wrong at my previous team and those I thought they had gotten wrong when I was at my previous team - needless to say in many cases we were simply missing information (although in some cases there were mistakes of course).
 |However, that's not to say that teams aren't better/worse than others nor do I think strategy is harder at the front of the field, I think if anything its harder in the midfield (perhaps I am biased, as you have to look around you, ahead and behind), but there is more scrutiny at the front.
 |We spend much time working out how well a team has done (or not done) based on the information available and estimating what may be unavailable etc. and we do have a ranking of teams for strategy skill/execution - but I won't reveal what the order is.
**Private/Confidential** 22/05/2020 *Dear Mr. Singh, I would like to apply for a 6-month internship, working as your personal assistant. I have 10 years experience in law &amp; accounting, and five years of film and TV production. I'm also a great cook and make the best pizzas and homemade pasta. I believe after 6 months training under your mentoring and tutelage, I can then apply to replace Mr. Cyril Bitesabull at Renault, and be successful on application thanks to the valuable experience under your wing. If the Renault application fails however, you and I will join forces, and stage a coup d'état at the McLaren Technology Group. When we have succeeded, we will then rehire Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard once again, and power our way to another 3 championships. I believe both drivers would fit in the car. I had considered our Nige, but alas, his FIA responsibilities would be a conflict of interest. I have full faith we would be successful and get Mika another 2 championships, while David holds the rest of the field up behind him. It is time for Mika's sabbatical to end. I await hearing from you in early course.* Signed: PapaKeth|Haha this is brilliant (and a good taste of my own medicine). We'll of course consider your application. I'm afraid you may have some competition on the pizza front - as one of our strategists has a talent in this area!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
The plan is coming to fruition 5-months ahead of schedule! (albeit Plan A. with Renault. Shame Fisichella declined) 1: Get an ex-team driver champion, e.g. Mika / Alonso in the car [✓] 2: Replace Cyril/Zak with Randy [_] 3: 2 more titles: [_] 4: Wanted Level: ★★★★☆ 5: Pizza.|I'm not sure about number 2!
Hi! What are your feelings on the super mega packed calendar? There has been a lot of talk recently, not just in F1, about the increasing demand on staff, drivers in regards to being away from home and families for a huge portion of the year. Super long hours and all the pressure that comes with that. Mental health as a topic is becoming increasingly more public and important in the Western worlds mind. The counter argument is that if you want to be the best you have to sacrifice, if you have a problem with the long hours, well there's someone else who will jump on that opportunity and work themselves to the bone. Obviously more races means more cash, more viewers etc, but I would be one of those people that would be happy if F1 perhaps said '21 races this is too many, our people need some work life balance'.|In terms of the calendar - it will be tough, but we're also going through unprecedented times and we all need to play our small part in making sure that F1 comes through this situation fit and healthy - so we can all enjoy it in the future.
 |It's easier for me to say that, as I don't have kids, I'm not at the Grand Prix for as long as some of my teammates (like mechanics and support crew) and I have to acknowledge that when I share my personal opinion.
 |It is stressful, long hours and it can take its toll but F1 and the FIA are aware of that as they experience the same issues as well and I trust in them to find the right balance with the calendar and I have to say I do not envy them over this task as it is incredibly difficult.
 |I think we will end up with a calendar that may be packed but that will also be enjoyable and provide exciting racing - and I believe there will be sufficient room to recuperate as well, even though it may be tough at times.
 |The point about mental health is an important one and I'm glad that this is an issue that is easier to talk about and discuss openly and one that McLaren and F1 really do acknowledge. Mental wellbeing is not something that can be overlooked because its a job that many, many people want to do.
As head of sporting, what were your thoughts on reverse-grid qualifying races that were proposed last year?|It's complicated.
 |This is quite a big topic, but a few high-level considerations are mentioned below, as with all changes of this ilk there can be some unintended consequences.
 |From a ""racing"" point of view there are two schools of thought, the first that this would damage the ""pureness"" or ""sanctity"" of F1 and the second that this would lead to better racing as it would lead to more overtaking.
 |We conducted modelling that showed that with the right parameters more overtaking would be prevalent and that actually much of this overtaking would be between cars of relatively similar paces, rather than with really large pace differences (as those overtakes add less excitement, we believe, due to their ease).
 |Setting the parameters though was shown to be a complex business, which events would you pick (more below), how long would the reverse grid race have to be to get you into the range between a normal qualifying grid and a fully reversed grid (say if you set the race to be only 0 laps long), etc. etc.
 |Picking events is not easy, each circuit has different characteristics, so the pace difference required for overtaking at the Circuit de Monaco is vastly different to that at the Bahrain International Circuit and you need to balance the race length with the ""overtaking difficulty"" to allow for the desired level of mixing. There are even second order effects, you're likely to have cars battling with cars of similar pace as they make their way through slower cars, some circuits with multiple driving lines and track width available may be more suitable than others to encourage this (probably very exciting) fighting between cars.
 |And then unfortunately, there can often be other unintended snags that add some inertia to changing the rules, as we, as teams, will try and exploit every change to our advantage. If you did reverse grid races early in the year then there would be the potential for gaming the system, i.e. trying to get a lower position in the Drivers' World Championship such that one starts in a higher position for the reverse championship order race.
 |Personally, I think F1, the FIA and the teams made the right decision. There are many changes already agreed and planned that should make racing closer, we don't need to rush changes at the expense of this great sport we all love, so let's see where we get to and then judge whether we should make further incremental changes.
Hi Randy! Thanks for doing this. My question for you is how did you become an f1 engineer. What are your qualifications and how exactly did you manage to get this job? Were you or your colleagues ever a part of student racing teams (like formula student) and if so did it help you to get this job? Thanks in advance! - An engineering student aspiring to work in f1|I'll try not to repeat myself so a couple of comments already written about what can help you get in (https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/go6c9m/im_an_f1_engineerstrategist_ask_me_anything/frh3gl8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and what my route was (https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/go6c9m/im_an_f1_engineerstrategist_ask_me_anything/frh45hn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
 |I was never able to do Formula Student (to my disappointment) as there was no team at my university at the time and we were not allowed to set one up - many others have done it and many haven't. By no means is it necessary, but it does provide both useful skills and experience and gives you a good taste of motorsport.
Hi Randy! Thank you for doing an AMA! As a social scientist, I would like to know how much do you and the team take into account the psyche of the drivers with regards to your strategy. Do different drivers prefer different types of strategies? And how much do y’all take into account the drivers feedback! Thank you!|We have a very special filing cabinet for drivers' feedback - 🚮 .
 |Of course, I'm kidding.
 |Drivers' feedback is very useful, they are the ones in the car and they often have access to ""data"" that we don't. The engineering team for each driver will spend a lot of time reviewing and improving the communications with the driver, inside and outside the cockpit to ensure we get the most useful information from them.
 |I have to say though that when it comes to strategy, the driver's feedback is one of many sources of information and data we have - that's why you may hear Lando complain about the tyres and we leave him out anyway - obviously we weight his feedback with the due respect it deserves, but we also understand he will often be missing information as well.
 |I think drivers tend to prefer strategies that are quick - first and foremost 😀 and with the small sample of drivers I've worked with they then tend to prefer more stops over fewer stops (which kind of makes sense, as they get to go faster on the timed laps overall and it must be much more fun to drive at the limit than to eke a set of tyres out).
Super thanks for your availability on this AMA !! How does impact a team to be running in the front, on the middle and at the back of the grid. I am thinking in terms of strategy, but also for example less TV cameras to follow your both drivers. Please answer on any perspective you think is more interested.|This is a very interesting question and one we do often muse about!
 |I will be biased, having been in the ""midfield"" more than at the ""front"" - although I've had experience of all 3 situations you mention.
 |I believe that strategy is harder in the midfield, with the current level of field spread and fundamental strategic parameters - not only are you racing many more cars directly than you would at the front or the back, but you're also affected by the cars at the front and the back strategically much more frequently.
 |At the front, you're typically not affected by the cars in the midfield and at the back of the field during the more strategically difficult parts of the race, which I believe makes things easier strategically - and of course you're typically racing fewer cars directly. However, the pressure to perform or not mess up may be much higher than in the midfield as you fight for podium places.
 |At the back, often your hands can be tied and strategic choices can dwindle down to avoiding traffic and deviating as much as possible from cars ahead to try and get further up the classification.
 |As I said, I'm probably biased on this matter - and you may get different answers from other strategists.
Hi Randy, this is the best AMA I've ever seen. Thanks for doing it, and apologies if you've already answered this question, but there are 700 comments! There have recently been talks of getting rid of some of the Friday practice sessions, limiting everything to what is now FP3 on Saturday. The idea behind it would be to reduce the data you guys have on tyre wear, leading to more unpredictable strategies and better races. This seems to be supported by the fact that, whenever there's a lot of rain in those sessions, that indeed happens (or at least it seems so from the outside). However, I've watched too much F1 in my life to know that, whenever there's a seemingly impossible problem, you guys struggle at first (and the grid gets mixed up) but then develop ways around it and things get back to normal. So the question is: would that also happen if you got rid of those practice sessions, that is, after a year nobody would notice (except the spectators at the track, and you of course)? Or would it really have a lasting impact, in a way that e.g. the private testing ban didn't? If so, would you welcome it?|Thanks for the kind words.
 |So to cover off your points (I pretty much agree so apologies for the short answer):
 |I think there is a correlation between good racing and missed Friday sessions/lack of information, I'm not sure there is causality there but I can understand the logic if there were.
 |I think teams will find a way to adapt and so over time the impact of missing those sessions would reduce, however, it would still be as least as bad for teams (in terms of the information/their predictions) than it can be now with the same effort (albeit more effort may be put in after such a change).
 |For the reason of creating more exciting race (but unknown really to what extent over the long-term, I believe) I would welcome it, however, circuits and fans (at home also) appreciate Friday running (perhaps less so than weekend running) and losing out on that would be a big hit I think - so overall, I don't think this is an idea we should pursue (and it's one we have discussed at Sporting Working Groups in recent times).
^(the below question has been split into two, enumerated)|
First of all, thanks for doing this AMA and your effort in answering in such great detail! I'm a bit late to the party, but here are my questions anyway: 1. In the past, teams have used evidence containing competitors' GPS data in discussions with the stewards. So I assume there is an official data stream at each event delivering certain information about all cars on track you can use as an input for your strategy algorithm? What does that data contain other than position?|Thank you. GPS data is provided to all teams for all cars. We get it at 10Hz (10 data points a second) and as far as I remember (it's been a long time since I looked at the actual raw data) you get position and velocity, as well as the type of data it is (true GPS, dead-reckoned, etc.). We also can run our own sensors on the cars and powerunits and can collect data from those, so those may include things like wheel speeds, steering angle, etc.
2. Maybe a bit of an odd one, but I've always wondered: do F1 teams employ lip readers?|My lips are sealed. But no - I don't know that for sure of course, but I think I can say with some level of confidence that there are far more useful things to spend our limited resources on (talking about teams as a whole).
Hi Randy, we´ve heard a couple times last season that one of the drivers race was ""compromised"" in order to maximise the other drivers result? At what point in the race do the team come to the conclusion that what is best is to ""sacrifice"" one driver in order to obtain whats best for the team? Whats the thought process behind all of that? Just to be clear, I´m not implying you get to the race with the idea of benefiting one over the other, the question relates to in-race incidents that lead to that kind of decisions.|Hi - to be fair, sometimes we know before the race, sometimes even earlier in the weekend, that it could be an event where optimising the overall team outcome may not be the same as optimising the outcome for each of the drivers.
 |We're all (including the drivers) on the same page - our aim is to get the best outcome for the team - which makes it really simple for us - we discuss these situations very openly and so often you can see the relevant situations approaching in the race before they happen. As you note, sometimes there is an incident in the race that makes these kinds of strategies more viable all of a sudden and having them in the toolbox and knowing everyone understands what you're trying to do makes it easier to execute them.
 |I would also say that ""sacrifice"" is rare, more frequently you tend to hedge certain risks, or split the cars.
What do when car go boom?|As much as everyone would like to get upset, go into ""Hulk"" mode or throw something, typically there is still another car in the race - so those of us who work across the team will take into account what has happened and continue to try and maximise the result for the car that remains in the race.
 |Those of us who may work on the car that is no longer participating will make sure that the driver is safe, etc. and then also focus on helping the other car - this may mean you debrief the driver/engineers to find out what has happened and see if it can be avoided, it may mean that you help your counterpart on the other car by buddying up with them or helping them out with menial/background tasks, etc.
 |Even if its your second car that ""go boom"" there's still a lot to learn and observe during the race - whether that is roleplaying as other cars and trying to understand what they would/should do, etc. or using the opportunity to do some training/practice in a live situation and so on.
Hi Randeep! Thanks for this AMA. Has been such an interesting read. I do have a question. While every team works on their strategy during the race, I would assume you also have people trying to decode the competition’s strategy. How much of that goes into deciding your strategy? Are a lot of resources dedicated to this?|It is really simple to work out the optimum strategy for a car if you were racing alone on a track - you could do this, literally, on the back of an envelope (and the maths is actually quite neat too).
 |However, when other cars are introduced and there are interactions between cars (notably overtaking and following) then things get a bit more interesting and more difficult to model also.
 |The strategies of your competitors is vitally important, because of these interactions and how the current strategy landscape (no refuelling) enables the ""undercut"" - you can gain track position by pitting earlier than the racing alone optimum and then other cars may have to overtake or follow you, which impacts on their race time.
 |But, it's not only the strategy of your direct competitors, but of their direct ones also (who may influence their decisions), of cars a pit window behind and ahead and their competitors and etc. etc.
 |Game theory and understanding what your competitors are doing or may do is a fundamental part of formulating a strategy.
how does the whole trackside team travel to each race? like is it together or staggered, and can you stay longer in a city if you would like? and how often do you travel back to the mtc/england? just wondering since there’s not too much public info on this topic thanks randy !!|Good question!
 |We will typically all fly to races, albeit there are some European races where some will drive/train but those people tend to be the exceptions. Normally groups of people from a team may fly together, so the set-up crew who set-up the garage, etc. will fly out first together, followed by mechanics and support crews and then by marketing and engineers.
 |Often we'll end up travelling on the same flights as our counterparts from other teams, or fans too.
 |Personally, I'm normally at MTC between every race, except double-headers where we don't come back - often we'll go in straight after we land or before we take off. That's pretty typical for engineers, but other areas may be at HQ a bit less.
 |Occasionally people will go out early, stay out later or between races for a holiday/trip - this again depends on role (engineers don't get as many opportunities to do this due to debrief/briefing requirements).
Have you ever driven a F1 car or any other race car? What is your personal vehicle?|I was fortunate enough to get to sit in the FW26 when I was at Williams and to ""drive"" it in for pitstop practice. For a long time this was my favourite car ever (views expressed here are my own and not necessarily shared by McLaren) - it was the ""Walrus""-nosed car - so this was a fairly special day for me.
 |I've never driven an F1 car or a race car, but based on my spreadsheets I think I'd be pretty quick and I imagine it's only a matter of time before I end up in the car (views expressed here are my own and *should* be shared by McLaren).
 |Recently I have been trying not to drive too much and using my bike much more - but I drive a Mercedes GLA.
 |This is a photo of someone called Montoya, driving the FW26 I drove for pitstop practice:

How many times have you rejected Ferrari headhunting job offers? Today, the official Autosport podcast, were highly critical of Fernando Alonso, and the male podcaster/journalist stated that something along the lines of all the track staff/engineers hated him and don't want him on the team, so much so, it sounded pretty libellous the entire podcast to be honest. (source: https://youtu.be/FMZDi7RWsc4?t=1847) So my real question is, how was it like to work with Fernando Alonso? and was the journalist right in what he stated?|Any really good headhunter will storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife - I've managed to avoid that.
 |I have to say that I certainly didn't hate Fernando nor do I know of anyone who did at McLaren - in contrast, the level of respect and admiration I have for Fernando is extremely high. I don't think it's easy to describe working with someone who has such an extreme level of talent, Fernando is a true racer, he has the outright speed of anyone, he has the intelligence to understand ""the race"" whilst he's driving flat out and he has a way of encouraging people to perform at their best.
 |There were, of course, difficult times - we disagreed on the strategy many times and yet Fernando still executed what we asked to 100%, we made mistakes and had good races too and Fernando acknowledged both kinds internally and helped us improve.
 |I feel really privileged to have had the chance to work so closely with him.
What’s it like from an engineers perspective, right before the lights go out|It's really stupid - I can't affect what happens at the start, whatever happens we will have plans or be able to formulate plans to deal with the situation and I've done 140 Grand Prix - but I get butterflies every single time.
 |The formation lap itself isn't too bad, as you're checking that cars have gotten away cleanly, that nobody overtakes and positions are regained by the required points if they are swapped, etc. etc. but from the point the cars are parked up and the light sequence starts the anticipation is immense.
 |I am fortunate enough to sit on the pitwall and watch at least the first few seconds of the start before we dive into trying to understand what has changed and what we are going to do - it's one of the most awesome moments of the whole weekend.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I don't know if you're still answering questions, but your last activity was 21 hours ago, so I'll give it a shot. And how does it feel after a good or bad race? (In terms of strategy)|As long as we're separating good or badness of strategy from good or badness of result - it feels amazing to have done a good strategy and yeah, you feel bad after a bad one, but your energy is really focused into understanding why it is bad, rationally understanding what could be done better, removing the impact of fortune, etc. and making a plan to improve - in a way the bad races can feel as good if you find that you're improving your processes/analysis/strategic thinking for the long-term.
How excited is the team for Daniel to come next year?|I have to say first of all, that it is sad to see Carlos go - working with him has been an absolute pleasure and he has brought with him a technical intelligence that rivals his driving skill. I am confident he will go on to win many races, which he deserves and the shame is he'll be wearing the wrong colour overalls when he does so.
 |The team, and I, are also very much looking forwards to welcoming Daniel. You can only have enormous respect for someone who has already won 7 races, those 3 wins in 2014, I think, showed his ability to make the most of any tiny chance and he seems to be an excellent character and motivator both of which are also crucially important to a team. There is a real sense of excitement and anticipation rippling through the team about Daniel joining.
What are your thoughts on refueling?|I'm a little sad that I never really got to do strategy under the 'refuelling' era, irrespective of the impact on racing there was an extra element in the strategy role in setting fuel loads, estimating others' fuel loads, etc.
 |However, we (as a sport) have considered bringing back refuelling numerous types in my tenure and the analysis has always shown that it is typically worse for exciting racing and strategies.
 |Whereas at a high level refuelling may seem to present an extra variable to play with in terms of strategy, really what it does is tend to constrain your stop lap and races become a lot more ""deterministic"".
 |Outside of strategy and with my ""sporting"" hat on, I also have to say that the safety aspect of refuelling is also a genuine concern (as well as potential cost impacts also) and I think the sport has made the right decision, many times, to leave refuelling off the table.
First I want to say that this is one of the best AMAs I’ve seen, it’s awesome how you’re giving such detailed answers and answering so many people! I’d like to know how many members are there roughly in the strategy team? Also, how does it deal with ‘both sides of the garage’ - are there strategists dedicated to one driver that would keep info from the other?|Most teams will have around 3 to 6 people and there's nothing to give away by saying that we currently have a core team of 5.
 |Some of us work across both cars and others are more centred on a single car/driver. It does get competitive in the sense that you really form a bond within your engineering team and with your driver if you are allocated to one (I remember from my time on Fernando's side of the garage) - but it's a team sport - nobody in the team would ever keep information from the other side and the opposite is true, the team is proactive in helping the other side where possible.
So uhhh..... what does the team boss/driver tell you if you make a mistake?|You don't get told off, not at McLaren at least!
 |Normally, if you make a genuine mistake the person who is most upset is yourself as you want to do better and not let the team down. I don't remember a time where Andreas or Zak, for example, have told me off for a bad strategy or a mistake, they trust us to work out when there are mistakes and to fix things to make them better.
 |There have even been occasions where I've been strongly disagreeing with my boss(es) about what to do if there were a safety car, then a safety car was deployed and I made the decision I thought was best. I didn't get told off but rather got told that I did the right thing in making the decision as I thought was best, as I should have more knowledge on the matter than they do.
Hey Randy, Be honest, how did you do in college, were you always at/near the top of the important engineering classes, did you have a couple “C’s get degrees” classes? Also, did Lando keep your face as his homescreen until the end of the season?|Hi ""mum"" 😂 .
 |So, to be honest I did ok at university and managed to get a first - but it didn't start off that way - I couldn't do the homework before we started our first term for Mathematics, the first term felt overwhelming in terms of difficulty, etc. but everything can be turned around.
 |There were some parts of engineering that I really found difficult at the beginning too (bode plots and engineering drawing!) but that got better with time and effort.
 | 
 |In answer to your second question, Lando did keep it for the whole season, he clearly has no shame whatsoever.
^(the below question has been split into three, bulleted)|
Thanks for doing this AMA Randy! *  What's the riskiest call you've had to make/be a part of? The biggest unknown?|No worries. Thanks for the questions! Really, I'd hope that everything is a balanced risk/reward trade. So I don't think we ever really ""throw the dice"". The biggest unknown is also a difficult one, it can vary from tyres at one race, to weather uncertainty at the next.
* Which F1 drivers in your experience have impressed you the most with strategic input? Oftentimes drivers like Lewis are criticised for questioning their engineer during races, do you think it's important for drivers to trust the team more?|All of the drivers I have worked with have been excellent. Fernando, in particular, seemed to have a passion for strategy and would even play F1 strategy games on his phone. But he didn't like 1 stop strategies...!
* What's it like working with Andreas Seidl? Hope we see big success with Danny and the new regs soon :)|Great - I enjoy working with and for Andreas. He's a fellow engineer, so there's a shared understanding which makes things a lot easier."

Hey everyone,

I’m currently a senior in college and I’m going to be graduating in May 2021. As a bit of background, I’m having to play a bit of catch up when it comes to learning how to program because at my first college (I had to transfer), I was the only girl in my CS classes and that wouldn’t have been a problem hadn’t my teachers repeatedly reminded me that I didn’t belong in the field and refused to help me when I needed it. I ended up getting straight A’s and transferring to an a prestigious college and I even managed to score a couple of internships at some well known companies by finding specific positions that didn’t require coding interviews, but I’m afraid my luck is going to run out as a new grad.

My data structures class didn’t have a programming portion at my old college (I was just as confused as you are right now when I found out we were supposed to learn how to program algorithms) and now I’m trying my best to get all of them down and learn how to implement them. I’m feeling pretty confident about where I’m at with that, but now my main concern is not knowing when to apply. I know a lot of the Big N companies start their hiring in early/mid September but I’ve had several recruiters reach out for other companies saying they were starting recruitment early and I can’t help but feeling that all companies are doing that and I just don’t know. Do you guys have a specific way of keeping track of when applications open? And do you have any tips for interviews? Also, has anyone ever experience something similar to what I did at my old college? 

Thanks!"

I will be honest here about my situation and ask for your help and guidance.

My Profile: I graduated in Bsc Computer Science from a Middle Tier University in India in 2018. I travelled and worked on personal projects until Summer 2019 and Started as a Masters Student in Computer Science in a Top Tier University in Canada in Fall 2019. TBH this is a coursework degree. It's purely to compensate for the shitty education I got in my undergrad (I did my best and got terrific grades, but the University was mediocre). I struggled in the first term in my Grad School but improved and did well in the next two terms (Currently third summer term). I have a fantastic Supervisor, and I am learning a lot from him, and my final report is on Software Engineering for Big Data Applications and I have done well in all the courses I have taken. I have learnt a lot working my ass off since I came to Canada, and I have Improved a lot.

I have no previous work or Internship experience in Canada or India, and I would like you to answer the following questions.

1. What are the chances that I will even get an Interview with FAANG Companies for New Grad roles, and Do they hire New Grads without Internship experience? Should I forget about FAANG (Mostly Amazon or any FAANG that has Offices in Canada)?
2. Should I stop leet coding and learn technologies (React and django) to apply for a simple new junior developer job in third-tier companies in Canada?
3. What are the chances of getting a SWE Job without an Internship?
4. Can I apply to Internships in these FANGS or Startups after Graduating  (Graduating in December 2020)?
5. What kind of Companies and Roles should I target to land a good SWE role in Canada given my current situation?

As I am yet to start Applying for Jobs, Which roles do you think I should apply for and increase my chances ?

I don't know what to do as all the paths seem to be unreachable to a new person in a new country. Please only reply to this post if you know the Candian situation around SWE hiring or if you are serious about helping or giving suggestions for improvement.  

Any help or fruitful suggestions are genuinely appreciated."

I never thought I'd be hit this hard by the COVID-19 back in Feburary when I failed my final round of interviews at Amazon. At that time I was just thinking, hey I almost made it to a big tech company. Although I'm a F1 student which makes it harder to find jobs in US but at that time I thought I will just do some more applications , practice algo and data structures more and I will find a fulltime job sooner or later.

What I did not know is that that was almost the last interview I have received as an ECE new grad(another very close one is SDE role at FactSet in May where I cracked the algo part but failed in OOP round, but that's almost all the interviews I have had so far).

And after almost another 3 months of job hunting. I did not even have a single interview opportunity and my OPT has already started on July 1st. During this time, I re-visited my projects and made some refactors, further polished my LinkedIn, set-up a github personal page to showcase my resume and also post some notes I have made when I was studying on my own(mainly data structures and some spark framework notes), currently doing some Flask side projects with one of the PhD students I met while I was still a grad student. if I'm not making any progress in job hunting, I guess at least I did some work to improve myself so my time is not fully wasted.

And now, even 2021 FT openings are coming up, I almost don't know what I could do now: experienced hire roles require working experience, I only have one summer internship.

I was a go-getter in my old career. I was confident, capable, and felt like I could propel myself anywhere. But I didn't like the work itself and always wanted to do this other thing. 

I made a career switch and finally got a job doing the other thing, which I wanted for a long time. But, my confidence is completely dead. I switched from being sure of myself and able to voice my opinions to absolutely terrified of being heard, or even seen. I've been in my new career for a little over a year now and am headed towards my third promotion (intern to associate to intermediate), and I just feel hopeless about advocating for myself. I like the work, but I just can't get over this confidence thing. 

I should mention, I also moved to another city and state when I got this job and it brought on a big bout of anxiety and depression. I've worked through these issues with a therapist and medication and feel better in general, but at my job, I still just feel lost, tiny, and incompetent.

Had anyone had this happen before? How do you find your footing again after taking a big career leap?"

I just came up with this idea in this shower, and I think it has a lot of promise. What would everyone think about a website such as PC Part Picker where you select all of the components you have to sell, and it tells you a fair price for it, as well as a range of prices that could be expected. Also, it would have the option for a user to put in a price that they bought a component for, just to help with pricing.

I know that a couple of weeks ago, when I was flipping some parts for some extra cash, I didn't have the best idea what everything was worth, and eBay was not very good, because the prices vary so much and the condition is usually unknown.

This would function sort of as a blue book for PC parts, and consideration would be given in the algorithm to parts that were barely used, or parts that haven't been overclocked.

I have experience with languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I was throwing around ideas of using an algorithm such as a genetic algorithm to determine prices.

I know a bit of machine learning, I was thinking I could collect user info on what a fair price is for all huge list of parts, and start with that.

This is just a rough idea, please let me know any ideas to improve it. I haven't written any code for it already.

Honestly, the only way I could get enough data to start with prices is if I get to hot on this page, so Reddit, do your thing."

i0gnba,222,2020-07-30,Why English is a necessary option as the medium of instruction,TurbofishPowered,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/i0gnba/why_english_is_a_necessary_option_as_the_medium/,"Over the last day, I have been speaking to several people offline and on Reddit about the new Education policy. While I am ambivalent about most changes, I am horrified by the move to make the mother tongue/regional language as the medium of instruction.

**Background:** I am Tamil by birth and live in Karnataka. I am fluent in English and Tamil, but can also speak Hindi fairly well. I know enough Kannada to get by and can read Kannada too - I picked this up at 28 when I moved to Bangalore.

**Issues I have with the changes:**

1. **People who move across state boundaries are screwed:** The Hindi teacher in my school in Tamil Nadu was terrible - and if that is the quality of teacher we get for the most widely spoken language in the country, what is the plight of children from Tamil families who live in say Gujarat? Who is going to teach them Tamil? Sure, there may be 1 school in the state that has Tamil as the medium - but then again, we are talking about primary school kids. No one is going to care about the one kid from a distant state. English was a great equalizer  

2. **This is Hindi Imposition that Tamil Nadu has been railing against:** The previous point leaves us with Hindi to fill in the hole English left since it is the only language that has sufficient proliferation throughout India - so if a parent knows that they would be moving across state boundaries, they better enroll their kids in a Hindi-medium school because there is no guarantee that anything else will be available.  

3. **Who is going to fill in the language gap?** Most prestigious schools in Chennai use English as the medium of instruction. Who is going to retrain these teachers to teach science and math in the regional language - let alone the mother tongue of immigrants?  

4. **Language translators aren't a solution** Someone in Reddit told me that the way to work around this would be for schools to hire Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada etc. language translators. This is a pipedream. Most schools don't even have enough teachers to cover the regular courses. Often for primary schools the same teacher covers science and mathematics. Now, does anyone expect schools to invest in language translators for a language that services maybe one kid every batch? Also, what happens if in a particular batch there are no Bengali migrants in that school in Bangalore? Not just this - the language translators need to also know the scientific terms in the language they are translating to and from. Where are these people magically going to appear from?  

5. **The distance factor** Most primary schools are within a few kilometers of the residence - gone are the days when students used to travel ""20 kms uphill both-ways"" to go to school. But this is exactly what would be needed if the only school that teaches in Tamil in Bangalore is far away from my house. (and incidentally there are 4 in Bangalore - despite a 15% Tamil population [https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2d1679ac93756fd197e9291b3de4ab70.webp](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2d1679ac93756fd197e9291b3de4ab70.webp)).  

6. **Who decides the mother-tongue?** Can I claim my child's mother-tongue is English? I am married to a non Tamil person, and speak English at home. In fact, I speak English to my parents (who are very much Tamil too) as well because I am most comfortable in this language.  

7. **It strips away choice** Most people jubilant on Twitter (yes, I know it is a bad idea to look there) seem to be happy that the MacaulayPutras are finally getting a taste of the same medicine that Tamil/Hindi-medium kids faced when they entered college. But what is the point in this schadenfreude? There was at least a choice in the past - several parents put in extra effort getting their kids into an English medium school because it is the best for a career and interacting with the rest of the world. What would learning mathematics in a regional language give me? This feels like extra effort for nought.  

8. (Not language related - but skill related) **This ignores the ground reality of teachers in the country** Sure there are great teachers, I had one in my 6th standard who made me fall in love with English literature, one in 8th who made me love mathematics, and one in my 11th who made me fall in love with  Computer Science. Now I am a computer scientist who reads a lot of books and dabbles with abstract math when bored. However, that is the point, I had **three** such teachers amidst the \~40+ teachers who taught me. And this was considered the best school in my neighborhood. Most teachers just ended up as teachers because they failed to get an engineering/medical entrance. Are these the people who are going to judge whether I am skilled or not? Any such subjective measure is likely to introduce biases beyond what you already see  

9. **Vocational training was attempted in the past and failed for a reason** Rajaji tried to push for vocational training in the Madras state. It received strong push back because of the unequal society we live in. Outside of highly integrated city schools, the rich kids are going to get great internships like working in their dad's comfy office for a day while poor kids are going to actually do laundry. Dalits are going to be discriminated against when it comes to good internships.  

10. Finally, we aren't Germany or Japan which are relatively small and homogeneous nor should we aspire to be Russia/China which imposed one language by diktat over the entire country.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc arguments from other threads (My response to the italicized points)**

&gt;Are you really telling me a subject is being forced upon you if you are  moving to a new state where a majority of the people speak a different  language? You need to learn the language the majority of the people in  your region speak, be it Tamil in TN or hindi in MP, it'll help in  communicating with people around you. Seriously, why have any languages  at all by your logic, let's all become monolingual and learn English  when the professional and the scientific world uses English mainly.

Think of an 8 year old who moves to Bangalore from Chennai who because  of this rule learnt science in Tamil - so water cycle is ' நீர்  சுழற்சி'. (Neer Suzhurchi) Do you really think he would within a short  period learn enough Kannada to switching over to ( ನೀರಿನ ಚಕ್ರ ) (Nīrina  cakra) and grasp the concepts being taught?

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120222082907/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/u/47/3X/473X0I01.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20120222082907/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/u/47/3X/473X0I01.htm): This  Formula as  enunciated in the National Policy Resolution of 1968 and  reiterated in the  National Policy on Education 1986 provides Hindi,  English and  modern  Indian language  **(preferably  one  of the southern languages)**  in  the  Hindi speaking  states and Hindi.  English and the Regional language in  the          non-Hindi speaking States.If north-Indian states were unwilling to teach southern languages as a 3rd language when the 3-language policy encouraged it, fat luck assuming they will accommodate all subjects in mother tongues of students from other states.

&gt;In a lot of villages, tier 3 cities and middle + lower middle   class families, prefer a school teaching job. A growth in requirement of   local language teachers help them in availing such jobs by learning  and  teaching in a language they're comfortable in.

And  that is completely fine and it exists today - but why remove English as  an option as the medium of instruction in tier 1 cities (and elsewhere)"

# Executing python script in PowerAutomate and use of Azure

Hello,

I am an intern responsible for digitising the processes of a business based in the UK. Right now, I am working on registering details of a new employee into a Sharepoint list. The flow I envisage is as follows:

1. An employee submits a FastField form(a service we use to capture inputs) on their personal device
2. FastFields detects a change and updates a Sharepoint list with the new employee details
3. PowerAutomate detects an update to the list and makes an update to the employee details Excel file
4. Once an update is made to the Excel file, powerAutomate runs a python script that interfaces with FastField's API to make some changes to FastField forms(these changes are irrelevant to the question)

I have already done the first 3 processes from the above. I am hitting major snags on the last step(no. 4) as PowerAutomate cannot run Python scripts. I was thinking of using Azure's virtual machines and make it run the python script. The way it connects to PowerAutomate is through a connector and gets triggered whenever an update is made to the excel file.

So, after step 4, I'd like the python script to execute. Is there a neat way to do this? Is Azure the best way to go?

I am just an intern and this is how i thought I could automate their process... so if you have better ideas as to the flow, please advise as well. 

Very grateful for your answers!"

I'm a 20-year-old CS undergrad who is entirely financially independent and has grown up extremely low income. I currently have about 3 semesters left to finish my CS degree not counting the current semester. Throughout most of my time in school, I worked full time in a help desk position but left last semester because classes had become very difficult and I needed to focus on school. 

This semester I realized that graduation is creeping up on me and I don't really have formal experience in any development position. I now have the opportunity to go back to the company I was working at but as a junior web dev and making around 60k+. However, it would mean dropping school down to half time and stretching it out over the next six semesters instead. I am fortunate enough to have a full ride and have my classes paid for but I would need loans to pay for my living situation if I didn't take the job. I'm really tempted to take the position as it would give me great working experience and I could potentially graduate with 2 years of industry experience and jump into a better position. Not to mention the financial incentive. Would I be making the right move? Or would it be wiser to stay in school full time and try to land a couple of internships over the next few semesters instead and accept some loan debt?"

I am a second year maths student in a top uni in England. I just had my results for the year. I wanted to apply for data science. 

I do not have any work experiences or any internships. Originally I was on the 4th year course and whenever I applied for internships I was rejected on the basis that I wasn't a penultimate year student. 

As such I was planning to get a internship in my third year, the penultimate year. 

Now they have forced me onto the 3 year course and so, quite understandably, I am worried about my job prospects when i graduate as I'm unable to do a internship this year to gain experience.

I have told them all of this for an appeal however they didn't reconsider so I'm forced to transfer to the third year course by the end of this summer.

Can anyone guide me on what I should do? Any advice will be greatly appreciated! 

Personally I believe I need to up my portfolio and as such my next plan is to create two projects, one in term 1 and the other in term 2 on computer vision, as that's what I want to work in.

Thank you guys"

I’m a senior at Michigan State University graduating in May with a Bachelors Degree in Finance. My GPA will be in the ballpark of 3.8 - 3.85 when I graduate with a couple of relevant internships under my belt. 

With all the uncertainty surrounding the next year or so, I’m torn on which avenue of finance to pursue. Corporate finance, financial advising, and commercial banking are my realistic options coming right out of college (the consensus is that investment bankers typically aren’t hired right out of MSU). I’m involved in both the Finance association and the wealth management association at school, and both are fairly interesting to me; I have no preference in terms of one industry over the other.

I’m looking for insight/advice as to which avenue I should start my career in given today’s circumstances. Is there anything I should work on/focus on my last year of college skill set wise? Any books you’d recommend reading? What are some reasonable starting salary expectations coming out of school? Do you like the stream of finance you are currently working in? 

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated! 

I am trying to get my ducks in a row months in advance so I am not running around with my head cut off when I graduate in May! 

I think a lot of soon to be college graduates could benefit from a thread like this!

\[Serious enough post\]

 I am 20, i am not really planning to get married anytime soon but kinda thinking about the benefits and drawbacks of marriage. It keeps me up at night.

I am currently studying CS at good enough university (top 5 in Canada) going into 3rd year in September, i have worked on personal project and planning on getting a Science internship program, if i did good in that i will be offered a job before graduation.

The thing is that i have been really good with money since i started my job at 17 and saved most of my money, i can pay all my tuition fee but choose not to because i decided to invest my money instead and so far it's been really great including some swing trading etc.

So i am wondering is it even worth it to get married at all. In the past it was a good way to get laid and stuff but now all you need is some biceps, good car + cash and boom you can taste different every week or another week. And with the increase in divorce rates and all of that stuff where assets are split like 50/50 and you are like left broke. In the future when i plan to get married let's say 25 i will probably have good job and probably good enough savings + investments (currently i have like $25K net savings + investment). Should i even consider marriage at all?

I don't want to be wiped out. Any suggestion from intellectuals on this sub.."
i0tney,27,2020-07-30,Need harsh advice. I don't need any encouragement.,quandinh04,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i0tney/need_harsh_advice_i_dont_need_any_encouragement/," I’m going to pour my heart out for today. For the first time ever. 

I’m a Vietnamese student preparing to enter Grade 11 ( which is like Junior year in the US)  
To start the story, my parents decided that I will study abroad in the US when I just started Grade 10 ( High schools in VN start from Grade 10-Grade12, which is 1 year shorter than in the US) After surviving a brutal entrance exam, I landed myself in one of, or even, the best high school in my city. Comparing that moment to now, I feel hopeless.   


Here’s the thing. I do well in school, in GPA, in SATs (+1500), SAT II Math II, Physics (going to do it, really confident about it), IELTS,.... but right now, I clearly know that I don’t have a Passion, a desired major. That influenced a lot of my decision in Grade 10.   
I didn’t join any club in high school (which I have learned, is a BIG mistake AND combined with the fact that high school only last 3 years.... Sigh), so my extracurriculars are barely impactful ( just some volunteering for my school’s Student Gov in making events for my school, really enjoy it tho.) Everywhere I read, watch online, it always said something along the lines of “Create a spike. Narrate a story about you and your extracurriculars” But I can’t pinpoint my major. Everything else was close to impossible. Went to a lot of consultations, they all advise me to do a Passion project or do activities that they recommend. I may not know what I love, but I do know what I hate. It’s when people joined random activities (which obviously never works), it’s when people made random projects, NGOs to prove their leadership, it’s when people pay an exorbitant amount of money to have a company script their entire extracurricular since grade 9. All of those are clearly happening in my school.   
On the other hand, I’m really happy for those who find their passion, aptitude for sth, and develop it to their best. People on Quora, Reddit tend to criticize some College YouTubers online for being pretentious, but in my opinion, they clearly worked very hard and I’m happy for them...  


Since young, I have always been shy, reserved but friendly enough to be on good terms with everyone. I’m not totally an introvert. Given the time, I will open, turn myself into a funny guy who likes to make memes for fun ( Yes, I use memes to start making friends in Grade 10; Before that, I use games (Geometry Dash :) ) to make friends in Grade 6 by training myself to be good enough to wow them. )   


I do have hobbies, interests: Watching, playing games about War-related stuff ( WWII, WWI, the Napoleonic war,...); Love cats in general; Love world politics, sports ( to the point that I only care about the sports, world politics, finance section in a newspaper.)  


Talking about sports, I have asthma and flat feet syndrome, which basically prevents me from sports intensively, but I still play badminton and soccer. I just quit playing them professionally. Believe it or not, I was quite good at badminton.  


I’m totally not a LEADER ( which is what colleges care about) I’m not PASSIONATE about anything. I’m an international, which significantly lowers my chance at every university. My family is just a typical middle-class Vietnamese family, which makes me unable to apply to US Public Universities ( too costly) So I have to be very good so get enough financial aid from a Private Uni. I heard that applying as an undeclared major will makes my application “not compelling” too.   
From the beginning of my summer, I have been interested (just interested) in Finance and Computer Science. But I know that I have to compete with people who have devoted their high school life for these majors. They did research, internships, become president in many different clubs. I barely code. I don’t have the entrepreneurial spirit. Right now I feel like I have a deadline by which I will have to make a decision that will affect the rest of my life.  
 To sums up, let’s talk about why I come here to ask for advice. Since I stumble upon [r/ApplyingToCollege](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2FApplyingToCollege&amp;h=AT25IflzdK2_LgXUVDmuHJOp8oKGLvLV9ywtljkjR4WUhOzs_rTXzwX27wfID-ZWZH2eilQsH9B6UUZbwQju6MS1mS7AvoqJkfKKxp0o17IUcfKh-2RmNzjnI_YDBeAusRbAtA), the Prepscholar website,... I have learned the best advice, know stories about lots of incredible individuals, and how they shine in their way,... Though I am very depressed right now, I still believe that knowing my mistakes early on is much better.   

I'm not going to quit though. I have to repay my parents, who are into their 50s right now.  They married very late so while others in their peers have sons and daughters who are successful in many different fields and able to take care of their parents, they have me: a 16-year-old kid struggling in his first uphill battle in life. AND if I failed next year's college application, I will use this experience to help my little sister, so that she doesn't have to make the same mistake as me."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
How many times in a year do you think you get race day strategy 100% correct?|I would say we never get it 100% correct. Race day strategy isn't just about picking the correct number of stops and stop laps for both cars.
 |Did we take every last drop of grip out of the tyres before we pitted? Did we pressure cars ahead the right amount at every point? Did we back off and protect the tyres the right amount at every point? Did we communicate to the driver exactly what we were trying to achieve and therefore get 100% out of them at every instant in the race? Was the modelling accurate and useful? etc. etc.
 |We will always be searching for marginal/incremental improvements in everything we do.
I’m in high school and am planning on going to school to become a mechanical engineer, so my question is this: how available are engineering jobs in F1, or just motorsport in general? Of course, being an F1 engineer would be a dream, but I have no idea how difficult it would be to actually find a job|I have to be honest and say that jobs in motorsport and especially F1 are not plentiful and that they are often oversubscribed many times over.
 |I would not let that put you off though, at your age you have a lot of time to pick up skills, experiences and knowledge that will help you in the endeavor of getting a job in motorsport.
 |I would also say that perseverance is almost an essential quality in finding a job in F1. I, and many others I know, were turned down for roles multiple times and at various points thought we would never get our dream jobs in F1.
Hey, Randy! Thanks for doing this awesome AMA. You have talked a lot about getting into F1 for a career as an Engineer. I was hoping you could shed a bit of light in what skillsets/qualifications you look for in candidates who work as the mechanics and the pitstop crew on a given race weekend. Again, Thanks for doing this. I have read through every one of your answers and they were as much fun to read as they were enlightening about the sport we love.|So this is not my area of expertise, although I do spend a lot of time working with the pitcrew - so please take this with a pinch of salt but I think below are the main things we look for:
 |* Some prior experience in building and servicing of race cars or bikes.
 |* An ability to understand and follow (often complex) procedures.
 |* A proactive nature (e.g. when reporting faults or build issues).
 |* Dealing well with a high pressure and time constrained workload and environment.
 |* An attention to detail and a willingness to learn.
 |* Ability to read and interpret technical drawings.
 |* Fabrication and machining skills.
Really cool to hear from you Randy. How have you and the team at McLaren been spending your time with everything that’s been going on with Covid-19? Hope we can see you go racing in Austria in July!|So F1 teams have all been subject to an extended ""shutdown"" meaning that most of us haven't been allowed to work on F1 projects and many of us, consequently, have not been working in recent weeks.
 |Personally, I've used the time to try and get fit, having averaged c. 4 hours and 15 minutes of exercise every day since April 1st (yes I do have a spreadsheet), as well as trying to learn some new skills like React.
 |Many of the team have used the opportunity to spend time with their loved ones, which can be difficult with hectic schedules, to improve their cooking skills (I have eaten the best pizza I've ever had during lockdown!), do gardening and so on.
 |Everyone seems eager to get back to it and most teams will be returning to work over the next fortnight.
Hi Randy. Thanks so much for doing this, the answers so far have been really insightful. Can I ask, as an armchair fan, what can I look for over the course of the weekend to help me predict likely strategic calls on race day?|The main 2 factors are tyre behaviour (degradation, wear life and pace difference) and pitstop loss. From here you can get a basic understanding of the strategy before competitors are thrown into the mix.
 |Pirelli kindly provide some of the information each weekend on tyres and you can estimate the rest from FP2 long runs towards the end of the session. Pitstop loss is also often given by some teams (maybe rounded or slightly noisified - but close enough to give you the right number of stops).
 |With those 2 things you can work out the baseline strategy if you were racing alone and then you want to be considering the cars that are a pitstop window ahead and behind and see whether you would stop earlier or later than the baseline based on undercutting, traffic and so on.
Thank you so much for doing this AMA! During last year's German GP, I remember that a lot of us fans were interested in contrasting approaches made by two teams as the track started to dry up. One driver saw that the track was dry enough for slicks, called it in, and got the go ahead to take the gamble; he ended up coming very close to a podium. Another driver made similar observations and appealed repeatedly to his engineer to make the switch, but was instructed to stay out for several more laps, costing him points. I understand hindsight is 20/20 here, but if you were the engineer, would you be more inclined to take the driver's word when they potentially contradict the data, or vice versa? Do you believe there's a ""correct"" approach in situations like these, or a personal preference? Again, thank you so much! (Typed from my [*“Mclaren Edition”* phone](https://imgur.com/U4U1ROT)...I can't wait for the season to start, and I really wish you guys the best!)|Thank you for the kind words!
 |I think there is a lot you don't see (not your fault) when it comes to strategic decisions, this is amplified many times over in a wet or changeable conditions race, where decisions are extremely difficult, with lots of information, of varying quality/frequency.
 |I think we have learnt that it depends. Sometimes, we will weight the driver's input higher than anything else, sometimes it will be the least valuable information.
Do you employ many Americans on the team, and if so what does it take? Assuming they have the technical credentials of engineering.|So we have nothing against Americans, nor people of other nationalities - having the right to work in the UK is sometimes required although we do also help with visa applications this isn't always possible for us to do.
 |In terms of Americans on the team, we have Zak Brown, of course and I'll be honest and say I can't think of any others at the moment, although we have had a few placement students in recent years from the United States.
 |There's no extra requirement for Americans, especially as we're moving to Mercedes powerunits soon, we won't have too many issues with the pronunciation of Renault anymore.
What kind of people do you have in the strategy department? Are they mostly engineers, or like mathematicians and computer scientists?|Although we are largely engineers by degree, we don't really discriminate against other backgrounds and are often quite keen to add a diversity of ideas and backgrounds into the mix - a numerate degree is going to be very helpful though.
 |We are 60% mechanical engineers, 1 engineer/mathematician hybrid and 1 physicist.
Is it unusual to go from entry-level engineer to head of strategy in 6-7 years? What do you think drove your success?|I think it actually happened even a bit quicker than that - which had never been my expectation when I started.
 |It's hard to say what is unusual, there are so few ""race strategists"" in the world, let alone in F1 that I think there's not really a ""usual"" and often timescales can be quite variable based on circumstance (e.g. someone leaving/changing role).
 |I guess the success is driven by the confidence and belief in the strategy team, of which I am just a part - so the fact that the other members of the team are so good, that management above us let us independently improve and change our processes without blame nor interference etc. is what has really driven it. Also have the much wider strategy team that includes 10s of volunteers to thank - it truly is a team effort and no single person would have the impact they do without the team around them.
Does race strategist cooperate with aerodynamics department in any way?|So, I can't go into details but yes we do. Strategy is a really cool role because we end up dealing with pretty much all other areas - as we also cover things like Competitor Intelligence and Sporting matters.
 |In a more typical sense, just thinking about race strategy, there are a few areas that spring to mind, aerodynamicists and other engineers will be setting things like the wing level and the trades made here can affect performance in qualifying vs. the race, something that we as strategists are well placed to comment on the value of and also for setting cooling levels, we're responsible for weather forecasting and interpretation and so will often liaise with our aerodynamics colleagues about the risks of it being hotter than certain limits.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Could you unpack a bit on what ""competitor intelligence"" does? Thanks!|""Mr Holmes, I would love to tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.""
 |I'm afraid that in this case the answer is no. All I can say is that we do some pretty neat things using the various kinds of information (audio, video, images, data, quotes, etc.) to gain intelligence on things like relative performance, other teams and so on.
What’s your proudest moment in F1 to date?|Another tough one!
 |What makes me proudest is the Strategy team at McLaren. The team consists of around 5 people at its core and I can honestly say that they are the most talented, motivated, most passionate and smartest collection of individuals I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Everyone's level naturally rises when you work with people of this calibre and although the team is constantly looking for areas of improvement, challenging each other - it is also really just fun. I am very proud that I've played a part in pulling in each of my strategy teammates.
 |One other thing that gets close (other than Grand Prix which I'll cover in another answer) is Mission Control. McLaren were kind enough to give me the opportunity to manage the project to design a new Mission Control from scratch, build and deploy it. We were responsible for building contractors, ventilation, budget, aesthetic, even unpacking and setting up over 30 machines. The Mission Control room is an awesome facility and we built it together as a team. A lot of it is secret but here's a photo you are allowed to see:

Hello, Do you go on reddit and check this sub sometimes?|I would say more frequently than sometimes and I'm not the only one who works in F1 than does.
 |The content on here can be amazing at times - from some of the photos, to some of the data visualisations - and sometimes it is just fun to read comments and see how different our perspective of a race/event can be to that of fans.
You've talked about refuelling in a previous answer, and how it might affect strategies, but what is your opinion on the current tyres, and how they basically force the teams to do a two-stop strategy? Would you prefer if the tyres were manufactured in a way that makes them more durable? Thank you!|So, I would start by saying the tyres don't force teams into 2 stop strategies, however, the front-runners will have a higher propensity for 2 stops over 1 stops in the current regime, which may present a more skewed picture to fans.
 |I believe and I think my colleagues and competitors agree, that good racing does involve some strategic flexibility and variety and a good sweet spot is to have races that are at crossover between 2 an 3 stop strategies (crossover means the timings and track position work out such as to be roughly equal).
 |However, Pirelli are in an unenviable position with regards to giving us tyres that would encourage 2 or 3 stop crossover events, as the drivers also need to be able to push the tyres lap after lap to get good racing.
 |So you can see that Pirelli have to try and balance both concerns and I think with that in mind they are doing a good job of finding a balance.
The strategy with sainz in Brazil was amazing man|Thanks for the kind words but the strategy in Brazil (I hope) was as good as in Austria, or Hungary, etc. We didn't do anything particularly special but in this case the outcome was particularly good - we try and judge ourselves on our decisions/processes/analysis rather than the outcome as the outcome/result can be dependent on chance which is outside our control.
Have you found any books in particular helpful when it comes to the soft skills required working in a multi-department environment, also when it comes to the overarching strategic principles. Building on that, how often do you find yourself acting against the data/conclusions presented to you in favour of your own observations or “common sense”|I think the most useful book has been Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as it really demonstrates the importance of teamwork. Mark Corrigan's seminal ""Business Secrets of the Pharaohs"" and Michael Scott's ""Somehow I Manage"" are also essential reading.
 |Seriously though, a difficult one, I think a lot of skills are picked up outside of books, things like logical problem-solving, being extremely pro-active, etc. however, some books that I find have been useful are:
 |* Thinking Fast and Slow (almost essential reading, Thinking in Bets is also good)
 |* The Intelligent Entrepreneur (very inspiring)

Speaking from a career standpoint, does having a background in something like biology factor into a possible role at all? Something of a mix of Biology and Engineering (Biomed, Bioengineering etc)? Thanks!|It can do - I specialised in Biomedical Engineering as one of my electives in my final year at university, by the way.
 |Especially in strategy, different viewpoints/experiences/backgrounds can be very useful.
So we're hearing that Austria and maybe Britain is going ahead, is McLaren prepping for this or are they waiting for official word from Formula 1|I can't comment on the calendar as it stands as that would be breaking confidentiality. However, I can say that Liberty and the FIA are working tirelessly to bring a calendar together and it was something that we all discussed yesterday in the Sporting Working Group and is no doubt being discussed on a daily basis in other forums also.
 |The teams, including McLaren, are trying as well to prepare for the season starting soon whilst remaining flexible such that if there are changes we can adapt to them quickly and well.
How do you judge a mandatory 2 pit stops instead of only one? Can this make the races more enjoyable in your opinion? Thanks|I don't think mandatory 2 stop strategies are a good idea. I can talk about this openly as its something we have debated with other teams, the FIA and Liberty as well and as a group we decided against it.
 |The reason I don't like mandatory 2 stop strategies is that it is artificial and artificial constraints (I believe) will lead to more strange/bad occurrences than good ones.
 |The benefit of mandatory 2 stop strategies is that everyone will make 2 stops which on average is more stops than we currently do and we believe that more stops (to a limit) typically lead to more exciting races.
 |However, the downside is that this is purely artificial. If the race is a clear 1 stop and we add a second stop artificially then it's more likely that that stop could be placed in a strange spot, because the sensitivity to its timing could be low - you may see cars pitting very early or late into the race and therefore the race is still like a 1 stop (you don't get the full benefit on racing of the second stop) - especially with a point for fastest lap.
 |You may then argue that we could force the second stop into a particular window, or set a limit on stint lengths. This also has issues, with cars likely to be concentrated on one side of the window and then there may need to be more artificial constraints.
 |I very firmly believe that the best way to encourage more stops is to keep constraints on strategists light and influence the primary factors that determine how many stops there are, that is:
 |* Pitloss (decrease = positive pressure on number of stops).
 |* Tyre behaviour (worse behaviour = positive pressure on number of stops).
What's it like working for the most positive and happiest team?|Let me ask some of my friends at other teams and I'll get back to you soon.
 |Only kidding 😁 ! I can't say if McLaren is the most positive/happiest team as I've not been everywhere, but its certainly the most fun, positive, happy, smart, etc. etc. team I've ever worked at.
 |I love it. It's the people that make McLaren (and I know that's a cliche) special and I enjoy working in such a tight-knit, funny, motivated team.
What was the most difficult race strategy wise in your F1 career?|My first race, I think stands outs - the 2013 Australian Grand Prix. I started work on January 2nd that year (my first real job in F1), had no strategy experience, had to do lots of winter reporting and had no strategy mentor (as the previous strategist had left already). I'm not sure ""baptism of fire"" and ""thrown into the deep-end"" are mixable metaphors but that's what it felt like.
 |To make matters more ""interesting"", the data showed and I was convinced that it would be a multiple stop (probably 3 stop) grand prix, based on what we had observed in Winter Testing and during Friday and Saturday running. This was in sharp contradiction to recent history at the Australian Grand Prix - so there were many heated discussions over this (with the majority of the team heavily disagreeing with it being more than a 1 stop race and every member having much more experience than I).
 |Turns out lack of experience can be an advantage sometimes. Teams tended to do a 2 or 3 stop race, but the latter was much better. Teams were reluctant to add stops given experience and recent history of the Australian Grand Prix and this pushed many into poor strategies, rather than adapting to the tyre behaviour we were observing.
 |2013 was an interesting year for strategy, with empirical data and lack of bias being really important to getting the strategies right. If you were to look through those races there are certain teams that flip-flopped a lot and others that quickly adapted to the new 'normal'.
Hi Randy, I don't know if this is already over but I'll try anyway. It's no surprise that working in F1 in any capacity must be extremely competitive. Is there any chance for someone considering a career change to be able to get a foot in the door? I work in investment management and realise that I want to be as close to my passion as possible. I'm open to pretty much any job just to get in. Naturally Id hope to have some transferable skills but i would focus on the chance to build skills and potentially go from there. Any advice? Thanks!|I think perseverance and desire are key and yes it is possible. Coincidentally, I was working in the investment industry when I was offered the chance to take a full time role in strategy for the 2013 season.
 |I had worked at Williams for my final year project at university, but had been ""out of the game"" for a couple years when I got the offer to return.
Hello Randy, I am sorry if this has already been asked. But I would like to know your thoughts on: The new strategy involved on the new regulations/ground affect designs on the new Formula 1 vehicles? Is this a step in the right direction? Love to hear an professional / insider view on these new changes to the sport as the team Engineers do not seem to have a big say in the acceptace of the design limitations from FIA.|I personally think the new regulations (Sporting, Technical and Financial) are moving the sport in the right direction and so am looking forwards to them being introduced over the coming years.
 |I would also say, as it may not be obvious to fans, that teams and engineers are heavily involved in these regulations. Whether that is us helping to draft parts of them, sense check them, vote on them, etc. it is a very open, constructive forum between the teams, the FIA and FOM (and other external experts as required).
Day 5: Mr. Singh is still answering questions. He's now one of us. LEGEND, and thanks to McLaren for allowing this. -Best AMA yet? DC^answered^^4^^^questions.|Haha thank you!
 |I will probably have to stop soon - but have a few more answers coming on a few families of question I haven’t yet answered. 🙂
Hi, Randy, Your answers are great, thank you! One of my most favorite McLaren performances of recent years was Fernando's insane race in Azerbaijan in 2018, when he had a double tyre puncture but still managed to finish 7th. Were you still his personal strategist back then? What was your role in his success? What were you thoughts when you saw him limping to the pits on two wheels? What did you do after that?|What a race, eh? ""Personal"" strategist, you make us sound like mathematical butlers... 😁.
 |I wasn't Fernando's strategist at that time, Chris (one of our team) had already taken over by then and I was leading the team. It was not an easy race, although it may look like we sat back and watched, there's a lot of decisions made that you don't see and a lot of decisions made not to do stuff.
 |It was a good team effort from everyone to stay calm and try and pick up the pieces after the incident on the first lap, when the car rolled into the pits we did consider retiring it - but as a famous paper salesman once said ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"". What outsiders (who get special access) often notice is that the team stays calm, you can't get wobbly or excited over the incident/accident, you need to be calm, methodical and logical.
Great ama|I think this is my favourite question so far. 😀
 |To be honest, the questions are very interesting and I have had so many people answer questions for me when I was in the position of being a fan/student and that changed my life by helping me get my dream job. If I can give back a fraction of the help/information I've received then I'll feel very happy!
How contagious is Landos laugh?|I don't know about you but I find it quite grating. Do you know the feeling you get when you hear someone scratch their nails across a blackboard, or when your alarm goes off and you're still tired?
 |In all seriousness though, Lando is a funny guy and does always keep the mood nice and light.
Hi Randy. Who is your favourite member of the IT team? Sincerely, Definitely not a member of the IT team.|Trick question! I don't have a favourite member of the IT team. 😁
Is there any role for physicians/doctors on race teams?|As doctors, I would probably say no. Most teams won't employ their own doctors anymore or will do so in a very limited capacity.
 |However, that doesn't mean we don't have medical support, it tends to come through external organisations that support F1, such as Formula Medicine, for example, or the FIA's Medical Programme.
 |We also occasionally get applications for strategists who have a medical background - and that isn't something we look down upon, if anything it may provide a skillset/experiences that would be complementary to those of 'mostly engineers'.
I understand you may not answer because this may be sensitive, but Which method of steering the ship do you think is more effective ? The steely dictatorial grip of Ron Dennis or the More lenient managerial approach of Zak brown ? From a fan perspective, I love that mclaren drivers aren’t on such a tight leash.|I never really worked under Ron as I joined in mid-2015. I have to say that the management style I’ve experienced throughout has been great - no blame culture, very open and understanding, letting the experts make decisions, etc.
Have you ever sat on the pitwall at the start and said (even to yourself) ""And it's lights out and away we go.""?|I haven’t! I imagine I now will at whichever Grand Prix we get the pleasure of starting first this year.
Is Ferrari’s strategy as much of a running joke in the paddock as it is by the fans and here on reddit? Maybe you can’t really answer that truthfully but I’ve always been curious. It’s obviously a difficult job but I do wonder if they shoot themselves in the foot as often as it seems from the fans perspective.|Answered elsewhere in the thread.
 |It's a difficult, stressful job, so you always have respect for your competitors.
In your experience, would adding flame decals to my truck make it go faster?|Where are you going to place them? What colour are the flames?
Hey randy, i am a 15 year old girl who lives in india and my dream is to become a formula one engineer or work in f1 in anyway. What do u think are the educational qualifications needed to become a formula 1 engineer and what exposure do u think i need to even be close to full filling my dream. I have been following mclaren f1 team for quite some while now and love the friendly environment inside the team.|As PapaKeth says, hopefully there are some answers to your question about what qualifications are required in my other comments.
 |Can I say though, don't let being 15, female, or living in India deter you - none of those things are a blocker to getting a job in F1 in the future.
Hi ! Thank you for answering some of our questions ! I've been wanting to ask, in the event of a car failure ( engine failure, hydraulics failure, etc) how do you become aware of it ? Do you have a real time data link to the car as an engineer ? Or is it something you see on a TV ?|So we get data from the cars ""live"", there are hundreds of sensors on each car and this data is transmitted to us at the track and we also transmit it back to HQ in Woking. There are tens of people looking at the data and typically we will spot problems in the data, or based on feedback from the drivers, before we see them on TV.
 |That doesn't mean that we never spot stuff on TV first - sometimes you don't have instrumentation for certain things and so you may spot it visually first and the TV feed is a good way of sense-checking in some cases as well.
Do you think Stoffel deserved to still be in F1? (Not necessarily with McLaren)|100% - he is a great talent and I'm very glad that he is doing so well in Formula E.
Hi, thanks for doing this Q&amp;A. Working for an F1 team is the dream, though I understand it's very difficult to get in. I'm disabled, would this matter to an employer? Do you have any advice on how I could approach this to someone as I'm just finishing my first year at University and hoping to apply for internships. Also, (sorry if you've answered this question already) I am studying Mathematics probably going to move into Mathematics and Statistics. Would it be possible to apply for a strategist position with a Mathematics degree?|Your disability should not matter to an employer and I really believe it will not. We have people with disabilities working at McLaren. Perhaps if it is something you are concerned about or if its a disability that a team (or McLaren) could help make easier to manage (apologies if my wording is not sensitive) then I would highlight that in your application when you apply for a role.
 |Mathematics is entirely sensible as a background for a strategist role. I started off in Mathematics (&amp; Statistics) before I moved over to Engineering (I found Mathematics at university to be too abstract for my liking). If you are doing Statistics anything that covers stochastic modelling would be particularly relevant to strategy.
I want to work in F1 in the future and preferably an engineer role. Would studying Mechanical Engineering be the best course to get a chance? Thanks|I would say the majority of F1 engineers have studied Mechanical Engineering but that doesn't necessarily equate to it giving you the best chance of getting in. Engineering skills (and particularly mechanical engineering skills) will make you suitable for a multitude of roles in an F1 team (from strategy, to design engineering, to race engineering and performance analysis), so naturally you would expect more mechanical engineers.
 |I would have a think about the role that you would like to do and what qualifications would give you the best chance for that role, it could be that its Computer Science instead, or Aerodynamics, or maybe it is Mechanical Engineering. I would also think heavily about how interested you are in said degree - a degree is not a small investment of time, money and effort and its important you do something you enjoy.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Hey Randy, this answer was not directed at me but I just want to let you know it really just helped me out. I recently dropped out of mechanical engineering because I wasn't enjoying it and made the switch to computer science. It really pained me for a while thinking about giving up the F1 dream because my career choice wasn't ideal for me. So yeah, thanks. While I'm at it I'd like to add a question about computer science in an F1 team, what kind of roles could I take part of with that degree (specificaly at the track, though I see how that's a bit less likely)? Are there masters degrees or specializations more sought after in certain areas? Again, thanks a lot for you time in answering these questions and apologies for the bad english 😅|Hi, no worries and thank you for the appreciation.
 |Computer Science is a numerate enough degree at most places that you could lend yourself to any role as long as you can pick up the required engineering knowledge as well. Obviously, something in areas like Software Engineering, IT or Vehicle Science/Modelling may be most relevant/easy but there aren't necessarily many trackside opportunities in those areas.
Hello, First of all, thanks for answering all those questions. It's nice for us students dreaming of F1 to have something to look up to. So I am studying mechanical engineering in France and I am really looking forward to become a Motorsport Race engineer, and obviously F1 would be the dream. What I like the lost in that job is the trackside aspect, travelling, living the race. As I imagine, you need some years of experience to become a trackside F1 engineer. So do you think building experience in lower formulas like F2/F3, FE, or prototypes, GT...as performance/data engineer in smaller teams is a good way to line up for a trackside job in F1 ? Or is it recomended to start as an engineer at the lowest level directly in F1 and try to climb the ladder from there ? What is the proportion of your trackside colleagues that come from other motorsport categories ? Thanks !|Great - I look forward to working with you, or competing against you in the future!
 |That's a tough one. I wouldn't say trackside experience, per se, is very highly desired for trackside roles, but rather a demonstration of the deep technical/operational knowledge, the ability to deal with stress, etc. that makes people successful in those roles.
 |For this reason, I would say it's better to be in an F1 team and then attempt to try and go trackside, than to be trackside in a 'lower' formula.
 |The data, from my experience, suggests the same, the vast majority of engineers are in F1 first and then go trackside, rather than being trackside outside of F1 and moving to be trackside in F1.
 |That is not to say that experience in 'lower' formulae is not immensely useful to securing a job in F1 (just, I believe less preferred than F1 experience).
[deleted]|We have - and not just sports too.
 |We have met with data scientists from football teams, coaches from the Olympics, rugby teams and professional cyclists - as well as many engineers and drivers from other motorsport series.
 |We also try and keep learning by working with partners or contacts across the military and commercial fields also.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Can you expand on the military part?|Only at a high level, I'm afraid - as I wouldn't want to give anything away to others.
 |One area that I can talk about is that many teams will use military or ex-military experts to coach/train/share ideas with their personnel as there is a lot of overlap (as there is with many commercial fields also). So, for example, the military practice high quality communications on a regular basis, in highly stressful/pressured situations - that's an area where many teams have worked with ex-RAF personnel, for example, to share best practice, to coach and teach personnel and to improve processes.
Hi Randy My question is, if there's for example safety car deployed and the decision whether pit or not have to be made quickly, can the race engineer and the driver make a decision without asking you?|They *can* but they *shouldn't* and I can't think of an occasion when they have.
 |Strategy decisions are made by the strategy team (not necessarily by me) and we have processes in place for making decisions where we have lots of time (normally measured in minutes), down to decisions where we may have 2 or 3 seconds to decide what to do for both cars and execute the communications/actions to do it.
 |Sometimes we may pre-make the decision and sometimes we have to make it on the fly or override our original intent - the thing about safety cars is that the cause of them can often change your variables/strategy.
Can you speak on how the sport has changed in the past few years in aspect to big data. How has data gathering and manipulation changed the sport? Specifically when it comes to making decisions based on past and current strategies. What kind of software and hardware have made the biggest changes, and how do you see the future of F1 benefit from AI/Big-data? Thanks for any info you may be able to share.|McLaren have always been data-driven, so things haven't changed too much recently. We are finding better ways to analyse the data we have and to draw insights from it. I'm afraid I can't say too much more.
Why is it that you still see signs being held out to the drivers at the pit wall? Surely there can’t be anything said on these signs which can’t be said over the car radio? There’s gonna be a simple answer id imagine. I’ve always thought that it would be hard to try read a sign while travelling at 200 mph?|It happens so rarely nowadays but the radio can fail, so the pitboards are a backup for that. The drivers should always give them a look as they go past (and they rarely do!) in case the radio has failed.
 |In the current times, where radio is public to other teams they could also be used as a way of passing coded messages, but we do watch them and that doesn't seem to be the case.
Hey Randy! Big fan of your work last season! My question is: Other than focusing on optimising strategy through the various instruments you have for every next race, what portion of your work is dedicated to improving the tools you have to work out strategies, or developing new technologies and methods? Is this something done consistently or over the winter? And lastly, how much does McLaren Applied work with you in using the newer tools in their work? Thanks :)|Thank you.
 |With how busy the season is, often it is difficult to spend too much time doing development in the season, so big projects are typically tackled over the Winter period between seasons (although this is also getting compressed).
 |However, we are constantly, both in race weekends and between, developing our analysis techniques, smaller pieces of software, our understanding of competitors' behaviours, etc. so there is a constant ongoing development battle.
 |We do work with McLaren Applied fairly frequently across the business - we're not currently doing that on strategy projects.
^(the below question has been split into two, enumerated)|
Hi, thanks for doing this AMA! I've spent a lot of time reading your answers!I don't know if you'll answer this too but I'll try asking something anyway 1. What are the possible roles that a computer science graduate could cover?|Hi! If you wanted to be very computer science focused, I guess software engineering, IT and some of the compute type roles would be interesting. If you're willing to pick up engineering knowledge then things like Vehicle Science modelling and CFD can open up too.
 |2. What are the main languages/frameworks used in the F1 enviroment?|I think it varies. I'd be surprised if most aren't moving to modern/web technologies, if there isn't an undercurrent of .NET and Python at most places and some things in MATLAB, C++, punchcard, etc.
 |3. Are you worried about Daniel coming next year? I mean, probably it will be hard not to laugh for the entire week-end when he's with Lando! Thanks in advance, *totally not a computer science student.*|I laugh at anything, so yes I am very worried. Haha!
Hi Randeep, first of all, thanks for your deep insights into the world of Formula 1 and McLaren. My question to you is, how do McLaren (or any other F1 team for that matter) ensure a stable electrical power supply in the case of a loss of normal power supply (Diesel Generators/UPS/battery banks) at both the factory and less likely to occur but still possible, at the track? Bonus question; how do teams (McLaren) prepare for different types of electrical outlets, voltages and currents all around the world?|To start - I’ll say I’m not an electrician - take the below with a pinch of salt.
 |Most teams will have generators at the track (actually various kinds - to run stuff on the grid, in the trucks at European events and external ones at fly away races) and some kind of UPS system as well. Power supplies at circuits can be ‘temperamental’ and often there are power outages for specific reasons too.
 |In terms of for electrical outlets - we as end users just bring our UK stuff and plug it in! There’s an electrician and IT team who ensure that everything is set up and good to go and sneak with different voltage, phase, etc. supplies.
How did it feel to be part of mclaren last year? Like it has been in an incredible year with outstanding results.|I have to say, I have enjoyed every year at McLaren and I started in 2015 when the results weren't outstanding - I am working with really awesome people and even through the bad times it is great to see the team spirit that pervades through everyone.
 |Last year was incredible and it's good to get an upswing in performance and to see teammates celebrating the thick after making it through the thin!
Who won the bet where Lando had to have ur face as his lock screen till Abu Dhabi last year?|Lando won the bet, but he also clearly has no shame. 😃"

JMU has a masters MBA degree I could get but CNU doesn’t offer a masters degree for my major which is the only downside I have with CNU. My boyfriend is going there and the campus is beautiful. I guess those are the main reasons I wanted to go to CNU and because it’s known for making closer bonds with the people on campus than JMU due to the difference in size. I heard JMU has a better employment status than CNU because CNU has a habit of keeping itself local and the companies near JMU are more promising financially.

I have novice IT experience and no certifications. I did however had 2 internships prior but focused more on project management and rudimentary IT tech skills (cable management, documentation, factory resets). I do plan on inquiring for Cisco’s CCNA and perhaps Azure certs (since the company I’ll be working for have numerous projects expansion that pertains to prem infrastructure to cloud based).

Honestly It’s almost too good to be true, especially of how difficult the market is today. During the salary negotiations with the managers, they immediately asked me of what’s my “number?” I was not expecting this question from them and with the lack of preparation on researching the current market for this position, I said 40k. One of the manager said I’m pinning myself and shooting myself in the foot. After conferring about knowing your worth and value, they decided to step out of the conference room huddled for about 10 mins. Afterwards, they all came in and one of the managers said “how would you like to start on Monday and we can do 45k.” I was beyond shell shocked. For someone who’s been making less than 40k for the past 6 years (in a different job sector), I really felt like it’s too good to be true, so without hesitation I said yes and I’ll be starting this Monday. 

I have a few questions in mind. After speaking to them about value and knowing my worth and for someone who doesn’t have solid IT experience, how can I assure myself that I am worth that salary? After doing research they placed me in the median salary for “IT Support” positions, referenced through glass door. With that salary value, I feel like there’s a lot of expectations from the get-go which I’m open and I welcome the journey. But I’m a bit worried about not exceeding their expectations. I did ask about how they go about their performance evaluations and type of insights they pick on to acknowledge my competence, and one of the managers said to me that “we play it by ear and we’re gonna look to see which milestone you choose based on our expectations.” That worries me because they have laid out some of the job competencies on top of their current projects, I just think that it’s not structured enough? I’m the only internal IT personnel aside from the manager, that said I’m anticipating a lot of work/responsibilities/stress and most likely be a “multiple hat” personnel. But I would like to know your guys’ opinion. What do you guys think? Do you think it’s a right start salary wise? Perhaps I should’ve asked what their current budget for this position and yes, I damn well undervalued myself because I thought I was being reasonable based on my experience. But then again I don’t know maybe they are getting a bang for their buck which I have no qualms with. I’m still overwhelmed from this situation sorry in advance if I didn’t articulate myself well.

I’ve been a long time lurker here, this subreddit have been resourceful and encouraging. I want to say thank you all."

Im a rising junior studying computer science at a public university. I am pretty unsure how the future of education will be like in the next few years, and due to these uncertainties I will be staying home during the school year, as my classes will be online regardless. 

I feel like during this fall quarter I will have a lot of free time and I want to use this to further my career, since I will just be at home. I have applied to internships for this summer(I started applying around last fall), but I didn't have any luck, and the pandemic just crushed all small chances I had. I wondering what I could possibly due during the next year or so. Somethings I am interested in are web app development, IOS programming, and computer security, and cloud computing. 

What should I be doing to gain experience? Finding an internship has proven to be quite difficult, however if anyone has any tips on what I should be doing to raise my chances of getting an internship, or even getting to the next stage in the interview process, that would be greatly appreciated.

I am really just trying to be prepared for when I graduate and need to find a legit job. I also need some income right now to pay for school, so I really am trying to get an internship that could help me pay and save up some money too, as I want to start setting my self for financial independence as soon as possible."
i0xmzf,18,2020-07-30,"Fuck what the law says, ignorance IS an excuse!",GypsyGold,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/i0xmzf/fuck_what_the_law_says_ignorance_is_an_excuse/,"#**Background:**

I am originally from Arizona. My mother remarried when I was 18 and still in high school - she had some mental issues that stemmed from long-term loneliness, so it actually didn't suprise me when she ended up marrying some guy from work after just a single week of dating. They got married without me ever officially meeting the guy.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyhow, one day (shortly after the marriage) during my senior year of high school I came home to find that my house had been sold, and my mom was moving out. She had an eviction notice from the bank, as it turns out my mother was going to lose the house, so the marriage was a way of her getting a safety net.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, I was told by my mother's new husband that I was an adult, and needed to start fending for myself. I was not allowed to move in with them (even though they had a guest room), and had to pack a bag, grab my dog, and go...to school.

&amp;nbsp;

I mean, I had class the next morning. I went to my wrestling coach with my issue and he allowed me to live with his family. When season ended I got a job, my own apt, and eventually a car. I was an honor roll student my entire life, but that last semester I failed all my classes because I had to work. I shouldn't have graduated, but the school principal ordered all my teachers to give me a C due to my situation...I had A's &amp; B's in their classes the previous semester, so they were happy to do it.

&amp;nbsp;

I worked three jobs at a time trying to support myself and also put myself through school. Community college was only 900 bucks a semester, but that was hard as heck to save - given I was working for $5.25 an hour minimum wage. But, I did it...

&amp;nbsp;

I competed in NJCAA Football and Wrestling, eventually earning All-American honors in both. This led to a wrestling scholarship to a DII school. The scholarship was just enough so that if I maxed out my student loans, tuition was paid for. This school was in California so I had to move. 

 &amp;nbsp;

This started the next chapter of my life as a broke college student who lived out of my car, and would usually walk around with less than $100 dollars to my name. It was the sacrifice I chose to make in order to get my education, as the athletic schedule kept me from holding a job, so what money I did have came from working at a labor staffing agency on the weekends. You'd get like 50 bucks for roofing, drywall deconstruction, or digging ditches. 

 &amp;nbsp;

It was rough, but I don't think I minded it too much - I was just happy to be consistently moving forward with my life.

#**The Rant:**

I kept in contact w/ my mother. She had her various mental breakdowns here and there, but I always hoped she would eventually revert back to normal. Anyhow, when she found out that I was living in my car she insisted on paying for my car insurance. She knew that I frequently ran out of money, and she didn't want me to lose my ""home.""

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to travel back to Arizona to spend the Holidays with her. She had told me that she had cleared this with her husband, but I guess she actually hadn't. Because when he found out, he threw a huge fit and eventually cancelled my car insurance.

&amp;nbsp;

I was commuting through Vegas at the time, when I received a call from GEICO wanting to know why I had cancelled my insurance. I had enough money at the time, so I actually paid for it myself and got my insurance back. I asked for clarification if everything was ok, and if I was good to continue driving, and the sales rep said that it was.

&amp;nbsp;

Later that night while I'm somewhere in between Henderson and The Hoover Dam I get pulled over by a police car for not having any insurance. I explained to him the situation, and he confirmed that I did indeed have insurance. Unfortunately for me, the DMV had already suspended my license plate. Not my driver's license, but my actual license plate. They also suspended my registration.

&amp;nbsp;

The police officer informed me that even though I was without insurance for less than an hour, since GEICO reported it to the DMV, the wheels were already set in motion. In fact, after checking the time of expiration, it was revealed that by the time the DMV had processed the suspension, I had already purchased back my insurance.

&amp;nbsp;

I asked the police officer how on earth I was expected to know this. He claimed that when the DMV processed the suspension they automatically issued a letter to the address on my license informing me of the suspension, and that I should receive it in 3-5 business days. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I asked again, how on Earth was I expected to know my license plate was suspended, I had asked the GEICO rep if I was good to go, and he said yes. The officer told me that the GEICO rep had no way of knowing my license plate was suspended...and that there was no way of me knowing that it had been suspended either, not until I received the letter.

&amp;nbsp;

So I clarified that I indeed had insurance, and that I should be legal to drive, but because the DMV had already suspended my license plate I was in fact not legal to drive...even though it was absolutely impossible for me to know that my plate was suspended. He confirmed that was indeed the truth. He said that in order to get my license plate and registration reinstated all I'd have to do was visit the Arizona DMV and show them my insurance card. It wouldn't cost any money, it would take about 10 minutes to do, and the closest AZ DMV was in Kingman about a hundred miles up the road.

&amp;nbsp;

So I told him that I would drive to Kingman, go to the DMV, and get everything straightened out. The officer told me that wasn't possible, because he needed to tow my car.

&amp;nbsp;

I asked him how that was fair, and he stated that it wasn't fair. But in the eyes of the law ignorance is no excuse and he has to do his job. 

&amp;nbsp;

We were on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. No street lights, no stores...nothing but dirt. I asked him what was I to do? He said I should call someone to come pick me up. I explained that I didn't live in Nevada, I didn't know a single soul in the entire state. That I only had about 200 bucks on me, which was gas money to get to Phoenix. On top of that my phone was dead.

&amp;nbsp;

The cop stated that he was authorize to get me off the dark road due to it being a hazard, and he could drive me to the nearest populated area, which was The Railroad Pass Hotel &amp; Casino.

&amp;nbsp;

So they tow my car to a lot in Henderson, while the cop drops me off at the Railroad Pass Casino, and now I'm stuck. This casino was by itself in the middle of the desert. There was nothing else around. There were no sidewalks or neighborhoods nearby. Just the Casino and the highway...which was dark without any lighting. So I couldn't even walk to the next town. I was thoroughly stranded.

&amp;nbsp;

So I walk into the hotel lobby and search for an outlet to charge my phone. I find one, but security immediately stops me. I explain to them my situation, and they state that unless I'm staying in the hotel or making purchases I have to leave. I ask them to let me charge my phone for at least ten minutes, as it's completely dead. Nope, apparently I'm trespassing - so I have to leave.

&amp;nbsp;

They walk me out to the parking lot, and want to know where my car is. I told them that I don't have one, but they claim that there is no way for me to get their without a car. There aren't even any busses that stop at that casino. I explained my story again, and they still don't believe it. They think I'm a homeless hitchhiker. They claim that if I don't leave they'll call the police, to which I reply, ""please do.""

&amp;nbsp;

They leave, and I'm stuck in the parking lot asking people if I can borrow their phone. Eventually the police do indeed come, and I explained to them my situation. They arrest me for trespassing, cuff me, and take me to Boulder City where I spend the night in a jail cell. 

&amp;nbsp;

The next morning the police verify my story, and the same officer who pulled me over offers me a ride to Henderson so I can get my car. No trespassing charges are actually filed, and when I get to Henderson the officer authorizes the release of my vehicle. He tells me to drive carefully, because I could get pulled over again by a different officer.

&amp;nbsp;

Two hours later I make it to the Kingman DMV, and in about 5 minutes they reinstate my license plate and registration. I go ahead and drive to my mother's house for Christmas, only to be given gas money from my step-dad and told to drive home.

&amp;nbsp;

That same night, I'm back in Boulder City and I'm pulled over by the same police officer. He had no reason for pulling me over other than it's suspicious that I'm still in the area. I explained to him my situation, and he apologizes to me for the hell I've been through. He lets me know that the impound lot will NOT be charging me for the tow, and offers to buy me dinner at, of all places, The Railroad Pass Casino. I politely decline and make my way back to California.

&amp;nbsp;

Now here is where life really begins to suck. The tickets I received for ""displaying false plates"" and ""providing suspended registration"" equates to about 7 thousand dollars. Which I obviously cannot pay. My driver's license is suspended shortly afterwards. I'm forced to drive carefully from then on out, basically parking and never moving. But eventually a warrant is issued for my arrest due to failure to pay. My car is towed one night (it was parked) and I lose my ""home.""

&amp;nbsp;

Luckily I was able to move in with my girlfriend, and after the police realize I have no money to pay them the arrest warrant is rescinded. I eventually graduate college, and get a job working in San Francisco tech. Lucky for me I don't need to drive anywhere. Everything is in walking distance.

&amp;nbsp;

Ironically enough, I got my job in tech partly due to this debt. You see, I actually wanted to become a police officer, and one of the degrees that I received was in Criminal Justice. I actually interned for two years at the police department while finishing up school. Following my graduation, I was denied entry into the police academy until all of my outstanding traffic tickets were paid.

&amp;nbsp;

I picked up a paid internship at a gaming company, that eventually turned into a full time gig. That's since morphed into various different jobs over the years, but all pretty cool. My intention was to save enough money to eventually pay off the ticket and enter the academy...but I've since become very jaded when it comes to the ""system"", so I ultimately just decided to stay in the Silicon Valley tech industry instead.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought the blunt of this entire debacle was mostly behind me, but recently I tried to marry my girlfriend of one year, but, I was denied my marriage license because I need to pay the tickets. Which w/ interest has ballooned to over $12,000 dollars. Which is about half of my current savings.

&amp;nbsp;

I've taken a semi-rigorous course load (I changed majors, so I'm a few semesters behind where I'd otherwise be), that will amount to roughly eight senior/graduate math electives, and two graduate CS courses beyond the standard degree requirements.  My math courses include a graduate algebra course, linear algebra 2, analysis (3 semesters vs 1 semester required), topology, differential geometry, combinatorics, grad quantum computing/info theory, two mathematical statistics courses, grad representation theory/integrable probability, and whatever I take in the spring.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done two summer internships with NASA with a small publication, although it's a far cry from math research.  I won't be able to take the subject GRE, but got a 162V/170Q/5.0AWA on the general.  Do I have any shot of admission to a top 30 masters or PhD program in mathematics?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm particularly concerned with how the PhD application cycle will run when many people can't get subject GRE scores.  How important are those?

&amp;#x200B;

On a related note, would I stand a chance at admission to a physics graduate program if I have had exposure to quantum mechanics and differential geometry?  I am interested in schools that are doing research in quantum computing and information theory, but a lot of these schools house the quantum computing research in the physics department.  I obviously won't be able to get an undergraduate physics education in a year, but I think my math background should translate into physics."

I hope yall are doing well. I've recently been getting into programming as a high school student. I started with some Java, but I found that somewhat hard to understand. So, I've settled onto HTML, CSS, JS, and web development of that sort and I find it to be really cool! But the question I have is: if I want to pursue a career as a programmer when I'm older do I need to really learn all of these languages and frameworks right now so I'm ahead in the future (I want to land a summer internship as well). I'm scared that if I learn it all now, I'll forget everything. As a student taking lots of APs, I really won't have a ton of time to practice these skills. I know practice is vital to learning things, especially programming. Will learning things now help me in places like college and the workplace?"

The first is a one year masters in computer  science at a top 3 UK uni. It is designed for graduates of a maths background with little to no cs knowledge (a conversion masters).

The second is a one year higher diploma in software engineering at my bachelor's college (no-name University). It pairs with applicant with a company (companies include Cisco, Accenture, Avaya, etc.) after a panel interview. The company trains the student in their stack while the student attends their diploma's lectures and does assignments. It teaches languages, databases operating systems, etc. It ends with a 3 month work placement as a software engineer at the sponsor company.

Basically the first choice is a super prestigious uni but I would be applying to jobs with no engineering internship. The second is my old no-name college but I would still learn all the programming stuff and have a 3 month software engineering internship. Any ideas?"

I’m in a internship in a prestigious marketing company. I already have another possession charge in process. 

I don’t have the energy to type out all the frustrations I’ve had with my father, life, and success. I’ve just finally been able to put some of my life together. I finally feel some sense of confidence because of the healthy habits like daily meditation for an entire hour a day and exercise and because of it I’ve been driving harder in my career goals.

I barely knew this girl and was from tinder but it was going well and we even almost kissed. It was one of the only actually good nights I’ve had in a long long time. I don’t go out anywhere. All my friends moved away.

I know it’s not a big deal to lose the girl but for some reason it hurt like hell when she wanted to be taken home by police instead of me. 

I didn’t do anything wrong. We got pulled over because we were playing Pokémon GO together. The officer pulled me over and asked me what I was doing and then said he smelled marijuana and it was all over from there. No jail thank god, but fucking still. I don’t deserve this. I’m not a criminal. I try so so hard to keep other people’s feelings considered and to feel special. I go out of my way to do that because I don’t want anyone to feel the same kind of pain that I feel.

I don’t know about you guys but I think it’s time for me to go. The world is not very bright right now, and nothing goes right for me. It’s always one after the other something extremely disappointing happens to me and even after everything it’s not enough. I’ll never be enough. I’m getting ahead of myself. I can’t believe I just did this. I’m so fucking embarrassing. Please just make it stop. Just make it stop, that’s all I want. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to help people."

I'm an intern sysadmin at a huge company and I was doing my routine remote support session with a user, repairing Cisco AnyConnect client after a failed update. 
As usual, before doing anything, I've created a system restore point. Was following usual procedures, but the problem wasn't solved, in fact, it worsened. Started having problems with secure token being not recognized by our corporate authenticator, reinstallations didn't work. Decided to screw it and revert to restore point created before. Unfortunately,15 minutes after I've lost connection to the users PC (restoring and rebooting) I get a phone call from him - we have a black screen with a cursor on it. Impossible to troubleshoot such a scenario via a phone call (at least for me). 

TLDR. Tried to revert to restore point and got a failed system. Thank God all data was still intact. Had to revert one time before with another user and everything went smooth. 
Wanted to hear your experience - how problematic restoring can be? Maybe you have some tips on how to correctly create restore points (quit certain programs, etc)? 
Any info much appreciated."

I considered applying for a role elsewhere however they all seem to be 3 or 5+ years experience . A company I applied for was very interested in my 'proficient' technologies , first Interview went well but they want someone with more years of experience and would be a good fit for a junior role if it comes up . 

So basically new roles want more years of experience and my current position I get good exposure to alot but I find  my team are too busy with Kubernetes to look at my work and if I pass it through my team it's just a fight with engineering since they hate change . 

Any advice  guys , do I apply somewhere else or stay where I am . Also what things to learn ( I'm Aws certified and have my CKAD booked in a few months) , any community based projects / forums or anything to set me apart or am I eternally doomed to be judged by my age :(

I don't want to be rude, but also know I should assert myself in a respectful, but firm way about this. I don't want to continue working here after this, but don't want to hamper their ability to be successful. How should I approach this?**

I'm the sole *full-time* software engineer (and currently an intern) at a very small startup; the co-founder is technical but not full-time. The internship only lasts this summer, and my contract stipulates that it's an 8 week long affair. If it's relevant, I'm considered an independent contractor, not an employee, for my work.

This is technically the last day of the internship, but the founder is still talking to me about doing meetings and work next week. She doesn't seem to know/remember that the internship is only 8 weeks long. I feel kinda weird bringing this up because I don't want to throw a wrench in her plans or put her/her co-founder in the lurch, but I really need to focus on preparing to return to school and just figure out my life right now. Also, I'm paid hourly and don't think it's right to work for free (unless it's on some OSS/personal project I care about).

For all of the work that I've done, I did a good job of thoroughly documenting everything (and shared this documentation with them), but there are some small development environment issues I am trying to fix before I leave.

I've been offered the opportunity to become an FTE at this place after finishing school, but in my current situation, I feel like it doesn't make financial sense to start out here after graduation, and I don't plan to. I have really enjoyed the learning experiences that came from this internship, but I'm ready to move on to something else. They have provided me with value, and I have provided them with value in turn by fixing bugs in their product, redesigning the UI, and documenting a lot of software architecture.

However, I don't want to be the person that just says, ""We have a contract, and our business relationship is finished now unless we write up a new contract,"" and then just ghost. Though I could legally do that, I feel like it'd put them in a bad spot, and I want them to succeed. However, I also don't want to work for this place anymore, not even during the semester.

What should I do?"

And between my undergrad and master, I intend to take a gap year where I want to do two 6-months internships in Software Engineer.

While I understand how to prepare for the interviews (leetcode, cracking the coding interview ...), I want to start doing projects that a SWE can encounter in his work. So what kind of projects can I do to prepare for the internships ? Do you have some ressources to advice ?

Thanks!"

I have struggled with academics my entire college career, and this is mostly due to mental health issues combined with a lack of discipline. The classes I have completed so far in college have only been in C++ and I have no experience in any other languages. I want to self-teach myself more languages so I can get working on some personal projects but I just don't know where to start. I know I screwed myself over by not putting in the work I should've throughout college, and it is biting my ass now. I also do not have any internship experience that is related to software programming. Networking was difficult for me because of my social anxiety. I know these all sound like excuses, and maybe they are, but they've been affecting me. My self-esteem is shot way down as I see all my peers excelling in school and getting these great internships. At this point it really feels like I am a lost cause and there is no hope for my future. I can't even tell anyone about these struggles because I am embarrassed.

If anyone has any tips on what I can do to improve my skills or prospects in the job search, they would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I recently graduated with a B.S in Comp Sci and have been job hunting since before the pandemic started without much traction. I've gotten a couple of interviews and made it to the final round right before the company in question implemented a hiring freeze.

Unfortunately I know that my biggest hurdle is the fact that I do not have previous internship experience, so I tried to supplement that with various side projects while being a full-time student

## My background and what I want to shoot for

Currently I am looking to be a Backend Web Developer. I have built projects in Node.js using both Serverless/Express in Javascript/Typescript and I'm experienced in building in the AWS enviroment. However after nearly 8 months of job searching, I am pretty much open to anything that can get my foot in the door.

I am also well-versed in applications of Deep Learning and tuning neural networks/data manipulation for training sets, but that is more for my own interests rather than a career endeavor. (Although it might be brownie points if a company is AI focused)

Any and all help is appreciated, be as brutal as possible! Thanks!

Let me preface this by saying that I am a 2nd computer science major going on to 3rd year and thus far in my academic career I have been loving all of the classes that I have been taking. But I can't help but read about all the stuff that is expected to be done outside of class.

1) For example, the only language that I have been working with in school is C++ and I've been reading about others who know at least 4 programming languages like Java, Javascript, PHP etc. 

2) I've read about doing projects outside of class. While I do have a project in mind that interests me, I don't know if I can build something that employers would see as useful with the knowledge I have so far.

3) There are so many careers related to CS that I don't know which ones I'm actually qualified for. I was looking at software engineer, web developer, database administrator. Will I have enough knowledge from my CS degree to do any of these jobs or any of the other CS related jobs?

4) I haven't done any internships so far and with the pandemic going on, this might hamper my internship opportunities. Am I screwed?

i1ehy0,46,2020-07-31,I was offered my dream job! Here was my experience job-hunting after graduating during the pandemic. AMA.,i-choose-science,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/i1ehy0/i_was_offered_my_dream_job_here_was_my_experience/,"I cannot express how relieved I feel. I've been seeking a job since January of this year... I just secured my dream job less than 48 hours after the phone screening - 7 months after starting my search. I had so many doubts about myself along the way (lots of imposter syndrome) and was told by recruiters that my goals and salary range were unattainable. 

Here's a summary of what I went through in the past months:

&amp;#x200B;

December 2019 -

* Realized I'd graduate in May 2020 instead of December 2020. I was no longer applicable for any of the summer internships I applied for.
* Was declined by an automotive company for graduating in May instead of December.

&amp;#x200B;

January 2020 -

* Began searching for post-grad jobs.
* Was welcomed back by a manufacturer for another semester of interning. Two weeks in, realized they only had intentions of giving me mundane office work.
* Stopped searching for post-grad jobs and began looking for a new internship.

&amp;#x200B;

February 2020 - 

* Started an internship at an environmental consulting firm with the verbal agreement of full-time starting at 60k upon graduation.
* Restarted the post-grad job hunt.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2020 -

* COVID hit. Continued the consulting internship from home. 
* Was told there would no longer be a job at the consulting firm in my city. 
* Continued job-hunting and applied to 5+ a day.
* Last day on campus, ran into a faculty member who offered to provide me local contacts. Connected me with a principal manager at a global automotive company, but no jobs were available.

&amp;#x200B;

April 2020 - 

* Every single job I had applied for seemingly had a hiring freeze. 
* Had a great phone screen with a CAD company and was scheduled for an interview, then received an email saying they had replaced my spot with another candidate.

&amp;#x200B;

May 2020 - 

* Received an interview with a research company I have been working for for a year. Several referrals and great 7-hour interview.
* Global automotive company had job postings - I applied and received referrals.
* Continued with my consulting internship indefinitely and manager helped me attain an interview for full-time in a different city.
* Contacted AeroTek for recruiting help. Was told not to expect anymore than 60k compensation and that my expectations were pushing employers away.

&amp;#x200B;

June 2020 - 

* Was told the research position was going to be given to an internal candidate, even though I was also an internal candidate.
* First offer: full-time consultant in another state for 70k. No negotiation needed. Remote work until October. 
* Accepted offer in the hope to buy time to continue to the job search in my city.
* Still applying to 5+ jobs a day.

&amp;#x200B;

July 2020 -

* Received an interview at a local supplier. 
* Received two rounds of interviews for a nuclear company in another state.
* Last week of July: 
   * Received an offer from the nuclear company for 67k on Monday.
   * Received an offer from the supplier for 73k on Tuesday. 
   * Asked for 73k-75k from the nuclear company on Tuesday. 
   * Received a new offer of 70k+5k sign-on bonus+relocation from the nuclear company on Wednesday.
   * Also received a call from HR for the global automotive company on Wednesday. Had an hour long phone screen.
   * Had a 2-hour interview with the automotive company on Friday. 30 minutes later, received a call with an offer - less than 48 hours after the phone screen!

&amp;#x200B;

The position at the automotive company is a two-year rotational program, followed by a guaranteed job... and they own the first automotive company that declined me back in December. I knew as soon as I applied that I would love it, but after three months of hearing nothing, I thought my chances were gone. It's an amazing program and I still have to wait for their offer to come in, but based on my research and connections, I have no doubt I'll accept it - and possibility try to negotiate. 

I used a ton of job sites, recruiting companies, LinkedIn networking and referrals over the past few months and learned more than I can think of to post here. If I can help anyone with specific questions, please ask!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
Dear Randy, I would like to ask what is your opinion concerning driver's influence on development of the car. And are there any big differences between the driver's feedbacks? Which driver was the best one you have been working with during those 5 years, concerning the feedback? Thanks in advance for your answer.|Driver feedback has a big influence on the development of the car, after all, if the driver can't exploit upgrades/developments/the car then you won't see any laptime gains - nobody else is in the car and so this feedback is vital. However, it is part of a multitude of tools, experience, analysis, etc. that we have, so you can't underestimate the other contributors to development also.
 |All of the drivers I have worked with have been quite different in terms of their feedback, I don't think I can pick a best one as they all have great qualities, Fernando seemed to instantly know what was wrong/where to improve, Lando is very open and easy to talk to, etc.
Hi Randy!! I wanted to ask you how hard is predict the degradation and overall performance of this generation Pirelli tyres. Also, are you excited for the new rules? I was also wondering how international the McLaren team really is in terms of staff. Thank you!!!|I would say it's not super difficult in the current generation of tyres to predict degradation and overall performance - this is done by our tyre experts and the strategy team together. Things change, however, through the weekend and sometimes you have to be very much into the empirical data to spot shifts in behaviour because of this.
 |I am excited for the new rules - change keeps us on our toes and presents opportunities. Even though I thought single-shot qualifying was a bad idea before we implemented it, it presented an opportunity to really adapt your strategy in qualifying to take advantage - as an example of these opportunities.
 |The team is really quite international, thinking about the people I work with on a regular basis, most are from the UK, but they also include Italian, Japanese, French, Spanish and German as nationalities.
Can we get McLaren's Tooned back? Next year with Lando and Dan Ric would be fun!|I've already asked a few times. I love Tooned!
Very broad question, but what are your thoughts on simracing and how seriously some team/people take it?|I think simracing is a great thing, especially with the relative ease of access (cost and location issues) compared to typical motorsport. There is some mounting evidence of a correlation between simracing and physical racing talent as well.
 |I'm impressed by how seriously some people take it and how good they are - I think it can also be quite addictive - there's a guy in our team Oli who plays pretty much all the time, we think by next week he'll be able to complete a full lap of one of the easier circuits.
Is AI (by which I mean applied neural networks) making inroads into how strategy calls are made in F1? It seems like it could be super useful for analysing how and when the tyres are going to degrade.|It is. I am a strong proponent of machine learning and artificial intelligence and we are getting some good benefits in this area. I can't say more.
How often do you pick a strategy that is not the fastest (by the models), but is counter to the other team(s) that you are trying to beat that race?|If you are referring to the ""free air"" quickest strategy - i.e. if I was racing alone, how many pitstops should I do and what tyre sequence should I use then we will almost always not use that strategy.
 |That strategy would be quickest if you have no other interactions with other cars, which is rare for any car in an F1 race - as you have interactions from battling/overtakes, lapping, etc. but it is not the best strategy (and potentially not the quickest) when interactions with other cars are present.
 |Depending on the types of interactions there will be a force that acts on the ""baseline"" strategy mentioned above, the propensity to drop into traffic, for example, may push a stop lap later to avoid getting stuck or battling, etc. But all of these will need to be weighed up to come up with an ""optimum"" strategy.
Ok, so one thing bothered me for a while now. In many races we see sudden safety cars or double yellows. More often than not, the commentators turn this into a ""everyone has to decide real quickly what to do now"" situation. Do you really decide just then whether or not to pit a car? If yes, why? I imagine you could easily run multiple real-time simulations that tell you at every given moment with a high precision whether pitting is beneficial or not. Is that not possible or is it just the commentators playing up the situation?|Really both things are correct. We try and simulate and analyse what to do in the future, even as humans, every second of the race we'll be thinking what we would do if there were a safety car, probing each other in the strategy team to test our strategies and so on, so in a way we are trying to be prepared before the safety car is deployed, if it is.
 |However, safety cars can be quite disruptive, depending on who has crashed or what has caused it, etc. your simulations and prior analysis may no longer be useful because the race state has changed too much. In this case you operate from first principles and (hopefully) a deep understanding of the key factors in the race that would sway decisions one way or another.
 |Safety car decisions are also very game theoretic which can make things more difficult as you typically won't know your competitors' decisions until some time after the safety car is deployed, reducing your time down even further.
Hey Randy! I am a big F1 fan and am very interested in what is one thing you hate about being F1? Could be anything just curious since I am not planning to do anything related with F1 (want to become a coder) but want to know something you dislike about being/doing/involved in F1. Also I know that you already answered something like this but are you going to miss the Carlos/Lando memelord group? Also what are you expecting Riccardo to bring in the meme side. I like to focus on the silly things about F1 hehe.|I think the one thing I do dislike about F1 is that more people can't be involved in it. I'm so fortunate to work with our young, extremely talented and proactive graduates, intern students and placement students but my role means I am also responsible for turning away swathes of talent as we have such a limited number of roles.
 |It's not fair that we are turning away people who are far more talented and would have far more positive impact than, for example, myself and it can be quite upsetting. However, as the sport continues to grow and prosper I'm sure there will be many more opportunities coming up.
 |I will miss the Carlos/Lando pairing just as I miss the Stoffel/Fernando pairing and many of the others. I have been fortunate enough to work with some extremely talented and friendly drivers so in a way you miss every one and every pairing. On the other hand I'm sure it will be just as great, in a different way with Ricciardo - I'm looking forward to some bonza Aussie slang and pulling out the ""Chopper does the weather"" video each year!
hello. as a 16 year old student doing a levels what would u say helped u the most in terms of getting to the position u are in now? im intestered very much in working in f1 when i grow up and im looking to do mechanical engineering in uni. thank you|I would say that Maths, Further Maths and Physics helped and will help the most - especially in preparing you for engineering at university also.
 |If you have other subjects to choose as well, then I can also put in a word for doing what you enjoy as well as what you 'need'.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks for replying. Would you mind telling me what uni you went to aswell? Loads of choices to pick from and im unsure|I went to the University of Oxford. There's a very large mix of colleges and universities represented here and thinking about recent graduate hires we have talented people from UCL, University of Bath, University of Southampton, Cambridge University, University of Newcastle and many more.
Are there any members of the traveling team that have a business / not engineer background? Would love to work in F1, but being an economist does not help. Right?|Being an economist is not common and I don't know of anyone who is travelling who is an economist by background. But for reference I did Engineering, Economics &amp; Management with a fair amount of Economics and Econometrics. It's not impossible, but as long as you're smart, motivated and can pick up the engineering knowledge you have a shot.
Hi Randy, many thanks for taking the time to answer questions. I’ve snuck two questions into my post. How many people would typically work on strategy within an F1 team and would many of these be based in Brackley during race weekends? Are there any roles in your strategy team that are targeted at or suited to actuaries / risk modellers / mathematical modellers/ statisticians rather than engineers?|Around 3 to 6 would typical for a strategy team and normally teams will have 1 of the team trackside, the rest back at HQ. For clarity, none of our strategists *should* be working at Brackley (Mercedes) - if they are we will be having some difficult conversations!
 |I would say that strategy does lend itself to those backgrounds (I'm a part qualified actuary - I rejoined F1 before I finished my last few exams), as much as it does to engineering backgrounds (or maths, or stats, or physics, etc. etc.).
Just wanted to say I really appreciate you answering so many questions. What race of the (original) 2020 calendar did you most look forward to? And what is your approach when determining a strategy for a new F1 track, such as Zandvoort?|Both Vietnam and Netherlands GPs were very much up there, because of being new to the calendar. This always adds some extra challenge and can lead to more mixed performances compared to the baseline pace of each car/driver.
 |You tend to rely a lot on Friday data where you are more pressured than usual to learn as much as you possibly can as you've not run their before. There's also a fair amount of prediction and forecasting before you ever leave (as you have to pick tyres, etc.) and a lot more scenario analysis than normal (and there's a lot normally too). Most teams will have the tracks in their simulators and offline simulations weeks, if not months before the actual event as well.
What exactly does a CS do in F1? Asking for a friend|I think many roles could be applicable, but most teams will have fairly substantial Software Engineering departments, as well as lots of modelling and computation activities in Vehicle Science and CFD - all of these may be quite well suited.
Hi Randy. Are there routes to get into motorsport and F1 without the usual maths/engineering route; asking as someone who loves the though of F1 but was shit at DT and intends to study politics?|Based on some of the stories I had read before working in F1 it had seemed that a degree in politics may have been *the* way of surviving the 'Piranha Club' - however, that is not the case, thankfully.
 |It will depend on the kind of role, without gaining engineering knowledge or scientific knowledge you'd struggle to work in the core technical or operational areas but we have a finance department, planning department, HR department, etc. and there may be roles in those other areas that are more suitable.
I’m currently at uni studying Mech Eng to hopefully work in F1 some day, and applied for a summer placement at McLaren this year. Of course that’s been cancelled now, and I’m gutted, but am still hoping to be doing an undergraduate placement year in the 21/22 academic year. Ideally, a summer placement this summer would have been a way for me to get my foot in the door and add some much needed experience to my CV, but what would be your advice now, to make myself as appealing a candidate as possible in the decreasing amount of time I have until the application?|Try and find something else, that you enjoy and that is relevant if possible - go fix up an old car, do some formula student, learn a programming language, etc.
 |Nobody is as gutted as me that Covid is meaning we won't get to work with some very talented summer interns this year.
Hi, I'll go right to the point, I'm from Colombia and finishing my last year of Mechanical Engineer, I've worked as a Mechanic for 2 years and understand quite good vehicle dynamics, I'm good in mathematics and I like to code on python and Matlab, and I keep improving my English. Do you think I have an opportunity as an intern in any racing team? Data analytics, vehicle dynamics something, I just want to get in haha, cheers.|Don't rule yourself out. Many of us never thought we'd get our dream jobs in F1, many of us never thought we were smart or able enough and many of us probably feel like that even once we're in - especially for me, seeing all of the young talent applying for jobs each year. Perseverance is key - you're doing the right things.
 |*""No. Try not. Do or do not. There is no try."" - Yoda*
Hi Randy, thanks for the AMA! When do the drivers get the last word for a chosen strategy? Is it only in the race, is it before too, given they know the tracks? How the strategy team work alongside all the valuable input from the guys behind the wheels, so you could as a team be always certain about a given strategy? How much drivers and strategists disagree about something? Best of luck in July, I will be rooting for you guys. EDIT: Grammar.|Nearly always the strategy is decided by the strategy team, I can't really remember occasions where the driver or someone else has chosen the strategy. That doesn't mean that the drivers don't have input, before the weekend when we nominate tyres, during the weekend with feedback and during the race over the radio - but we let the experts in each area make decisions and so the strategy is driven by the strategy team.
 |There are sometimes disagreements, for example, we may think a 1 stop strategy is possible and the driver may think its not, like with all things we'll discuss it rationally and then decide what to do. Sometimes the driver is correct and the 1 stop is too slow to make it work and sometimes we are correct and the 1 stop is the right choice. We try and have the right expertise, skill and feedback coming into the strategy group such that we are correct most of the time (otherwise what is the point of having a strategy group).
 |Thank you!
This is probably way too late. Do you require a chemist/physicist, my credentials includes but not limited to growing up on Bruce McLaren road. How do you handle inter Strategy-team disputes when/if there is a split between differing choices of strategies. What would you consider to be your go to technique to settle these/bring the team back together after maybe choosing a strategy that it becomes quite clear later on that it was not the optimal choice?|Well done on having parents who chose to live on Bruce McLaren road - they're welcome to get in touch 😀 .
 |I'm assuming you mean disputes inside the strategy team at McLaren (intra? My Ancient Greek is a bit rusty.)?
 |I think we are fortunate to have very few disputes whatsoever (thinking about any kind of disagreement) - the team atmosphere is really great and we are all just quite honest with each other and open - if one of the team tells me that I made a mistake, or could have done something better then that's probably some of the most useful/trusted feedback I will ever get to get better. It's kind of a nice feeling knowing that you have to do everything really well, because some of the best people in your field work with you and will call you up if not - so you are constantly improving.
 |Sometimes we will disagree on stuff, there's a lot of data but a lot of things become subjective, as its a case of weighting some factors over other and the weightings can't always be determined. We may disagree sometimes on (mostly non-strategy) stuff and tend to just work out which underlying assumptions/beliefs/knowledge are different and align if we need to.
 |I think strategically we have very few disagreements - I can't really remember any. If one of the guys told me something could be better, I'd go away and try and work out how to improve it/avoid making the same mistake/ask them to help me fix or improve it, etc. so any disagreements we do have don't really linger.
Thanks for doing this AMA! Since most F1 teams are based in and around the UK, how often do teams hire Canadians/Americans for intern level or full-time engineering roles? P.S I am currently a Canadian software engineering student in Montreal working towards a career in F1 someday.|I would say it's fairly rare, but I think a lot of that will be based on volume of applications, we get a lot and from memory they are largely non-US/Canadian.
 |For some internships and placements we require the right to work in the UK which may also be more difficult for Americans/Canadians to achieve - unfortunately this is because we are quite limited in what we can do in this space.
 |For other roles, including full-time roles it shouldn't be a detriment to your application - especially not if you are able to address it as well in your cover letter.
F1 never stops, obviously, but are there any cities or circuits that you especially enjoy visiting because of the facilities or culture, rather than the racing?|In terms of cities, it's so hard to pick just one, we are fortunate enough to travel to some amazing places.
 |I have to say that Melbourne (Australia), Suzuka (Japan) and Austin (United States) have to definitely be up there though! But there are so many others that are up there too.
Is Hamilton really that good or is it the car? Would he be as good if he was in, say, a McLaren?|I think the evidence stacks up to say that Hamilton really is that good. I imagine he would be as able in a McLaren, but we have to admit that our car isn't yet as quick as his car - but don't worry we're working on it and going in the right direction!
How many have strategies are developed for every race?|We will easily simulate millions of races, if not billions of races for each race. Unfortunately the number of permutations of races possible far exceeds this number, so we have to employ some smart methods to make each simulation more useful than it would be if we just tried to simulate everything.
[deleted]|Thank you for the concern - but although I'm giving my own views this is being done in conjunction with our Marketing and Communications teams - so there is no risk of me being fired (for this).
I have heard the radios from Sainz at Brazil 2019 and i know he didn't pit during the SC because he didn't have a delta behind, but i still don't understand one thing about the strategy followed that race. My question is, what led you to put Lando on the hards and Carlos on the mediums? Were you aiming to do a 2-stopper with Carlos originally and changed your mind after the Safety Car ""shortened"" the race? Or did you believe he was better and keeping the tyres alive?|There are reasons, but I'm afraid these lips have to be sealed on this one.
Is there like a kill switch for the car that the team can use to shut off the car|Yes there is, you may hear race engineers telling their drivers to go from ""P2 to P1 or P0"" and that is effectively what is happening (turning the car off). This procedure is drilled into every driver and race engineer as its very important for safety too.
 |We can't turn it off remotely as we're not allowed to communicate from the pits to the car (otherwise we'd probably be making all kinds of changes all the time).
How many Gigs of data are generated after a race? Does it vary a lot per race? (provided no failure of some sort)|It can vary but we're roughly talking between 100 and 200 gigabytes of car data, and lots of other types of data such that its probably 1 to 2 terabytes of total data per weekend.
How faster cars could go if they had track specific gear ratios like they used to have?|With the current generation of cars and powerunits - it's not a huge amount (I can't give numbers). Locking down ratios was and is a great cost-saving measure with little noticeable impact for fans or spectators.
Having worked with the likes of Jenson and Fernando, how much did their feedback work into your calls? Is jenson really brilliantly nice as he comes across?|Jenson was my favourite driver growing up, so it was a privilege to work with him - he's a really nice guy.
 |Their feedback is really important - often (and Jenson would attest to this) we would disagree on how many stops there would be but never would you not value the feedback or use it (even if you decided other things were more important).
^(the below question has been split into four, enumerated)|
Thank you for doing an AMA. I have a couple of question for you: 1. did Lando win the bet with the wallpaper|Thanks (but not sure we'll win the 2020 season - I hope we do). He did. This bet required no skill and only a lack of shame.
2. Right now am applying for Mech. Eng. programs in SA (KAUST) US and UK and I hope to work in F1 or Formula E one day, do teams prefer degrees from one country to the other.|No, we don't prefer any country but for some roles there is a requirement to have the right to work in the UK.
3. How many possible strategies do you come up with before the race weekend, do you have one for every grid possibility, temp, tyre setup etc. or is it more simpler?|Millions if not closer to billions. We simulate a lot of different variables including many that you mention. As the weekend progresses the set of permutations shrinks, as it does with each passing lap in the race.
4. as Alonso's former strategist do you see him coming back to F1 for 2021 and to which team? I hope you can answer my questions, and win the 2020 season.|I'm not sure - I hope he does because a talent like his belongs in F1 and I hope he doesn't (I'd rather not race against him).
Hi Randy, thanks for taking the time to come on here. One of my biggest interests in the sport (aside from the racing) is the commercial side of it. Specifically sponsorships but also the negotiations behind them and just the general business of the sport. What college degrees would be most useful to enter the commercial side of a team, and how often would such positions open? What kind of positions would someone be aiming for to enter an entry level role? I'm about to enter college next year and need to finalise my course choices now, and am hoping for some insights on how to break into that world...thanks again!|I think anything focusing on the business side could be helpful (e.g. economics) but I think you also have some freedom to do something you enjoy. My impression is that relevant experience will be more useful than degree choice.
What was the biggest mistake you've done and what were you able to do to correct it? Or in other words how do you deal with mistakes during the race in order to get everything back in order?|I've made many, many mistakes and will make many, many more - but they don't tend to stand out as we hope that we make a mistake, learn from it, change processes and procedures and analysis and move on. I guess one of the biggest changes to how we worked came after Germany 2018, where we, like many teams, made the wrong choice for tyres in the changeable conditions - we learnt a lot from that event. I've experienced lots of poor luck and bad results from races, but I try and separate mistakes from what we can't control.
 |I think we're very good at not looking at 'sunk cost' now, once you've made a mistake, or something has gone wrong or against you, it doesn't really matter any more until after the event is over when you can analyse it and improve - there's no point expending any energy or thoughts on it in the race, you have to move on to the next thing and you shouldn't try and recover the mistake - it's happened, let it go and work out what to do from where you are.
How hard it is to become an F1 engineer/strategist? How much time you took to to become one?|I would say it's difficult to get ""your foot in the door"" and unfortunately things have gotten so much more competitive over time that it can really take a long, sustained effort to put yourself in a good position.
 |I ended up waiting a few years for the ""dream job"" offer in F1 after my placement and to be honest I thought I would never receive that offer.
 |Perseverance is really important - it is so much more competitive to get in today than it was when I did - but that doesn't make it impossible.
Did Lando keep the screensaver or did you get to keep your £250?|Lando has no shame (and may have forgotten how to change the screensaver) and won that particular bet.
Is there a limit set by the F.I.A. as to how many people can work for a Formula 1 team? And if so, what is the limit?|So there is no limit in terms of the total number of employees, although as the Financial Regulations come into force and we are subject to a budget cap there will be a natural ""soft limit"" from that.
 |We are currently limited to 60 operational personnel for nearly the entirety of the race weekend at the track - designed to stop teams spending too much money flying too many people all around the world.
There must be so many people travelling from race to race - what's the atmosphere like around the paddock on the weekend for someone working it? Does it feel like an F1 'community' or do you all generally keep within your teams?|It does feel like an F1 community. People move around teams fairly frequently so I think most people will know someone or have worked with someone at the majority of other teams. You also get to know your counterparts fairly easily.
 |It's a great atmosphere, there's obviously an underlying feeling of competition and trying to beat your opponents, but there is also a mutual respect as well and most people are actually quite normal human beings (or very good likenesses at least) and quite fun to chat to.
Hi, thanks for doing an AMA! Are there any roles in F1 for someone with a pure economics degree? EEM at Oxford would’ve been great but they stopped offering the degree a few years ago. Thanks|Yeah - what a shame about EEM being discontinued - I thought it was a great course!
 |There are suitable roles, most teams will have finance departments and areas that even cover financial planning, analysis and strategy. You would also be suitable for more typical roles if you were able to find a way to pick up the engineering side of things.
Hey Randy! I've been reading through all these questions and answers, they're all awesome. I also might be a bit late, sorry. I'm 16 and have dreamt(literally) of being a f1 aerodynamicist when I grow up! I have a knack for physics and calculus. What kind of degree do I try to pursue/study? I am absolutely bewildered by the amount of information out there. Is mechanical engineering the right place to study fluid dynamics, or engineering science? Thank you in advance! P. S. I live in New Zealand|It can vary between general engineering, mechanical engineering, aerodynamics, aeronautics and so on. I would suggest you find something you enjoy and also interrogate the course content to see how applicable it may be to your career desires before committing.
What do you think about Lance stroll? Do you rate him as an F1 Driver?|Lance's race pace has been fairly strong this last year, he has been close to Perez in that respect and Perez is no slouch in races.
 |Lance's qualifying positions have made it hard for him to score more points - so that's an area that will clearly payback for him (in terms of points scored) if he can improve on it.
Hi Randy, hope you’re doing well over lockdown! I’m currently in my second year of Automotive Engineering and would love to work in motorsport when I graduate (as many of us do). Firstly I wanted to ask whether you felt academic achievement, work experience or who you know in the industry is the most important part of getting a role in F1? And secondly, if you were an engineering student again now what would you do to stand out (especially for someone wanting to work in race strategy)? Really appreciate you doing an AMA by the way, and good luck when the season starts!|I would hope that knowing someone no longer has an impact on getting a role in F1 - I certainly feel that it shouldn't.
 |Both academic achievement and work experience can be useful - it's hard to rank them. Personally, I have always valued ""intelligence"" highly - but to me that includes things like book smarts, applied smarts, problem-solving, proactivity, etc.
 |Thanks for the luck.
Hello! I am currently working for Honda Performance Development where we develop and build the Indycar Honda engine. I got in through an internship from my community college and I have been tearing down and inspecting the engines when they come back to us. I am young and have only taken little math classes so far because I want to become an engineer one day and work in F1. I just don’t know what kind of engineering I should try to get into. I’d love to become one of the engineers who push our engines to the limit at the track. People have told me mechanical engineering can quite basic just designing parts while electrical engineers deal with stuff like engine mapping. What should I do and pursue?|Awesome - sounds like a fun job!
 |I don't think Mechanical Engineering will hold you back and at many colleges and universities you can specialise enough into the areas that are a little more related to Control Systems/Powerunits to help. I also don't think Electrical Engineering will hold you back either.
 |From experience, most of our Control Systems engineers I have worked with have done either Mechanical or General Engineering, but not all have.
 |I would pick what you enjoy and try and get some good and relevant experience and knowledge around that - for example, given you're already at HPD, can you offer to help out with some basic tasks in that area there?
Hi Randy, I know you’re an engineer. I’ve applied for a job in Marketing at McLaren (and other teams) multiple times over the years, and had no success. I live in Australia but I have a dual Australian-British citizenship so I can live and work legally in the UK. I think my skills are strong enough to justify an interview, but I always seem to get rejected. Is there a bias towards hiring people already in the UK? Is being in Australia hurting my chances of scoring a job somewhere like McLaren even if I’m willing to move?|I'm sorry but I'm not sure - I know in engineering we are careful not to be biased, but we have to sometimes consider the right to work in the UK. Perhaps you could try reaching out to HR to find out if there is any feedback?
why Vettel spin|Find me a driver who hasn't. I've never worked with Vettel, but have a lot of respect for him. Driving these cars is not easy and I imagine that driving them 0.1% faster than the other excellent drivers you're competing against (because that's what a tenth of laptime comes down to) puts you even closer to the line between a truly quick lap and disaster.
 |PS: Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
Thank vou for this AMA. I am a PhD Student in engineering Physics. I would like to know where did you start your career as an engineer/strategist? As a motorsport enthusiast I would like to be part of a motorsport team. Do you have suggestions from where to start looking?|I think answered elsewhere in this thread, so I won't repeat the comment here.
 |Keep an eye on the McLaren careers website (and if you really want to work elsewhere - their websites too).
Thanks for all the info in your pervious questions. Do many strategist or engineers work their way through F3 and F2 to get to F1? Is it common/possible for someone to start out in engineering in like suspension design and then transition into strategy? I’m a going into my 3rd as undergard as a ME, does McLaren offer opportunities to pay for grad school and work on the team? What is the difference between the strategists who travel and ones who don’t travel? Do you or other strategists contribute to the design of the next year’s car? Thanks if you get a chance to respond. It’s really thoughtful of you to do this, and I think it reflect very highly on McLaren that you’re doing this! I joined Formula Student in college during my first year and started doing data analysis for my team. Because of my time so far in Formula Student, I picked up following F1. It has been possibly one of the best decisions I’ve made. I’m highly interested into going into F1 now as either an engineer or a strategist.|Hi - thank you for the kind words. I've enjoyed answering these questions! And great that you've picked up a passion for F1.
 |In my experience, very few of the strategists I have worked with/invited to our team have been in F3 or F2 prior - that's not to say that that is a bad route and certainly I have met some very talented F3 and F2 engineers (including a strategist who has really impressed as well).
 |The other route you mention, doing some other role at an F1 team and moving over is probably more frequent. We've generally tended to hire people we've worked with and there are plentiful volunteering/assisting opportunities to teammates in the F1 team.
 |The Engineering Graduate Scheme (which I am biased about positively) is amazing in terms of talent (that's not bias, that's 100% honesty) and so we've actually taken most of our strategists from there as people finish their 2 year rotation period through the F1 business. I can not recommend the Engineering Graduate Scheme enough.
Can you give a funny or interesting story that happened to you and McLaren (about strategy) on a race weekend last year?|No really funny ""strategy"" stories from this year - at my first race (Australia 2013) I did jump off the pitwall in front of the safety car at least 2 times causing an emergency stop though - and I did get sent on to the track when it was live later that year...
 |But an interesting story, after Germany I had a very long chat with Carlos in the airport. Initially he was happy with 5th, but we chatted and I explained how we could have got a podium (his first!) by making a different decision, because of how things played out, but that that would have been the wrong choice. It was a great conversation and I think Carlos came around to our way of thinking fairly quickly and sensibly. We sat there and said we just needed to carry on making decisions the right way and the podium would come, little did we know we wouldn't have to wait too long...
hi randy quick question are there any legal related jobs in f1 in specific for lawyers|Yes, most teams will have (small) legal departments.
What are some of the biggest challenges with data visualization that you face? I imagine you have to sift through a lot of telemetry data quickly for your work.|I think some of the biggest problems are having too much data and being able to drill down to the important stuff quickly and making information presentable to those not familiar with the data so it is easy to comprehend the conclusions/summary/analysis.
Hi Randy, Could you explain what Ferrari were doing last year with their fuel flow sensor? And how teams found out? And how sure we are they were doing that? And do you expect other teams to have developed DAS? Thx mate.|I'm afraid I don't know what Ferrari were doing, if anything. Teams conduct a lot of competitor analysis so we do often spot things that others are doing or may be doing that way.
 |I don't, due to the ban and the complexity and time required to develop such a system but I don't know.
Hi Randy. I couldn't find this specific question. So would you guys love to see less durable tires. Or more obliged pit stops so that there would be more tire strategies possible?|As a strategist, I would love to see less durable tyres than we currently have - but I also understand that drivers want tyres they can push harder on and for longer (to battle each other) and there are a myriad of other factors that Pirelli are also dealing with to produce the ""perfect"" tyre.
 |So yes, strategy-wise less durable and higher degradation tyres would, in my opinion, lead to better racing, but they could have negative effects on other things.
 |I disagree heavily with constraints on strategy as I think they will make racing worse, so I disagree with obligated numbers of pitstops (I have just written another answer about that if you'd like more detail).
For the more “business” roles, do you guys hire people with MBAs or are people with just undergraduate degrees hired as well? (Eg. business strategy for the team, supply chain etc) Do you have an approximate of how many challenges would someone from Canada would have to overcome to get a job? (Or how much better would they have to be than someone from the UK)|I think there are probably not many MBAs based on my knowledge but that does not mean its not a good asset to have and that it won't help you.
 |I think the right to work in the UK can be very helpful, otherwise it shouldn't help or hurt you.
Evening Randy, I’m actually an undergraduate physicist. I had applied for the race team internship for this summer. I was very sad to hear that it was cancelled. I was really hoping to get a better understanding of how you guys model the tires and decided on optimal strategies and lap times to find the shortest race time. Do you know of anyone who releases tire data publicly that I could have a look at when I eventually get bored this summer? Also I saw that placement over summer as the first stepping stone for a career in formula 1. I’ll be graduating next year so won’t have an opportunity to reapply. Do you have any advice for someone in my position, looking to get into the data analysis side of formula one without much prior knowledge. Thank you for your time.|I'm so gutted that Covid has scuppered our plans this year, I get to manage the summer placements and it's a highlight of each year of work.
 |Pirelli do a great job of releasing tyre information each weekend to the press and on their website - I'd suggest you start there.
Do all of your plans get tossed if unexpected rain comes? Do you make strategy plans for rain happening at say lap 10, a different plan for if lap 15, etc? And how does rain potential affect amount of fuel you'll carry, if at all?|We don't toss our plans. We do plan for wet and changeable races, as well as all kinds of other scenarios too.
 |Less fuel is used in the rain as you are going slower (and considerably so) but before you remove too much fuel you'll need to think about the certainty of rain during the race (when you decide hours before how much to fuel the car) and its intensity and duration...
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks for the reply, I know you've had a lot asked. If you don't mind me asking, what's the strangest weather pattern/geological event/etc you've ever made a ""no real chance of happening, but just in case"" plan for?|I think the typhoons in Japan are always pretty special to follow, there have also been heatwaves and occasionally snow/ice."

I've been following this subreddit and PF for a few years, I tried my best to save as much as I can. Sometimes though I feel like I save too much or I go through phases where I spend too much, I just need advice on determining what to do next?

ME:

- Graduating next year with bachelor's of CS

- 28k OSAP loan (estimate, currently is at 23k)

- $450 monthly payments for a car lease (I realize this was stupid, but I just wanted to treat myself)

- No rent, live with parents

- Have about ~95k in the bank earned and saved from all my internships

- hoping to make atleast 80-100k salary on grad or higher if states open

My problem:

I tend to spend on certain things but other stuff I cheap out so much on. I've had family and friends call me out on it and sometimes I tend to agree. I've always shown a face to my family I don't have money to spend because if they knew I had what I have in my account it would most likely be pressured to be spent. When do I know it's time to spend?

Should I just keep saving for a down payment on a house (Seems like the GTA is 500k plus for decent ones)? Can I buy a shiny new car? I don't just wanna save till I'm 65, I wanna live life before then too. Any help would be appreciated, thanks everyone in advance at PFC for great advice."

If you’d like to see my last post regarding specific application strategies, I’ve linked it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/he6l02/niche_insights_and_advice_from_a_t20_shotgunner/).

(For those interested in my stats and results, you can find them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/he3xkr/waitlist_galore_from_an_asian_male_cs_t20/).)

**Your Writing as a Tipping Point**

At this point, as a rising senior, you have little-to-no control over your GPA, your rec letters, your ECs, your demographic, and your test scores. What you *do* have control over is communicating a compelling personal narrative that could sway an admissions committee to choose you over another applicant who otherwise is identical on paper.

**Writing That is Personal and Processed**

Schools do a decent job of teaching analytical and argumentative writing. However, personal narrative writing can be a completely different challenge as you have to write inwardly to a reader who doesn't know you at all. Furthermore, striking a fine balance between selling yourself in a persuasive way without flexing too hard is key.

In terms of process, your first, second, or third drafts are all likely insufficient. In fact, your idea may not even be rock solid. You should be generating a whole host of ideas, perhaps in the form of a brainstorm, and thinking about deeper and more abstract themes that help communicate who you are.

Idea generation and theme development, as well as outlining, all precede the writing in and of itself. And in that process asking for someone else's honest opinion can be incredibly helpful. It’s super easy to get tunnel vision and not catch or consider potholes or obstacles that might compromise your story. When I wrote my Common App, I spent a ton of hours discussing with a writing coach about what my story would eventually be. Obviously, most aren’t working with a writing coach, but I highly recommend at least talking through your ideas with some friends.

When you actually begin writing, it’s important to know that those early drafts are truly works-in-progress. In addition, as you work through the drafting process, don’t be afraid to tweak and reshape ideas. It took me eleven iterations to finally be satisfied with my common app, which was probably a bit overkill and nitpicking at the end, but I was ultimately super proud of what I wrote. And at that point, I didn't really care whether I was admitted to a school or not since that essay represented me in the truest sense. That sort of attitude was necessary to keep me grounded.

**The Essay Idea**

It's helpful to think about your idea relative to what you *shouldn't* write. There are a lot of bad essay ideas that get communicated to colleges (e.g. the ""[mission trip essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/to-get-to-harvard-go-to-haiti.html)."")

It's helpful, I think, to consider the essay idea relative to what you can imagine others writing about. How many applicants will write about their experience doing some service work? How many will write about their experience doing speech and debate, math team, or an internship? I'm not saying those are bad ideas -- in fact, they might be good ideas, but what I am saying is that you need to distinguish yourself from your peers in ways that set you apart from what many others are doing.

Figuring out that idea takes some inward reflection, some introspection, and well, some time.

**The “Perfect” Essay**

Many of us have been tempted to find the perfect college essay online, even in the noblest of ways, and try to emulate their style, structure, and content. You too may have come across the so-called ""Costco essay"" and think that that is the only way to write a college essay. The truth is that those essays may have worked for those specific students, but that person may have received college admission for a whole host of other reasons. \*Correlation doesn’t imply causation.\*My suggestion on this is to write in a style and voice that is truest to your own. Be creative and be daring with your own ideas. Take ownership and pride in what you write.

That said, I know many of you would still like to read essays for inspiration to get started on your own, so here’s some of mine that I wrote this past application season: ~~A2C Sample Essays~~.

Note: please don’t be stupid and plagiarize these. They are posted for inspiration ONLY. Students caught stealing essays have been *rescinded* in the past, so don’t make me take them down.

EDIT: essays removed due to plagiarism :/

**Writing Support/Services**

Since there were a number of PMs asking about this in my last post, I’ll expand a bit more on my opinions and personal experience on this topic.

As I said last time, essay services can sometimes be hit or miss. In the best-case scenario, you find a service that works with you closely to develop killer ideas that (a) you are proud of and (b) cater to and highlight you as an individual.

Your typical run-of-the-mill service is pretty good at the revision side of things (e.g. removing wordiness, fixing awkward sentences, etc.), but what separates the great ones from the average ones is a focus on the whole writing process, from ideation to polishing edits. I’d actually caution against paying for a service to solely get help on the revision stuff since your friends and teachers can probably do much of the same things for free. I think in the worst-case scenario, you pay an exorbitant price and have your natural writing voice mutilated by a third party, but that is pretty rare. Services are meant to *accentuate*, not *alter* your writing voice.

As for my personal experience, I worked with one called GreenMark Writing, which I was really happy about and recommended to a number of friends. My writing coach heavily emphasized the process, which I think is indicative of any individual who is actually invested in your success. Without a doubt, the responsibility was on me to write the essays, but he helped me avoid both obvious and less-than-obvious landmines in areas like brainstorming, structure, and tone. As a result, I felt more than satisfied in terms of what I had hoped to get out of a service. My main takeaway here is that if you do plan on using a service, I highly recommend keeping these criteria I’ve mentioned in mind, so you get your money’s worth.

As a final thought, if you think you can write your essay without college essay services or tutors or instructors, then you should do so by all means. Save your money and use it to defray the cost of college, the applications themselves, or some other fixed cost that is inevitably coming your way.

If you have any questions on anything, feel free to PM me or leave a comment. I’ll try to respond asap!"
