I am about to be done with CS 161 in about two weeks or so, but have been performing very poorly, to say the least. While I feel like I understand the concepts I read in the textbook, I have struggled to complete assignments to the point where I required tutor help for almost of all the work - a big burn in my wallet. I am currently on the brink of failing (borderline C and C-) and was wondering what classmates here think. Should I retake CS 161 or should I barely pass it and move on CS 162? 
   On the one hand, retaking the course would allow to strengthen my C++ skills, a necessity for CS 162, a class that is often called a lot more difficult than CS 161. On the other, retaking a class would mess up my current 2 year plan and make me even less competitive for Summer internships. Not to mention, I would need to spend an extra $1900. Has anyone experienced this? What would you recommend?"

(lots of info in post)",yaynewthrowawaytime,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/5wu9sd/m_20_usa_thailand_prague_anywhere_lots_of_info_in/,"A while back I stopped by to ask some questions about a potential move to Prague with my girlfriend to teach ESL. However, my situation has changed drastically. 


I will be travelling solo, now. I am graduating this April from a state university with a double-major in English and Communication (I know, I know, emigration wasn’t really on my to-do list when I picked), with Honors and a completed thesis, have three years experience as a resident assistant, limited desk job experience (~6 months total), and have worked as a PR intern for a political campaign. I am familiar with basic IT protocol including software and hardware, but have no formal training. I am male, 20 (21 in May), a tad short (5’ 8”), and average physically (a little overweight, but I’m working on it). I am white, with blonde hair and blue eyes, and not too ugly, definitely not a 10 though (I mention these things because from what I understand, they are important details in some locales). I know a bit of French (I’d say approaching conversational) and according to DuoLingo am 10% fluent in Spanish ;) I know those don’t mean much, but I’m willing to keep studying or start a new language. 


Financially, I haven’t done so badly. I don't have any debt, and when I graduate I’ll have around $9,500 in savings, and if I was to sell some stuff could probably come up with another $1-2,000 fairly quickly. My then-girlfriend was then most amiable to Prague. I still find Prague fascinating (even spoke briefly with a poster in this sub about a potential entry IT position), but want to keep all my options open. I don’t really have a profitable degree for foreign markets, that I understand. I understand that TEFL is probably my easiest bet for emigrating somewhere, for now. However, I understand TEFL is not very promising for long-term stability. Which is kind of what I’m looking for - I’ve really not got much in terms of things to stay here for, I’d like to make some sort of new life. I know that may sound like “grass is always greener,” but I’ve been thinking pretty strongly about this for around three months now, every day. I’ve heard a lot of good things about Chiang Mai in particular for freelance work. 


Now that I don’t have to compromise with her, I am free to go wherever. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I’d like to travel for a bit casually, but then I imagine looking for something more permanent (someday I’d like to settle somewhere, but I just can’t see myself doing that in the United States, petulant as it may seem). The pipe dream, of course, is to meet and fall madly in mutual love with a nice Irish, Kiwi, or Australian woman =) (joking, here... mostly). My tentative plan (still gotta research visa particulars, etc.) was to live in Thailand without working (or finding casual ESL work?) for as long as a visa lets me (unless there’s a conceivable way to stay semi-permanently), then going to Vietnam for the CELTA course. I’d then work for a year (either in HCMC or Da Nang), and simultaneously search for freelance/remote positions in writing professions while trying to learn some coding to build a portfolio. I’m also a fairly good writer, with some University level accolades, and would love to be able to freelance write but I know that’s a pretty difficult world to enter successfully.


Another option would be to take a live-in job opportunity here in the U.S. over the summer, where I could net another $1-2k, more if I got another part-time on the side. During this time I would work as hard as possible trying to find a permanent remote position based in the United States, and with some extreme luck, maybe find one that could fund my relocation to another country friendly to remote work (any thoughts? I've heard good things about South America). I’m looking for anything here. All help is appreciated!"

My dilemma is as follows. I've been working on a business plan for about 2 years now, it's a plan that's mostly based on creating a new financial product that would be very attractive to institutional investors (would increase their profit by literally millions a year). A few days ago I finally got the good news from my lawyers that the plan has been greenlit, after a 2 year process.

However, a few days ago I also got some more good news. One of the leading financial services providers in the country has offered me a thesis internship, where I write my thesis on a subject they came up with and pretty much work with them for 6 months, this usually leads to a job offer after the internship.

Just to clarify, I'm by no means complaining. It's a lot of good news in just a few days. However, my dilemma is whether to pursue the internship or to start up my company. If I decide to do the internship, that's 6 months during which others might come up with the idea or 6 months in which laws might be changed that would make my whole plan moot. If I reject the internship, it'll probably leave a bad taste in the company's mouths.

I'm really at a loss here. I'm leaning towards starting up the company and simply postponing my thesis by half a year or so, but there's a good chance I won't get such a good internship offer again. 

Some more background info, in case it's useful: I'm 23 years old, doing a master's in Finance (duh), the business plan could potentially make many millions (though of course everyone thinks that) and would require practically no start-up costs.

Any advice would be very very welcome, thanks a lot everyone.

Edit: If any other information would help in giving advice just let me know of course.

Another edit: I don't have a partner I could start this company with, no one really knows about it except my girlfriend and me, and the lawyers that looked into it. "

I was wondering if anyone had experience with completing a second Bachelors at GAtech?

I finished my BS in AE in May of 2016 and graduated with a 3.34 overall GPA. Due to out-of-state tuition and having to take on loans, I rushed through school in order to complete it in 4 years and never changed my major even though I had some reservations about it. I was never super-passionate about aerospace engineering, and never got an internship in the field, so now I find myself working in the automotive industry and I don't make fantastic money nor am I enamored by the people that I work with. My pay isn't great, my loans aren't getting paid off anytime soon, the work is boring and slow. Honestly, I miss the rigor and pace of learning that GAtech offered, and even though I felt resentful about the amount of work before, I was younger, less mature, less driven, and felt forced by parents to take that route of rushing through school so my mindset was just off. The people that I met at tech were always crazy driven, very intelligent, and just a high quality of people that I miss interacting with.

I'd like to return to GAtech and complete a second BS in CS. All my credits will still be available, right? Since I don't need to take any labs or gen eds, the second degree could probably be completed in 1.5-2 years (of course there would have to be considerations for pre-reqs)? How do admissions work for a second bachelors? Are they easier on you since you already attended the school and what kind of overall GPA looks good to them (is 3.3 good enough for admission back into the school)?

Just looking for any thoughts from people that have done the same. I'd just love to be back in that environment."

I'm currently a Junior in an upper-ranked Canadian school for CS.  I'm in a co-op program and want to try applying to internships in computer graphics in some future work term (at least 7 months away).  I see plenty of postings aimed at undergrads (that I've applied to) but I haven't gotten responses.

Obviously this is pretty broad (since it's a wide field), but what do I need to get in?

Things I can think of from stalking LinkedIn would be:  General SWE experience, Intermediate/Advanced C++ (like metaprogramming and memory optimization), paper implementations, research experience and advanced math courses / good grades (since a lot of these people have masters).  

So far I've implemented some basic rendering stuff (a basic raytracer and game engine) and a few recent papers (a SIGGRAPH paper on CFD and some NPR techniques).  However nothing really looks all that impressive since it's all sort of unfinished (like the CFD solver impements the whole paper but just renders the fluid particles as a bunch of spheres).

My C++ is pretty mediocre and my grades are slightly above average but nothing special.  I've taken multivariable Calc, Linear Algebra and numerical ODE solving but don't know these subjects at advanced levels.  I also have a bit of work experience but it's all in web development.

It's obvious that I need to improve a lot of areas if I want to do this.  Does anyone in the industry or with similar experience have any advice?"

5wx4v5,10,2017-03-01,No guidance at internship: what can I do?,AnotherIntern12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5wx4v5/no_guidance_at_internship_what_can_i_do/,"In case you want the gist of it first and avoid that wall of text:

**TL;DR**: My mentor is not actually mentoring me, and doesn't seem to want to either. She also does not understand I have no experience with hardware even after I told her that explicitly. I already met with her several times and each time it was like pulling teeth to get any information out of her. What else can I do? The management system here is strangely isolated and my mentor is the ONLY person on the team and is the only person who knows what is going on. And, of course, account is a throwaway.

First some context:
I am a CS student, who got lucky and got an internship at a big company in the Silicon Valley that deals primarily in low level firmware and hardware about a month back. Unfortunately, my experience is in software and not hardware, BUT I was hired with the promise of coding firmware and learning how to make a micro-controller communicate with peripherals via ANSI C. The end project is testing the timing of the communication with a severely under documented peripheral. 

My mentor, let's call her May, told me that I will learn a lot and I can ask her any questions I may have. Unfortunately, the management system here is very strange and isolated; my mentor is the ONLY person who is working on the project and the only one familiar with the toolchain. It doesn't help that her manager quit the week I joined, so I have no real higher up as of now.

About two weeks ago, I learned that I actually need to do some wiring and soldering on a board, when I have no prior experience. This was a bit of a shock. Up to that point, I was learning synchronous communications and how they work and how to activate them with software, not how to connect anything to the hardware. 

I ask May how to go about doing this and pointed out that I have no experience with hardware or wiring, so I may accidentally break something. She says that it should be easy to do and that I need to connect the three wires. I ask her which three wires and she looks at me as if I grew an extra head. She told me that I need a GND, a SCL and SDA wire to make sure everything is communicating correctly. I ask her how she knew this, and she told me that she learned it after 4 years in college. I ask her who I can ask besides her if I need hands on help, and she tells me to ask a person who is not on our team. 

Now to be fair, since she is the only person on the project, this means she has to do all the organization, meetings and documentation on the entire process. I understand that means she is really busy. But that doesn't help me out in any way, since I did ask that person and he didn't even know where to begin and waved me off.

Since then, I have been asking her more questions and she answers some of them and ignore others. I did meet with May several times, emphasizing that I knew nothing and had a lot of questions; the last meeting, she grew extremely frustrated. I had to ask basic questions, since she kept explaining everything very abstractly (ex. ""use board A to talk to board B""). Every time I asked her a question, she would stop me and tell me to be more specific. It got to the point where I had to ask very specific questions by pulling up a picture of our micro-controller board and point to every component and ask what does what. She told me that I was supposed to do everything on my own and that she is only giving me suggestions. 

She also mentioned that she didn't actually care if I had no measurable output or productivity. I don't know what that means for me, but it felt like we were on different pages. I can't seem to make it any clearer that I have no idea what I'm doing and I can't be more specific unless we spend time to work on the project 1 on 1. It also doesn't help she changes what she says or blames me outright for giving her the wrong information. I do try to research before I ask, but since everything is new to me, I can't sift the chaff from the wheat.

I feel lost and frustrated at this lack of guidance. Especially since she seems to assume I can learn what took her 4 years in a month. Because she keeps treating me as if I should know better. So my question is: what can I do? I plan on talking with her again, but besides gritting my teeth and doing the best I can, what can I do? I debated to just say screw it and do whatever I want on the job but I really do want to learn the low-level firmware programming.

Feel free to ask any questions, since I skipped over some details to avoid a (bigger) wall of text.

**Backstory Summary:** I wasted my first year as an engineering student and switched to CS. It took me two more years to break out of the Intro to CS classes while knocking down other pre-reqs and dealing with some setbacks caused by my freshman year screwups. 

After my internship in Summer 2016 I learned more than I ever did in school. Before that point all I'd learned was some C++ and I had to go to the communications dept. to find a C# class. But at my internship I learned: HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, Node.js, Angular.js, HTTP, SQLite3, and I got to work on debugging an app in VScode along with the Chrome Devtools.

Needless to say, that internship blew my mind. I'd never known how to work on a web page before, much less a full application. And I had to pick things up fast since I'd come in knowing nothing.

**Current Situation:** I'm now in year 4 and taking higher level courses and not faring well, partly due to the fact that roughly half of the 9 classes that I NEED to graduate deal theory/proof related things, and the rest is all just building small command line programs that never get used again and are pretty irrelevant.

I've come to the conclusion that I want to be a Web/WebApp Developer and maybe gain some Mobile Dev experience down the road, and my school honestly doesn't offer the classes or employer connections to get me to a place like that.

After this semester I will have 4 years and about $64k student debt under my belt with 1 real webdev internship and 1-2 more in the coming summer and fall (I've locked down at least a summer internship, looking for a fall one because I'd rather work and gain money/experience than come back here). 

Transferring seems a bit pointless at this point since I've already invested so much time here... I'm also really discouraged by the fact that I don't know if my grades are good enough to get into another school with good financial aid. I've had a lot of difficulty here academically that might exclude me from other schools.

But dropping out and not having a degree doesn't seem like a good course of action either, so I've been trying to stick it out here just to graduate.

**TL;DR:** Basically I've got a pretty bad college track record academically and the courses my college offers are not helping me practice for the job I want but rather are wasting my time and frustrating me further. I don't think I can transfer easily, I'm on thin ice with my GPA/dropped classes history, and leaving school entirely now doesn't seem to be an option either.

Are there any good options for me here? And if I do end up having to go the transfer route, are there any good programs out there that would accept a mid/lower-grade student while offering real webdev/appdev classes?

Now I'm looking at other internships and trying to apply and a lot of places seem to be closed for this coming summer. Kinda nearing panic mode: at first I was mildly worried I might not get a ""good"" internship and now I'm concerned I might not get placed into any internship at all.

     I'm a 23 year old computer science student at Portland State University.  I'm a senior level student with only 2 terms left until I can graduate.
Here is my dilemma: I have never had any real industry experience or internships BUT I have just been offered a 6-month full time C++ gig making about 25/hr.  This job would be with a company that's quite small.  I would have no real interest in working with them upon graduation.  Obviously, I would be delaying my graduation by 6 months by taking this contract, but I think it might be worth it as I could head out into industry afterwards with some solid experience under my belt.  On the other hand, if I could graduate first, then get a more lucrative job with better prestige upon graduation it might be better for me to decline this offer.
     I'm really confused about weather this would be a good option or not and would appreciate any insight anyone could provide.

I'm a business student and I interned at a company for a while - after the internship ended they asked me to stay as a part-time employee. What I didn't realize, once I started the new role, was that a lot of the new position involved packing and shipping boxes (about one third of my time is spent shipping).  I was pretty unhappy about it because that's not what I was told I'd be doing prior to me starting the new position and it's not anywhere related to my major. I originally thought about quitting for a while but it pays well and I need the money. BUT, I've accepted a full-time offer at another company starting in May, so I'm planning to quit this job in April. 

However, I've been having a lot of issues with my lower back lately. I'm not sure if it's related to this job or not (I don't think it is honestly because my back has hurt even on weeks that I haven't picked up heavy stuff at work). I've been prescribed medicine for the pain but I'm waiting for my test results on something and I'm getting X-rays done of my spine next week to find out what the issue is. But regardless of whether it's caused my job, it's certainly not helping. I've had to bend down a ton just today to put stuff in boxes and just bending down is very painful. 

I'm planning on going home early today and getting some rest. but I don't know if I can continue doing this job in general if I have this much pain. 

Is it worth it to talk to my bosses about this and see how we can adjust my position, even though I'm only planning on being here for another 5 weeks? Or should  I just give them my two weeks notice at the beginning of next week and attempt to live off of my savings until May?

Tl;dr: my job requires me to pack and ship boxes but I've developed pain in my lower back. I'm planning on quitting in April regardless. Do I talk to my bosses about my health issues and see if my job responsibilities can be adjusted? Or  should I just quit a few weeks earlier than I'd planned? The biggest issue is that this I would like to keep working here through April as I need the money to pay for rent/bills/life"

* Graduating senior.
* No offers [or even interviews] in the fields I want [yet], but plenty of people willing / trying to give me opportunities in fields I'm less interested in.
* Not sure how I should proceed with respect to these opportunities I'm not interested in. Do I nab a job I don't want to so I can pay the bills then bounce the minute something better comes along even if it's &lt;6 months after I start? Can I accept one offer then start interviewing for a different position 2 weeks later? Or even accept one offer from Company A, get my ~dream offer~ from Company B the next day, then call Company A back to say ""whoops, never mind all that!""

--------------------------------------------------------------

Hello! I'm going to be graduating from a local uni in the Midwestern US with an undergrad degree in Computer Engineering in May, and I don't have any offers yet - which is (most likely) due to the following:

* **I started applying during my last semester.** As in 2 or 3 weeks ago I started sending out applications. I'd been specifically advised not wait so long many times in the past, but I was trying to hold off until I'd fixed my second bullet...
* **My GPA is below a 3.0.** It's a 2.7ish at the moment. I'm currently retaking one of the courses that's dragging it down and doing pretty well, and I should be retroactively assigned a high B / an A in Senior Design I when I finish Senior Design II at the end of this semester (so I should be graduating just a smidgen past a 3.0). 
* **I've ruled-out moving to the major tech hubs in California like Santa Clara as an option.** The Rent is Too Damn High. 

That being said, I'm not worried about being jobless for ages on end after I graduate. I've got over 3 years of intern experience under my belt, a good number of related extracurricular activities and projects through IEEE at my school, and several friends in the area at a few different companies have come forward and told me they're willing to refer me to their employers. The problem? I'm not interested in the positions people want me to interview for (Software Engineering, PLCs, DevOps, a few Salesforce.com Admin / Developer gigs). Additionally, I don't want to stay in my city much longer.

What I'm really interested in is doing more work with stuff like embedded systems or firmware or ASICs  / FPGA prototyping, but there are very few of those types of positions in my area (practically none in firmware and ASICs) which is why I'd rather move somewhere like Atlanta, the Seattle area, the Portland area, or [god forbid] the Austin area. 

Now, if my friends' experiences are any indication of how things will / could go for me, it's entirely possible that I could get an interview and have an offer [or multiple offers] by the mid~late April. I'm thinking I might just cave and interview for one of the gigs they're trying to get me in on, but I don't want to accept an offer at Company A only to get a call from Company B that they're starting their interview process for my ~dream job~ in 2 weeks *(in a career orientation class I took years ago they stressed that going to a different gig after accepting an offer was a no-no and burned bridges)*.

How should I navigate these next few months? I hope this is enough info [and it's not too confusing], but, please, tell me if I need to expand on anything! 

I've gotta run to class for now, but I'll check the replies and clarify anything when I get back!"

I am really scared that even if I graduate, I wouldn't find a job or have the necessary skills because right now my GPA is shit and I don't think I have any skills that will be useful in the workplace. I haven't made anything (idk where to start, everything costs money). I havent had any internships (they want high grades, i have low grades and low confidence that they will want me).

So, here is my situation: I’m currently a managing editor with a magazine company. I have several years of communications experience. However, as you can imagine, market conditions have caused low, stagnant wages. I make well for the industry, but I’m in Los Angeles, and while I could move elsewhere for lower living costs, that is a subsequent cut in pay too. With those considerations, I’m working toward a career shift to something else I enjoy: Information Technology

So, here is my background: IT-focused high school, help desk for two internships, as well as for CompUSA (RIP), and low-voltage wiring over a summer. Problem is that was almost 10 years ago, and my time since has been spent in the communications field. Any interaction with tech has basic enthusiast stuff. I’m currently enrolled for a second BS degree online and will finish middle of 2018. I’m planning to get my Sec+ cert next month, with A+, NET+, and CCNA in the months following.

My W-I-P resume: http://imgur.com/a/no7KT

Now, here is the kicker: My wife and I are expecting in September of this year. Now, it is still an option to stay with my current position. I do enjoy it, but if at all possible, I’m aiming to transition to something entry level in the IT field. I figure it is best to do now rather than with a newborn.

I have been lurking in this subreddit for a while, and I do feel it is possible -- yet daunting and steep -- goal to accomplish. What I am looking for is any qualified advice for my specific situation. Am I crazy? Am I even somewhat realistic? What positions would be best to look for? What can I do to compensate for my lack of recent professional experience? Journalists suck?

A few thoughts:

* I have thought about technical writing, but everything seems to be requiring 2-3 years of tech writing in that specific field. Am I looking at it wrong?
* For experience, I’m planning on (self-taught) setting up a virtual test network with MS Server 2016 to act as an active directory domain/DNS/DHCP server with a couple other virtual clients. I figure this would give me basic experience setting up and configuring an MS Server, as well as deployment.
* I am also planning on (self-taught) building a custom physical server running Server 2016 to run as an SMB NAS for cloud storage (with OwnCloud), Time Machine backups, and Windows backups. It would be using a RAID setup. I figure this would give me hardware and software server experience. (Budget ~$600)

Sorry for the long post. I am learning as I’m going here, so I apologize if I am completely off base."

The jobs themselves are in downtown Toronto/Waterloo in very small teams, which seems pretty great.  However, I'm worried that my lack of experience in technical interviews is going to be a problem later down the road and wonder what the lack of technical questions could signify about the quality of work I'd be doing in that position.

I know that the problem might seem a bit trivial but everyone I know who are applying to tech internships are getting heavily technical interviews and it feels a bit strange that I haven't encountered any.

I could ask for an end date to take into account the second internship, but then I feel bad for making them wait what could be a month for something that could be an inevitable no, and even then I still feel apprehension for say yes!!

I'm pursuing a bachelor's in software engineering at a local university, and am in my third year. I am currently attempting to obtain a summer internship or coop before finishing my degree (one semester left). I am very interested in embedded systems programming. I have three companies (companies 2-4) in mind in this field, as well as one company (company 1) that I would rather work at than any of those three but my chances are low (very high standards).

I have received an offer from company 4, however it happens to be my lowest preference. From what I learned recently, the work itself is very similar to company 4 but I'm likely to be translating code from one language to another more than doing development. This does not excite me. Additionally, company 1 does not offer a living stipend and I would have to drive 1.25 hours each way each day if I want to avoid paying double rent.

Company 2 is my second preference. The company seems to be a more prominent name, as well as the work would be strictly development. I would also receive a housing stipend or onsite housing, so no double rent and no lengthy transportation. I have communicated with the representative for this company and let them know that I received another offer, and was told that I was one of three candidates referred to the manager of the team I would be working with (I asked for any idea of how much of a risk it would be to reject my current offer and place my hopes in this company). I will be scheduled for a final interview with this company if I choose to reject the offer from company 4.

Company 3 is my third preference. This is a company local to my hometown, so living expenses and transportation would be easily managed. I have a friend as a referral to this company, as he has worked an internship here before as well as worked with me before. I'm not currently sure that they are still looking for interns for the summer, although I hope to receive confirmation from my friend by the time I must respond to the offer from company 4. This is a company where references from employees or employee's friends means a lot, and the manager is one of my dad's friends from high school as well.
Company 1 is my highest preference, but feels like a complete shot in the dark - they receive hundreds of applicants and reject most of them solely based on their resumes and GPA's. This semester, right after the local career fair, they asked another of my friends, a previous intern and now future employee, for a list of the smartest people he knew. I am one of five people on that list, along with a description of his experiences with me. Last semester I was screened out based on resume, but I have not received an email notifying me of so this semester, and my resume and GPA both look much more appealing after last semester.

Currently, my plan is to await my friend's feedback on Company 3, and if he confirms there will be availability in a few weeks, to reject my current offer. If I do not receive meaningful feedback by my deadline, I will accept my current offer. I'd like to know what Reddit thinks. I definitely don't want to commit to working for company 4, but I'd rather work there than another summer of a non-career position."

Meanwhile, the job with the utility was very lucky for me. It may be a once in a lifetime opportunity since they rarely hire outside of university new grads and the pay as well as the pension are excellent. However, I did not have a pleasant experience working with an utility (different one) during one of my summer work terms, where I dreaded coming into work everyday. Also, I probably prefer a large city life compared to the suburbs of the prairies.

Do any of you older engineers have advice for a new graduate like me? My heart feels like I should stay with consulting where I am familiar with the people and am interested in the work, but the job security, lower stress and pay are big pluses on the utility side. Are there any other factors I should consider in my decision?"

I've read about people being able to find jobs with just being self-taught but over here in my city, it seems that those with degrees + co-op internship are more likely to find employment than those w/o degrees and are self-taught based on what I've heard from employers and friends (if there are those who are self-taught in my city and were successful in landing employment please share your stories).

Due to my low GPA, I'll most likely have to spend a year as a non-degree student taking courses to upgrade and transfer after my first year, this would probably take me a minimum of 4-5 years to achieve a CS degree.

I'm fine with self teaching for two years and by reading around this sub there is a good split between those who seeked out formal education and those who self-taught. However, I feel location plays a huge factor in those who are self-taught being hired versus a CS grad. Please feel free to roast me out on this one if I'm wrong.

I've already begun self-teaching myself Java on my own. I can't help but feel that going back for a second degree is a much 'safer' option than self-teaching for 1-2 years and struggling against the large supply of CS grads in my city with a degree + co-op experience.

Thoughts?,AussieChopTop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x3lkt/a_company_i_applied_for_countered_with_an/,"As the title suggests, I was applying for a bit of a 'dream job', but didn't hear back. I pulled all of the strings I could, and recently got my CV onto the desk of the lead in the team I wanted to join. Today I received a call from the HR department about a paid, 3-month internship program with said team, where I will apparently perform ""meaningful work"" full-time. I still have to do an online test, but I'm confident and they're currently asking for salary expectations.

Now, this is all awesome (I suppose it's their version of a junior position, and although I've been programming in C++ for a few years, relative to this AAA-ish game developer, I'm a bit of a junior), but I'm just concerned that if I give some lower figure I feel would be appropriate for an internship, it could be used against me if I was brought on to a proper development position where I would want to be paid more. I'm also having trouble arriving at a figure. I tried to dodge it, and tried to get the salary range, but no dice. If I was joining as a developer (this is in games, so a little less than in other parts of CS), I'd be asking for $65-70k AUD in a major city, but as an intern...? 

I was thinking I'd make it clear that I was not sure due to it being an internship, but as a potential job trial of sorts, my ideal would be $50-55k with the ability to renegotiate if I was to be brought on. I would ideally make it clear I'm open to discussion if I'm way off, etc etc.

Has anyone else been in this situation before? How did it turn out, esp. the transition from intern to full developer?"

I'm tired and frustrated after eight months of interviewing and failing to find a job. I need fresh suggestions, so I thought I'd turn to /r/cscareerquestions for advice.

Long story short, I changed my major three times before graduating June 2016 with a double major in computer science engineering and statistics. Since I spent my summers catching up on academic requirements, I didn't complete any internships. However, I have done a few out-of-class projects (most for self interest, two for professors). I've interviewed for both software engineering and data science roles at a few large companies, a number of smaller ones and startups, and even a few research firms, but I've been rejected by all of them.

At this point, I'm running out of companies and ideas. What suggestions do you have for me? I'm happy to provide whatever information about myself if it'll help you better advise me. I apply mainly through internal referrals (either through my friends or through networking with engineers at the company). I've progressed from initially getting rejected in phone screens to now getting rejected at on-sites. Most places tell me ""We like you, but we think you first need work experience. Please reapply after your first job.""

The few specific questions I have - 

1. How do I find companies having exhausted big name firms, AngelList, Intern Supply, HackerRank's coding challenges? Is there some equivalent for academic/research organizations?

2. How should I be using my time? I'm currently splitting it between applying, leetcode practice and personal projects. Is there something else I should be doing?

3. I'm interested in applying to grad school, but I'm hesitant because I don't feel comfortable applying without knowing what programs/professors are out there. My plan was to work as a software engineer for one to three years and then apply once I have a better idea of what I'd like to spend my time in graduate school doing. Is this a bad plan? Most of the programs I'm interested in are in Europe and are still accepting applicants - should I just apply now? If so, what should I do while waiting to hear back? Apply for summer internships?

4. Baidu Research and now DeepMind rejected me because they didn't feel I was sufficiently proficient with C++ (my preferred language is Python). Are there any tutorials for more advanced features of C++ that someone can refer me to?

Because of this my grades weren't always the best (a 3.2) but I learned a lot. I believe I've lost out on internships due to my GPA.

I was looking on one of the IB forums and they pretty much explicitly said that recruiters only care about GPA, not excuses for lower grades. Now, I'm confident I can get through these classes. I'm not necessarily confident I can get an A though. Has anyone else been in this position? I understand people will say to prioritize learning but realistically, the reason I'm in this professional master's is to get a better position when I leave, not necessarily to learn.

I've loved CS for a while now and though I am doing an engineering degree, I have found myself dabbling here and there and enjoying modules that veer towards programming all through my degree (Currently completing my 4th (masters) year). I enjoy reading about new developments and gaining knowledge about CS subjects/theories.

During summer I completed an internship in a development role at a major investment bank, which I thoroughly enjoyed and received an offer to return as a grad. 

My problem is that, I feel I will be fired if not on day one, then within the first couple of months due to my skill level when compared to other employees. Even during the summer internship,  while some other interns managed to complete 1 or 2 projects, I could only manage to get halfway within the one I was given.

Additionally, most people studied a CS degree from a top (target) university and I feel it is impossible for me to compete with them considering I haven't even studied a CS degree, less alone at a target. 


I received very good feedback all through my internship at the bank and got along really well with everyone, not only my team. But as my starting date is drawing nearer, I'm beginning to waver in the belief of my abilities. I've tried to address my fear by learning as many programming topics as I can. However, there is only so little I can do, considering my masters degree commitments (dissertation, projects, exams etc.). I feel as if I was chosen to come back by mistake or something along those lines. 

I am not scared of the competition during the role and I am definitely not one for self pity. However, as I believe anyone coming into an investment bank is expected to hit the ground running, I just feel that I will be all but useless.

I would like some advice on what to do at this point? Rescind my acceptance of the offer?  Bearing in mind being a developer as been my passion for the past 6 years and I have tried to do as much as I could during my spare time (even going as far as to complete a year placement role as a software developer in between my degree), but essentially can't get the same level of knowledge (theoretical and practical) as someone studying it full time...

Many thanks!"

How would you decide?,nasagoog,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x50sf/fulltime_job_nasa_vs_bign_how_would_you_decide/,"I am a computer engineering student at a state school in the midwest and I was extremely fortunate to get both of these two offers. I am having an incredibly hard time deciding.


I interned at both NASA and BigN (search engine) while doing my undergrad and I loved working at both but they were very different experiences. The BigN internship was definitely more fun and exciting (tons of company sponsored events, freebies, etc), but the work at NASA was more interesting for sure. I loved my coworkers at both and I honestly believe I would be happy at either. How would you make this decision? 


As far as I can see, here are the pros/cons of each.


BigN

Pros

 * Very high compensation (~200k / year (salary, stock, bonus))
 * I like the location (sf bay area, CA)
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Amazing perks (Free breakfast/lunch/dinner, free shuttle to work, gym, misc benefits)
 * High prestige if I want to move
 * Good work-life balance (at least for my team)
 * Better Software engineering practices


Cons

 * Very expensive location (I would pay ~2k/month rent for a studio)
 * Specific project isn't very exciting to me
 * Not advancing humanity
 * All software (no hardware which I'm interested in)
 * Most people leave after a few years


NASA

Pros:

 * Very cool project/team (Robotics/Avionics)
 * Good Benefits
 * Cheap Location for living (~800 for a 1BR apartment)
 * Mixture of hardware and software
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Very good work-life balance
 * High Prestige
 * Advancing Humanity
 * Many people stay for life


Cons

 * Not a location I want to live in (very hot + humid)
 * Low compensation (starting around ~45k but likely to increase in the future. Will never match Google though)
 * Poorer software engineering practices
 * No real perks besides benefits
 * Government bureaucracy
 * Unsure what will happen under current administration / future administrations


So what do you guys think? I understand this is a very good problem to have, but I am having a really hard time deciding. I know money shouldn't be the biggest factor in my decision but after receiving the BigN offer it is hard to imagine accepting ~4-5x less. On the other hand, it's been a dream of mine to work for NASA and while I've already accomplished that in a way through my internships, I now have the option to continue with it. How would you decide?"

To their credit, they are a web dev company in a city with a lackluster university that doesn't teach **any** web development courses.

I've been a longtime lurker on this sub and the material here has been incredibly helpful. I will be graduating from a Top 10 Liberal Arts College this spring with a degree in Physics and CS. After two internships at a national government research laboratory in quantum computing, I decided to change career trajectories towards engineering rather than pure physics. I was lucky enough to be accepted to Columbia's M.S. in Electrical Engineering program as a Tesla Scholar ($2,500 per semester with other perks), with the catch being that living in NYC carries a high price tag alongside expensive tuition.
   
  I am very good at living frugally and that shouldn't be an issue, but I am nevertheless frightened at the thought of taking out hefty student loans. I should also mention that I am fortunate enough to not have any undergraduate debt. My question is: since I plan on an industry oriented career, is this an intelligent investment of my time and money? I am very passionate about my field (photonics) and Columbia is home to some of the best photonics researchers in the world. The course track will be very heavily physics oriented and overlaps greatly with the past research I have done (I will be on the photonics and devices track), so I am not concerned about having to make up ground for not being an undergraduate EE major. While I have considered work directly out of undergrad, I have found that getting a job with a physics degree is difficult compared to an engineering degree--I have general quantitative problem solving skills but no true specialization that is applicable to industry. 
    
  I will also mention that I have no interest in obtaining a PhD at this time as academia is not as enticing as it once was (that is another reason I got away from physics). The main things I wish to know are: 

* Will the connections, prestige, and quality of education of Columbia make the high price tag worth the expense? Economically it seems feasible if I am able to land a decent job post graduation but I'd like to hear other opinions as well.

* How should I go about taking out student loans if so? (i.e. government loans, family, private, etc.)

* Is getting this degree the best way for a physics undergraduate to break into engineering? My job search thus far has been mixed with multiple final round interviews but no offers.

Any advice or information is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:** Accepted to Columbia University M.S. in EE mostly unfunded as a physics undergraduate from a small liberal arts college. Given that I am passionate about the subject area and desire a career in industry, is this opportunity worth pursuing?

I'll make this quick and easy to read:

-Majored in accounting from a strong but not Ivy League private university, had a Big 4 internship that was *okay*, but not outstanding

-I accepted the return offer, but was unsure if I actually wanted to stay in the accounting field as a full-time position

-Now I'm 6 months into the job and I'm certain the work is not a good fit- simply put, I find it quite uninteresting and unfulfilling

^^^^.

^^^^.
**Here are the skills I'm most interested in learning/developing:**

-statistical modeling

-data analysis

-data visualization

-statistical programming (R, SQL, Tableau, Matlab, etc.). 

I've been independently learning R and SQL for the past year or so, and feel comfortable enough with them to list it on my resume. My current job is very Excel-heavy, so I feel comfortable with that as well.

^^^^.

^^^^.
What sorts of positions do you think I should look at? Maybe data analyst or business analyst? Would I be qualified for these positions?


Thanks very much!"

Miami is just so large and foreign to me that I wouldn't know how to begin planning a move.

No longer having the audio files that I stumbled across, I must do my best to tell you this story from memory. For me, it started on a hiking trip through the Florida Everglades. Camping and hiking are passions of mine. I’m outdoors any chance I can get. A couple of months ago, I went backpacking through the everglades and camped in some of the primitive sites the park has to offer. Feeling a little adventurous, I went off trail for a few nights. 

Normally, going off trail is a bad idea, especially in the Everglades. Several people have been lost in there, never to be seen again. Not to mention, the myriad of dangerous animals like alligators and crocodiles. 

I was fine, however. But during one of my nights camping off trail, I came across a small clearing that looked like it had been used as a campsite previously. There was a small pit in the ground with dusty embers inside. Other than a few small pieces of trash, it was empty. I thought I had missed the campers by mere days. 

I pulled the tent out of my bag and set it up in the middle of the clearing and used the already dug pit as my fire pit. Collecting a decent amount of firewood, I settled in for the night. Nothing of major importance happened that night but in the morning I stumbled across something…strange. 

A few feet away from the fire pit, I found another patch of disturbed Earth. While investigating, I realized it was a buried box. Removing the small, orange shovel- usually reserved for restroom purposes-I uncovered a green plastic box. Opening it, I found an audio recorder inside. It was strange but I didn’t think too much of it. Grabbing the recorder, I pressed play. 

I was greeted by the sound of a man describing some sort of ecological trip they were conducting. It seemed like research notes of some kind. Interested, I scooped the recorder up and dropped it in my pack. Placing the box back in the hole, I broke down my site and continued on my way.

Like I said before, nothing of importance happened on this trip. It was when I got home I found out how disturbing the files actually were. I will now recount the audio that I found on those files to the best of my ability and hopefully in the correct order. 

“This is Dr. Alan Crane with Cathy Cumberland,” the male voice on the recorder said. “We are documenting this trip with audio devices to better gather our research.” I could hear shuffling around as if some papers were being pushed aside. 

“Hey, don’t touch that,” said a female voice that I assumed was Cathy Cumberland.

“I need the space for my recorder. You want to get everything documented, right?” 

“Yes, but-“ 

“Now, now. Don’t give me any lip.” 

“Shut the hell up, Alan.” 

It was obvious the pair didn’t get along. I wondered why it was they were working together. Then the male voice spoke again, “Ah, and this is my intern Laura.” 

“You mean my intern,” Cathy shouted. 

“Nope, mine.” Alan whispered to the device. “Say hi, Laura.” 
A shy voice in the distance said hello.

“She is coming with us on this expedition to learn more about our particular field. Care to explain what it is we are studying, Laura?” 

She mumbled something about audio experimentation but seemed too shy to continue. Alan pulled the recorder away and pressed it close to his face saying, “That’s Ok, I’ll explain it since I’m the only one here who really understands it.” 

I don’t quite remember exactly how he explained it, a lot of it went over my head. But from what I could gather, they were studying levels of what they referred to as “sound pollution” deep in the Everglades. I guess there was a theory that sound produced by modern society was actually causing a shift in the ecosystem. Certain animals were no longer found in their normal habitats near busy cities and instead traveled deeper into the woods. This sets off a chain reaction in the ecosystem and throws a lot of it out of sync. Animals that were normally nocturnal have been found hunting during the day and so on. From what it sounded like, they were planning to take a backpacking trip into the Everglades with audio equipment and try and take “samples” to see how the audio levels were affecting the ecosystem. 

Not much happened in the first audio file. Alan talked more about the expedition and the type of data they would be collecting. I remember he spoke in a sort of arrogant way, almost as if he thought he was the smartest person in the room. I could tell his colleague, Cathy, didn’t take kindly to this and they hardly ever got along. 

On the second audio file, Alan was introducing another man by the name of Sean. Apparently, he was an entomologist. “State your name and profession for the record please,” Alan said into the recorder. 

“My name is Sean Whitcomb. I’m an entomologist.” 

“Bug scientist, in layman terms,” Alan teased. 

“Sure, you can call it that.” 

“And why are you tagging along with us on this trip? “ 

“To collect data about local insect species and how their patterns are disrupted at night due to audio vibrations caused by neighboring geographical locations of the human variety.” 

“In other words, to see if the bugs get pissed at the loud noises from cities.” Alan joked. 

“Correct.” 

He seemed like a shy guy as well. Him and Laura the intern would probably get along. Farther along on the files one last person was introduced. Again, Alan asked him to state his name and profession and why he was there for the “expedition record.” 

“I’m Brian Hunt, zoologist. I guess I’m doing the same thing everyone else is. Studying the local ecosystem where animals are concerned.” 

“That’s right, folks,” Alan interrupted. “We have an animal scientist, bug scientist, my intern, and two acousticians. We’re heading out into the Everglades with our expensive equipment to study audio patterns and have the zoologist and entomologist here to compare their data with ours.” 

He spoke sarcastically as if he didn’t like the others tagging along. I figured it was because he felt he could do a better job all by himself, but maybe it was because he had a thing for his colleague, Cathy, and saw the other two men as a threat. 

The rest of the audio followed the group preparing for the trip and heading out in one vehicle together. There was a lot of banter during the drive out. I think Alan was recording most of the trip without everyone’s knowledge. I’m not sure why he wanted all of it recorded, but maybe he just really liked to hear himself talk. 

Regardless, nothing of any major importance happened until the next audio file. They had camp all set up and night was falling. Their audio equipment had been set up deep in the woods, far from their campsite. Alan must have flipped his recorder back on and I heard them sitting around a crackling campfire talking and telling stories. Alan told some stupid story about the Florida Skunk Ape. I remember Brian, the zoologist, laugh about it and tell him why the animal didn’t exist. 

It was around this time something happened that terrified me. Cathy said she was going to hike out to the audio equipment to make sure everything was running properly before heading off to bed. None of the others decided to go with her, probably not wanting to make the trip out there. Cathy didn’t seem worried, however and headed off by herself. I listened to this part so many times, wishing I could tell her to turn around. I begged she wouldn’t find whatever it was she found out there. 

The ones left at camp, save for Laura who had gone off to bed, sat around the fire still talking. I can’t remember what it was they were talking about, but I remember the scream. It was a blood curdling cry unlike any other I had ever heard in my life. What was weird, it seemed to cut off as if the sound itself had been plucked out of the air. It was Cathy. 

Alan must have grabbed the recorder and slipped it in his pocket. Then next few minutes all I could hear was muffled shuffling around and what sounded like booming footsteps on the ground as if he were running. Finally, the recorder was pulled out of the pocket and I heard Alan say, “Cathy, what the hell is wrong? What are you looking at?” 

She mumbled something that I couldn’t hear and Alan asked again. “Please, turn around and tell us what you saw. A bear or something?” 

“A bear out here would be highly unli-“Brian started but Alan cut him off.

“No one cares, man. Cathy, what the hell was it?” 

Finally, I could hear Cathy turn around but what she was saying made no sense. 

“Darkness, utter darkness like I’ve never seen before. Green glowing orbs and silence. Oh god, the silence. I couldn’t even hear my own thoughts!” 

“If you’re pulling a prank on us, it’s not funny,” Brian said. 

Then something happened that was unnerving. The sounds of the woods around them ceased. The cicadas that chirped, the branches that swayed in the wind, even the faint chirps of bats as they fed stopped. All at once, there was silence. 

“What the hell?” Sean asked, noticing the silence. Then a sound broke over the recorder. It was utterly terrifying. It sounded like all of the sounds of the woods concentrated into one single wave of audio blasted in a stream, like someone had weaponized sound itself. I could hear them all scream and begin to run. 

They ran until they made it back to camp. Breathless, Alan said, “What the fuck was that thing?” 

“I’ve never seen anything like it before,” Brian said. 

“Cathy, is that what you saw out there? Is that why you screamed?” Alan asked. 

I heard a soft yes in return. 

“What the fuck?” Sean screamed. “It was like a shadow. Nothing but darkness. An outline of a person. You guys saw that, right?” 

“Yes,” Alan said. “But what about the eyes?” 

“Green orbs!” Brian shouted. “Just like Cathy said.” 

“It absorbed the sound, everything. How the hell could it do that? I’ve never heard of anything that can do that.” Alan rambled. 

They went on talking about the creature in hushed, terrified tones for a few more minutes. From their descriptions, I learned it was a tall, humanoid figure. Maybe about eight feet tall. It was completely dark, no color whatsoever. I pictured a shadow with a mind of its own. But it had bright green eyes that glowed like little spotlights in the middle of its pitch-black head. They said it could absorb sound in the area and push it forward in a focused cone of energy. 

“Get Laura out of her tent,” Alan screamed. “We’re getting the fuck out of here.” 

There was rustling and the sound of a tent being opened and then…

“Laura,” Alan began shouting. “She’s not in her tent. Where could she be.” 
My blood ran cold when I heard another scream on the file. It was Laura. Much like Cathy, it was loud and all at once silenced. Everyone began to talk over each other. I couldn’t understand a word. When the sounds of the forest slowly receded, I knew something was wrong. Desperately, I screamed at my computer screen for the group to run but they just stood there, questioning.
 
God, the silence was strange. All the sounds of the forest stopped in an instant. There was nothing. It shook me to my very core. As I waited for the inevitable wave of sound to return, a terrible thought crossed my mind. 

Whatever had happened on these files happened where I had camped only a few nights before. Whatever it was that attacked these people could have come after me. At least, I thought. Maybe the group had found a way to defeat it. I had to get to the end. I had to know what happened. 

The blast of sound did return and the audio file clicked off. I think the rest of the file was corrupted. Before it ended, however, there was this odd mechanical hiss. It reminded me of the sound an old cassette tape made when the film got caught. 

Trying to listen to the next file, I found it was corrupted as well. I was frantic. I wanted to know what was happening. I clicked on the next file and crossed my fingers. It started with the sound of a man sobbing. I recognized it as Alan. Leaves shuffled underneath him as he moved. 

“It took them,” he cried. “There was sound and darkness and then they were gone. All of them.” He continued to sob. “I tried to save them. I think it’s coming back for me.” 

Again, the sounds of the woods stopped. I could hear Alan jump to his feet and start running, panting as he went. He tried to explain what was happening, but I couldn’t understand him. He ran for the remainder of the file. When it ended, I quickly played the next.

“I think we lost it,” Brian was saying. I realized this file was out of order. From what I could gather, they ran shortly after being blasted by the sound wave. Laura wasn’t with them. They had left her out there. Left her to the fate of that thing. I guess I didn’t blame them. 

There wasn’t much of importance on this file. The group mostly walked and talked about the being they had seen. They argued about which way was out, which way was back. The last thing on the file was the sound of silence once again. It had returned. 

Only one file remained. I doubled clicked it and listened to the distressed voice of Alan. “I’m the only one left,” he stammered. “It’s coming back for me, I can feel it. I stumbled across our camp again. I’ve been trying to get out of these god damned woods for hours and I was walking in a fucking circle.” He laughed. “Perfect.” 

I heard the sound of something unzip. I figured it was his pack. 

“I’m going to bury this recorder. I know I won’t make it out of these woods. If someone should stumble across these, know what happened here. I don’t know if they’re dead but they’re all gone. Brian, Sean, Laura, and Cathy. It took them all. It was like a cloud of black smoke. It circled them. When the black fog cleared, they were gone. It took them one by one until only I was left. It’s going to take me too. No matter where I go, it will find me. I don’t know how I know that, I just do. Even if I made it out of these woods tonight, it would eventually find me.” 

My hands were actually shaking as I listened. I couldn’t believe something like this was actually happening. This shit didn’t really happen, did it? Maybe in movies but not real life. 

“To the person who finds this recorder, get away from here. Run. Don’t stop until you get out of these woods. If you happen upon this, this thing, don’t look it in the eyes. Those green orbs are the death of you!” 

With that, the file ended and that was it. There was nothing else. 

Dumbfounded, I looked up the people from the recordings. All of them are missing. Their equipment had been found in the woods. The sensitive audio equipment they had used had all been scrambled. It seemed the only thing that had survived the attack was the recorder. 

I had planned to take the recorder to the police. I thought they should hear what was on it. Maybe they could figure out what the hell was in the woods that night. Maybe they were all out there still and had a chance, though somehow, I knew it wasn’t true. They were most likely gone. I locked the recorder away in my desk and went to bed, terrified to dream of the creature. 
When I awoke in the morning, the recorder was gone. The desk was locked but the recorder was no longer in it. I have no fucking clue where the damn thing went. What’s worse, the audio files I had copied to my computer were gone too. Any proof I had that some creature had taken that group of people was gone. Who had taken it? In my mind, there was only one explanation. It was the creature. It had come for the proof of its existence. Does it know about me? Will it be watching me now? 

I sit here now, writing this here. No one else would believe but I figured you all might. It’s been a day since the recorder went missing. Thinking that I only misplaced it, I tore my house apart. It wasn’t there. I think it wants to come for me. Last night, the noise outside my bedroom window stopped. I buried my face in the pillow and stayed that way all night. Whatever happens, I will do my best to never look it in the eyes.

5xcvhn,1,2017-03-03,Overachieved or Underachieved,Mysterio446,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/5xcvhn/overachieved_or_underachieved/,"Today is my birthday, I turned 30. Since I was a kid I had always loved this day, waking up on this day make me feel hopeful and happy within. Today I remembered a thought which I had in my early 20's that the day I will turn 30 I will reach a certain stage in my life, which I named it ""Successful"". But looking at myself today I feel confused as to whether I have Overachieved or Underachieved. The feeling of Overachieved is because I have came a long way from what I was 10 years back, moved to a different country, got my Masters degree, out of all odds landed a internship in one of the dream companies straight out of University, manage to land in well earning jobs. No Debt at this day, took care of a family finances as a responsible Man. The proud feeling in family eyes definitely make me feel I have achieved something good.

The feeling of Underachieved is because I read somewhere in My early 20's and I started believing that the age of 20 to 30 is what decides if you have been successful or not. In my early 20's successful for me meant a lot of money, respect, power etc. Today when I look at my savings or investments they are good but not extra-ordinary as what myself in 20's would not call it successful. I don't feel that I have achieved something extra ordinary, probably might be that I got used to what I have achieved so far, I don't know.

I met someone at a show who is the senior engineer for a luxury goods company that offered me to apply for a summer internship after mentioning to him that I'm a CS student at a top tier school. He invited me to take a look at their offices soon after, which I did, and we had a sort of informal mix of an interview and hang out that went well. He forwarded my resume to the HR dept and a recruiter followed up with me for a 20 minute phone interview. I was told they exclusively code in Javascript. They asked if I had any experience with Javascript and I was honest, telling them I only spent around 50 hours learning and using it during the summer for an online code camp. I did tell them I've used Java and C in classes, though. I made it to the next round phone interview, which was with an engineer. He had told me they code exclusively in Javascript and had asked again what my experience was with Javascript. I had described some of my coursework and the languages I've used, but there were no technical or screening questions at all. I had passed that round too and now I'm at what seems like the final round, apparently a 2.5-3.5 hour interview at the HQ. What sort of things will they likely test me on or what do they expect from me, given how little I know Javascript? I've checked out their Glassdoor questions but I'm unsure how much would apply to me given my position. Thanks in advance."

The highest paying offer that I've received thus far is a software engineering internship at JHU APL, more specifically in the cybersecurity group, but I have a few concerns about the position. First off, I'm worried that things could get very bureaucratic due to the nature of the work. Also, I'm curious as to how a position like this would look to the Big 4 and similar companies, as I am planning on applying to such positions for Summer 2018. I've received a few offers from startups in the area that seem like they might offer better experience as they have great culture, let their interns be more hands on, and make most of their software open source where interns can be seen as contributors. I feel as if I would have much stronger portfolio at the end of the summer working at one of these startups, as most work I would do at APL would be confidential. However, the startups I've received offers from pay significantly less and are widely unknown. Being this is my first internship, what option do you think would be the best to jump-start my career?"

So, I've been accepted for Computer Engineering at UIUC, GT and Purdue. Overall, UIUC would have the highest cost at $27,000. Whereas GT and Purdue would end up at around $20,000-$22,000.

Are there any specific benefits of UIUC in contrast to the others? Specifically career fairs, internships and co-ops as an undergrad. I plan to get a MS degree as well, if that's of any help.


Another question I have is how hard is it to find a part-time job on campus as a freshman at UIUC?

2. I received CTCI as a gift from friends would starting to read that help me out now or is it too early? I haven't opened it atall yet.

Looking at the Waterloo application, I have some questions:
1. Do they only look at GPA? I go to a small school that doesn't offer math beyond ap calc ab(which I took junior year), so would they still look at my senior year grade GPA or sat? Is it cumulative high school GPA or junior and senior year only?
2. for someone who is not a mathematical genius, how manageable is the cs circulum(how many hours a week do u study)
3. Should I apply for the co-op or graduate in 4 years. Is the extra year in lost wages worth the additional internship experience?

I have built a PC before, but I've been out of the game for some time.

* RGB RAM because why the hell not?

5xghxd,4,2017-03-04,Offered a summer teaching internship. Requesting Advice!,nolin9889,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xghxd/offered_a_summer_teaching_internship_requesting/,"First time posting in this subreddit, so I apologize if I'm breaking any rules.

I'm a senior majoring in CS graduating this December at a mid-tier UC in southern california (i.e. not Berkeley). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get an internship in previous years. 

I know it's not ideal. But there were personal circumstances such that for all intents and purposes I started my CS major classes in the fall of 2015, so I didn't have enough CS knowledge to start looking until last summer. I wasnt able to find an internship last summer, so i opted to do a month of travel + a month of summer school instead. This year, I applied to more places and was rejected/ignored for a few internships. 

The only offer I have this summer is a position as instructor at iD Tech Camps. For those of you who haven't heard of this company, they offer week-long coding instruction to kids and teenagers in a camp setting, from June through early August. I'll be teaching a group 7-8 high school and middle school students how to code: languages like java, C++, or python &amp; raspberry pi depending on which class I end up teaching. This is for 8-6pm, five days a week, with a new group of students every week.

The position itself doesn't pay too much, though this doesn't really bother me. BUT I'm wondering if it's a worthwhile use of my summer. 

Pros, in my view:

1) Something to put on my resume. Not a software development position, but a whole lot better than nothing (?)

2) brush up on coding fundamentals; i've heard it said that teaching something is a good way to understand it yourself

3) improve my speaking and presentation skills, and help me become more social (am an introvert)


Cons:

1) Not a software development position, so not great on resume. Not sure how much of an impact it'll have in helping me find a job after graduation.

2) Opportunity cost--maybe the time could be better spent working on personal projects and practicing interview questions. Perhaps even travel to Europe instead?



I do have an interview with a company developing wi-fi diagnostics next Wednesday through my school's Team Internship Program. Needless to say, I'll do my best to get that position, but my school's giant population of CS undergrads makes these programs extremely competitive, so my chances isn't very high.

I'd like any and all advice. Should I take the teaching position, or do  personal projects to brush up my resume + study for interviews? Thanks.


TL;DR: is an internship teaching coding any good for my resume? Or should I spend my summer trying to do personal projects and study for coding interviews?


EDIT: Thanks for the advice, everyone! I ended up getting the software development internship at aforementioned company. Which is a good thing too, since the hiring manager at iD Tech never called me after the email offer and request for commitment details."

My career advisor said that I should have no problems getting a Summer engineering internship, and that I might be able to land a job with my science degree and background in CS. I want to get an engineering (or coding) job, but what would I be best suited for now or in the near future? I really do not care what the job is as long as it is permanent and pays more than 30k/yr, because that’s what I make now as a Nurse’s Aide. I currently live in Portland, OR if that matters.

**My background:**

* 25, German citizenship
* will graduate with my Master's (Media Studies) in September. 
* previous work experience of three years in different jobs media-related /PR and communication
* no debt - but also no savings ...
* fluent in German, English

**My problem / wish / plan:**
Graduating in September, I cannot stand the idea of going back to my hometown and find a corporate job immediately. However, I know I will go back there eventually as I want to settle with my long-term boyfriend. Nevertheless, I am not ready for this yet and feel like I need some “adventure” or experience on my own, abroad, to grow and gain new perspectives before I try to set up a steady life for me. 
Call it Quarterlife Crisis, First-World-Problem or Travelbird Syndrome. 

To make the long story short for you:  I am searching for an opportunity to life abroad for 3-4 months. However, I need to find a way to fund this endeavour on the go. I bring some work experience and have searched for internships as they provide the possibility to work for a limited amount of time. However, 99% of them do not pay, especially in media-related fields … 

There is a knot in my head that says that because I have previous work experience, I must find something “qualified” that looks good on my CV. I know it is ridiculous, but I cannot get this twist out. Maybe someone has an idea? Also, I would absolutely work in retail or related, but it would be lovely if it was indoors. :D

Does anyone know of any opportunities to make a (small, short-term) living abroad? I am thankful for all opinions, advice and experiences as I feel stuck right now.



Thank you so so much!

(also need career advice),tigim101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xief0/can_get_employer_to_pay_for_dev_course_possibly/,"I posted this is r/learnprogramming, figured it would fit in better here.  
  
I'm in a unique position, I just graduated with a mechanical engineering degree in NYC, and the first job I was thrown was this ""data center engineer"" position, at this major financial institution (started in September), where I spent most of my time plugging in cables and racking servers. I had it before I graduated so I just took it so I could start paying off bills. Short story, it sucks and I see no growth in it.   
   
They also have this full stack application they use to monitor all their data centers globally, and I've been slowly pushing/getting pushed into doing that, possibly full time. It looks pretty simple on the front end side, and the back end is in C++. The backend is pretty reliable so far and it definitely needs a lot more love on the front end. It uses HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery. I got a 3 month stint where they are making me only work on this application full time, since it has basically been on life support for 2 years. Right now I'm mostly doing operational tasks that don't involve any coding, but I have the opportunity to pick it up. The people who wrote it (who moved on to do other things in the company and seems like they don't want to support it anymore) are saying I could possibly get the company to pay for some dev courses (probably a few thousand $$ max).     &amp;nbsp;    

So right now I basically have an opportunity to learn programming on my own (while getting paid), other than the basic upkeep of the application I have a lot of free time, and don't really have a boss right now. I'm thinking of turning this into a transitional opportunity for me, where I can learn development and then transition into a better software engineering job.     &amp;nbsp;  

What are some good online (maybe in person in NYC) courses that I should take? The two developers told me not to sell myself too short and pay for some super beginner web dev course that only has html and css, since I studied engineering and should pick up the basics pretty quickly. Seems like they prefer I learned fullstack.   
  
  &amp;nbsp;    


    

These are the options I see right now:      
    
Udacity Full stack with Uconnect (once/wk in person meetups) : $299/month (about 3 months completion)     

CodeAcademy ready, front end only: $500 OTP, 8 weeks     

Thinkful frontend, with once a week mentorship: $500 per month (about 3 months completion)      

General Assembly, frontend or javascript, in person 2x/wk in NYC. : $3950 OTP. (for this one they say javascript needs basics of HTML and CSS, maybe I could pick this up on my own beforehand?)    

   
   
&amp;nbsp;  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
  
   
Also what are your takes on me using this to transition into software development? I didn't do much internships, just two but they more gear towards construction and facilities. My GPA was a 3.6, went to a small state school that isn't too well known outside a few niche industries. Only programming kind of knowledge I have is some MatLab, which I used in a machine learning elective I took in my last semester.   

Also in case anyone is interested, compensation is:  
$60k base salary, + annual bonus (roughly 15% of base), + overtime over 40 hrs (time a half, roughy 43-44$/hr)  
   
Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks!"

While I am not opposed to staying at Oregon State for my masters the faculty member I worked under has encouraged me to pursue a PhD and go elsewhere. I have a lot of respect for him and he talked with me for a few hours about this topic. My girlfriend and I are convinced that this would be a great opportunity and that I should pursue this now rather than later.

We have been together for 3 years now and have no intentions of breaking our relationship off. She is a pre-nursing student at a community college back in Portland and is kicking some major ass. She has a 4.0 and is a certified CNA with work experience. However, she has been working at her degree slowly as she needs to work (swim instructor) to pay for school. She will be completing the pre-requisites required for all BSN programs in Oregon this spring term.

Now, many of the schools I am considering either have a nursing program or are within 20 minutes of other respected nursing schools (University of Northern Colorado for instance). She is very excited about going out of state although she will miss her family a lot. At first she worried about leaving but her family has really encouraged her to go out and see the world. They are all loving and supporting people and are just happy to see her working towards a degree (her sister and her are the first to do so).

So I am beyond grateful that we have the support to do this but I still have some concerns. I currently work part time to pay for living but I have saved some money for an emergency fund. This summer I am lucky to have an amazing internship opportunity which will only help me when I apply to schools in the fall. She will also be applying to schools in the fall but she intends to work all next year as a CNA 40+ hours a week to save money. I think we will have enough to get started in another state but from there I am a little worried.

I am expecting (hopefully) to receive some sort of research or graduate teaching position. It won't be a lot but I am used to living off of less than $10,000 a year so I may actually have a little more money than usual. However, she will need to find a job to help with expenses. We have talked about this and she was already planning on doing so.

We have never lived together but we don't want to expand our already somewhat long-distance relationship into an even larger one. We think that this is worth the risk because it may help us and our relationship grow.

Honestly, I typed a lot of this intending to ask a lot of questions but I don't really know what to ask. I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar position and has any advice. I would really appreciate your insight."
5xjzfa,12,2017-03-04,How to get referrals for top companies or even have a chance to interview if you hardly know anyone working at prestigious companies?,rmislj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xjzfa/how_to_get_referrals_for_top_companies_or_even/,"Hi,

A bit of a background before going in:
Hiring for interns is slowing down and I was lucky enough to secure an internship from the big e-commerce company for next summer. I applied to more than 200 internship postings throughout  September to early February, using tools such as intern.supply and Apply Everywhere (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7vxbL0Wjt58Q6M73b3leNjIYSkUeej1E8afQF86ZeQ/edit)
. Throughout the process, I was only able to get no more than 20 interviews with different companies. This is through straight online applications with no referrals. This is less than 10% callbacks for a college junior that had a previous internship as a SDET and 3.9+ GPA.

Now, looking forward, I really want to know an appropriate strategy going forward when I'll be looking for a new grad in the fall. I'm quite aware of the abysmal callback rate when blindly apply online and almost everyone suggests getting referrals in order to have a better chance to land interviews, but how can I magically ""get referrals"" when I'm not in the position to do so?

Here's a fun read that seems almost fictional that supports how important referrals are. I linked the second part but feel free to read the shorter first part as well. 
http://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-ii/

I go to an very uncompetitive college where students don't care much about their career and are generally unmotivated. It's a big state school but also very hard to find other students that have internship experience in my school. As an example, our school hosts annual contests that students can participate in by talking about their previous summer internship. There were only 15 submissions out of 20,000 enrolled students. No one hires from my school and STEM career fairs consist of 30 companies that no one has heard of that are paying $15/hr without benefits and a 2.5 or lower on Glassdoor.  I am born in the US and as a first generation Asian American, the first person in my family to go to college and pursue Computer Science. As such, no one in my family are working in tech. I have lived in the suburbs Southern California since I was born, highly populated by Asian and Hispanic immigrants working in other industries. The area has no reputable tech companies nearby (can't think of any off the top of my head) and very little tech influence. Tech and CS in particular were seen as nerdy and an undesirable career path. While attending school in this area, peers are mostly first generation Americans that are of low and social status (I am too) that are just as clueless as me, the first person in their family going to school in the US and possible college. 

As such, I don't have many strong connections that could possibly help me, although everyone keeps saying how important it is and to not just apply to companies online. All I have next year are possible referrals from Apple and Facebook. I didn't even get interviews with any top company except Amazon, if that's even considered a top company anymore, and a few other tier 2-3 companies that you guys would have a hard time recognizing. 

Is there a better way to go through the application system as someone who doesn't have the luxury to know many people working in the tech industry? I don't even get a chance at interviews with ""unicorns"" and would love to see, at the very least, where I stand if I were to interview at places such as AirBnb, Zillow, Box, Uber, Palantir, IBM, Nvidia, eBay, Microsoft, Google, etc. The list goes on and on. 

Let me know what you guys think."

My dream is to work for a non-rainforest top tech company. For the rainforest internship this summer, all I had to do was 2 online coding assessments which I felt were way too easy-- far easier than the other big n companies I'd imagine. I feel like all I've gotten so far in my life has been pure luck.

5xl02x,1,2017-03-04,Trying to come up with a build that is a good mix of budget and power for gaming and potentially deep learning.,hellfirebound,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5xl02x/trying_to_come_up_with_a_build_that_is_a_good_mix/,"Ok, so I'm going to try to build a gaming rig that I could also eventually use to play around with deep learning. I'm a computer science student in the midst of my second year, so the kind of stuff I'll be doing isn't something where I need the most computational power. I'm also not trying too hard to future proof it because I plan on getting my skills sharp enough to land an internship next summer, and software engineering internships pay pretty well. 

My original Idea was to build a rig with kaby lake and a 1080 because of the price drop of both, but after doing the math the build wind up being over $1100 not including a monitor, or input devices. 

so here's what I'm looking for:
the ability to play most modern games at 1080p with 60 fps. (to name a few I really want to play: mass effect Andromeda, Agony, and Resident evil 7, etc.), I'm really not looking to max out every setting, but to play the game at or slightly above recommended settings. 

cpu with full 40 PCIe lanes and correct PCIe spec for the motherboard. this allows me to add more gpus later. I'm not to concerned with clock speed, so long as the cpu doesn't wind up being a point of failure for trying to play games, or play around with data. 

motherboard needs to have USB-C and hdmi or vga support(though I can compromise on the usb-c), and would prefer DDR4(though I'm still not sure if this will make a difference for most games). 

I have a 186 gig SSD from a laptop that recently died(the reason I decided to build a rig), so a 1 TB hd would probably be all I need. (I would appreciate recommendations on this note but It's not really necessary, I can find affordable 1TB HDDs). 

and a full size tower case. mainly so I can add parts later, and leave plenty of room. granted this rig is only until I start interning or doing co-op, so this isn't an absolute requirement. 

oh and don't worry about linking a copy of windows 10, I'm going with arch linux. 

price range $5-800. I don't want a pre-build; I have no experience trying to build on a budget(or build at all for that matter) so I'd appreciate any help in either generating a build or points in the right direction. "

I'm not sure if I should post it in the Office Hours thread, but since it does not apply only to professors, I decided to post it here. Sorry if this was a mistake.

Look, I'm a computer engineering undergraduate. In my country, my CE course takes at least 5 years, by the standard curriculum, but I'm completing it in 6 because I spent one year studying abroad in the US. Well, I'm currently somewhere near my 7th semester and I still got 2 more years until I get my degree. I could actually get credit for all the classes I took while studying abroad, but I wanted to really take it easy and have some time for my hobbies and also to dedicate myself to the classes I was taking and to the projects I was getting into at the lab I'm working.

I've worked on several projects at the same virtual reality and image processing lab in my university since I was on my second semester and I got really fascinated by researching and making science. I have already published a 4 page paper with a poster in a major conference (ACM SAC 2017) in my field as the main author and I also have been active on events and conference contests, resulting in two 2 page extended abstracts with some friends, also. I mean, my grades are also really good and I was thrilled at the thought of pursuing a masters program and, finally, a PhD to become a researcher and a professor, just like my adviser. Since I had only worked at the lab at the time, I wanted to see what it was like to work at a company, so I applied for an internship. I worked for a year in one and for 3 months in another, only to realize that I had absolutely no attachment to the projects and didn't really felt motivated to work, since the objectives were quite different compared to working in an academic environment, which assured to me that working at the lab was the right thing for me to do.

The problem is that after talking to some colleagues (two PhD students and a professor) recently, I came to realize that there is a lot of self-interest when a peer is reviewing a paper and that a great deal of the published papers are not even read. The proposed modifications are so minimal and specific that it just supports the ""publish or perish"" idea. I kinda lost that thing I had about publishing papers, you know? I mean, I wanted to really invest a great deal of time on something and publish a meaningful project that would actually be useful or at least read, but it seems that my adviser needs to fulfill a publication quota, so there is always not much time to actually get into a paper and produce a useful result. I don't blame him, he's a great guy, and it is either this or not actually getting fund for anything and getting in trouble with the university/government for not publishing. I really enjoy working with him and I feel that I have grown a lot since I started working at his lab, but I just find that all the things I did, although it was cool and got me some publications, my actual contribution is not really useful. I want to contribute to science and create knowledge, but it seems kinda rigged, you know? I can't really focus on something interesting when we need to meet publishing quotas and all of this is really frustrating me to the point that I'm not sure anymore about my future, since I don't enjoy working at companies and the academia has become frustrating, since it seems unreasonably difficult to make useful science.

Does anyone has any advice for me about what to do?"
5xllrh,8,2017-03-05,Reneging internship offer,superdankswag,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xllrh/reneging_internship_offer/,"Hi guys,

I signed an agreement over this past winter break to intern at a company for the summer of 2017. At the time, I was content and looking forward to working at the position over the summer. The recruiter actively went out of his way to find me online (this is rare for me since I've usually been the one knocking on company's doors). The interviewers were kind and the recruiter helped me out so much.

However, one of the programs I applied to/interviewed with before I accepted the offer just reached out to me and I very much would like to take the offer. I think that this program aligns much better with my interests and would allow me to grow much more in terms of personal development and my CS career.

I've already mulled over the moral/ethical decisions in my head, reading Quora posts/advice and random blogs. What I got out of reading this stuff online is that it's okay to make decisions for my own self interest, but to just be aware of the consequences. So I plan to renege on my accepted offer to go with the second offer. 

But I can't help but feel guilty and I would like to call my recruiter to be honest about my situation, especially since he helped me out so much. I would also like to do this as soon as possible to allow them enough time to hopefully get in another candidate for the summer.

Before I call him, one of the things that I'm worried about is that he will ask me what program I decided to take in place of theirs. Should I tell him? If I do tell him, I'm paranoid that he might contact the new company about what I did. If I don't tell him, I feel like I'm not being honest enough with him.

And just in general, what kinds of things should I say when I renege? I want to be honest, thankful, and apologize as well. 

Any advice is appreciated

Thanks

TL;DR
Accepted offer from company A. Got a new offer from company B and plan to accept it as it much much better aligns with personal interest. Need advice on how to go about communicating this with my recruiter from company A, as the recruiter was so helpful and kind to me."

I'm very certain I'm about to get a position at a well established global company as a Technical Support Representative troubleshooting their tax software material for clients. Now my interest really isn't in support work.  I've been maintaining and running my school's lab for 4 years and been hired as a member of a network engineering team for my internship and I stayed with them after my internship ended. 

I've been putting out many applications (loads of fun to be had there), and I got a few other interviews that look like they'll pan out, but all lower end support work for the most part. 

My dilemma is that I believe that the tech support work will allow me to learn and gain a foothold within a great company that I really want to work for, has great benefits, work/life balance, and great lateral movement between teams and is also very close to home. But, it's not necessarily related to my internship or work experiences.  

So do I take the position and wait there a year and learn the company and THEN move (or look for) into a more suitable position within the company, or do I keep on the job hunt and wait for something better? 

I appreciate the help!

I don't even know where to begin, i feel like the whole relatiobnship has a some bearing to my situation. I guess i could start by how we met. 

Right of the bat, our relationship started out with lies. She claimed that she was been beaten by her abusive ex, and me like a fucking idiot valiant prince, i went in to comfort her. I went to her coffee shop to get coffee all the time, and she would talk to me about this or that, nothing really specific. Until one day, she was looking very distraught and i asked her what was going on. She told me that her ex had visited the night before and had gotten a little rough with her, and she left some bruises on her arm. So i was upset because i am very against people getting beaten or taken advantage. I started talking to her more and more often, and obviously she was very attractive so i kinda had the hots for her anyway, so i so it as a way to get to know her, and obviously I felt like she trusted me because she would tell me her very personal situation. As the week went by it remember her coming into her job very fragile-looking, and of course since she had mentioned her ex had gotten rough with her, i asked her if everything was okay. It was at this point that she told me her ex had gone to her house the night before and basically punched her. She had a very convincing black eye, and more bruises on her neck and arms. Honestly i was just very gullible and I felt like I needed to help this dansel in distress. We ended up getting together because she liked me and i liked her. Honestly things were going very welll at the beginning. She was very caring, she bought me things, she would pick up the check from time to time, and i was like really into her.

The only thing that was bad about our first months of our relationship was that her ex would keep contacting her and supposedly stalk her, it even got to the point where she told me she was pressing charges against this guy because he had gone to her house and pulled a gun on her. She even told me that the cops had come and that they had caught the guy while he was trying to leave, and that he was going to go to jail. I never really got involved with that situation as much as i should have. Now, looking back into it, it is very obvious why she never got me involved. It was all lies. One of her supposedly friends, who happens to work at the same coffee shop, told me that she had made all that stuff about her ex beating her, She used that to get me interested in her. There was never any case with the police, and all the bruises i saw on her, were basically just make-up. At the same time that this was going on, she was also making social media profiles acting as my ex. She, at the end of the relationship, admitted to making said profiles. She never told me why she made them, but she was using those profiles to send herself nasty messages about my ex saying how i was going to get back with her, that ""she was nothing but a roadblock"" and that i was going to realize how great my ex was, and that eventually i was going to get back with her. I feel like she was just very insecure about our relationship, and she was using those fake profiles to measure my feeling for her and my ex. 

Also around this time, she pretty broke the news to me that she had gone to the doctors and there were two possibilities. Either, she was pregnant, or she had an ovarian tumor. As things went on, she basically it turned out that she was both. and according to her, she aborted the baby. Again, i offered to go to doctors consultations, and do anything i could do to help her out. She never budged, she pretty much took care of it on her own, because we were such a young couple that she didn't want things to get tarnished by the situation. The other part of this ordeal, that i feel is very important, is the fact that she claimed to have cancer. After she supposedly aborted the baby, she told me that they had run some tests, and that she did in fact have a tumor. She said she almost didn't want to tell me because she told me that when i found out, i would just leave her. I obviously was very taken back by this revelation. Naturally i tried to comfort her, and be of any help. She told me that she didn't want to burden me, and that we should probably just split up as she didn't want me to see her all messed up. Any time i would offer to go to the clinic or the doctor, she would say it was fine, that she would go on her own. I now know, that this were all lies, and she had never had cancer, and I didn't want to suspect something like that, as it is such a fucked up thing to do. But like i said, things just weren't adding up. This was confirmed by on of her co-workers, who told me this isn't the first time she said something in that ballpark. The co-worker claims that she had said she had cancer in the past, and that she has faked many pregnancies.

The lies kept on piling up. The day that i realized that this girl may not be entirely truthful with me, she basically told me she had graduated as a registered nurse, and that she was going to start her internship at a hospital. Over the months leading up to this day, she was asking me if it was okay if she would go in to work at th hospital, as she was on-call. She said she didn't have a set schedule so they would just give her days that she could go in, and she would go in. On this day, she called me in the morning and told me she was going to go for a shift at the hospital, and that she would see me after. When she got to my house around 6pm, something didn't sit right with me, i greeted her in and i noticed her scrubs looked brand new, as in when they had just been unfolded after been just unpackaged, like it still had the crests on the shirt. I asked her how her day had gone at the hospital with an incredulous tone, and she just rolled with it, she basically told me, some guy had gone in and his hand had been almost cut off and Yadira yards yadda. From that point on, i was very careful with what i would believe from her. I recently found out that she never even graduated, let alone gotten a job at a hospital. One of her coworkers basically told me alll that.

We stopped being intimate, and that just made things worse. I honestly couldn't bring it on myself to have sex with someone i didn't trust, or was basically lying to me, but i also didn't have any evidence to support my suspicions, they were just that, gut feelings. It wasn't until later that month, when she said, On a Sunday night i may add, that she was going to go for her treatment. I thought this was very suspicious, and since I worked pretty close by to her house, i went to check to see if she was lying. Her car was there, and since there was a possibility that she may have uber or picked up a ride, i texted her asking if she had. She replied, not knowing that i knew about her car been there, that she always drives herself, she had asked her brother but he was unavailable (he didn't live with her). This confirmed all my suspicions, i knew that she was lying, i just didn't know about how much.

Around this time, is started noticing her gaining weight, and i straight up asked her if she was pregnant and if we needed to go to the doctors for check-up, or what not. She replied, very hurt at the notion implying that she was, that there is no way she could be pregnant, as she had ovarian cancer. 

The combination of finding out about all this things, made me realized that I shouldn't be anywhere near someone like her. I didn't know when i broke up with her that she was pregnant, as i had asked her plenty of more times as her tummy continued to grow. I saw all the signs but she kept denying everything. I also didn't know about her not graduating from nursing school, or working at the hospital, or he lying about having cancer, and totally dragging her ex's name through the dirt by making up the stories about him beating her up. The only thing i knew when we broke up last month was that she was a dishonest person, and that she was making fake profiles impersonating my ex.

Now I honestly feel so lost, her co-worker basically told me today that she had told her manager about her being pregnant because she needed to work less hours.. So all this time i was trying to go to the doctors with her and, her supposedly having cancer, are just lies. I honestly don't understand why she wont tell me. I have no idea what to do. I honestly don't want anything to do with her. But know there is a human life involved. I need your guys' help. What should i do, what kind of steps do i need to take in order to protect myself. I am probably gonna have to get a lawyer, but I don't even know where to start looking, or how much money that's all going to be. I don't make a lot of money, i live pretty comfortably, but that's only because I don't have anybody else to care for.



Please, i am literally shaken and i feel like my life is going to end. 

Tl/dr: My ex is a pathological liar, while in the relationship she claimed there is no way she could be pregnant, as she supposedly had cancer. Ended up being a lie. I am 99.9% sure she's pregnant, but she wont admit to it.

If she decides to keep the baby, i would love to have custody of the baby. I am also concerned. As she mentioned to someone that she wouldn't need me and the she will do it on her own. If she tells me this, what are the legal ramifications of that statement. I know am fucked, i just want to know how badly.

&gt;**Minimum qualifications:**   

&gt;* Must be a first-year or second-year student (freshman or sophomore) **currently attending a 4-year Bachelor's program**, majoring or intending to major in computer science or related technical field.
&gt;* First-year students must have taken one Computer Science course by end of first semester. (AP or IB Computer Science is acceptable).
&gt;* Must be completing their Bachelor's program between April 2019 and August 2020.
&gt;* Must be attending an **undergraduate university** in North America.  

All that is pointing to only uni students, not community college students. It's a bummer, as I *really* want to take an internship during the summer between Freshman and Sophomore year. That means I'd have to wait until I transfer before applying to internships. That would leave me with 2 instead of 3 planned internships.

I'm currently in my Junior year of undergrad (bioinformatics major) and starting to look at careers/graduate school. Ultimately, I'm going to talk to my undergrad research advisor about these things, but I have some questions I'd like to figure out before then. So:

* What general job opportunities are there available for someone with a b.s. in bioinformatics? I don't really want to do research, but rather something on the applicable side.

* Is it feasible to go right from undergrad to a PhD program? I have a good GPA, research experience, and hopefully by the time I graduate an internship and publication.

* What other questions should I be asking/asking myself to narrow down what i'd like to focus on?

Any other relevant questions/information you can provide would be fantastic. Thanks!"
5xmz9l,24,2017-03-05,Is there any fixing this? I think I am literally un-employable.,oksygo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5xmz9l/is_there_any_fixing_this_i_think_i_am_literally/,"First, I know I've fucked up big time. Second, throwaway account because of how ashamed I am that I let it get this bad. ~~I'll try to keep this short~~ This is going to be long.

A little about me: I graduated in 2009 top of my class with a BSc in mechanical engineering from a very respected engineering school.

Mistake 1 (and this is the big one): I have ADHD. I was diagnosed when I was 7-8 and was medicated from such a young age that I never learned how to do stuff that most people take for granted, like how to study on my own, because the medication did it for me. There were times in high school I tried to go off the meds, but my grades would always go to shit, so it wasn't long before I started taking meds again. Fast forward to college and I'm still medicated. One of the side effects of the medication is it makes me reclusive so I always had my nose in a book, happy to spend all my time studying which meant I didn't network literally at all, so I knew precisely zero people who matter after graduation.

Mistake 2: I didn't take any internships while in college because I was always taking summer classes so I could still graduate in 4 years while also doing an academic year abroad.

Mistake 3: After graduation, I decided I would take a couple months off to just relax and unwind after four years of 8 A.M. classes and constantly being on the go. Well, a couple months turns into 6. 6 months turns into a year. I finally start applying for entry level engineering positions and get a couple interviews despite having zero experience and no references except for a few of my former professors. I actually get a call back from one company and they fly me and a bunch of other candidates to New York for more interviews and hands-on stuff. It turned out to be a very corporate situation (think massive cube farm) and this scares the shit out of me so I decide I'm going to ""work for myself."" Great fucking decision to make based on what it was like to interview with one company, right? So I start making and selling stuff. It's really just a glorified hobby, but I make a little money and keep busy.

Mistake 4: Circa 2009 I get started doing an annual e-sports tournament (GT Academy) where the winner is basically fast-tracked into professional motorsports, which was and always has been my dream job. This was supposed to be the answer so I go hard. Remember how I mentioned I have ADHD and take medication to treat it? Well, now I'm abusing the medication to try to gain an edge in the tournament. If I had to trace my addiction back to a single event, this is it. After GT Academy ended, I found myself longing for the comradery and competition, so I started playing other games and kept abusing the meds. It didn't take long for the substance abuse to start spilling into other parts of my life and before long, I found I needed the medication to complete even the most menial tasks. This shit continues for several years; living one monthly prescription to the next. How do you get clean from a drug that makes you *normal*? 

Back in 2008, when I was still in college, I got really, **really** lucky. When the economy was just starting to recover from the recession, not knowing a damn thing about investing, I (foolishly) dumped all my savings into one stock. As the economy continued to improve, the share price skyrocketed and I turned my small savings into a decent amount of money for my situation (not rich by any stretch of the imagination). I'm 30 now, still live with my dad, and haven't had a job since I earned my degree (8 years ago, now). I wasted the better part of my twenties playing video games and abusing prescription medication. What tiny income I have comes from investments but it isn't much and I'm not putting anything away for the future. I know I'm a huge burden on my dad and if something happened to him, I'd be homeless. My life is a literal dead end.

I'm not looking for sympathy. I know I've fucked my entire future and I have no one to blame but myself. I don't even apply for jobs any more because who the hell is going to look at a candidate with zero experience and an 8 year gap? I see people worry because they have a 6 month gap in their résumé and my spirit just fucking bottoms out. Is there **any** coming back from this or have I rendered my education utterly useless? 

TL;DR I played life on easy mode but now I'm stuck on hard mode."

Things haven't gotten any better since I posted that. I sort of finished college, but to officially get my degree I have to do a second internship and I haven't had any luck finding one, let alone an actual job, for the past six months. I'll be 30 soon and I've never worked before, so you can imagine how well that's going (it's not). Last year at this time I was doing my first internship and almost went insane from the anxiety and stress. I had to pop Valium just to cope with the work and having to speak on the phone all day long, and now I can hardly find any work that doesn't involve being on the phone all day or direct patient interaction. My throat and stomach tighten and my hands shake just reading the job ads. I don't know how I'm gonna cope with working even if I can find someone who will hire me.

I've moved so little this past year and a half that now I can barely stand or walk for more than a few minutes before I'm drenched in sweat and in excruciating back pain. I've always been in bad shape and I'm morbidly obese, but I was at least able to walk the half mile home from my bus stop without too much trouble...now I can't even make it to the kitchen or bathroom without ending up in pain. My teeth are rotting out and hurting most of the time because I don't take care of them (or the rest of my body for that matter) and can't afford to fix them. I have never cut but I do hurt myself daily and pick at blemishes and small wounds until they're 10+ times as large as they started and turn into lumps of scar tissue. There's big red painful wounds on my face and arms and belly and other places because I just can't stop and I hate myself. I'm ashamed of my weight and my scars and my hideousness.

I'm still lonely as hell. The ex fiance that ghosted me several years ago came crawling back, and I stupidly gave him a second chance just to have him ghost me again a few months later. He also treated me to the visual of seeing him drunkenly point a thankfully unloaded gun at his head and pull the trigger, which still haunts me two years later. The timing of his reappearance (and my shit choices) ruined the chance of a relationship with my wonderful best friend, who rejected me romantically around this time a year ago. I withdrew from him and my few friends and have hardly spoken to anyone except my mother since then. I find myself in tears frequently because I'm so heartbroken and excruciatingly lonely.

I don't get any enjoyment out of anything anymore. Everything hurts. Everything and everyone I ever cared about is just gone or I've pushed them away. All I wanted in life was someone to love, a few good friends, to make art and write, to see the world, to make it a better place...

The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I promised my mom I would help her out of the debt she incurred taking care of me and helping me through college, but I can't even do that and I'm hurting so much I can't cope anymore.

I spend at least half my days thinking about dying and how to do it in the least inconvenient way for my mom and the least painful way for me and how I won't be hurting anymore.

I can't do this anymore"

It was a small hospital, one that specialized in services that you don't always see except in really large facilities.

IT was really small, just the CIO and myself. One day, I get a somewhat urgent sounding call asking for help in one of the operating rooms. I figured that a surgery was scheduled shortly, and that a pre-op check came up with an issue with the surgical computer.

As this was the OR, of course it's a clean room, so I had to be prepped before I could enter. So after getting dressed, I head in to find out that I figured wrong on when the issue was found; hint, it wasn't during pre-op. The patient was already on the table, anesthetized, waiting for the procedure to begin.

I don't recall what the issue was, but it was a little unnerving as a college intern working on a computer with a room full of surgeons watching and waiting on you so that they could begin."

This semester I'm taking Calc II, Physics I, Intermediate Programming and Discrete Math. I plan on taking courses over the summer.

My path has been different than the average path and so my programming experience is currently only what I've learned in intermediate programming. We've done projects with nested classes, interfaces, abstract interfaces, .jar files she provides us, etc. Outside of that, I've only made around 40 C# scripts from tutorials while playing with a project in Unity. I'm not the best student in my class; I would say I'm in the upper half.

I worry that it's not ""IT"" enough because it feels 55% Operations 45% IT, I figure I take the year to get experience in the meanwhile I want to focus more on my certifications because it was harder to focus when I was getting denied for several jobs due to lack of experience and just an A+. My goal is to finish the year in Dec and have atleast be working on MCSE...."

5xrn1b,29,2017-03-06,Am I Being Selfish?,i_am_eating_food,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5xrn1b/am_i_being_selfish/,"Hello, I am a long time lurker finally posting for the first time (so excuse my poor formatting hehe). First of all, I want to take this opportunity to thank r/applyingtocollege for helping me through this college application process in many ways.

So before I start my story, here is a little bit of background about myself that might help me explain the situation better.
1. My family immigrated to the U.S. 7 years ago, and our income is pretty low (got 0 for EFC).

2. My parents are extremely religious. And I mean, EXTREMELY religious that they don't care about my education at all.

So I'm a high school senior and fortunately, I got into my realistic first choice college. It is a state university, but it has a great reputation, great engineering program, and is affordable. As I mentioned just now, my EFC is 0 but because our income is so low, I qualify for another state grant that will cover most of the cost for attending that school, so the money is not an issue here. And I would be paying for my college somehow anyways so I don't think my parents can control my college decisions since they won't be paying for it. Plus I think the loan is worth it if it is for the education.


Knowing my religious parents, I knew living on campus or off the campus was never an option for me. They think dormitories are full of sex and drugs and I will leave the religion because of the bad influence. My parents and I had many talks about it. The talk always ended in some form of physical disciplinary action so I stopped resisting. And for a while, I really thought I could commute all 4 years. The school is only 40 minutes away, an hour with the traffic (but there is traffic most of the time), and I have seen a couple people commute from their house, too. But now I'm actually about to attend that school, and I just simply do not want to commute. I want to live in a dorm. And here is my reason.


1. I want to perform my full potential in terms of academic. Maybe in the first year, I can pull a satisfactory GPA with all the time spent on driving but what about the next year and the year after when the classes get harder? I would have to work on a lot of team projects, too. I will probably have to work as well, too since the grant does not cover everything. If I live in a dorm, it would be easier for me to get an internship or on-campus job, too.
Honestly, I'm very scared. The route to the school is notorious for having many car accidents. I'm afraid that I won't be able to perform my full potential. I'm afraid that I won't be able to make friends because I commute. I'm afraid that my life will fall apart after the high school.


2. I want the full ""college experience"".


3. I want to get away from manipulative and controlling parents.


I will be 18 by the time I go to college, so I know my parents can't legally control me, but I have a younger brother (4 years younger than me) and my parents will destroy his freedom if I leave the home because they would want to make sure my brother does not turn out ""bad"" like I did. My brother and I already had a talk about me going away for college and he was terrified that our parents will ruin his life because of my ""selfish"" action.
Also, I will get disowned and support myself completely on my own (car, car insurance, health insurance, phone bill, and all that stuff). And my mom has been threatening to kill herself if I do anything to disappoint her and God, and I think she will really commit suicide if I leave home for college. I'm not sure if I can handle the guilt. I'm scared to even talk about it with my parents because every time I do, my mom ends up having a meltdown and stops talking for me for a few weeks.


So given the circumstances, I will probably commute to school all 4 years and I know it is not gonna be that bad but I can't help myself feeling angry and frustrated over this. It's not like I'm asking for them to send me to an OOS college that cost over 60k a year. I just want to live in a dorm and my parents won't have to worry about paying for it. Am I being selfish for wanting to dorm?



**TL;DR Religious and overprotective parents want me to commute but I simply don't want to for a number of reasons. Am I being selfish for wanting to live in a dorm?**"

Is this level of work normal?",Dominator046,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xt694/csc_senior_accepted_to_grad_school_feeling/,"Hello, everyone! This is my first post here in this subreddit, not a frequent user of reddit in general, but finding this board might be just what I needed!

I will warn you, there may be some tangential venting in this post. I don't have too much longer to write, and each time I go back through I end up cutting this post significantly.

Anyways, to begin:

I'm a CSC major, finally rounding the bend as a senior. Technically I'm facing the last semester of my major classes, but I have some gen eds to clean up next semester, since I started out of rotation. So, really, I'm almost a graduate! Yay me!

I've never failed a CSC course. I do quite well on theory, and pre-planning implementation. I'm not the fastest coder on the block, but I can work through problems. I struggle debugging other people's uncommented code (*grumble), but I can do it.  I haven't had an internship yet, but I am waiting on a few phone calls. Yay!

Though, that's all well and good. Why did I title the thread this way? Well, I'm struggling to keep it that way at this point.

I'm at a full load at my university with eighteen credits for the semester, fifteen of which are 400-level senior courses, with one 300-level junior math course. My days are mostly consumed with slamming down code as quickly as possible, tearing from one subject and project group from the next. I'm not learning anything, I'm just trying to keep my head above water with the grades. I'm doing well in almost all of my courses, save the math, and one CSC course.

I have never felt so particularly stressed as I do right now. I don't have enough time to dedicate to truly solving one project, and I have three different groups of people demanding my best work simultaneously. I see my other groupmates do it by largely operating in the same group and dividing out the assignments, taking less classes, or just 'working harder'.

The capstone to my degree, a software engineering project where I cooperate with three other people to produce software that should uphold professional standards is also demoralizing me. I can work on par with most of my groupmates, save one who is definitely way above my level. His suggestion for a project is the one we're working on, and I feel that his aspirations have me in-and-over my head. Between participating in a number of the same courses, ordering additional resources to study in the meantime, and explaining that if 'I'm not coding, I might as well be doing crystal meth', I realize fully that I cannot operate in a way that's going to meaningfully satisfy these expectations without dropping classes.

I've come to terms with the fact that I might need to drop the two classes I'm not doing well in, take an extra semester to finish them, and be done with my degree slightly late. Start grad school a little late, but protect my 3.0+ GPA and financial aid.

But, I am worrying now that this is what my future is going to be like once I graduate. Dedicating hours upon hours every single day to achieving the bare minimum of proficiency, just to then go to work, and slave out the last bits of what I'd been working on. If so, I'm not sure my earlier classes effectively showed me how much work a career in this field would be, and if I can hack it so it speak.

So, really, I'm asking if this level of stress / dedication is normal?

I manage to squeeze in the little things, a weekly D&amp;D campaign I DM (which I've had to cancel a few times at the behest of partners), a bit of youtube everyday typically regulated to an hour, weekly sports practice (which I've almost completely given up to finish assignments or meet with group members), and occasional time out with my lady. I got up extra early today after having a relatively merciful weekend, so I'm managing this post out now before class. 

But I want a bit more out of my life than just a constant grind. I'm okay with constantly learning more. I find computer science fascinating. I like computers! I like solving puzzles, even when I'm not so good at them! I don't like it though when the bare minimum for these tasks consumes my life.

So, my original question. Am I experiencing the normal level of stress that a computer science professional should just 'get with', or after I finish my course work (maybe even get to grad school) will there be a silver lining where I can have my free time back?

Thank you all for reading this far, and sorry if I've been supremely vague. Doxxing people I work with / myself probably isn't in my interest."

So I have from now to mid june to do anything I want.

I'm thinking about:

* improve my C (i'm having fun with coding game);

* learn c++ and java;

* build a little robot with arduino;

* getting my english from b2 to c1;

* learning a third language to a2/b1 level (thinking about German dunno, anyway I dont think I will be able to do it);


What else could I learn? I can't ask for an internship because I work already and I'm interested in medical robotics.

I have multiple internships under my belt. I can start from scratch and build anything you want, but for some reason I don't do well on interviews. I guess, I'm just not a problem solver type (at least in the ""fast"" pace). I recently, made it to on-site at Amazon and after solving all the problems - I got rejected -- they said it was a very close decision. 

I'm very skilled and have experience, on-paper, but I'm struggling getting a job as a software engineer. Even though, I know I deserve to be there. I have a phone interview coming up with Google, but considering how fucking hard those are, my hopes are very fucking low - but I'm not stopping trying, I'm trying to solve all the interview questions that fucking exist.

Currently I work as a Tech Support Guy -- I have no respect for my job and I will not give up until I find what I am looking for. I really hate where I am at the moment and I am not planning to settle. It's just so hard when you fall down like this.

I just wish someone would see past the fucking world of the ""interview questions"" and give me a fucking chance. I'm the quickest learner there is, and I can do whatever I have to do, and I'm always the hardest working guy in the room. Anyone that ever, gave me a chance, saw that I was worth it, and I always over-performed.

With the knowledge and experience I have under my belt I could be leading a team of engineers at the moment. But instead, I'm dealing with stupid API problems. 

Sorry if I sound like a person who is crying but I'm really fucking down at the moment and I know I can't change the system, but I have to change me. I just don't know if that will ever be enough. 

Sorry about the rant. It's just that all the work I have put in, and I have a horrible fucking job (even though it pays well), it's making me sick to my stomach.

While in school I worked as a waiter so my people skills are quite good, provided I'm prepared enough and don't get thrown too many curveballs, but I can handle a few because I know I won't be able to foresee every question of theirs.

Does anyone here have any tips for interviews like this? I'm not sure what they could want to discuss with several higher-ups.

This is going to be a long one, reddit.


**About Myself :**
I am an undergrad in mechanical engineering. I like what I study (mainly fluid simulations). I do some programming in my free time - build tools for personal use, contribute to OSS projects to fix some bugs that I face. I especially love it when something breaks and I need to do some *google-fu* to fix it on my computer. I don't like competitive programming, but love development hackathons. I am one of those guys who love to learn a little bit of everything but fail to know one thing well.

**The Big Question :** I am not sure if just programming is the right path for me. I am not sure about *just* mechanical engineering either. I would love to do something that involves both. Are there any career options related to this? Do some of you guys from non-CS background have a programming job? Do you like it?

This dilemma took away a lot of internship opportunities for the past years. The companies here don't like jack-of-all-trade types. I would really appreciate your time if you guide me, reddit.

Thanks!

5xvbnu,3,2017-03-06,Mentally exhausted. Long Post,Kasrios,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5xvbnu/mentally_exhausted_long_post/,"Hi Reddit,
I'm sitting here looking at the keyboard and thinking about how to explain my situation. I'm not good with explaining or talking in general so bare with me...
Life story so this is a very long wall of text.
PS: English is not my first tongue.

I'm an Iraqi born guy, currently 21 years old, who's been living in Jordan for a little over 10 years. From an outside shell i always thought i had a good childhood but recently because of what has been happening with me, as i think and try to figure out why am i like this i can't find a reason. Because of my university studies i was reading a book by Christopher Alexander and i came up upon a sentence ( i can't remember the exact words), but it means that if a child does not spend time with other children growing up he will not be normal and that includes both humans and animals. I have a brother who's 7 years older than me, and because of that age difference  we weren't that close and he didn't prefer to spend time with me. We never had a good relationship. I haven't spoken him since about 5 months. Growing up i never went to kinder garden or nursery i was pretty much at home until first grade school. Because of the war my parents are very overprotective and they didn't let me out of the house and play with other kids in the street or something. I spent a lot of time alone, i used to talk and play with  my plushies, imaginary friends, cats ( i love cats )  and a fig tree in our garden. My father worked very late ( up to 10 somedays). So almost the entire day it was just me and mom in a very large house.

So i'm not NORMAL and this is my first problem. I have always struggled to fit in and to have friends, or at least long lasting friendships. I was the kid that would get picked last in a ""school"" game or something like that. I have had a few friends over the years that moved on at some point or another. In my last year of high school i pretty much had no friend. 

I don't have or at least i don't think i have Social anxiety. One would think i'm shy but i'm not, maybe i'm reserved but not shy.
Another HUGE problem which could be one of the reasons people don't like me or lose interest in me after spending time with me is that i don't talk. I like talking ( when i do ) i like being in a conversation i love hanging with people, i love people and i love listening. I just simply don't have anything to say most times. And most the things i talk about is asking questions and routine small talk. I can't explain very well and i can't tell a story in a fun way. The older i get the worse i get. I even stutter now... i didn't stutter when i was a child and it's embaressing and it's getting worse year by year.


And now i'm in my third year in college. During my school days i liked video gaming and i spent most of my time gaming( mostly online) i was little and naive. I didn't feel there was a problem. That i didn't have a social life outside of gaming ( who were amazing people). i stopped enjoying games overall and i stopped about 3years ago. After stopping my social life was non existing. Slowly i started to realise how lonely i am. It's a horrible feeling, like slowly dying the more time passes. 

Social life is very dominant in college and you see it everywhere. People chatting all the time and during their breaks between classes. They socialize in college, outside it, during the holiday, etc. Of course i'm always left out and uninvited. Even from the people i felt i was close to and worse... friends with. 

I did have people who i thought i was friends with, but i'm the one who would get left out or not be included in group's inside joke. I mainly had a group of friends that i will call The Group. I met them since the beginning. I also met another friend in my first day of college who's now my only friend. Sadly he switched to another college. We're still good friends and he's the only friend that i go out with ( actually my only friend in general ). And i'm tankful for that. Even though, hid humor gets on my nerves sometimes, but i love him. And i HATE breaks, contrary to literally everyone, because it's a reminder of how lonely i am, i just usually sit at the college's terrace and do nothing for an hour and a half. Sometimes i go to the piano room and play something. 

If you're still reading i'm reaching the point of posting this post.

So, with The Group i did use to be friendly with for a long while and i'd sit with them. I didn't talk alot which i hate but i enjoyed their company. It's better than being alone.

By the way i'm Bisexual.

In the First semester of second year. I was enrolled in a class. We had a project that we were supposed to work on a group of 4 on it. Anyway, i didn't know anyone that class because it was a first year subject that i didn't take and i'm taking it in my second year. So i didn't know anyone in that class. My chance i was grouped in a group. In that group there was a guy my age who transferred this semester to my college. I'll call him T. I noticed that he's different and not like most people ( not a bad way but a nice smart way). We finished the project, He and i pretty much did all the work ( it was a group of 4) . He worked hard and i liked that a lot about him. I was attracted to him since pretty much our first meeting. We became friends quickly. I felt very comfortable with him. I helped him easing in to the university and classes. Next semester we became even better friends, we also had more classes together and he was more introduced to the other people of our year. I liked almost everything about him. From his hard work, appearance, voice, way of speaking and cleanliness as i noticed from visiting his home. I would feel perfectly happy and serene just by being with him even if we didn't say or do anything together. And i never had full trust and felt completely comfortable with a stranger before that. I realized that i loved him. I never loved a guy nor a girl before him.

I think he's straight and i never told him i love him. 

During that semester he made more friends and also became friends with "" the group"". We were still best friends. But he became doing things that made me upset. Mainly ignoring me, forgetting me, not calling and asking where i'm at and lying to me. Even though i'm always there for him and would drop anything i'm doing to help him. It kills me from the inside when he does that. last semester ( First semester third year ). I and The Group were setting working in a class, and he came and greeted everyone but me. Litrerally greeted a guy infront of me but not me. Then a while later he called my name and asked for gum without even a Hi. I threw it at his face and said nothing, he didn't think something was wrong.

More time passes more he prefers company of the other guys. And later i find out they have been going out a lot of times and i was never invited. I couldn't believe he wouldn't tell me. I was talking with T and hinting at it and he said "" i just went out with the guys"" as if i'm not friends with them BEFORE him, and as if i'm not a ""guy"". I still loved him. Then came the break between semesters and we both did internships in different companies. Before the break we agreed that we'd go out and see a movie together the next saturday. ( was 3 days after the break started). I waited but he didn't call so i called and he said  sorry that he has a birthday party that came up that he needs to go to ,all i could think of is he's just going out with ""the guys"" and he didn't want to tell me so, i was boiling with rage. Anyway, he told me we can go the next day, which was a sunday, and i was like ok great. When he said that i felt more relaxed. Yup, next day he didn't call or confirm through a message, and as i was swiping through snapchat i saw his name... i was terrified knowing what i'm expecting to see and yup... he was out with ""The Group"", but that's not the problem. It's not like they called him to go out and he went out and forgot me, but they were in HIS house. He invited him and secluded me. I died from the inside. I have depression but i don't take medication. After sawing that picture, i died from the inside, and it was the first time in my life that i genuinely prayed to not wake up and die and was genuinely disappointed after waking up the morning after. Why do i suck socially? Why don't i have friends? 

Why people don't like me?
I'm a very nice person, people say i'm too nice so it's not that i think myself as nice but i'm not actually nice. I even look nice and people get surprised if they see me do a wild thing or listen to unusual music. 
I have always been there for him, the week before, we had projects submission. I had finished mine and he needed help so we stayed the entire night working on his project at his home. I couldn't even go back to my house and i had to go to university in my day old clothes without taking a bath. Why doesn't he appreciate me?

I'm madly in love him But after that happened i hated him, had to forget him and get over him. I removed him from snapchat so i don't see what he's doing. He called only once during that break just before the next semester start but i didn't, couldn't answer. I decided to accept that fact that i'm alone and will always be. I cut him off from my life. I also don't talk with ""the group"" again. Only if they say something to me and i speak very coldly to them.

And, next semester starts, the first day i avoid T and in a mutual class i sat to the opposite of wherever he and ""The Group"" do. I hate him but still in love with him. Ignoring him hurts. He did greet me the first day, i said quickly Hi. The next day he came to me while i was on my laptop and asked that i didn't look ok yesterday or sad. I just said why would i be sad, coldly. I think he knew something was odd. 

The reason i did that as the reason i'm writing this post.
i'm trying to cut him off from my life. But i love him. it's been 2weeks into the semester and after the first 2days he spoke to me he never spoke again. I thought this would be for the good but i still miss him and love him, same time hate him. 

The reason i'm trying to cut him off is, i'm mentally exhausted ( from everything i wrote so far ), i just can't afford being hurt again by anyone and especially not by someone who i love and admire like him. But i'm afraid with cutting him off, i'm losing two things, a friendship and someone i live ( He's straight though). If i didn't cut him off i'm only losing his love. What should i do? I'm mentally exhausted. I can't afford therapy and i'm losing my will to live. lost the will to study and hobbies. I used to be an A student but i'm getting worse. I'm barely average now. 

Every single goddamn night i just keep thinking about him and about being physically in touch him. It smoothes me to fantasies about him holding me. even though when i actually see him i hate him so much because he hurt me.

I lost my will to live, my love for hobbits, my will to study, will to do anything.

If i am to... restore our friendship, how would i initiate or explain it? if he asks what's been wrong what should i say? Note that i can't tell him that i love him or that i'm Bi. I never told anyone or my family about all of this and I can't do that. 

What should i do?
Sorry for the very long wall of text.

Recently I was lucky enough to get an offer for a SWE internship this summer. This offer expires on the 15th of March.


I currently have another onsite, but the recruiter has not confirmed a date and time with me yet.


My current plan is to send an email to the recruiter and telling them that although I have an offer, their company is still my top choice and ask if they could schedule me for an onsite before the 15th.


Should I do this or is there a better way to handle this? I don't want to lose out on my first opportunity. Thanks!

I just cannot seem to get a real job. And by a real job I mean something that's professional level. Hell, I would do lower level office work like data entry. I pretty much apply to any junior or entry level position I can find and sometimes to multiple positions as well, why not.

Sure, I realize my resume sucks. It sucks because I lack relevant work experience to the jobs I apply for. I wasn't able to get internships and most of my experience is retail and tutoring. However, I do try to tailor the resume to the position. For example, if it's tech, add projects and link to examples.

I realize another thing that might be working against me is that it is going to be 3-4 years since I graduated and the new grad smell might be done.

I'm unemployed now because the last job I worked absolutely messed my body up to the point where I have chronic back, shoulder, and ankle issues.

It's not like I've been doing nothing. I've been teaching myself to program, I have a website or two, some monte carlo projects I coded up as well. I've been learning more about mathematics and statistics even though my degree was in physics.

Plus the annoying factor of being stuck yet seeing friends or acquaintances progress and I'm here like someday I might be able to afford things. Then to add to the stress of the situation my family wants to commit me to a mental hospital because I cannot find a job. It's like, lol wut?

I recently graduated from ""Software Engineering"" program at a university in Perú . Throughout this program I took courses in math (calculus , linear algebra) and programming (mostly C and Java , Data Structures , Algorithmns ) for the initial part of it , but later every course was focussed more on the ""project managment"" side of things.

I did a 2 year internship on a small , local video game company using Unity Engine and C# and I liked it A LOT . I mostly did prototypes of game mechanics and a little AI , but there was always this topic that i never got the change to delve into and that I have always found fascinating : Shaders and Computer Graphics. I always wanted to get into that but everything seemed so overwhelming complex and ""alien"" that I always ended up giving up.

So here I am , a newly graduated in an environment that doesn´t care that much for that branch of programming (everything here in this country is mostly web or mobile apps for customers or banks or big enterprises) wanting to start learning CG from the ground up and hoping eventualy become a Graphics Engineer (at least that's the dream) and work on a videogame or animation company , and I need your help?

I'm a final semester MS student in Applied Physics from Norway and I'm not sure how to proceed right now. I really want to do a PhD in quantum computing (preferably solid state quantum computing at Oxford), and I have some paths in front of me, but things are a bit unclear to me on how to proceed. Could you help me clear things up? 
________________
So I have an offer of a 9 month - 1 year internship where I'll work as a ""grade 6 research assistant"" for a theory physics group. Apparently I'll be paid at around £35k per annum brutto. While this does sound good at first sight, the problem is though that I think the job will be about coding sub-routines into C and, allegedly, ""learning about computational physics and programming"". However, when I asked the postdoc in charge of the project, he flat out told me that a software engineer with no background in physics or mathematics to speak of could do the job.. This, along with the unusually high salary for an internship, I think essentially means that I'll be working as a full-time programmer, possibly code-monkey, helping them write up their software. 

I also have an offer of DPhil in solid-state Quantum Computing, but with an uncertain funding situation. I might get funding, or I might not, but honestly I doubt it. I'm going to ask for an internship in case of no funding, but I'm not sure if they can fund one that's longer than a couple of months.
________________
So if I get funding for the Quantum computing DPhil, or a reasonable internship offer, I will obviously take this route, but I don't think I will.. So in case I fail at that, as far as I see I have two choices:

(1) Do the Oxford internship and hope it looks good on the CV and apply to Oxford Quantum grad school again, and that time hope for a funded offer. However, I have my doubts as it looks like I won't be contributing to any physics research, but instead just doing coding work.... 

(2) Stay in my uni for one extra semester while taking heavy-weight physics courses and working as a teaching assistant, while applying for less competitive PhDs all over Europe.  
________________
What do you guys think? Do you think I should take the internship with the hope that it strengthens my CV for grad school applications next year, or not take it and instead spend the time trying to find PhD programs immediately? 

PS: In case somebody is wondering how I got this internship, I was basically cold-calling (actually emailing) professors I thought researched interesting stuff and hoping to catch something.

5y1eo3,2,2017-03-07,My SOP for cognitive science subject. I really want someone else review. Dont mind harsh criticism.,evilgenius_,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/5y1eo3/my_sop_for_cognitive_science_subject_i_really/,"Best advice I have received, “Study your entire life. Study everything”. Coming from a family of research driven backgrounds I was interested in everything this world has to offer. In school years I enjoyed studying mathematics, computers, philosophy, history, sociology and anthropology.  My own lifetime has essentially coincided with the rise of computers which paved the way for modern computing industry that is why I decided to do engineering and enrolled in Information Technology program of Sinhgad Institute of Technology for my bachelor degree. Like many students in the class, I had been struggling with the labs. I came into my own after some time spend. Combining different studies in developing projects is what I liked most about engineering. I enjoy applying interdisciplinary thinking to scientific discovery. Many scientist debate implementing cognitive behavior in machines over efficient performing model in many theories. I want to implement and develop applications that incorporate such knowledge into the machinery for enhancing further the capability for research in order to take advantage of these theories. This is the reason why I am interested in becoming a student to learn more about Applied Cognition and Neuroscience degree in University of Texas Dallas.
What is intelligence and how to make machines intelligent? We do not come in with any prior knowledge about the world. Our intelligence system starts out with no knowledge. I think we all agree that, one system represent intelligence very well which is human brain and maybe some mammals as well, but we all agree that is the gold standard. As Jeff Hawkins once said, “It’s that learning process that makes intelligence. We continue to learn for our entire life. Intelligence isn’t something you reach. It’s a continuous process you go through.” Human as well as animals go through a methodology to be intelligent in the world. So when I think intelligence in machines, I have got to consider those same learning methodologies that we used for our intelligence. Patrick Winston a professor at MIT, pointed out that we are making less progress on Artificial Intelligence because we are narrowing the field to just one study. Contributions from various fields are so necessary to accelerate this process. To make machines intelligent, scientific methods and simulations are key in learning process. I plan to utilize the knowledge I have gained about certain aspects of humanity to reform the concept of cognitive science, specifically Artificial Intelligence.
Cognitive Science is an accumulation of several other subjects from computer science to philosophy to linguistics. Cognitive science is a large field, and covers a wide array of topics is an interesting prospect for me. Great Satisfaction, for me, is to gain ambiguous concept of knowledge and learn how it can be used to transfigure the world. To base ideas about the world on our personnel experience and try to revolutionize the world is really exciting. Alan Turing said in his paper on Machine Intelligence, “The question machine can think is too meaningless to discuss”.  I think what he meant by that was like asking if airplanes can fly and submarine can swim. In order for us to develop intelligent machines we have to take every aspect which helps us think better and apply them on machines.
The undergraduate program at the Sinhgad Institute of Technology provided me with a strong foundation of computer science and exposed me to various fields of it. During my undergraduate studies at the Information Technology department, subjects like Discrete Structures, Data Structures, and Computer Networks interested me the most. Subjects like Data Structure and Software Engineering has helped me to excel in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and design patterns. The vocabulary and structures of software design seem to lend themselves naturally to the study of human reasoning and learning. I plan to use this training to test how far the mind-machine metaphor holds. In addition to experience with imperative and functional programming paradigms, I have enjoyed coding in declarative languages like SQL. Multiple labs work on databases class is an ideal balance of theory and practical experience with modern database systems. An in-depth understanding of relational and ER models will help me design better knowledge representation schemas, such as semantic networks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like word sense disambiguation. At the end of my undergraduate program I was really interested in subjects like Neural Networks, Natural language, Machine learning, Software Design Network and Behavioral sciences. 

I wanted to develop my Major project based on machine learning concept. I wrote a paper on the subject ‘Human Identity Recognition through Ear Lobes Geometric Features’. To understand human anatomy basic concept, I took online course on human anatomy which gave me some ideas to base it on external ears geometry. I published my paper in International Journal of Engineering and Computer Science (IJECS). Later developed this project using JavaScript for dynamic interactivity and MATLAB for implementing mathematical models such as KNN algorithm, Color conversion model, finding gradients, Non-maximum suppression, double thresholding and Edge tracking by hysteresis were used. The project is based on machine learning concept of supervised learning. A supervised learning analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which we used for mapping new examples. This projects goal was to make biometric technologies highly secure recognition and verification of identity. In this dissertation, we propose the ear as a biometric and investigate its potential with both 2D and 3D data.
Not only subjects of my curriculum but extra curriculum was a big a part on my time at Sinhgad Institute. I played state level soccer for my school and also represented my university in college football. I was elected as vice president of sports and linguistic club for our department. During this time, I helped organize many sporting events throughout my under graduating period. After my junior year I took some time off for myself. In that time I learnt Spanish; taken internship at Pune society of Psychology; I have taken a seminars on anthropology and philosophy; spent time with local social workers to help students with anxiety disorder. Throughout collage my intent was to increase my own education, feed my curiosity, and drive to be something great. I feel now that I can achieve a Master’s degree and maybe in the future even a Doctorate.
Browsing through the University’s homepage, I feel that the graduate study at your institution holds a promising career. On-going research and publications on subjects like (Subject name) by revered Professor like Prof. (  ) augmented my urge to solicit for an opportunity to pursue Masters from the (University name). The breadth and depth of the courses coupled with stimulating research environment seems to me, the right blend for seminal work and initiating research.
I found your esteemed university, known for its great facilities, would be ideal place for me to pursue my graduate studies. Interacting with the best minds in this field will be an enriching experience and this will spur me on to be the very best in my chosen area of study. I anticipate your benevolent act of accepting me into your esteemed university and granting admission in (Course name) Masters in Science for Management of Information Systems program.

I am currently finishing up my 3rd year in college (junior) and majoring in Computer Information Systems. I plan on on getting my Bachelors in CIS by the end of next year (only 2-4 semesters left).

I currently have a great internship with a Financial company doing IT Support. I am the only person at the office, but the company is managed by a Managed Service Provider so I get to work alongside them most of the time - which teaches me a lot. For an intern I have good pay, my own office, friendly staff... I can't complain and plan on sticking with them till graduation.
This summer I am not going to be traveling home, so I planned on taking a class or two over the summer and working Mondays-Fridays at my office. Since I won't be AS busy, I wanted to use this time to set a goal and start to study/train for obtaining my first Certification.

Now this is where I am kind of in a pickle... Over the past year working in IT Support, I'm starting to realize that even though I enjoy it sometimes - I can't picture myself ""fixing stuff"" for the rest of my life. don't get me wrong, I love IT and am passionate about it in every way... It's just I don't see myself being a ""Mr. Fix-It"" guy in the future.

Doing more research, I have started to looking at Management Information Systems and am really interested in that. I like the idea of managing my own IT group/company and being in a so called ""higher up"" position then a Help Desk Technician...
So my question is, what would be the best certification to start training for regarding my situation? Awhile ago I was set on the A+, but I believe with my current studies and hands-on internship I learn most of that anyways (plus I don't want to be in PC support in the future). 

Anyone in an IT management role and can help me out?"

5y36vs,8,2017-03-07,My class in Micro/Embedded Systems is a dumpster fire. How do I fix?,2disposable25698,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5y36vs/my_class_in_microembedded_systems_is_a_dumpster/,"tl/dr: Prof is unhelpful, lectures are torturous, lab assignments require time and effort far beyond reasonable, and lab communication has entirely fallen apart. Ruining all my other classes, should I withdraw?

I'm a senior undergrad in Comp Engineering, hoping to graduate in December. I have 10+ years of work experience outside of engineering and two successful engineering internships under my belt. I'm in a Microprocessors / Embedded Systems class that is required for my degree, but I'm spending all my time on lab assignments and it's bringing my grades down in all my classes, even my Capstone project. I want to withdraw, but I don't know if that will hurt me down the road, especially when I don't know if the class will be exactly the same in the Fall. I have an appointment with advising tomorrow, but I could use some more guidance.

Here's what's happening:

1. The lectures are awful. It's a 3 hour class at night (after a full day of classes) no breaks. The lecture slides are generally just walls of text, with an occasional unexplained diagram, and a lot of unrelated or very outdated information. The content seems to me fairly disorganized, so when studying, I usually need to re-write the slides in my notes so all the info that belongs together is together, and I can get a better idea of the material.

2. The prof is not doing well. The lecture slides are exact carbon copies of another professor's slides from a previous semester. But that doesn't stop him from slapping his name on them. He lectures by reading verbatim off the slides at a snail's pace. I did find video of the previous prof's lectures on YouTube, and the slides are still bad, but he gets through the material in a third of the time, and with more helpful info. (unfortunately, I only found those lectures a few days ago, but they will be helpful in the future.)

3. There is no textbook.

4. There is no scheduled block of lab time. Each team is expected to find our own time to work together on the lab. There is only one set of hardware to share. Those are ok, but all of us are commuter students with conflicting class schedules and other commitments (I do not work at the moment, but my partners do) which makes it  very difficult to coordinate time to work together.

5. The lab assignments (60% of our grade) are just the worst. Very little of the information we need to do them is in the lectures. We've had two assignments so far, and 90% of the time is spent just trying to set hardware up and figuring out how to program it, rather than demonstrating relevant knowledge. The prof and TA scatter links to other tutorials and datasheets throughout four separate online platforms, and several times, they were for the wrong device. The actual lab assignment sheets look pasted from several different sources, so key figures and references are missing, and the actual assignment requirements are unclear. The prof and the TA either do not respond at all, or tell you to talk to the other one.

6. My work is being excluded from my lab team. Communication is nigh impossible. I send out emails to try to coordinate schedules or arrange for passing off of the one set of hardware so we can work on it, but multiple times I have found myself in the lab alone without the hardware, so I try to work to compensate, while sending emails to the team about my progress and what I'm working on. When we are able to meet, one partner makes it a one-man show despite anything the team has agreed to do previously, or any status updates. He moves cables, pins, and changes the on-board OS settings while we are working, which has cost us hours, then somehow the day before the lab demo, he miraculously has written all the code weeks ago all by himself without telling us. Directly telling him to stop has no effect. Working out a plan in person or in writing has no effect. He just agrees with what we're saying and then does what he wants. I have zero confidence in the prof or the TA to fix this. They don't seem to care at all.


The result?: I am spending 20 - 30 hours per week in this class on lab assignments. The assignment time is making it impossible to study for the SAME CLASS, let alone my four other classes, including my Capstone Project. The kicker is: NONE of my work is even being submitted. We're each supposed to write individual lab reports on our contributions. How can I write it if my work is destroyed, then excluded!?

I know I should be prepared to study beyond the scope of the class. I know I should study data sheets and put extra time and effort into learning the material. I have done so in many classes before, and it has usually been a challenging and satisfying experience, despite the time and energy cost. I feel this class is beyond a character-building level of unfair.

I know I'll have to work in teams in ""the real world"", mainly because I've been in ""the real world"" longer than I've been in school, and I've had tons of lab classes before this. I've had slacker teammates, I've had control freak teammates, I've had teammates with massive family emergencies that I've been glad to do more than my fair share for, and I've had some teammates do the same for me. Every time, I can get along, or at least grin and bear it.

So. What are my options? This can't go on."

I'm sorry if it's completely off topic. 

Anyway, I'm a computer science student and I am beginning to look for a job in the field. Obviously becoming a game developer is the end goal, it's also the most unrealistic one. 

Now I am well versed in c++ and believe myself to be higher than average in computer programming knowledge than most of my class. Unfortunately I only have one small program in c++ dealing with object oriented programming and data structures. I can't think of anything else to make in c++ that would WOW an employer unless I make something absolutely crazy. 

Now Unity is my forte, I have put so many man hours into making a plethora of game concepts, and even have a game on the app stores. I can manipulate it to work almost any way I would like it. My confusion is that this isn't really all that to be proud of, or is it? I don't know that's why I'm making this post lol. 

It seems, pretty obviously, that Unity holds your hand for a lot of things. A lot of the coding is more ""scripting"", which is my worry. It seems completely different in skill comparison than making a program from the ground up and making everything work your way. 

I'm just worried that I won't find a good internship or entry level position, or none at all. 

What are your guys' experience with this. Do you have any insight into what I could do? I would also hope that this post will be able to help others in the same situation because it seems like I'm in a pretty crappy situation. 

Thanks and have a nice day guys!"
5y4ft2,34,2017-03-07,JP Morgan Summer Internship (TAP) Info,Hello_Illinois,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5y4ft2/jp_morgan_summer_internship_tap_info/,"Hey Guys. I recently received an offer from JP Morgan Chase as a summer Technology Analyst Program. I wanted to share my experience here, since I wasn't able to find a lot of information myself when I was going through it. So here it is.

I went to a campus career fair, and handed in my resume. They emailed me to apply online, and then the application was moved forward. A few days later, they invited me to an on campus interview. I'll share my experience, and that of another friend as well.

Firstly, the info on Glassdoor regarding the Summer Analyst Internship Position is pretty useful, so make sure that you go over it (Practice the behavioral questions there).

As for my experience, I got 2 back to back, 30 min interviews, In person (I hear the phone interviews are in a similar fashion). The first was supposed to be behavioral, and the second one was supposed to be technical. In my experience, the 2nd one was largely behavioral as well (Just ~12 mins of technical questions), just a little less formal. This however depends on your interviewer. I'll break it down into the 2 interviews.

Behavioral part:
First part behavioral: Describe a moment when you were a leader, when you had to work with a non cooperating team member, when you head to take a risk, when you had to make an important decision, etc etc. These go on for a while, and they take a ton of notes based on your responses (mine did at least).

Behavioral part in the second 30 min Interview (which was supposed to be technical): 
:: Asked me about what I was doing, and my favorite class. 

:: Asked me about my biggest accomplishment in college/on my resume. I talked about personal development rather than the projects that were listed on my resume. I assumed He'd read those before, so why waste time. Also, discussing how college has made you a leader, and helped you become a well rounded person is more unique - I guess. 

:: Asked me the typical ""Why Chase"". Personal advice, don't just say ""I love banking"". Make sure you sound smart :)

:: Since he was an alumni from my University (UIUC), and head of ""recruiting strategy"" for computer science as well, I asked him if he liked being around the college, what he thought about the quality and work ethic of the hires from UIUC, etc. Basically, was trying to be personable (I'm curious about these things anyways so it's a nice way to show the interviewers that you care).

Technical Part: First 15 mins as described above. I asked him questions as well, and the conversation flowed smoothly. Then we moved on to the technical part

The technical questions that I did get asked was: 
1) reverse a string (~4 mins)

:: O(1) space, and O(n) time 

2) Talked a little bit about hash maps, and hashing functions. Basically SUHA Assumptions (~5 mins) 

3) A couple questions regarding basic Object Oriented Programming

The question my friend got: 
1) Given a string, return the first unique character in the string. 
:: Can be done in O(n) space and O(n) time.

The coding part is not very logic heavy, and JP Morgan didn't seem to care a lot about it. But again, this depends on the interviewer.

Other (unsolicited) Advice: This goes for any interview, but specially for JP Morgan (and corporate places). They're looking for people who are pleasant to work with, so make sure you seem personable."

Hi, I'm 23 years old on my way to 24 very soon. I have a college degree in social studies and just finished a 3 years college degree in computer science.  With excellent grades. I'm usually good in school but don't know what to do and can rarely get a passion for anything. 

Here in canada, i don't know for everywhere else, but a lot of people start to work after those 3 years of college and don't go to university (they start working around 21 years old but at a lower starting point (30k-50k) ).

I'm 23 and university would take me 4 years, I would have about 3 internships paid around 15k each. 

I'm wondering if I should just start working now (for around 40k a year at the company I'm currently interning) and try to work my way up with work experience or if I should continue with software engineering ... 

I feel like I'm getting old and another 4 years in school seems really long. Most of my friends will be parents / have houses then. Is it worth  money wise / experience wise? I like school and making friends but getting out of it at 27-28..I'm not sure if it's the thing to do. 

Did you go to university and do you feel like people who don't end up with lower-end jobs?"

Ok, so last 2 weeks has been absolutely worst for me ever. I am facing many serious long term shits right now:
First: My gf of 4 years broke up with me 3 days ago. We were together for 3 years and had been in long distance relationship for the last 8 months or so. It was on and off for us in LDR. We are on the opposite end of the globe for each other. I can’t go back to her at least for 5 years, which was the reason for us to be skeptical about us. Still I tried my best to stay with her, gave my everything but she says she doesn’t feel anything for me now. She likes someone else but doesn’t see anything with him. Same was the case with me some months back but things bounced back. But she is adamant that nothing can improve between us. I think I am not gonna get her back ever. I am devastated and just want her back.
Second: I am in my graduate studies and looking for an internship for summer. Even though I have a strong profile, due to no work experience (fresh out of undergrad) and lack of contacts in the semiconductor industry, haven’t received a single call for interview till now. Not even a positive signs from anywhere. I have applied to 100+ positions till now easily.
Third: I dont know why this happens to me, but I am trying to study very hard but not able to get good grades this semester. I have excellent understanding of concepts and mostly solve the homeworks on my own. The guys I help to do homework, ends up getting way better marks than me. ALL OF THE TIME. Sometimes I made them write line by line, still I was the one to lose.
Fourth: I have OCD and currently on medication. Due to these things, I am not able to cope up with my treatment. 
I feel absolutely suicidal right now. I have tendency to self hurt but that’s gone long ago. I understand my life is not that lame to waste so easily, so I wont kill myself. I have amazing parents and sisters who are helping me with breakup but still I am too low to feel like living. Please help me!! You can save my life."

So I am a third year CS student in Canada, and received 2 internship offers a few weeks ago:

Company A:

* Large mobile gaming company
* Position: Game Programmer
* Duration: for 16 months, May start
* Location: London, ON. (~2 hour drive from me)
* About the role: will be working on game development using Unity/C#, etc. 

Company B: 

* Small section under the Science and Technology branch of Canadian government
* Position: Java Web Developer
* Duration: 12 months, May start
* Ottawa, ON. (~ 5 hour drive from me)
* About: will be working on a particular database tool for genome scientists to analyze genomic data, etc. 

Both companies pay the same. 

In my quick haste and excitement at working in the gaming industry, I accepted the offer for the Games Programmer a few weeks ago, and have been feeling lots of regret since. There's nothing I can do about it now, having accepted the offer and signed the contract, etc. 

At first, I decided against Company B because the description of the role did not appeal to me (developing a database tool), sounded much less exciting, and I initially wanted to go into the gaming industry. Since then, I've heard many things about how game devs are often underpaid, undervalued, etc., and just the title ""Game Programmer"" is not as impressive as it once sounded, compared to ""Java Web Developer"". Not gunna lie, I've been feeling hesitant even putting it on my LinkedIn page, where all my peers seem to have landed full-stack web dev positions at ""proper"" companies. 

I've also been working with full-stack web frameworks for this course I'm in, and have thoroughly enjoyed web dev, fueling my sense of regret. Even though the Company B position wasn't ""modern"" web dev, I keep thinking it would've helped a lot in obtaining web deb roles in the future, and I am hindering my future careers by taking this game dev position. 

At the same time, however, I have good web dev projects using full-stack web frameworks, React, and a good GPA. I was thinking maybe since game dev positions have higher competition, having this position would help me in that industry, and my projects/GPA would still allow me to find web dev positions in the future. Is this the right mindset to have?

Have you ever felt regret in a career decision? How did you feel better about it? Is there any advice you have to maybe alleviate some of my feelings of regret?

I'm a second semester junior and have been reflecting a lot lately. These are just some late night thoughts I'd share. I remember freshman year being like it was yesterday. So naive, breezed through high school and didn't really know how to study my freshman year, and got by with all Cs (except English and physics I).


Come sophomore year and I decided to live on campus. As a result, my time management was just so poor first semester. Finally I had the opportunity to meet people and party, and was just constantly putting off homework and cramming when studying. Ended up with 2 D's and was put on academic probation and had to retake a class. After that semester I got my shit together but still got by with mostly Cs.


Last summer managed to somehow land an internship. This gave me invaluable experience in what it's like working with people in the real world. As a result, coming into my junior year I had a much stronger work ethic. Managed to get my first semester with a GPA higher than 3.0 and felt like I achieved something. Also learned how to study with other people, something I hated the thought of in my earlier years just because I liked to learn on my own.


Now I'm sitting here after midterms reflecting halfway through the semester that in a little over a year from now I'll be saying goodbye to this wonderful time I've had here. I've had my ups, SEVERAL downs but NEVER gave up through and through. And yet, I'm wishing I could start over sometimes with the experience I have now. I wish I didn't ditch those classes sophomore year. I wish I took my homework more seriously. It would have made life so much easier. I look around me and see these people with 3.0+ GPAs and several opportunities thrown their way, and even if I make all As before graduating spring 2018 I can't graduate with higher than a 2.97, which will close a lot of doors in the job field. What makes matters worse is that only a few months ago I expressed interest in grad school or a doctorate program, and it's gonna be next to impossible to get into a good school. 


For me, studying engineering has always been an accolade. It's always great hearing people's reactions when I tell them I'm studying engineering and the respect I've been able to garner from my non-STEM friends. I'm not an athlete, don't have any incredible talents. Nothing has made me stand out besides this.

The people I've known who attended the aforementioned universities are over at the Big 4 in the states and with good reasons as those were people I considered as high achievers who excelled above their peers back when I was in school with them. However, there were also those who attended the same universities but wanted to remain local and are currently working for big corporations.

For the rest of the people I know who were unable to enter UW/UofT, they had to settle with universities with a smaller/'unrefined' CS program. Co-op/internship opportunities at these universities with smaller CS programs which had a smaller selection of opportunities to choose from. More often than not a few of them did end up having to search outside their school's program for more opportunities and with good reasons.

With the increase in people within this field, would it be fair to say that those who came from schools with a huge CS presence/department are more likely to work in larger corporations since those corporations usually have a connection to those schools/hire them out of their internships? And those in schools with a smaller CS presence/department are more likely in start-ups/smaller companies?

This is a black and white view I'm putting out there and should not be taken as fact but merely based on my observation (and small sample size) because I'm aware some people may just enjoy the start-up environment versus a large company and vice-versa. 

There are also many factors that plays into the effect of how one would end up working in a large company vs. a start-up/smaller companies such as pursuing side projects outside of classes, ambition, skill, preference for work-life balance, etc. These wouldn't necessarily take into account of their school though.

The calculator will calculate the OEE from different values. I have to put in the values and that way it will calculate the OEE. It will calculate the Availability, the Performance, the Quality and the OEE itself. Since the OEE shifts each day, I want to make an Excel sheet that calculates it everyday when I put in the values and the Calculator sheet puts it in the right box(date) in the database sheet.

The second database has in the Colum from top to bottom the dates ranging from 1-1-2017 to 31-12-2017 ( Yes I'm European haha).

I always struggle with becoming friends with other people. I have difficulty initiating conversation with others and keeping conversation going if contact has been established. 

For example, I see one of my previous grad student instructors who takes the bus at the same stop I do. He's a cool guy and he nods at me when we make eye contact but I have no idea what to say to him. I'd love to strike up a conversation but I'm worried I'll run out of things to say and that it'll get awkward. 

Another instance was an internship I held last summer. I joined as one of two interns. I only spoke to people when they spoke to me and avoided people otherwise. I had the same fear that I wouldn't know what to say. The other guy was a lot more gregarious, and he would chat up other employees. He got invited to get drinks after work (I did too, out of courtesy I guess) and he was always talking to different coworkers and people went up to him to talk to him. I was just kinda sitting there, awkwardly. No one really spoke to me unless we were alone together and they talked to me to not be awkward. 

I don't know why I am like this. I do have friends and I am very outgoing among my friends and am usually the more social one of my friends. But when it comes to random people, I get so scared and become stiff and awkward. I really wish I could be just as open and friendly with random people. 

Is there a way I can change this? I am starting a full time job in June at a new company and I want more than anything to have lots of friends in the office and be comfortable enough with my coworkers to drop by their office/cubicle and just chat about nonsense. "
5y92md,5117,2017-03-08,My mute sister spoke for the first time last night.,fairynextdoor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y92md/my_mute_sister_spoke_for_the_first_time_last_night/,"I'm gonna try to recount the night as clearly as possible because honestly, I'm still so shaken up by the event. I don't know what to think of it. It just doesn't make any sense. 

My sisters name is Melissa. She is 25 years old. She has cerebral palsy. She is partially blind, always been mute, half paralyzed, and bound to a wheel chair, for those of you who don't know what that is. Any basic need you can think of, she has it done for her. Melissa talked once when she was two. It was the muffled cry ""mama"" through the baby monitor. Or at least that's what my mom told me. She is 8 years older than me. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my sister, but an eerie aura always seemed to follow her. Whatever house we moved to her room was the coldest, we could hear her laughing like someone was talking to her (about the only response she can give to us), and the worst one to admit is I was scared of her. I'd have terrible nightmares that I would go to her room in the middle of the night and someone was whispering to her, leaning over her bed while she giggled. In another one I'd go to check on her and she'd be floating in the air, pitch black eyes just staring at me like she could see me clear as day. As if she wasn't mostly blind. Those always scared me and I grew into the habit of sticking my hand in the door and flicking on the light before id even peak into her room. 

Eventually, as I grew older the nightmares stopped and so did the small habit of flicking on the light first. Two days ago I even took her out for a picnic. Everything was normal. I carried her to our huge living room couch when we got home and kicked back on the other side of the couch then turned on some tv. We fell asleep together on the couch that night and I don't think I ever bonded with her like that. 

I woke up yesterday morning and my mom (her usual caretaker) had already gotten her up. I made myself breakfast and headed off to my internship. It had been a long day working for a grassroots organization and by the time I'd got home I was beat. 

Here's where I can only recount as what I would call  the scariest moment of my 18 years of existence. 
As I come in around 9 o clock, my mom is getting ready to go out with her new fiancé (thankfully he's a good man). About once a month they like to go out and have a few drinks and I usually stay home alone. Well besides Melissa. I put on a movie last night and popped some popcorn in the microwave. My mom had been gone for about half an hour and I was already getting pretty sleepy despite the time. I could hear the faint ticking of the clock in the background and the movie playing. I stood in the kitchen waiting for my food. The light seemed to grow dimmer for just a second but I blinked a few times and it seemed to go back to normal. ""My eyes must be playing tricks on me,"" I thought. 

I pulled the steaming bag out of the microwave and began to walk back from the kitchen to the living room. That's when I heard it. It sounded like a faint whisper was coming from Melissa's room. My heart grew in pace and I grabbed the TV remote to turn it down, as that's what I thought the source of the whispering was. It couldn't be anything else. As I turned down the volume, I could hear the whispering still, just a little more loud and clear. The green drapes my mom used to add a POP in our living room seemed to be drained of their color. Everything did. I was frozen in terror but I kept telling myself I needed to check her because A. Someone is in my house or B. ... I didn't want to think about B. It honestly seemed worse than A at the moment. 

I crept down the hall to her cracked door. It was about half way open. I stood there listening for a minute, what seemed like a century. Just as I began to call myself silly and walk away, it started again. I couldn't make out the words but someone was definitely talking more loudly than a whisper at this point. I could basically feel myself vibrating I was shaking so badly. I felt along the wall for the switch as I entered the room. When I flicked on the light Melissa was sitting up in bed, facing away from me like someone had set her that way. This freaked me out because it just looked fucking creepy. 

The whispering started again and tears began to streak my cheeks as I realized it truly was coming from her. I began to walk over to her. As I began to slowly lay her down I hyper focused in on what she was saying. I couldn't really make out anything, it just seemed to be jumbled together. Her eyes were closed the whole time and I was trying to conceal my cry as I sat there running my fingers through her hair, just asking myself how this is happening. 

Then she said it. 
""Behind you."" And her whispering stopped. I immediately spun around and to my pleasant surprise nothing was there. I was panting at this point and basically took one last look to make sure she was okay before making a break for my phone. When my mom arrived home I couldn't even tell her what had happened at first. When I finally could spit it out, she just looked at me with a combination of disturbed and concern. Her fiancé slept on the couch last night and I slept with her. She told me not to worry about it. It was probably another one of my nightmares or something else. 

I don't know how this could be possible? What did she mean behind me? How can someone who hasn't spoke for 25 years or have learned a language at all, just gain speak? Any answers would be appreciated. Anything.

I'm in my early twenties, just out of school, and I've worked here for a few years as an intern, and accepted a full time job because I am finishing up my degree. I don't want to work helpdesk forever, and I understand that I need to work my way of up the ladder. However, I don't foresee that happening here. 

How do I go about getting experience to be able to apply for the Systems Administrator or Network Administrator positions if I have no opportunities to work with enterprise level equipment or virtualization software?

But I'm about to lose it right now. Since September or so, I've submitted 70+ applications for various SWE full-time positions and internships, and I have been contacted for a whopping TWO interviews. For my first interview, I actually got to the on-site (didn't get the offer), and I am currently scheduling the first round for the second follow up that I got.

So how is this possible? I've had my resume and cover letters looked at by everyone from my school's Career Services center to coworkers and SWE friends and everyone seems surprised that I've received so few responses... Is it expected that you have friends/family at the places you apply to in order to get interviews? Or a 3.9 GPA? It's not like I'm even applying to just big name companies, I've applied to all sorts of companies from tiny to huge, in 5-6 major cities around the US, and I've applied to every kind of position including iOS, web, front end, backend, and especially focused on all of the general software engineering positions for new/recent/college grads.

Though I'm still an undergrad, I have a few years of REAL web and iOS dev experience working part time for my university. So maybe I just pigeonholed myself for only web dev/engineering jobs? That doesn't seem right considering I'm still in school for my CS degree. And while we're on the topic, I'm also getting a degree in Psychology &amp; Neuroscience - did that make me a less desirable candidate because my education seemed ""less focused""?

cscareerquestions, I need you guys to help me figure out just WTF is going on!

5y9wjl,95,2017-03-08,Always wear headphones on the metro,M0C2K4,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y9wjl/always_wear_headphones_on_the_metro/,"Hey guys. I've never submitted a story on Reddit, but I have to share: I'm being followed. It's unclear who is following me and what he/she wants. I just know that I'm not safe anymore. I'm on the metro (rail/commuter train system in Washington, DC) typing this right now so my reception is crap. I hope there's enough of a connection for this all to post when I'm done..

So background information would probably be helpful for everything to make sense. About four years ago (Fall, 2013) I was a junior in college, and I got an internship with a government agency. It was paid and I was taking an internship class for credit so this was a win-win. I received notice in September 2013 that I’d been chosen, but due to the government shutdown, I was unable to start until October 2013. My schedule was Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

The day was Thursday, October 31, 2013; Halloween. I boarded the metro to embark on my commute to Downtown Washington. I was a little ahead of schedule, which was awesome because that meant there were still seats available. I quickly snagged one and opened my purse in search of some headphones. When I realized that I’d left them in the pocket of another coat I was bummed, but just decided to text some of my sorority sisters about our weekend plans.

My fellow commuters seemed un-phased by the fact that it was Halloween. However, I was feverishly texting back and forth about costumes and fraternities and all that bullshit. Looking back, I wish those conversations were more enthralling because maybe I wouldn’t be hopping from car to car on this damn train trying to avoid this guy. 
So I’m texting away. We make one stop, then another. In total, there are 8 metro stops from my college to my internship; it’s about a 30 minute commute. Not bad. About 4 stops in a man boards my metro car. He seems uneasy; he’s pacing my end of the car and then briskly walks down the aisle to the other end of the car. He’s dressed like an average guy, in an old but clean polo and faded light jeans. The man looks to be in his mid-30’s but weathered; maybe from drug use? 

To be frank with you all, I don’t even know why I noticed him. It could’ve been my justice/law major working overtime. Who knows? Regardless, I kept tabs on the guy for another two stops. 
We hit the sixth metro stop, and the doors open and close. I’m halfway through a ranting text from a sister when the same man comes flying down the aisle screaming, “HELP HELP HELP!” and jumping like a damn popcorn kernel in a microwave. No less than 10 seconds later, a man comes sauntering down the aisle, dressed to the nines. He was dapper as hell, and smelled like nice cologne. This gent looked to be in his mid-late 40’s. As he struts passed me, he’s repeating, “ain’t nothin’ wrong with him,” as his eyes remain locked on the man spazzing at the tail end (my end) of the metro car. I glanced around me to see no ones’ gazes had faltered from their newspapers, books, and iPods.

At this point I felt like a huge asshole; have I been staring at this man’s son, judging him for potential drug use when in fact may have a disability? Damn. What a jerk I was. So I just lowered my head and kept reading the text. We were still between stops and our train was holding to allow another to pass (single-tracking is a bitch!). I looked up from my phone to see the jumping bean cornered, like an animal, by the older gentleman. Weird, but it’s not my business. 

Until…the dapper gent puts his face about 2 inches from that of the spastic man and says in a low, almost inaudible tone, “I have eyes all over this city. If you don’t get me my money by 5pm, I will find you and I will not hesitate to kill you. Do you understand me?” My jaw drops like wtf is this real life? No, it can’t be. It has to be a Halloween prank, right? Then, of course, the spastic man successfully squirms away from the classy gent and begins to scream “HELP!” some more, whilst climbing on a lady and her son. The lady yelps, also in disbelief, grasping at her son. A nearby passenger drops his briefcase and puts this man (who seems to be completely out of control) in a headlock. 

Just then we pull up to the next station, and the guy holding the spastic man in a headlock, pushes him off the train and I saw that guy sprint away from the train, never once looking back. The doors close and the train is once again in motion. I shift my gaze over to the dapperly-dressed man. He’s sitting down into a seat, opening up a newspaper. He catches my gaze, tips his hat in my direction, and smiles nonchalantly. His eyes were so dark and I instantly felt a chill run up my spine. I got off at my stop and went to report what had just happened to the WMATA workers. The woman just smacked her gum and said, “k.” 

Fast forward to last week, nearly four years later. I was on the metro on my way home from work (I got a job at the department following graduation), and I’ll be damned. That same dapper man got on the train in that same damn outfit. He tipped his hat at me and said, “good day.” I just stared at him until I collected myself and stammered out, “you too.” I jumped off the train at the next stop and Ubered home. And now, I’m on my way home from work. I left early since I felt run-down (this sporadic DC weather has me sick all the time). And who the hell is sitting across from me as I feverishly type this? None other than the dapper man. I have no idea what to do. How’d he know I would be on this train, in this car, at this time? What does he want? Why now? Nothing makes sense. Sure it could be a coincidence but what the hell?? Please. Let me know if you too have seen this man, and if you know what he wants. But for those of you who haven't encountered this man on the metro, always wear your headphones and keep your head down when you ride."

This interview was for a paid internship with a company that I really like.  The entire interview was over Skype, but the interviewer didn't have a camera and there was a ton of noise in the background, so it was really hard to judge his reactions.  The first 2/3 of it went great, but towards the end we had this exchange:

&gt;Interviewer: So you're graduating in May, are you looking for jobs elsewhere as well?

&gt; Me: Yeah, I have a few other interviews planned out so far.

&gt; Interviewer: Are they for full time positions?

&gt;Me: Some of them are, yeah.

&gt;Interviewer: (Silence) ...So you would probably take one of those over this?

&gt; Me: If I was offered a full time position I would have to do what ever I thought would be best for my future.

&gt;Interviewer: (Silence)

&gt;Me: I do really like [Insert Company Name], and if you think there is a good chance that I could be hired on full time from this internship then it is something that I would highly consider.

He ended up picking back up with some questions for me, but I felt like the entirety of the interview was thrown off.  I didn't want to lie to him about other opportunities I may have, but I feel like he pushed way to much.  

Do you guys have any advice on how I should have handled this?  Should I just not mention other opportunities in the future?

Due to my normal jobs work hours I almost exlusively did QA during my internship. In January my internship offered me a full-time job as a Junior Developer. A good portion of my work is still QA, along with Git maintenance and updating servers/managing branches and releases to servers etc. I occasionally have bee given small programming tasks like making sure the copyright updates to the current year on a site, or tweaking CSS, creating an HTML page, running SQL queries to fix things etc.

Since this is a small company I knew I'd be wearing many hats but I feel like I'm not really doing enough development work. While my resume says I'm a developer, I worry if I attempt to get another more programming intensive development job, my current experience won't be as valuable as if I was a developer at some other company. My current job is a great place to work and they said they'd slowly give me more dev work but I still don't think it will be a lot due to the nature of the workflow(We have an offshore dev team who does 90% of the dev work).

While I do not have a degree, my pay is much lower than most entry-level developers and I know this is both a combination of being at such a small company but I feel also because I'm not actually doing a lot of development. I'm just worried I may actually be hurting my career progress by working here, rather than focusing on programming somewhere else.

So I guess my question is this. Does this sound like a normal workload for a Junior Developer? Its hard to tell if I'm being 'tricked' into having this title while they have me do other work, or this is simply part of the process of becoming a career developer that happened to start out at a smaller company with an offshore dev team. I don't have any friends/or know anyone who is a programmer so its hard to relate my experiences with others."

However I am not good enough yet to ask to get paid those exorbitant machine learning salaries. 

This is kind of a perfect solution imo. I can learn for free, from real people in the field, doing real interesting cool stuff, and they don't have to pay me, they can just use my help for free!

However, the resounding advice is to never work for free. Not even taking a free internship.

I'm a current freshman planning a double major in computer science &amp; business. I'm originally from the West Coast and currently go to an engineering-focused school in the East.

Today I got an offer from a tech startup in NYC! Really excited, but it comes with one caveat: it's an unpaid internship, and living costs in New York are really high. Because I have no family in the East Coast, I'll basically pay out-of-pocket for the entire thing, including food, rent, etc..

The startup said that they are not open to paying interns. However, I do plan on asking if they can help reimburse my relocation/living expenses. I also plan to ask for a grant from my University to see if they can help. I know some school offer grants for unpaid internships, but to my knowledge, mine doesn't. Doesn't hurt to ask, though.

My parents offered to pay for my living &amp; housing expenses, but I honestly would feel guilty taking even more money from them, especially because they promised to pay all of my tuition through undergrad.

Does anyone have any other suggestions on how I can make ends meet in New York?"
5ycgfc,1,2017-03-08,"Freshman math/cs major, am I crazy to turn down an internship for a REU?",chamberwell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ycgfc/freshman_mathcs_major_am_i_crazy_to_turn_down_an/,"Hi guys. For context, I'm a freshman math and cs major at the University of Massachusetts. I recently got 2 internship offers that I'm really excited about. The better one that I'm thinking of accepting is at Putnam Investments (medium sized financial company in Boston).  I'm really enthusiastic about this one for multiple reasons. One of the projects that I could work on is Putnam's data visualization software, which I find really cool because I'm a math guy just as much as (if not more than - more on that later) I'm a cs guy. I'd get to work with a team of other interns which I think would be really fun. Also, the pay is pretty good, $24/hour for 10+ weeks. I know that very few freshmen get internships like this, and that I'd be passing up an incredible opportunity if I turned it down.

The other thing I might do instead is this REU program. If you don't know what REU is, it's Research Experience for Undergraduates - the NSF gives grants to various universities so that they can fund undergraduates doing research in various fields. The one that I got into is at the University of Miami and the projects are all about CS. The research projects I could do are really, really interesting, (roughly) in order of my interest, they are studying how GPU's can enhance this elliptic curve factoring algorithm to attack cryptosystems, studying how different normalization techniques can improve how deep neural networks recognize images, this computational neuroscience project that would use sequencing technology to study how neuron transcription changes when neurons are injured, and this project in how to visualize neurological data. It would pay $5k for the summer and a $120/week food allowance for a total of $6200 for 10 weeks. They would also pay for my travel to and from Miami and provide free housing. It's less than what Putnam would pay me, but not a ton less, and either way it's more money that I'd know what to do with so I'm not too concerned about money. I also think it'd be pretty cool to spend a summer in Miami away from my parents and all, instead of living at home and commuting every day.

The way I'm looking at it, the decision is basically deciding what career path I want to go down: there is my dream of being a scientist/mathematician, or there is the software engineer path. Like I mentioned, I like math as much as if not more than I like programming. My ideal career would be one where I do math on a regular basis and apply it to something really cool, whether that be cryptography, complexity theory, computational biology, or something similarly meaningful. I know that this would likely have to involve grad school, a PhD, a postdoc, and 10+ years of making little money and moving up through mid-level academia before I would become a professor and things would get really interesting. I also know how cutthroat academia and how hard it can be to get established.

If I went the safer, more traditional software engineer path, this internship would be an awesome start: not many freshman would get an internship like this, and if I keep my grades as good as they are now I feel like I'd be in a great position to get a big N internship next summer which would put me in a really good place career-wise. However, I have this lingering fear that if I become a software engineer, I'll get a job writing some boring application that won't invovle any cool math/interesting problems, just lots and lots of code, and I won't like my job, given that math and science is what I really like. I know that there are lots of really interesting software engineering jobs that involve lots of math and research-type work, such as in AI like making self-driving cars or in cryptography. However, there's no guarantee that I could get a job that involves stuff like that. Of course, going into grad school and research is no guarantee I'd be able to work on interesting research, as not everyone makes it in academia.

Of course, I probably sound like a crazy person thinking that what I do summer after freshman year will determine the rest of my life. I know that either decision will not determine my future career, and that I could still go either path no matter what choice I make. But it's true that this decision will at least push me a little bit towards one career direction. I'm leaning towards the REU for a few reasons, which I'm not sure if they are true and would like some clarification on.

I'm under the impression that grad school admission generally won't care about industry internships that much (or at least not as much as companies care about research experience), even if it involved something fairly mathematical like the data visualization I might work on at Putnam. On the other hand, even if I do the REU, I would still gain some really practical CS skills depending on the project I do, such as GPU programming, or artificial intelligence/machine learning, or cloud computing. I'm under the impression that companies would view a paid research experience in CS as almost as good as, if not as good as, a paid software internship. Am I correct in those assumptions? Say I decide in 2 years that I want to go the software engineer route. How would the Putnam internship versus a paid CS research internship look to a big N company recruiting me?

Also, I think that REU's are harder to get into than internships, although I'm unsure about this. My sample space for REU's is pretty small (I applied to 3, only heard back from 1 so far) so I'm not sure how hard they are to get into but I believe that they're quite selective. Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I don't think it'd be too hard to get a comparable internship next summer, given the fact that I got 2 offers this year as a freshman, (and a 3rd interview that I'm going to cancel), I think I could get something comparable next year as a sophomore. Still, knowing how few freshman get internships like this, I feel like I'd be a madman turning down 2 of them.

Sorry for this wall of text. As you can probably tell from this long, rambling soliloquy, I'm seriously agonizing over this decision. I know I shouldn't be stressing out so much over this given that whichever choice I make, I'll be in a very good place for a freshman, but nevertheless I am. If only I could do both :( Someone help me make a decision please!"

I'm a high school senior (Boston area) looking for some advice on summer internships as it is a grey area between high schooler and college freshman. &amp;nbsp;


I have been employed / interning with my local town hall's IT department for the past three summers and I would like to move onto a more demanding program this coming summer. &amp;nbsp;

This is a throwaway so I am happy to share my portfolio site/ resume if anyone is interested, but I am most interested in infosec and cyber-security (whether that takes the form of a sysadmin or a dedicated security researcher), so I have been looking into internships with Raytheon and rapid7, but each are targeted to university/ college students, even if they have only completed one year. &amp;nbsp;

My primary skills (and interests) are programming (Java, C, C++, Python, x86 ASM) and Linux systems administration, so I am really looking for an internship where I could apply and grow these skills. Just by my personal projects and homelab I would likely be more proficient than most college freshmen. &amp;nbsp;

I have already applied to Army educational outreach programs (SEAP, HSAP) and I would like to apply to Raytheon, but my question really is whether or not it would be acceptable for me to apply for positions targeted to university students simply because there isn't much out there for graduating seniors. &amp;nbsp;

Obviously over the next couple months I will be networking at conventions and conferences, but any help would be appreciated. &amp;nbsp;

TL;DR Should a high school graduate apply for college-level internships?"

5yctiz,1,2017-03-08,Is it acceptable to accept internship offer after accepting a different one?,gunhorseunlimited,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/5yctiz/is_it_acceptable_to_accept_internship_offer_after/,"I'm a Computer Science student. Back in October, I interviewed with Company A for a summer 2017 internship position.

The HR rep for Company A told me when I interviewed with them that they would get back to me in a few weeks with their decision (positive or negative). They never got back to me, so I talked to some other students in my computer science classes and all of them said that no one they know had heard back from Company A, so I figured the HR Rep was backed up and I should just consider it a loss.

Around this same time, I applied to Company B and interviewed with them in November/December. In early January I received an offer from Company B and told them I was interested. They had me apply to the company that handles temporary staffing for them, and I received 1) An official offer letter from the temporary staffing agency, and 2) A link to complete information for the background check. Additionally, I completed a drug screening for Company B. I have not signed and returned the offer letter, as it states in the offer letter that it is to be signed and returned on my first day (which I think is odd, but I digress).

Earlier today, I received a call. I didn't answer the call (I never answer calls from numbers I don't know unless I'm expecting a call), but they left a voice mail: It's an HR Rep from Company A. They told me that my information was given to them by my previous HR Rep at the company, and they'd like to ""discuss internship opportunities available for Summer 2017."" This doesn't necessarily mean they're going to offer me an internship position, but I feel that it's likely, and I want to be prepared if they do.

I interned with Company A last summer in a different department, and did not receive a return offer, but my HR Rep at the time encouraged me to re-apply to a different department if I wanted to work for them again. I enjoyed my internship, but I'm not sure if I'd like to work for Company A full time, while Company B seems like a company I might be able to get behind more. However, Company A has a better internship program than Company B:

 - I was paid almost 18% more last summer than Company B is offering me for this summer

 - Company A paid for relocation as well as offered corporate housing or a housing stipend, while Company B does not provide either; and

 - the location that Company A's internship would be is a nicer area of the country that the location of Company B's internship, in my opinion

Anyway, I'm getting way too long-winded here. My question is, if I receive an offer from Company A, and decide that I like their offer better, is it appropriate for me to accept it and contact my HR Rep from Company B, backing out of my summer internship with them? I'm not sure what the etiquette is or what's expected of me. Thanks so much for reading all of this :)"

5ycvnf,3,2017-03-08,UW Seattle or WWU,renvoir,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/5ycvnf/uw_seattle_or_wwu/,"I've always wanted to go to UW, but now I've been questioning it this year. However, I want to study CSE. I want to work with programming, coding, the whole spiel 90% of prospective CS students say. I took a few CS classes at a community college and am learning some languages, and I really like it. I know next to nothing about the entire study of it, but I like it to put it simply so far. However, I might not be the student they're willing to admit once I apply for the major. Realistically, I'd be looking at falling somewhere like 3.3-3.8 by the time I try to apply to CS if I'm in UW probably. However at Western, it seems far more likely I could get into the CSE program. 


PROS UW:
• I'll like the area more 
• Better and more internships 
• I REALLY like the campus
• The ~prestige~ of it being UW Seattle
• Pretty sure I qualify for the Husky Promise 
• Closer to my home, easier to travel


CONS UW: 
• I will probably dorm if I go to UW for freshman year and I don't know if my mental health and thus grades can take that kind of hit
• Probably won't be able to get into CS
• It seems most STEM majors are super competitive
• It would cost more than WWU
• Larger class size on the whole
• High car density
• Probably will regret not going to WWU a lil



PROS WWU:
• pretty neat campus
• Is relatively near Vancouver
• Is relatively near Seattle
• Bellingham's a pretty neat area, I don't know it well at all though
• I'll be in a student apartment with 3 friends (2 who are already students at WWU) so more privacy, better mental health, closer to the campus, cheaper than dorming
• Bit cheaper overall
• Better chance of studying CSE
• Majors aren't as competitive 
• The Planned Parenthood in Bellingham offers a service I might use that I don't think the Seattle one does. 


CONS WWU:
• it doesn't have the same reputation as UW
• I prefer the Seattle area 
• I aprefer the UW campus
• It seems harder to find internships and research opportunities in the area
• will probably regret not going to UW at least a lil too



I'm all twisted up over this. I like both equally but for different reasons. At this point I'm a fence sitter with my feet dangling over the WWU side because the whole CSE thing. I don't want to go to UW and end up having to transfer to WWU after 2 years because I couldn't get into a major I at least was interested in; I'd be slightly okay with the other way around because if I end up transferring to UW, it's because I could get into CSE or a major I like. I could always try to move to Seattle after graduating regardless. Any thoughts, experiences, or advice? "

Does anyone have advice about at what stage I should start thinking about searching/applying for internships? Is there a certain course I should have completed before taking on an internship? 

I live around the Washington, DC area so it's we have a ton of defense contractors out here. I've seen some requirements of 1-2 years of C++ or some other language. But wondered what others have experienced and what could be recommended."

I have interned with this company for the past two years. It would be a safe option to take and I could live in New York City.

Regardless, I'm not going to take the offer. I don't think I'm going to take any offer. College, and these past two internships have really taken a toll on me. Every day I wake up and have a series of classes or a day of work I *have to get through* as opposed to things I look forward to. All of my hobbies, which are fairly productive, are put on the backburner for these obligations and I don't want to do this anymore. Not to mention, some family issues with my parents' violent divorce have caused me to see things in a different light recently and sort of solidified that I want to do something sort of ""out-of-the-box"" that I know I will enjoy more. At least, if I don't try it now, when can I? I have a lot of self-taught web-development experience and at one point was making around $3k/month from my websites but a lot of that died when I had to do college full-time. I have a plan in place that I think could allow me to make as much or perhaps more, and is more scalable. I have told my family, including my parents, that I won't be taking my job offer and surprisingly they understand and actually want me to try, especially as they know I have not been doing well lately. 

So, on to the actual question. I'm trying to find a place I can move to for a year or so while I pursue this. I have $6k saved for this and will likely make more by the time June rolls around. Also, my father would likely help me if I asked. I'm sure I could borrow a few thousand from him if I need. I'm from a very cold, snowy region of the country. We have great summers, but the winters are long and draining. I have spent the past 4 years in a state with slightly better weather, but similarly draining winters. I'm so done with the cold and the snow, unless it's a place like Denver that embraces the cold and makes it great. 

Here are things that matter to me:
* Warm climate
* I'd prefer a house, and I'd vastly prefer a place with a garage or shed where I can work on cars or motorcycles (part of my business plan as well)
* I'd like to be surrounded by other young people but wouldn't mind an older crowd to an extent (I'm 22). I think the best way to achieve this would be to find a college town, but most college towns don't combine well with my other criteria.
* Somewhere chill
* The ideal place would be a beachy, medium-sized place by the water
* I know most of these things do not combine well

Here are the places I'm considering, in order:
1. St. Petersburg, FL - It looks so awesome, just worried that the population is gonna be really old
2. Denver, CO
3. Austin, TX
4. Anywhere in California that is by the water and *remotely* cheap
5. South/North Carolina (?)

One other question-- I'm really worried about moving somewhere and not knowing anyone. I can always meet people (I'd probably get a job at a bar or something) but part of me is still worried about this even though I've done it before when I moved to college. Any advice?\

I know this is long, but this is a huge decision for me and I'd like to consider everything. If you have any input at all, I would appreciate it greatly!"
5ydkef,1,2017-03-09,Help choosing between two really good job opportunities,RogerfuRabit,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5ydkef/help_choosing_between_two_really_good_job/,"So Im a wildland firefighter for the US forest service. Ive been doing this job for 5 years + 1 more year as an Americorps intern. I’m entering season #6. I’m basically a sergeant/NCO, my role is a ‘squad boss,’ leading 4-6 firefighters during day-to-day forest work and/or out on the fireline. I can be in charge of small forest fires. I want to do this as a career and the next step is to qualify as a ‘single resource’ boss, basically being in charge of a fire engine or 20-man handcrew.

**Here's my conundrum:** I have to choose between two jobs I really really want. I’ve taken one… but I’m about to be offered the other, and I’m really fucking torn.

**Job #1** The job *I have* is a GS05 temp seasonal job in the town Im I currently live in.

* I get some benefits (paid leave, sick leave, and some help with healthcare while Im working, so 6~ months of the year). I have very few rights and can be laid off in a few days notice if some budget snafu occurs or whatnot.
* It's a covetted location to work, a cool mountain town with lots to do in the summer. Ive lived here for the last 6 years... except when I leave to work in the boonies every summer.
* I can come home to my long time girlfriend [soon to be fiance] and 2 dogs every night, except when we camp out on fires or go on 'off forest' assignments, so like 80% of the time Im working (april-october). I can tend my garden. I can go shopping whenever I need to on the way home. My job is basically at the fire department that handles wildfires.
* I'll probably work 6-7 months of the year and make $35k, but only get 5.5 months of full time status which counts for 'time in grade' i.e. my ability to qualify for a GS06. That's kinda lame.
* I'll get good work experience at this job and it's on a new National Forest for me, in an area I want to stay in, so it'll be good networking.
* I'll also be one of six GS05's and it's a big organization, so I'll realistically be like #10 in charge out of 30 firefighters. 
* It's also on a firefighting engine crew, whereas I've only ever worked on handcrews, so it'd be a new experience and good cross training.
* I have committed to this job and will start in a few weeks. If I take this second job, there might be some hurt feels, but they will be short lived as it’s the federal government and everyone knows our hiring is whacky and taking a promotion suddenly is par for the course. For instance, the guy who hired me at this job wont be there this summer as he took a promotion.
* I dont know my bosses really at all. They seem cool, but wildland firefighting attracts some strong personalities and Ive worked for dicks in the past… it makes life hell, as we usually work 6-7 days/week for between June-September… we often live at work.

**Job #2** I have this second job offer waiting in the wings. My old boss is working behind the scenes to offer me a GS05 permanent seasonal position. This in kind of a big deal

* In addition to paid leave, sick leave, I’ll be a fully vetted government employee and get matching retirement, cheap healthcare year-round (and I can basically not pay it in the winter and have that debt taken out of my large summer paychecks), and **a pension** which is based on years of service. I'm 28, i'll have to retire between age 50 and 57. Oh yeah, and if I get hurt while not at work, they cant fire me and have to find a new job that I can do or pay me disability. It’s a pretty sweet benefits package.
* I worked for this boss for 3 summers and really like him and his #2 in charge. I'd be #3 in charge. At times, I'd certainly be #1 in charge.
* It's a sleepy district about 1:40mins away from where I’d live. I'd have to commute weekly. I'd have to pay for housing and live with the mostly single dudes. I've calculated this to be a $2000 expense, plus the untold suffering of not coming home to my GF and dogs about 80% of the time between april and October.
* It's not even in a town and Id have to do strategic grocery shopping.
* Being a perm, I'm guaranteed 6 months of work all of which will count as time in grade. I can also apply for temporary 'details' in the winter and try out random other jobs in the USFS. I’m also due a $0.75 pay raise every 12 months for the rest of my career, in addition to getting promotions etc.
* It's a sleepy district. I love the area, I recreate and hunt there in my free time, but the fire load is light and there's not much to do after work besides shoot guns and drink, both of which I enjoy, but…
* It’s a firefighting handcrew, and leading a handcrew is what Id really like to do someday. It’s a hard qualification to get, usually with a long waiting list to get training opportunities for it, and I’d be prioritized.
* It’s on a different national forest that’s kinda provincial and an old boys club.
* I’d probably make less than Job #1
* If I turn down this job, my old boss would be kinda butthurt, but we’re friends and he’d probably understand.


So looking at these facts, and I can’t list them all. What do you think?

I’m kinda leaning toward Job #1. Coming home every night to the girl and dogs is HUGE. Plus this new forest seems to have a lot of opportunity, for instance they called me today and asked if I could start work early to help the camp ground managers cut down dead trees at all the campgrounds around the district - working full time, 4/10 schedule, starting in 3 weeks… So I’m making commitments now cuz it’s getting closer and I’m starting to really stress out. I’ve turned down 2 other ‘perm’ offers becuz they’d require a 3 hr weekly commute. I think I need to keep with that school of thought and say money/benefits be damned, my personal happiness is more important. Plus, it’s something new, the unknown, and… yeah, that’s exciting. Versus going back to my boys out in the boonies. Fuck… this has got me stressed."

At the start of september I was selected for a 1-year long training program to be molded into a Java Enterprise Edition developer.
There were around 75 applications and only 10 were selected. 
At the end of May we will have finished the course completely in which we have been given a firm understanding of Java.
We have been working together for 8 hours every day since the beginning of september.
In that time we have seen a fair bit of Java and the optimal design patterns needed for OO programming.
We have also had multiple lessons on HTML, CSS, Javascript, XML, JUnit, SQL, and starting next week we will start with JPA with Hibernate and following that we will finish the course with lessons on Spring. We will then combine all these practices by making a fully functional bank application (we will be making this with the entire group)

Now the reason that I am saying this, do you think its possible for me to receive an internship? Or is it out of the ordinary for someone without a degree to apply for this? 
We are already being approached by companies who want to recruit us (locally) with a fulltime offer for a junior development position when we finish this course.

Any ideas on how to approach this? Any sites I should check out to apply on? 
Since its probably not common it's quite overwhelming and I'm having trouble finding out where to apply to.

(Which opportunity to choose?),EggerChristian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5yethk/how_should_i_invest_my_free_time_which/,"As the title states, I have a problem to decide which university/career related opportunity to choose.

First of all, some context: I am a 2nd Semester computer science student in a somewhat (QS Ranking for CS: 51-100) good university. My grades are excellent and now that I got used to the university life, I find that I have quite a lot of free time.

So that is why I am trying to make use of that time.
Here are my current options to choose from:

a) Working part-time (12 hours/week) in the R&amp;D department in a rather unknown but very successful tech company. I have previously done two summer-time internships there (same position, same company) and have always learned a lot + was mentored very well.

b) Becoming a Tutor at my university. A tutor is basically supporting the team of a specific institute. (Correcting tests, helping students taking courses at that institute, assisting other members of the institute etc.)

c) Two fellow students and I are currently working on an app that seems to have rather good chances to be actually released by the end of summer. (We already have an appointment with an investor)


Taking option a) or b) wouldnt end c) but just limit the effort that i could put into our app by about 70%.

So which one of the above options would you say is best? (And would look best on a resume) Which one would impress companies like Google, Facebook etc. the most?

TLDR: should I work part-time as a software developer intern, become a helping hand at my university or put 100% of my time into an app that im working on currently?

5yfkrt,1,2017-03-09,Drop out of college to travel ?,Yoshiwhut420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5yfkrt/drop_out_of_college_to_travel/,"Hey guys, I don't have many people to share my ideas with so please give me some input on whether this is a good/realistic plan or not.

I'm going to try and be as concise as possible. Well i'm currently 24 and in community college and i am not enjoying it at all. Not only did I screw up my GPA when i was younger, but i have heard that a college degree by itself is pretty useless if you do not also network/internship along with it. This idea does not sit well with me because I have very bad social skills which makes it difficult to make friends. Not only that, but it is hard for me to connect with kids who don't share similar interests with me. I know you can say that its my responsibility to go out and initiate and that is correct, but out of all these years nobody has tried to network with me either since it goes both ways. i think this has something to do with the fact im gay (bisexual) in a very conservative environment (Texas).

So I was pretty bummed that i can spend years and years obtaining a degree only to be told that i ""didn't have experience"" or that i couldn't get my resume read because i didn't know someone to vouch for me at a company. I think both of these scenarios are very possible. Even internships have requirements. Ive came to the conclusion that i cannot compete in the job market and have became pretty suicidal. I feel that 'time' is the most valuable thing in my life, and i am unwilling to invest it in a degree that doesn't guarantee more than a mediocre soul crushing 9-5 lifestyle that i would probably kill myself in anyways. 

Mid last year I was looking around reddit and discovered backpacking around the world. My logic is that since i am not enjoying college, i would never be motivated at it so ill be wasting my time and not getting much out of it. However, I love the idea of traveling and seeing different cultures around the world, even at the expense of comfort. I live a very comfortable lifestyle right now but isn't worth it if i'm this unhappy and suicidal. I figured before i kill myself i might as well try and travel the world and see what comes out of it, maybe i can even find a job and make a living somewhere and never have to come back home! Worst case scenario, if things still don't work out and I cant figure anything out after traveling, then i can kill myself anyways but at least i would have tried to make things better. Remember, the reason i'm so scared to invest so much time into school for a piece of paper is because TIME is incredibly valuable and a degree does not seem to guarantee anything by itself. My biggest regret would be to graduate and not find work while losing 4-6 years of my life for nothing. Relationships, Travel and time are probably the things I value the most way above money.

Finally, I'm sure a lot of you are going to suggest getting help for my ""clinical depression"". However , i do not believe i have clinical depression although i am diagnosed with it. The reason is because if I had clinical depression, whenever something exciting happens (scored a date, seeing a good friend in a long time, discovered something interesting... etc.) I would still be depressed regardless of circumstances. I feel it is circumstantial and dependent on my environment. My doctors disagree and kept shoving meds down me, and i stopped taking them over a year ago. Also, the fact that I had been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and bipolar without ANY tests done whatsoever is very suspicious to me. Asking me how i ""feel"" and how my day went is not a very accurate way to determine a mental illness.

 I herd life is too short to do things just for the money. I'd rather be poor and uncomfortable but happy.

Sorry for the rant, thank you if you took the time to read this, but what do you think i should do in this situation? stay in school? if so why? Travel the world? For how long? I really appreciate yalls responses and would like to get opinions of other people instead of just my own, maybe yall know something that I don't. Thanks!

** I have also done a lot of research to find these answers on my own and they are contradicting ( college is worth it/ college is worthless,   Traveling now it will change your life/ You should wait till you get a career to travel ,   Get this degree/ get that degree  etc...) It seems there is no clear answer."

I posted [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5wd4xx/internship_compensation_help_xpost_r_internships/) asking about how to ask about internship compensation. 

To give a TLDR: At the internship interview with a global company, both interviewers stated they absolutely wanted me and were going to check on the hour restrictions for interns at their company and would get me onboarded ASAP (which they are not 100% sure how long it would take). COmmenters said basically once I received a formal offer we would talk compensation.

As I had interviewed 2/22, I decided to email the admin on 2/27 asking if there had been any update on the above-mentioned items and an hour later the recruiter emailed me stating "" I wanted to let you know we’re working on some final internal details before make the official offer and get the background started"". 

I asked the recruiter on 3/2 what kind of timeline I should expect from this process and he said ""It should not take much longer, my worst estimate is 3 weeks but I know the team is excited about having you on board so they’re pushing to move forward. I hope to have better news next week but it really could be 1-3 weeks"".

Today makes a week since that email. Should I reach out to him again just to check in? On one hand I do not want to harass him, but on the other I want to make sure they know I am still interested and keep the process moving forward, instead of stalling.

I am learning a lot but after looking at the topics and information in the A+ I feel that I need to learn all that information to educate myself and better my career.

So over the summer break from my university classes (about 3 months) I plan to really buckle down and start studying for the A+. Hopefully I can get it done within 2 months or within my summer break time frame. 

My situation is that after university and getting my A+ is that I don't really want to be stuck in ""Help Desk"". I was wondering how hard it is, or what kind of time frame, it would be to get the N+ right after I get my A+. Does the information carry over making it an easy transition?

for those that have gotten their A+ then went right for the N+, can you share your experience and how you did it?

5yfzj4,15,2017-03-09,What to expect/demand from your college career services,HackVT,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5yfzj4/what_to_expectdemand_from_your_college_career/,"All
I want to help you get some help from your career services centers and to leverage them. Here are some ideas of mine on what you should demand regardless of the size of your college or school , full or part time. 

Here's a quick list that you should get out of or at least start demanding that your career services start doing. 

**1. Resume review**

At a minimum they should be looking at and reviewing your resume for the most basic formatting and grammatical issues.  It's up to you to go and see them but if you are making the time to get there use them to review what you have and to provide you examples. 

*What you should not get: a big fat resume book with samples and that's it.* 

**2. Mock interviews**

Again, this requires very little from them just to have you answer some interview questions and get some feedback. Even if you get outside HR people asking you fit questions it will be great for you to get done. And for your mock interview wear the clothes you will wear for a real interview. 

*What you should not get: paired up with someone not in your industry or who talks the whole time.*

**3. Whiteboarding groups**

Technical interviewing and whiteboarding sucks but it's a core aspect of what we have to do. Getting some students to ask you questions and provide some pizzas should be something that they can organize to occur. Even if you get paired up with a peer who can time you and look at your answers. 

*What you should not get: No help. This is really tantamount to being able to deal well in a situation where you will be challenged.*

**4. Internship ideas/local company connections**

I write this from the least second lowest populated state in the US -- local companies are the lifes blood of the career centers. Yes Big 4 are great but more students in their early collegiate years will be able to work during the school year for local small shops. The ability for these firms to come to a career fair is really important. If you see that there are companies missing that are local, demand that they work on getting them to the event. Conversely, if there are other career fairs at other schools that may have a larger draw, they should work to arrange transport or at least get you the details so you can get there. 

*What you should not get: Interviews to just government or state agencies. There are places that you can intern at and they should be small. Additionally, make sure that they aren't gouging employers to show up there.*

**5. Basic guidance for budgets during and after school**

Again, this can happen in probably an hour but having a budget becomes super important once you graduate. Having your finances in line is extremely important. The earlier they tackle this with you the better or you can learn on your own. I have seen so many new and expensive cars in the parking lot driven by new hires that it's staggering. 

*What you should not get: just getting dumped off by your parents and told to learn from the experiences of college. College is a safe space, you are there to learn and to fail gently. Making financial mistakes early can have long term impacts that are significant down the line.*

  To start off, I am currently a junior in college and have an internship lined up for the summer.  However, this puts a slight pressure on me, because the way the company described the internship is that you'll have a job lined up for you at the end as long as you don't truly mess up.  Thus, a lot of thoughts pop up into my head wondering if I should just work at the company I intern for this summer, or take the risk of just applying to full-time jobs.  

  I know I'm probably looking too far into the future with this, but I would just love some brutal honesty of how *far* I can go I guess.  I put a link to my resume below, and I'm excited to hear what you guys have to say.

However, I currently have another paid internship. I asked my current manager if I could take an unpaid leave, but he told me that I had to work minimum 5-6 hours per week during the unpaid internship. The other internship is a fulltime internship where I am supposed to work 8 hours a day, 5 times a week. Additionally, all this is during the exam period where I will have 2 exams during the unpaid internship (3 before the start of the internship).

The problem is that I think my current internship/part-time work is pretty good for a student, as I am working as an investment advisor. It pays ok (however, way below my firm's competitors), and I like my co-workers. It is generally pretty flexible year-round, and it usually fits my masters progamme. However, if I am going to work full-time internship + 5-6 hours per week in the second internship + revising for exams, it is going to be very exhaustive, and that will have a negative effect on my study (and possible both of the jobs). However, if I manage to do all three and get good grades, I think it will be pretty good to mention in future interviews. 

What do you think I should do? Should I quit my current internship, or juggle two jobs while trying to get good grades?

I'm asking because I had it under ""Personal Projects"", but I'm getting hardly any responses from applying.

I'm a computer science student from the Netherlands specialising in web development. I'm in my third year and in September I have to do a 6 month internship. I'm looking to widen my knowledge of web development so I have a better chance of getting hired at a fun internship. I find it really hard to figure out what to do, though. I feel like businesses require so many things and then they list another 20 things as a 'nice to have'. I understand that people get hired without fitting every single requirement often enough, but I find it hard to distinguish what's important and what's not.

So far I've learned quite a lot about JavaScript:

* I've used it both server side (with express) and client side (with react+redux)
* I know how to use web sockets 
* I know how to write unit tests using mocha
* I know how to write automated tests using a testing framework like mocha in combination with selenium and webdriver
* I've built several applications for school assignment using all of these techniques combined.
* I know some jQuery (and I think my google-fu is good enough to find out more about it when needed)

Apart from JavaScript, these are skills I have that are worth mentioning:

* **php**: I know fairly well how to use the language itself, but I've never used it in combination with libraries.
* **java**:  I've used it in combination with maven packages and I've even used it to write web applications (for a school assignment). Most of my java knowledge has kinda faded after not using it since the start of my second year, but I'll have to use it again soon so that will refresh my memory.
* **SQL**: I've done a semester on database design and implementation. I've used a lot of different aspects of T-SQL and I know about normal forms. I've used SQL server and MySQL.
* I have experience with **git**
* I have some experience with **mongoDB**

So, I guess these are some questions that I hope you can help to find an answer to:

* Is there anything within the JavaScript world that is really important to learn about that I might not know?
* Is it worth learning how to use php in combination with composer (and specifically laravel)? It seems a reasonably common requirement but it seems it's usually only smaller design/media businesses that use it.
* What techniques/languages are used commonly, or are otherwise worth learning, that I haven't mentioned? Where to go next?

My project is using TWINCAT3 as its software, and it's actually my first time using this software, so I have no idea if my code right or wrong because my supervisor is not an expert using TWINCAT3. I would like to ask what kind of basic programming to use for this kind of software. I have tried using a structured text (ST) to do this project and I would really glad if someone can confirm it for me.  Is there anyone an expert using this software?
The main idea of this water curtain is to make and exclamation mark with a dot on the right side after the exclamation mark. So if the water curtain gets a power supply, then 25 valves will pump out the water, next, there is a button with LED and if the button is pressed the curtain will stop for a few seconds then making the ""!."" mark, after that it will keep dropping a water curtain like before, it will not change if the button is not pressed. thankyou before

I'm doing a project for my internship and it basically a web platform that retrieves **XML data** from a database and also inputs data into the database using forms.

I'm wondering what's the best way to do this and what technologies should I use. The ""site"" should be HTML5 on the front end to run in multiple platform devices.

Being that I'm new to web dev/programming I am open to learn anything. I already tried using jQuery and AJAX to retrieve data form the API and it works, but I'm not sure if this is the easiest way, and I don't really know much about this languages.

*Note: Someone at work suggested that I use backbone js because it emulates MVC but from what I could found it doesn't work with XML data only with JSON.*

I'm currently in the process of buying a new laptop. I'll be using it to replace my current deskopt and laptop during my internship abroad for the purposes of school/work (fMRI analysis) and gaming.

Specs (Clevo P650RP6-G) are an i7 6700HQ, 16GB DDR4, GTX 1060 6GB. I have to choose between a 1080p G-sync screen or a 1620p non-g-sync screen for 100 euro more (both IPS). I really like the idea of more screen real estate to work on, having 2 applications open side by side would be great for productivity. 

However, I'm wondering what the downsides are to this uncommon resolution. Since a GTX 1060 is not the strongest card, it won't be able to run all titles at 1620p, certainly not for long. How would visual performance be for 1080p content (movies, applications and games). Will reducing resolution to 1080p limit refresh rate (my current monitor switches to 30Hz on 1440p for example)? 

Many (older) threads on websites mention scaling problems, as well as blurriness due to a change in pixel density. Is this still a problem today (fixed by news windows), or a hardware problem that can't be fixed (I've read about physical difference in pixel density ratio, but maybe there are easy workarounds by using a resolution close to 1080p with a similar ratio?)? 

Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR Downsides of a 2880x1620 screen (for a GTX 1060) with regards to blurriness, scaling issues and such?"

At present we use a combination of a static phrase + the last 4 digits of the employee's SSN.  Theoretically this is something that the employee should know and be fairly difficult for others to guess.  We also use last 4 digits of employee SSN + MFA for VPN access passwords.

Problem is if we have interns or contractors, our HR team often doesn't get their SSN.  As well, we are starting to hire people outside the USA and they don't have SSNs at all.

Our HR team wants to stop using the SSN as a unique identifier, but I'm not sure what else we could replace it with.  Obviously we could generate a random password, but the problem is that we don't always have a mechanism to communicate that password to the end user (i.e. if they're working on a remote office).

It was suggested that we use birth month and birth day to replace SSN (i.e. Jan 10 = 0110), but I don't think this is a good idea because birthdates are public record in many cases and many people other than the employee would know their birthday (much more so than someone would know their SSN).

Seems like this would be a common challenge for corporate admins, interested to hear how others handle it."

As the title suggests, im looking to achieve better opportunities until the end of this year, so im looking forward to get some certifications and improve my social skills, i want some advice if im in the right path.

**My background**

School: i have 3 technical courses (about 1,5-2 years each): 1- Computer Maintenance; 2 - Web Programming and Design; 3- Information Technology (covered a bit of all areas in IT). Now I'm my 3 year of Computer Engineering(the government pays for it);

Languages: Im native Brazilian Portuguese, i speak english fluently and im at an advanced level of spanish;

Professional Experience (chronologically):Starting at 18 I did internship in a small local IT maintenance shop, got promoted to supervisor after 6 months, i quit a year later to study in another city. 

In said city I got a position of Service desk analyst to a multinational company, again got promoted to Leadership of this team of 15 analysts after 6 months. 

After 1 year and a half as leader of this team, due the low payment (10,5/hr) decided to send some resumes and got an opportunity to work as level 2 system technician for 15,5/hr.

Im this position so far for 6 months, but i know i wont have promotions, big challenges due the amount of job i have to do daily and with this salary i can just pay for my needs.

Total: 4 years so far.

**What now ?**

I love IT in general, **I dont know which certification i should try to get first, CCNA, MSCA or ITIL** because i want to try to go for a position where i earn something like 20/hr at least, is it possible ? **am i being greedy ? Or am i undervaluing my skills(im pretty afraid of that) ?**

I know i can get these certifications pretty quickly because i have been studying for them during the past years looking to one day have the spare money to spend on it, and i know this year i'll have the money for sure, but i dont want to be dumb, so **i want to get the most cost beneficial certs related to my background.** 

**Also, which roles do you suggest to me to look for?** . I dont mind working in the future with managing teams, or in a support role, because im not sure of what i want in the future (middle term) and im love with almost anything related to IT, the only thing i'd refuse are programming roles like Java, C+ or PHP, i dont dislike them, i just feels its not for me.

So, for this year I've got a summer internship lined up (it'll be my first internship ever) as a programmer for a big corporate company. I was speaking to my college advisor and he gave me two options for next year (2018). He said I could either take classes in the summer of 2018 and graduate the following december or I could seek another internship for next year which would push my graduation date further back to spring of 2019. He says I'd have to work out the pros and cons of what would be better and he says that my schedule might be a bit crowded but doable if I go with classes instead of a second internship. He says if I graduate early I could probably start working starting in January 2019 but if I get that second internship it would mean I would get paid more for my starting job if I have two internships under my belt. How true is this? Do jobs really pay more if I have more internships under my belt? Is two better than one? Should I just take the classes and graduate earlier since I'll already have one internship?

- It's a 4 hour drive down there (8 hour round trip)  
  
- I don't have a car anymore (because I don't need one in college), so I'd have to have one of my parents drive me down, which is problematic because they both work.  
  
- It's an IT internship that isn't specifically for freshmen, so I think as a CS freshman who frankly knows very little about IT my chances are slim. So I'm not really thrilled about wasting an entire day or two of both my time and my parents' time, not to mention the cost of gas.    
  
How should I respond? Should I suck it up and get my ass down there?  
  
TL;DR I implied that I'm open to doing an in-person interview when I reality I'm not really. What do?

I applied to a bunch of summer internships but I either got rejected or never heard back from most of the places. One of the place I did hear back and had a pretty successful phone interview is a media agency called Starcom in Chicago which has a corporate finance position. 
In addition, I contacted one of my family friend, who's on a board of a middle-market private equity firm in NYC, who is willing to find me an internship position. I know this summer internship is very important in regards to my future career path, and I wanted to hear some insight from people who are experienced in this field. 

So following is my questions:
1. Between private equity and corporate finance internship, which one would put me in a better position when I look for a job after graduation. 
2. If I chose to intern at private equity, do you think I have a chance to get a return offer right after college, knowing many enter private equity with at least some work experience and MBA. 
Thanks,

Finally, I got an offer today from a company that I'd like to work at as well, offering slightly less pay, but for a longer internship duration than what I've accepted so pay is balanced out, plus they're offering to hire me at the end of the internship, and I can actually see myself starting my career there

1) Is there anyone with experience that can help me with what types of tools/libraries/apis/etc I should know about given my game genre?

I remember being a super noob intern who didn't even know libraries were a thing and, to make a long story short, ended up coding AES from scratch only to find out I could've saved hours of toil if I had known to ask. This is something I'm not keen on repeating. So far I pretty much only know about Tiled, but not really anything in the way of making tilesets.


So I know my first question is pretty vague, which leads me to my next question:

2) Is it a bad idea to share my GDD with the public if I don't particularly plan on making it open-source?

Sharing it with yall might make answering my first question a little easier, but I don't know if I'd be shooting myself in the foot.

I'm a high school senior (Boston area) looking for some advice on summer internships as it is a grey area between high schooler and college freshman.  
I have been employed / interning with my local town hall's IT department for the past three summers and I would like to move onto a more demanding program this coming summer.  
This is a throwaway so I am happy to share my portfolio site/ resume if anyone is interested, but I am most interested in infosec and cyber-security (whether that takes the form of a sysadmin or a dedicated security researcher), so I have been looking into internships with Raytheon and rapid7, but each are targeted to university/ college students, even if they have only completed one year.  
My primary skills (and interests) are programming (Java, C, C++, Python, x86 ASM) and Linux systems administration, so I am really looking for an internship where I could apply and grow these skills. Just by my personal projects and homelab I would likely be more proficient than most college freshmen.  
I have already applied to Army educational outreach programs (SEAP, HSAP) and I would like to apply to Raytheon, but my question really is whether or not it would be acceptable for me to apply for positions targeted to university students simply because there isn't much out there for graduating seniors.  
Obviously over the next couple months I will be networking at conventions and conferences, but any help would be appreciated.

So about me : 

I worked previously 5 years in SAP. I was working on their own language, called ABAP. 
Unfortunately most my work has been on a very specific business module in SAP, which although was critical to the business won't be very much relatable to outside world. 

I worked  on a very specific technical tool, which really has very less employability . With every passing day, my career was moving into a dead hole. I . 

To get out of that mess I decided to restart my career. I started my masters in the states, with main focus on Data Science. 
I also interned as a Data Scientist intern during 16 summer. 

Starting last December, I started applying for full time positions, both in Data Science and Software engineer role. I did my resume review here and also among friends, and it is decent. 

However I've gotten less than 10 calls, in over 300 applications and nothing went passed the HR /Hackerrank round even if I passed all the test cases 

The only decent chance I have is with a big Seattle online retailer company. This company sent me an online assessment, for which I passed all the test case. Then they called me onsite and it is on 21st . It's a half day interview, that means it'll be for 4 hours. And it's a part of an event, so other experienced candidates will be there. 

Over the past 6 months , I've mostly been practice CTCI /leetcode and I'm decent in algorithms. I've solved over 215 questions and also all the questions that's been tagged with the specific company. 

Few days ago I had a call with the recruiter and she said because of my experience I'd be interviewing for SDE II. That means they'll throw in a system design round there. 
Although she also said that they have so many openings, that  if everyone does well on the interview, they can extend offer to everyone. Every body is not competing for the same position or something. 


I've only started preparing for system design questions few weeks back and although I have gathered  decent breath but I don't have much depth of knowledge on these technologies . for example, given a question like ""Design Instagram"", I can probably come up with high level design and say a few stuff about caching, sharding etc and how to include in that design but beyond that I won't be able to go deeper. If the interviewer asks me to go even deeper on topics like Redis, I won't have much idea. 


I also never got to work using design patterns or worked on multi threaded environment, which is all is expected of someone with 5years exp.
 I'm also not very comfortable with the Oops question. For example given a question like ""Design a Parking lot"" or ""Design a elevator system "" I can probably come up with a decent design on which I can talk for 10-15 minutes but beyond that I won't be able to go in much more depth. 

Overall I feel like I'm in a very bad shape and probably won't be able to crack the SDE II interview. I asked my recruiter that what happens if I do well enough for for SDE I but not SDE II. She said that then they'll give an offer for SDE I, as the final position offered  is determined by how I perform on the interviews. 

Unfortunately this upcoming interview is the only real option I have, since I don't have any other calls. I've been applying still, but the number of companies are running out. 

Not to mention, that I'm an international student who'll graduate in May, so I'll have to have a job by the end of September or I'll be deported. 

Seriously getting freaked out here. What can I do in 10 days to maximize my chance at cracking the interview."

I have done research and have an open-source Java internship lined up for the summer, I also served as a TA for a couple of classes.

By now, I have probably gone through 8 or so coding interviews plus 3 more math/logic interviews to get into university in the first place and many many exams --  but I am still absolutely terrified of the sorts of programming questions you usually get asked in coding interviews. Now that I am thinking of changing companies, this is becoming a real problem. I am not just afraid of interviews, even just hearing/reading/attempting an interview question for practice can send me into panic. 

A lot of the advice is about practising more but I feel like I need some strategies for how to make my practice sessions actually effective and make me less likely to avoid them. Over the years, I have managed to feel less anxious about other areas of my life that used to give me trouble (like public speaking), but fear of coding questions I haven't been able to shake off.

As long as I get an idea of what the solution could be not too long after reading the question, I am fine but as soon as I hit the question where my mind goes blank at first, I start thinking that I must be a Bad Engineer (TM) and that in turn stops me from being able to think properly about the problem. Those cases then usually end with me curled up in a ball crying for an hour and telling myself I'm the dumbest person in the world, which is extremely draining and pretty much ruins the rest of the practice session. I once had a mock interview during which I burst into tears and couldn't finish.

If anything, I feel like having worked as a software engineer for a while now has made this worse. I am doing pretty well in my job but I would say that I am mediocre at coding questions (my boyfriend says that I can't be mediocre since I have never been rejected, but to me it just seems like I got lucky with the questions I was asked). Everyone around me (including my boyfriend) seems to love programming questions and loves discussing them and solving them for fun. When I hear these questions being discussed, most of the time I think that if I had been asked _those_, I would never have gotten hired.

Theoretically speaking, I know that interview questions are just another skill that you can practice and that you don't have to get every question 100% right to get hired. And I also think that interview questions are not indicative of whether someone is a good software engineer or not -- but in practice what I feel in my body is quite different. I don't know how to get from knowing this on an intellectual level to really changing my attitude towards interview questions.

I’m looking to ease my way back into IT after taking a minor course deviation into more of the development side of things. My end-goal is either System Administration or Network Administration/Engineering. I graduated last year with dual degrees, BS in Computer Science &amp; BA in Information Systems, and I just recently passed my A+. I’m expecting to get my Network+ within the next 4 weeks or so. 

I have a year of Tier-1 Help Desk when I was working at my school a few of years ago, however since then I’ve worked a couple of internships which aren’t related all that much to entry-level IT jobs, and I also did some private computer science tutoring for high-fail weed-out courses.

A few questions:

1) Will the two degrees hurt my chances of getting an entry level help desk job? A part of me thinks that hiring managers might skip over me because they think I will hop ship soon, which wouldn’t be the case. 

2) I’ve already been turned down by a few jobs through Robert Half because the employers/clients said my internships were unrelated. Do you think the sys admin and dev/QA internships are going to hurt my chances with a large number of employers or are these experiences through a recruiting agency flukes?

3) Is it ok to put the more relevant experience higher up (non-chronological order)?

4) Down the road I plan on getting my CCNA &amp; MCSA. I’ve heard that one of my local community colleges has a great CCNA prep program that involves two courses. I think I might do this just to get the hands-on experience along with the benefits of being enrolled again at a college (networking and the college job board). Is taking classes for the CCNA overkill if I already have the Network+ cert, versus self-study?

I have an internship position this summer doing molecular biology R&amp;D at a large biotech company, I interviewed for a computational chemistry position but I didn't get the job.  

Would it be wise for me to essentially apply for PhD positions as being interested in the same kind of research I'm doing currently (standard biochemistry) to increase my chances of admission as I'm a stronger applicant in that field. Then I would just start taking the computational bio, math, and CS courses my first year. Or should I apply as being interested in computational research and focus on developing myself in that regard. I feel I don't have enough time to properly do that though."

5ywtvv,339,2017-03-11,101 Resume Writing,ibarmy,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ywtvv/101_resume_writing/,"Hi Guys, 

As part of my work profile, I often have to hire associates, interns wagera for my projects and its amazingly shocking to see crazy ass resumes even from 'good' colleges in India and getting a big red flag right in the beginning. 

Resumes matter a lot during the initial years of your hiring cause you are still new and always dont get work via references. So the foremost way of putting an impression is 'resume' and 'cover letter'. Also the way you format your resume shows how good are your skills in formatting and presentation, which in the initial years of kutta kaam of associate, you have to do a lot. I am just sharing some of my thoughts on how resumes should be written. Feel free to change and add things to it. 

#Basics

1. Resume is about you and only you, but doesnt mean I get to see these details . 

- Your parents name 

- your birthplace 

- your current city of residence

- yOUR PHOTOGRAPH - No just fuck no !

- your blood group 

- Your age 

- your declaration/ objective on botton/top stating you wanna change the world or be the best damn engineer. 


As a employer, I get atleast 200 - 300 job applications for a post, so best to show you got the skills right in the beginning.  The chronology possible is this

- Name and Address / Email / Phone number 

I personally am an asshole on my CV, so I usually just give my professional email account and phone number. I dont like giving out address, AADHAR is doing enough damage to my privacy, wouldnt wanna add more to that stupidity. 

- Education 

All degrees from the latest to the bachelors. Never ever mention your schools except if you are drunk and in delhi, where conversations follow from school allegiances. 

So Phd then masters and then bachelors. If you wrote these in these programs mention it or other terminal projects. Please dont mention GPA if its less than 3.5/4 or 7.5 or 8/10. 

if you got an award, happily mention that below the school you got it from. Please keep off anything which does not show you in the best light. 

As you get advanced degrees, or electives towards a certain competency, mention those subjects. I usually go 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
College ABC                                                                          2010 - 2012

Thesis: Critical analysis of RBI Policy 2015 - 16

Case Study:  Banwarilal bank, India

Coursework: Awesomeness101, Awesomeness102, Excel Awesomeness 201, Excel Awesomeness 202, Bakchodi Writing 101 etc etc.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Work Experience

If you have more than 2-3 years of experience, unless and until your summer internships were super coveted in college and hi fi like nomura/ Bloomberg kinds, please dont mention internship just to ensure the experience section is lonnnnggggg. 

always tailor make your resume and mention your relevant experience. If job is asking about coding, write about coding you did in the previous job/s. If the job is suggesting management of younger associates will be present, show how you managed team/s even informally with words like 'LEAD'/ 'Led' and mention how any members were in the teams. 
For instance, 'Led a three member team to analyze the performances of stock patwarilal from 2012-2017'. 

Also another big red flag (personally for me) is looking at the same word being repeated in the work ex. as it shows weak writing skills. Dont repeat 'conducted' again and again. Change it to conducted, executed, evaluated yada yada. 


- Core competencies and Skills 

Can/Should be your third section and include all the important skills you have for this job. if the job is not asking about GIS skills, please dont mention ARCGIS and QGIS and GIS wagera in it. 

in Skills go ahead and mention your writing and analytical skills and in tandem with education section upar. 

Competencies with softwares, languages and other platforms important in your field.

- and lastly #Achievements

Please dont  mention all the things you won during school in 6th/ 7th class wagera. If you are an olympiad winner in school or NTSE scholar wagera then only mention. Nobody needs to know you were 100 % attendance wala kid in school. Always mention scholarships and anything which separates you from your class in college/university. 


#Formatting. 

1. If you dont know how is MS word operating, please check templates in MS Office on Resumes, they are plenty and very clean designs too. 

2. Instead of pressing space bar to show gap between two lines, select the two lines on MS office and right click to click on paragraphs. As part of the box which pops up, there is something called spacing with which you can regulate spacing between two lines. Select 1.15  which is decent spacing. In some academic circles the spacing goes between 1.5 - 2  which is okay since they have luxury of space. You do not, which brings me to the next thing. 

3. Bullets: Dont use big big bullets to show all the work you did. Keep it simple and use dash. or little square bullets. 

4. Always proof read your CV. Make sure dots are present where they should be. No random typo. In a few CVs I have got this too .. XYZ Public School ki jagah XYZ Pubic School. 

5. Page numbers. 

Keep it clean simple and crisp. Make it one page. As work piles up, the CV can become 2 pages, but thats it. If you are not in academic circles, always make sure your CV never goes beyond 2 pages. NEVER EVER. REpeat after me. NEVER EVER. 


This is all for now, will add as things pop up in my mind.

There's a lot to it that made it bad (just read stories from /r/asianparentstories), but having been away from it for a few months in college (intentionally the one 7 hours away) and having my mental state gradually improve, I really don't want to go back.

Sorry about the rant but that's why I *need* something to do this summer, preferably something that pays but doesn't need to. I've applied to a few internships and research spots, but I haven't gotten any replies. I can't work retail because I won't be able to work past the summer since I'm 7 hours away for college and I'll also probably need to take about 2 weeks off total in the summer.

## **Student's Piazza post**

&gt; **Advice for dropping out of college as an EECS major**
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure if there are any previous posts regarding this so I decided to make my own. My circumstances right now:
&gt; 
&gt; - I am a first-year transfer majoring in EECS
&gt; 
&gt; - This is my second semester and I have taken or am taking CS61A, B, and C, 70, and EE16A
&gt; 
&gt; - I am a full-time student also working two part-time jobs and the ocassional freelance work
&gt; 
&gt; - I am from a very low-income family and I am the main source of income
&gt; 
&gt; My source of stress and the reason why I am considering this at all is because of the last point listed above. I currently receive full financial aid for my classes (besides the summer semester, for some reason) and the extra money I get from grants/loans along with the money from working is crucial to my family's survival. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm dramatizing that, but I can't really think of a better way to put it.
&gt; 
&gt; This May, I will not have enough money to support my family lest we resort to living in a shelter or cramped apartment. Even then, we would not have enough money for a lot of the necessities we pay for every month. The only options I can think of are to drop out/take a semester off or attend school part-time, all in order to have time for a full-time job as a software engineer. I believe I have the necessary experience and side projects already for landing such a job, but naturally I'm afraid to just drop out. The problem with taking a semester off or attending part-time is that, since I'm a transfer in the engineering department, I believe I only have a limited number of semesters here before I can no longer enroll. I suppose I could petition to stay longer as another option, though.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, I'm considering dropping out to support my family before we go homeless. If I have the experience and confidence in my skills to land a software engineering job right now, should I go for it? Some clarification for how long an EECS transfer can attend would also be appreciated.

## **Student's comment**

A student wrote:

&gt; I am very sorry to hear about your situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you considering finding an internship over the summer? You seem like a very resilient person, and after all the tribulations life has thrown at you, I am sure finding an internship will be no problem. Given how well internships pay, you can both take care of your family and not drop out of school.
&gt; 
&gt; Please hang in there. You can do it. Just one more year to go, then you can find a comfortable full time software engineering job with your Berkeley degree without any problems. College, and especially the world's best colleges like Berkeley, lift their graduates out of poverty into the middle class. You won't need to worry about finances any more then. You're so close. Don't give up.

The OP wrote:

&gt; OP here. Thank you for the kind words. An internship has certainly been one of my options. Unfortunately, it may only be a temporary fix if I continue to attend school full-time in the next academic year.

A student wrote:

&gt; EECS transfer here. I think you have five semesters in total, and I heard you can postpone graduating if you do a co-op or full-time internship. Please talk to your ESS advisor as they know the stuff best! Besides, there are a lot of resources to support transfers. Talk to Tiffany Reardon at ESS! All the best. 

The OP wrote:

&gt; OP here. Thank you for this information! I wasn't aware of any postponement policies, so I'll confirm this with an advisor very soon.

## **Student's comment**

A student wrote:

&gt; After freshman year, I ""dropped out"" of Berkeley CoE. Then I worked as a software engineer and was making ~$50/hour. Then I decided to go back to school after 2 years. Afterwards, I still had an offer to work part time but I decided to focus on school. Like you, I also had 0 EFC.
&gt; 
&gt; Your income may affect your financial aid EFC. However, if your parent/parents that you put on your FAFSA has a income under the zero EFC threshold, you will get the automatic 0 EFC. Which means that no matter how much money you earn, if you qualify for 0 EFC, you will still get the 0 EFC.
&gt; 
&gt; Hypothetically, if you work part time for 20 hours a week and $30/hour, you'd be making $2500 pre tax which would be good enough to cover your family expenses if you keep things budgeted. Also do keep in mind that the more money you make, the more taxes you pay so working 40 hours a week may not necessarily give you twice as much as if you had worked 20 hours a week. Working part time will probably affect your GPA but I think thats a compromise you would have to make. Also, having an internship over the summer can get you like $15k over the course of the summer which might be enough to barely scrape by.
&gt; 
&gt; One reason for my coming back to school is that I would be able to make more money after I graduate. I'd suggest that you try to find a way to make ends meet and graduate soon so that you can get a full job.
&gt; 
&gt; [Warning: Next part is something most people initially won't agree with. But I'm just sharing my personal experience on how I made careful decisions to make ends meet]. Contrary to what people may say, it may also be a good idea to go into debt. This is a view that I have that not many people agree with, but in my situation, I made a calculated risk to go into (0% interest) debt in order to have more emergency cash padding. If you want to take a gamble that you will be able to find a good six figure job after you graduate, consider going into debt. $1 today is as valuable as $0.20 in a few years.
&gt; 
&gt; (As a side story, my mom passed away within the past year meaning i am no longer eligible for the 0 EFC next year and my income counts against me. However, I can submit a appeal for student contribution. Also, you can get a appeal for budget adjustment to get more financial aid.)
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to ask any questions about my own experience

The OP wrote:

&gt; Thank you for sharing this. Could you clarify what you mean by going into debt? I'm already taking out federal loans and, aside from borrowing from people I personally know, I don't see how private loans would have 0% interest. My initial plan was to rely on my federal grants/loans and I was fairly confident I could land a decent job right after graduating to pay them off asap, but my circumstances have changed such that I now would need to take out more loans to go down that same route (something I consider riskier than just trying to find a job now and finishing school later).

A student wrote:

&gt; (I'm the author of the initial response thread). By going into debt, I mean using it to make ends meet while you work towards graduating. My situation was probably different from yours in that I had built up a credit score and was eligible to apply for credit cards that gave 0% interest for 15-21 months. This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I didn't use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important expenses that financial aid didn't cover). Having a full time job also helped my chances of getting a credit card.
&gt; 
&gt; One plan that could work for you is taking one year off of school to work as a software developer. Then while you're there, save enough to help you get through for the next two years. And perhaps, if your credit score is okay, then you could even get 0% interest credit cards. With 15-21 months of no interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able to focus on school while also being able to survive. Then you will have only paid a few months of interest before you get a job hopefully making a decent salary.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I think i'm writing in circles, but I hope this clarified things without making things more  confusing. Feel free to ask more questions.

A student commented:

&gt; I'm the author of the initial response thread). Oh, one more clarification I have to make. My decision to open these credit cards were carefully planned and I had written up a detailed plan on how I was going to manage the money. If done haphazardly, credit cards could be cause more problems than it solves.

## **Student's comment**

A student commented:

&gt; I just wanted to say that I wish you the best of luck with your situation. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to follow the EECS curriculum while supporting your family. All I know is that you must be extremely capable, smart, and hardworking if you've made it this far, and I'm sure that will help you a lot in your professional future. Keep going, you've made it so far!

## **Students' discussion**

A student commented:

&gt; Are you white or Asian? If so, you're already privileged so this situation shouldn't be a problem. Just use your privilege!

A student commented:

&gt; are you serious? No point to be a troll under this post

A student commented:

&gt; Not a troll. Whites and Asians are privileged. They don't need help. Only minorities, LGBQT, etc. are victims. 

A student commented:

&gt; Glad this page is not totally anonymous so at least staff members could know who this ridiculous person is ;)

A student commented:

&gt; Let's please not make jokes here. This person (and the commmenter above) is revealing some highly personal information, and we should be mature about it. I, too, am not a fan of political correctness but this is the wrong forum to attack political correctness.

A student commented:

&gt; I think it's relevant though. I have a slight feeling that the OP is Asian. He/she should know how the left views them: as overprivileged, monotonous automatons.

A student commented:

&gt; What does this have to do with anything? OP is just asking for advice, and not once mentioned privilege or anything like that.

A student commented:

&gt; Not sure how you assumed the OP was Asian. Also, it may be true the left views Asians and whites in the way you described. In fact, many posters in the ""Town halls too politically correct"" expressed that view. So that may be correct. However, by bringing this up, you're using the OP's plight to make a political point, which is not related to the discussion at all.

A student commented:

&gt; At the risk of getting dragged into a fruitless debate, perhaps we should be mindful of the fact that everybody's personal situation and experiences are different. Trying to stereotype people, assign characteristics to arbitrary groups of people, and otherwise deny people their individual identities, thoughts, and feelings is unhelpful and harmful. This is regardless of whether it's done for comedic effect, to make a political point, or whether it stereotypes ""whites"", ""asians"", ""the left"", ""the right"", ""LGBQT people"".

A student commented:

&gt; Asians aren't a monolithic group, either. Some groups are overall underprivileged, like southeast Asians.

An instructor replied:

&gt; Why is this relevant or helpful? Please, try to be sensitive. This should be a supportive space; please try to be helpful and kind. The admins can see your names and we will not tolerate trolling.

5yxlvm,60,2017-03-12,I Quit My First Day at Strood Funeral Home,SleepinMongoose,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yxlvm/i_quit_my_first_day_at_strood_funeral_home/,"I walked through the hall in a half dead stupor. My head pounded from the previous night’s drinks and I was hardly in bed for 4 hours. I felt along the wall for the light switch as I made my way down the hallway. The corridor walls were marked with spots where pictures of them used to hang. I could no longer bear to see their faces.

The cold showers were painful. I used to enjoy the luxury of a steaming bathroom but those days are long gone. Without the icy sting I couldn’t function. Long gone were the days where I woke feeling well rested and eager to take on the world. Now I moped, and forced myself to get up to writhe my way from the grips of endless depression.

The internship was the only thing that kept me going. That and Dr. Pearson. He was like a father to me since my parent’s accident in that damn blizzard. I stopped going to class but I aced my way through physiology and genetics without incident. He vouched for me after noticing my tests scores when the dean pushed for my expulsion following my lack of attendance. He even got me my job in the cadaver lab.

I left every morning by 5:30 to arrive by 6. I had a key to let myself into the science building and prep the lab and bodies by 7. Some days I was rushed because the drive in held me up. This winter seemed to never end and the harsh maelstroms never stopped. The roads that day were particularly dangerous, a fresh powder laid over the icy roads, and the winds howled fiercely. Just like the day my parents died.

I arrived at 6:30 with my heart racing. I fumbled at the door with my gloves and the small case which housed the fuel warming sticks. My hands shook as I put the case in my pocket with my lighter. Driving always gives me anxiety now. I unlocked the door and made my way down the dimly lit halls. Most people would probably be uneasy in the dark heading to a handful of dead bodies all alone. I just didn’t care anymore though. But I knew I owed Pearson a lot for what he had done for me.

I started my routine like usual. I badged into the lab and made sure to secure the door behind me. It’s not a room you can accidentally walk into, and for good reason. I rubbed my hands together with a shiver. They kept the temperatures low to prevent further decomposition and smell. Most people have this idea that it smells like rot in there, but it mostly just has a chemical smell. The bodies are drained of fluids (as best as possible) and loaded with preservatives. To prevent the outer tissues from decay I sprayed them with a solution regularly which basically looks like a weed sprayer.

At this point in the classes dissected the superficial layer of skin and the inner tissues were exposed. The yellowing muscle fibers were apparent over the more defined bodies while older, less fit individuals had a tendency to look mushy. The human body wasn’t as pretty as the illustrations in the anatomy book. They weren’t as uniform looking either.

I took a broom next and swept up the bits of tissue which weren’t picked up from the class the night before. Loose tissues were properly disposed of in a separate bucket that would not make it into a typical landfill. The bodies would be worked on throughout the semester then finally incinerated. A thank you event would be thrown by the university for the families of the deceased.

As repulsive as the job was to the average person it really wasn’t that bad. After the initial shock of seeing the bodies it was nothing more than accepting mortality like everyone else would have to. Something I already had to do with my parents. The only thing I hated about the job was how curious it made me. I never realized how morbid I was and how fascinated I could be. I longed to do more. On that day my dream came true.

I nearly jumped out of my skin when the door to the lab opened well ahead of Pearson’s usual arrival. It was a rather large man, with a stern intimidating look on his face. His facial hair was cut with precision and his eyes pierced through the lenses in his plastic frames. In one hand he clutched a full sized model of a skeleton with a heavy support base like you’d see in a typical anatomy class. His voice was deep and booming, “Hello, young man. My name is Mordecai Strood, would you happen to be Jason?”

I was taken back for the second time that morning. I hesitantly moved from behind the corpse on the table beside me, “Yes sir, is there something I can help you with? Do you have access to this room regularly?”

Mordecai chuckled with a wide smile, “I apologize, I forget that I tend to sneak up on people in here. I own a funeral home on the north end of town. I occasionally work in here with Dr. Pearson to help prep the bodies for students. He asked me to take you under my wing.”

It was a recent dream, but a dream come true nonetheless. I jumped for joy and jarred my glasses loose. I shrugged to push them up, my gloved hands were covered with cadaver juice. Dr. Pearson had requested his old friend from med school let me intern for him and I accepted in a heart-beat. Starting that day I would finish up my classwork, go to my job at the hospital, and spend two hours a night with Mr. Strood to see if the path of a mortician was right for me.

Mordecai left that morning with his model skeleton and class dragged that afternoon. The day was filled with tension. Pearson never showed up for whatever reason and I was constantly bothered to do the maintenance on the bodies that he normally would have done. All I could think of was my internship later that night and just wanted to leave. I didn’t even care that we were facing another blizzard. Not everyone felt the same though.

As I approached the cafeteria I saw a crowd of people gathered around my friend Christina. She was tall, thin, blonde, and all around gorgeous. She was taking criminal justice courses with her boyfriend, Curtis. The two of them hit it off quickly when they found out about their common hometowns back in Florida. How they ended up traveling across the country north is a mystery to me, but they hated the snow.

Curtis was a car fanatic with a penchant for speed. Driving in the snow isn’t a race though. His vehicle careened through the light at the highway exit up the road and he got hit by oncoming traffic. I felt so sorry for her. He was in real bad shape, or so I heard.

I was extra careful when I left school that day. I finally had something to live for, even if it was focused on death ironically. I got to work and hoped my shift would be uneventful. I worked patient transport so my night depended on how sick or injured the populace was. Today was busy, car accidents left and right. Not to mention a nasty flu outbreak. It wouldn’t be a relaxing night before I started my internship.

Thankfully Ed worked that night and kept the mood light. He was a few years older than me and always tried to cheer me up since I was typically a real downer, and I knew it was the truth. Ed was what most people called a burnout. I didn’t care for the term because he wasn’t a lazy guy, in fact he was one of the most devoted workers in the whole facility. He just never had any ambition to do anything else. He drove the same crummy car since high school, to the same job he’s had since he was 18, staying at the same low rent one bedroom apartment, and he took the affection of literally any woman that would give it. Ed was complacent with most things in life and never excelled at much, but the guy could tell a story like no other.

The topic of today’s tale, the Strood funeral home. Naturally since I was going to work in the creepy god forsaken basement of a funeral home with dead people my mentor was labelled a crazy old man who murdered his victims and buried them right on the grounds. I told him to shut up, but he insisted that he wasn’t lying. It was a local legend. That old man Strood lost his son and his wife too, driving him insane. I had to hand it to him, he almost made me believe him for a minute.

After finally hearing enough tall tales I split from Ed and went to work in ICU taking patients from their rooms down to radiology when I saw Christina crying in the hallway. Undoubtedly Curtis was in intensive care. As much as I wanted to talk to her I knew that I had to distance myself from the situation. I knew how hard it was to have a loved one sustain injury in an accident, and I was the last person to give advice on how to cope.

As the night came to a close I sat down in the transport office and relaxed while I stared at the time clock. My eyes were fixated in the deepest stare until I heard the buzzer for the door to the lower level entrance. I stepped out into the hall and much to my surprise at the door was Mordecai. He waved me over and I hurried to open the door.

Mordecai shivered as he quickly stepped inside, “Thank you, my friend. I forgot my badge at home. Is your shift almost done, we have work to do.” I was taken back once more by this odd, giant of a man. I told him I just needed to punch out and to sit tight. He chuckled, “Take your time, our client isn’t in a rush.”

By the time I put my coat on Mordecai already put me to work. He instructed me to go outside to his hearse and wheel the bed up. It was cold but I came prepared with the fuel sticks I would stuff in my gloves. It only took me a moment to figure out how to unfold the bed and unlock the wheels. The setup was similar to the patient beds I worked with on a daily basis.

As the two of us made our way down to the morgue he urged me forth to badge us in. The hulking man adjusted his black tie as he took a sigh. “Have you heard the news yet, son?” My brow furled as I shook my head. Mordecai placed his large hand on my shoulder as he delivered the heart wrenching news. Mr. Pearson, the man who had been looking out for me like a father was killed in a gruesome accident earlier that morning while passing the College exit. As I soon pieced together, in the collision which also involved Curtis.

Mordecai gave me a moment to process the news as I leaned on the slab which the body bag rested. The large man lowered his head muttering a prayer before approaching Pearson’s corpse. “If you plan to settle down and work as a mortician it is only a matter of time before you see the body of a friend or loved one. I didn’t plan for this to come tonight, but it may be for the best to let you decide if this is the right path for you. You’ve seen cadavers, but not a body.”

The sound of the zipper echoed off the cold metal drawers which housed the bodies of the deceased. I knew that Mordecai was right. To be a mortician you needed to a place to work, and unless you traveled a great distance for work every day, eventually you’d see a familiar face from the community. The day had to come, so why not now? I leaned over the edge of the bed to make eye contact with Mr. Pearson one last time. It wasn’t like the almost inhuman gaze of the dissected cadavers. His mouth was stained with blood and the bruising around his eyes was immense. The eyes were cold and lifeless, no longer emanating their lively, inviting aura.

I nodded my head as I reached over Mordecai’s hand to close Mr. Pearson’s eyes. He zipped the bag shut with a nod of approval, “I’m proud of you, boy.” The gentle man told me to step outside and get some water, that I was off the hook for loading the body tonight. I used the restroom, wet my face, got a drink and contemplated if this was really the right thing for me today. After a few minutes of soul searching I came to my senses and decided it was worth exploring more. By the time I got back Mordecai was waiting next to the wheeled bed, freshly loaded with a body. But Mr. Pearson’s body still lay in the same place.

“Are we not taking Mr. Pearson?” I asked him with a shaky voice.

Mordecai addressed me with a calm tone, “No, son. We weren’t called for him, I just received the news and had to see for myself. We were actually called for this young man. Immediately my mind conjured images of a grieving Christina, I should’ve comforted her. I reached for the zipper to see for myself as I had done before, Mordecai quickly grabbed me by the wrist though.

He gave me a melancholic stare, “There’s not much left to see.”

I shuddered at the thought of Curtis being disfigured, but that was the reality of this line of work. I helped Mordecai load the body with an exasperated gasp as the harsh winds stung my face. My cheeks were nearly as red as the bags under my eyes were purple. I made my way to the passenger seat, my legs were noodles, and I plopped hard onto the seatbelt. I closed my eyes as I breathed heavily trying to clutch the hand warming cases in my gloves even tighter.

I felt something press against my arm as I quickly looked over towards Mordecai, “Drink this, and eat. You’re malnourished, boy. You have to be strong both mentally and physically for this job.” I took the water bottle from his hand and the apple in the bag beside me. I had lost 15 pounds since my parents died. I probably looked just as bad as Mr. Pearson did.

Mordecai drove cautiously through the inclement weather, but I was still on edge. The road was barely visible as the snow blew into the windshield horizontally and the drifts of snow whipped across the pavement. As we reached the north side the snow subsided just a bit as the heavy tree cover of the forest loomed over the street. We made our way deeper into the woods, and up the hill to Mordecai’s home. The place where he lived, worked, and rested. A place where the dead rested too. A long driveway curved up at a steep incline towards the old 2 story building. The building itself was an old chapel, it even still had the cross on top, though it was backed by a strange triangle. I’m not particularly religious so I didn’t know if it bore any significance.

Along either side of the driveway was a small drop, followed by headstones. Apparently before Mordecai bought the place years ago it was a regular site of worship and burial for the townspeople in the early 1900s.

The long hearse puttered its way up the drive until eventually we began to slide. Mordecai stopped and stepped out of the vehicle walking around to my door. He opened it with a mischievous, yet unnerving grin. “Well son, I told you that this job required physical strength and I meant it. The car isn’t going to make it up the hill. I’m going to bring you a shovel, then I want you to wheel the body up the rest of the way.”

I was taken back by the absurd request which I initially thought was a joke. Sure enough though, Mordecai made his way to the house and back with a shovel and bucket of salt in hand. Then he made his way inside. It was dark and I was cold. My face felt like it was being stung by dozens of bees as the freezing wind chill coursed through me. Pearson stuck his neck out for me and then he was gone. I wouldn’t let him down.

It took me an hour to clear the snow and put down enough salt to create a decent enough clearing to wheel Curtis’ body up the hill. I wanted to rest but I knew it was best to keep my momentum so I went straight to it. With a heave I lowered the bed onto the snowy drive. The wind blew hard from my left as I slowly began my ascent. My feet slipped as I tried to dig the chunks of salt into the grooves on the bottom of my shoes for traction. No longer did I feel the cold as I began to sweat and lean all of my body weight into the bed.

Surprisingly all went without incident, until I reached the top of the driveway. In a moment of sheer stupidity I paused to catch my breath and stepped away from Curtis. I checked my phone in a moment of weakness to scroll through Facebook. I stared in confusion at the most recent status, “Christina Janes: HE IS GOING TO BE OKAY!” Then a heavy gust tore through the area and the bed rolled straight past me, down the small incline, and crashed beside a pair of headstones. I was petrified of what I had done until the moment of the crash. I expected to hear a dull thud, but instead I heard sharp clanks. I approached the body, carefully making my way down, looking behind me quickly to see if Mordecai had witnessed my screw up.

I reached down to the corpse to feel. To my surprise, it was almost plastic feeling. I knew the sight would be gruesome but I had to see for myself at this point since Christina’s post perplexed me. I held my breath fearing the smell of decay and the sight of gore as I unzipped the bag. The bag didn’t house the body of Curtis though, it was the model skeleton I had seen Mordecai with hours before. I was completely confused and a bit upset. Had I just done all this work so Mordecai could try to prove a point about my physical well-being? I know he didn’t know that I was acquainted with Curtis, but this seems to have drawn the line.

I paced in anger trying to plan my next move. I was exhausted from all the work I had done. Mordecai was right, I hadn’t been taking care of myself and he proved his point, but this was wrong. As I planned what I would say to him I noticed the pair of gravestones next to the overturned bed. The first read, ‘James Strood, Age 4’. The second was blank, marked with the strange cross I had seen earlier. Maybe Ed was right, maybe the guy’s son died and he did go off his rocker, but was the unmarked grave next to it his wife?

While I pondered this in the snow the cold got to me and I quickly got my mind back on the task at hand. I was going inside to demand Mordecai bring me back to my car at the hospital. I was so furious I even left his bed laying in the snow. I opened the heavy double doors to the old church with a gasp. There was a hallway to my left and immediately on my right a large open room filled with pews where I’m sure church services used to be held, but eulogies were given now. I walked into the open room first calling out for Mordecai to no reply. I glared around the room at the strange crosses carved into the pews, each one backed with the triangle as I had seen outside.

I didn’t know the difference from a Baptist or a Catholic, but I know in my 22 years of life I had never seen this symbol even in passing. I walked up to the pedestal at the head of the room which sat in front of a large curtain. A bible lay on top of the surface, or at least I thought it was a bible initially. The cover of the book was again marked with that strange cross, and as I flipped through it, the symbols inside looked like nothing I had ever seen. I focused on the markings under the light of my phone looking for anything at all that resembled a familiar character from any language I could think of to no avail. That was when a shiver ran down my spine.

“I bet your professors back at school never showed you a book like that, son.” Mordecai chuckled at the other end of the room. I could just barely make out the unnerving grin on his face in the darkness. “I thought I asked you to bring the body up?”

I don’t know if it was the depression or the confusion talking, but I snapped, “Fuck you, is this some kind of sick game. That’s not a body out there. What’s wrong with you?”

Mordecai slowly approached, he was no longer grinning. “I gave you a golden opportunity, boy! Are you feeling tired now?”

I had had enough. I took the book off the podium and threw it to the ground, preparing myself to storm past Mordecai. Instead I strolled past with a lazy, labored gait until I realized he grabbed the hood of my jacket. The rest goes hazy.

My neck wasn’t sore so I don’t think he choked me out, and my head didn’t have any bumps. I wasn’t quite sure what happened but my cell phone was gone, and I was alone in a dark room. The only light source was a small frosted window on the wall towards the ceiling, so I must have been in a basement. I felt around the wall for a light switch to no avail, but I did find a door handle. I shook the door hard until I began to panic.

That’s when I heard his voice from the other side, “I’m sorry I had to do that to you. The fumes work fast, but you shouldn’t be harmed, my young friend.”

“Please let me go! I won’t tell anyone, please just let me leave!” I pleaded, never had I desired to live so badly.

Mordecai opened the door and I scurried back along the dusty cement floor until I hit the cold wall behind me. “A long time ago I lost my son, and my wife fell ill as well. I couldn’t bear to lose her too so I started searching every last medical text I could. That is when I happened upon a fellow intellectual, our mutual friend Mr. Pearson. He promised he could help my wife in exchange for my discretion and service. He needed my help as I need yours!”

“What do you want from me, Pearson was a doctor! I’m not qualified, I’m just a student!” I cried out with a shakiness in my voice.

The hulking man closed the door behind him softly and gently approached me with an outstretched hand, “I’m not looking for medical expertise, I’m looking for someone like me. A person who understands the hardships and cruelties of a life taken far too soon! Pearson recognized that same quality in me and showed me that there is a way to defy the laws of nature in this world with the right texts!”

I didn’t know what to do, but resistance was clearly futile against this looming giant. I reached for his hand, “Plenty of people know death, why me?”

“You’re smart, Jason. You can stomach it, and most importantly you’re young. Far younger than I was when I started my work here. With luck you could work for decades into the unknown and revolutionize how this world views life! I am offering you a choice, you may leave, I only ask that you let me show you one last thing before you do.” Mordecai begged me as he held open the door.

I followed him out into the hallway. The cement floors were cold and the wooden ceiling beams were exposed and filled with spider webs. The smell of chemicals grew stronger as we delved further into the basement. Mordecai pulled out an archaic key ring opening the door at the end of the hall.

The room was small with a countertop lined with bottles of chemicals undoubtedly used for the embalming process. A lone light swung overhead in the center of the room. Mordecai locked the door behind me and I began to shake. He moved towards the countertop where another copy of the strange tome I saw upstairs rested. He walked to the back of the room in darkness where I heard the unlocking of another door followed by a hatch opening on the side of the wall. The madman reached in and pulled a body out of what seemed to be a chute and dropped it on the floor.

Mordecai peered down into the book and began chanting something in some archaic language lost to man years prior. There seemed to be whispers echoing through the walls and the light began to flicker. That was when I saw it. From behind the bed came forth the most disturbing creature. An amalgamation of corpses haphazardly fused as if sewn together. Their yellowing limbs left a moist trail behind them as it limped along the hard cement floor. The head was almost human in appearance, female in specific. A harrowed look of sorrow was on its face and it wailed in agony as it approached the corpse.

Mordecai stopped chanting and directed his gaze at me, “Don’t you see, child! My wife is still with me, even after death, but her form is not yet complete! If we work together we can perfect the process! We can give her the life she was owed, we can revive your parents, and we can defeat death ourselves!”

I rushed to the door crashing into it with my shoulder over and over, shouting as loud as I could for anyone at all to hear me. I looked behind me as I saw the ghastly creature loom over the corpse feeding with a blood curdling sound. The sloshing of guts and sinew tearing will never leave my mind. Mordecai chanted throughout the ordeal and I had no doubt in my mind I would not get to leave if I did not agree to help him.

While his gaze was beyond obsessively fixated on the thing that was his wife, I rushed towards the counter grabbing two of the bottles of chemicals. Formaldehyde, now was my chance. I tossed both of the bottles on the floor near Mordecai and the creature. The liquid spilled all over the floor as I dashed beside Mordecai for the chute which he had no doubt built to drop in food for his wife. I dove inside the small metal corridor and Mordecai clutched my leg. I kicked frantically while reaching into my pocket for my lighter. I struck the flame and tossed it out of the chute onto the floor. In less than a second a bright flame roared as Mordecai and the creature let out a screech.

The man writhed in agony and finally relinquished the grip of my foot. I scurried up the steep shaft as fast as I could muster. I pulled myself up at the top, finding myself behind the curtain near the podium upstairs. I made my way outside sprinting as fast as I could. I slipped and slid down the drive as the flames became visible in the windows.

I’m not sure what I witnessed that night or what arcane knowledge Mordecai and Pearson knew. All I was sure of is that the Strood Funeral Home burned to the ground that night, and the police reported it as a stove malfunction in the kitchen. Since I knew this was such a blatant lie I can only assume more people in this town have knowledge of Mordecai’s work than I find comforting. I left that day, and I’ve never gone back.

[Pt.2],fairynextdoor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yxq4j/my_mute_sister_spoke_for_the_first_time_last/,"Part: 1  https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y92md/my_mute_sister_spoke_for_the_first_time_last_night/?st=J06E4TEL&amp;sh=be67dcee   

Listen guys. I'm sorry I went MIA but the situation got worse the last few days.  The day I last wrote you guys I saged every room in the house and went around twice just to be sure I really did the job. I was more confident reading your guys comments and also scheduled an appointment with Melissa's doctor to see if it truly could be possible she had summoned the will to talk during her sleep. The soonest appointment they had was yesterday. That left 2 nights before that.   

On the first night I was studying in my den. I've been cramming in studying when I'm not at my internship. I was preparing myself for a late night and thought if I pushed through the last few pages I could be done in a half an hour, which would be around 2 am. All of a sudden it went silent. I'm not sure if silent is the right word. It's more like when you go to the bottom of the pool and your earn won't pop. Like your in a bubble under water. That's what it was like. Then, gradually the sound began to fade back in.   This may not sound scary but it was more strange to me than anything. You'd have to be there and if you have experienced it  you should know what I mean. I decided it was just my brains way of telling me I had been studying for too long and went to bed.   

I got into bed and when I closed my eyes i couldn't shake the feeling that someone was staring at me. I would open my eyes every few minutes just to be sure there wasn't anyone there. Of course, there wasn't. I finally forced myself to keep my eyes closed and eventually drifted to sleep.   I don't know at what point it was that I was woken up, I just knew I was awakened by a loud slam. That loud slam just happened to be the door to my room. I got up and felt my way for the door and light in the darkness, wondering who in the hell woke me in the middle of the night. I switched on the light. Nothing happened. No light. I twisted the door handle and it just jiggled like it was locked.   


At this point I did what every rational human being would do and start jiggling the fucking handle trying to open the door and flicking the light back and forth. I got over this fast and knew it wouldn't work. ""This isn't funny!"" I shouted. Nobody responded. I started banging a little harder and the feeling of someone staring at me came back. But now I could feel breathing on the back of my neck to accompany it. Just then my mom came through the door as I threw myself into her sobbing. I didn't get much sleep the rest of the night. The next day I noticed Melissa had significantly dark circles under her eyes. I thought that maybe something was keeping her up too. I packed a bag and went to my grandmother that night and didn't come home till yesterday just before Mellisa's doctors appointment.  

 When I saw Mellisa I was in disbelief, to say the least. She looked exhausted, pale, like the life was sucked out of her. I was glad we were going to the doctors and hopeful we could get more answers.   Unfortunately, we got the opposite. They told us in basic terms that she doesn't have the motor skills to speak. She couldn't have. They also said she just needs to get more sleep. But how? She seemed out of energy so she'd been taking naps. Maybe at night? When we got home my mom looked more confused than before too.  

 I was nervous to spend my first night back in the house, but I decided not to let these things discourage me. I wasn't going to be scared out of my own house. My mom made dinner and I popped a movie in after. Before I knew it I had fallen asleep on the couch. I always tell myself I need to stop doing that. I tuned in to what sounded like whispering. Immediately I was thinking, ""no. Fuck no. Not tonight. Not again."" Of course so many other things ran through my mind too.   I needed to check her. I figured I could wake her up or whatever it was was already keeping her awake and that's why she was so tired. I snuck over to the room and screamed louder, bigger, more scared than I ever have before. Someone had been standing next to her bed, like in my dreams, and whispering to her. As I reached for the light they turned and I flicked it on and there was nothing. Nothing next to the bed and no one.   

I know I was awake. I know I was. My scream woke my mom up and she said that her fiancé could stay at his brothers for awhile so I could sleep with her and he wouldn't have to keep sleeping on the couch. The image was just burned into my brain.   Today I woke up and went to my internship all day long. I got back about two hours ago. My mom and I tried to cleanse the house again. We also tried also tried other suggestions. I hope I can get some sleep tonight. I'll update soon.  

Thank you for all the support."

Let´s say you work for a company with flexible working hours, so you can basically work when and as long you want.
The company is a big international company and you have a basic programming or software engineering job.

If you want to climb the career ladder and plan to get to a high management position, what of the following is the most import thing to do?:

*  Spending more time at work than regulary
* Staying at the same company for a long time
* Try to socialise and build a network at events from your company
* Train yourself in management behaviour and skills
* Be a good programmer and train your programming skills
* anything else not on this list

Im just curious because I am doing a student internship at such a company right now and I can´t really see through, how one can be able to get to a higher position. "

5z0s7t,32,2017-03-12,How can visual learners have technical conversations?,FourthHead,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/5z0s7t/how_can_visual_learners_have_technical/,"I've always been a very visual learner. It's next to impossible for me to learn by listening. During university, I skip all my classes because the professors might as well be speaking another language. I just read the textbook to learn what I need to.

I know I'm not an idiot either. I go to a Top 20 university, and have a great GPA. I do well on my exams, and have a solid understanding of the material. But again, I got all of this by just reading the textbook, I didn't find classes helpful at all.

I'm doing an internship this year and because of being such a visual learner I'm having a lot of trouble with conversations. Often my boss will come up to me to dicuss something, and everything he says will go over my head. I'll just nod at him while having no idea what he's talking about. It's embarassing and makes me feel like a complete idiot. After he's gone, I usually try to piece together what he was talking about and hope that I end up doing what he wanted me to. When he sends me an email however, I have no trouble following along. It makes complete sense to me, and I get it done quickly...

The work isn't particularly challenging either, it's very straight forward. It's just understanding what he's talking about that I have trouble with. Obviously, I guess I can talk to him about this and ask him to send me more emails, but I don't think that's a solution. Often the material we're discussing requires back and forth discussion that *needs* to be done in person (since we often look over code together), so these conversations need to happen.

I was wondering if anyone has any advice on what I should do. I feel like a complete moron and I've noticed my boss often gives me weird looks because my response often won't make sense, since I usually have no idea what he's talking about. It's extremely frustrating and I don't really know what to do...

I'm a computer engineer, and most of my current job involved writing code, but future jobs will probably involved math and circuits, so that's going to be even trickier..."

I would love to work for NASA it's always been a dream of mine. I'm also very interested in machine learning, A.I and their applications in deep space exploration. 

I actually live near the JPL in Pasadena, CA. What can I do to make myself a great candidate to work on their machine learning team? From my research, the team is mainly comprised of people with Ph.Ds, would it be best to get one in CS with a focus on machine learning? I've already planned on applying to internships at NASA when it's the time, but what else can I do to make myself a competitive candidate? 

As a side note does anyone have any figures on the compensation?

Would really appreciate any advice on the below.
 
I'll try to keep this as short as possible.
 
Discovered late enough that coding/software development is what I want to do (32 now). 

Enrolled in a two year internship with a one and a half year work placement. Currently working within a MS technologies focused team. Therefore all experience is in C#, .NET, ASP.NET (not really a fan of front end) and SQL server.

I'd consider myself somewhere between a beginner and intermediate (closer to intermediate).

I've received a number of fairly useless certs in System design, system development, procedural, OOP, SQL. I also have a Microsoft C# fundamentals Cert and will be sitting the Programming in C# (70-483) Exam in April.

Have no computer science degree etc. 
 
My internship ends in two months. Don't think I could apply for even junior dev roles elsewhere (not confident I know enough) and it's highly unlikely I’ll be kept on in my work placement company.

A degree isn't really an option as I need to pay bills/rent etc.
 
I wouldn't be opposed to working with/learning a different environment and/or language if need be.

Advice on where I go from here? Any ideas on how I stay within the sector, continue to learn and eventually become an experienced and accomplished developer?

Happy to answer any questions.

Thanks."

I've been offered to continue the internship into the summer, as a ""post-bachelor"" position. However, I did not know this was going to happen, and I cannot and do not want to say no to the offer, its an awesome job. But, I had 2 big trips planned for the summer. One of which I've had quasi-planned for the past 3 years, and the other for the past 5 years (seriously). And I've now just been asked by a family member to go on ANOTHER trip. 

The summer isn't that long. I can't spend like a total month of it on vacations. I mean I would love to, and I feel like I owe it to myself, like a lot of people do after finishing undergrad. But I mean how could I go about telling my boss, ""By the way, I'm planning on being gone for 2 weeks here, and another week there.""? I'm not sure that I can. 

For the record, this is the kind of job where pretty much whenever you say you can't come in, they'll say, ""ok see ya later"". There aren't vacation days or anything for temporary positions (as I will have). But, that fact makes me even *more* nervous about asking for days off. I don't want to seem ungrateful for the position or seem like I'm taking advantage of the system. 

I don't know. This will be my first job out of school and I'm not sure what the norms are. What would you do?

Recently I've been facing a dilemma. As a self-taught developer who is pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science via [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/), is it wise to look for internships while still in the program? Or should I actually start to find a place where I plan on working at for the next 3 ~ 5 years?

I am currently working at a startup as a senior developer, but I've been looking for a different job because I want to see what working at other companies are like and look for more guidance.

I was initially interviewing for a senior developer position at a startup, but I was finally offered a junior developer position. I understand that my lack of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science could be a reason why they think I only deserve a junior role, and I totally understand that I don't really fit for a senior role either as I only have 2~3 years of experience. However, I've been helping a friend with his undergraduate degree in CS, so I know that I can't be THAATT bad either.

So here's the question. I feel that I can learn tons as a junior developer at that startup, as I will be helping them with big data technology such as Cassandra, Spark, and distributed computing problem with micro-services. I am also in the process of interviewing with Facebook, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them(although I don't have much expectation from it.).

In 1~2 years, with a combination of 4~5 years of experience, and a Master's degree, I think I will have a better chance at working at something that truly interests me. So what should I do in between? Is it better to find multiple internships in Canada(I live in Vancouver, and I'm not eligible for internships in US) for the next 1~2 years and find an area that interests me the most, while risk not being able to find any internship, OR find a place where I can learn a lot and potentially grow, but unsure whether the startup really interests me."

so this is a fairly recent tale of mine. Due to the very confidential nature of the events I altered a lot of details but I can assure you it happened exactly like that.

-------------------

Due to one of my coworkers heading for maternity leave we had to replace her for a few months. Training a new employee would've taken far too much time so we hired an $intern and tried to make everyones job easier so we could collectively fill in for our coworker.

I'm not exaclty sure who picked the intern or why exactly they did it but knowing their reasoning would propably lead to me questioning our collective sanity. You'll find out why shortly.

*$intern* is a student of business. $intern doesn't really like doing work because who does, right? But $intern refuses to memorize basic operational procedures and doesn't really care how we operate. We sell stuff. A lot of stuff. We're talking truckloads of stuff. 

As any business of this size we use different softwares that we haven't developed ourselves. Let's call the software *$PAS*. *$PAS* is basically an interactive inventory, balance and receipt software. Everything and everyone has a unique *$id*.

*$intern* was given a lot of small tasks that we trusted her to fulfill so we could go on with our day. *$intern* was with us for about 6 months. After our inital period of struggling to get her to do basically ANYTHING we settled into a state of peaceful co-existence.

Until one day I got a frantic call from $customer. $customer had a large local retailer selling goods to people. And *$customer* had a complaint. His complaint was that his appeal to cancel multiple deliveries/orders had been dismissed. 

At this point I was kind of lost. *$customer* ordered basically the same every other week. There should be no reason for a complaint in the first place. The transactions with him were set in stone long before I even joined the company.

And him having sent an appeal and it being dismissed? I was completely lost. I went around the office asking different people about this and nobody had the slightest clue as this was basically automated and running on its own.

So I fire up *$PAS* and start investigating this mystery. His usual orders are all scheduled regularly, delivered and paid for way before the deadline. But also there are about 10-35 TRUCKLOADS OF STUFF HE DIDN'T WANT. All registered on his unique customer *$id*. I was beyoned worried. Our system was ordering stuff for people that were drowning in truckloads of goods they didn't want or need.

So I went deeper into the rabbithole and discovered that *$customer* had opened a appeal/complaint for EVERY SINGLE ORDER. And guess who had dismissed those orders?

I hope you beat me to it - *$intern* did. So I went and talked to her. Her reasoning? ""I kept getting messages about this stuff. I have no idea about it so I dismissed them.""

At this point is was none the wiser as to WHY she did get those messages. After a short period of digging I found the reason.

When our travelling salesmen open an order they can be sometimes incomplete. A salesman will fill in the first order completely and book additional stuff and trust our department to match the details down (they're working on tablets and it's a pain to fill in stuff).

Guess who saw a red field in her software and decided to put in the first *$id* that worked and kept doing it? Yes. *$intern*. Every single unfinished order from our salesmen went to *$customer*.

Took us nearly 6 months to clean up after our coworker came back from maternity leave. I can proudly say we did our best for *$customer* and he still is indeed a customer of ours.

5z58yv,1,2017-03-13,[Seeking Advice] I've received a lot of suggestions but I don't know where to start.,buckygoboom,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5z58yv/seeking_advice_ive_received_a_lot_of_suggestions/,"I am currently a full time high school teacher and I'm fairly certain that somewhere down the line I'm going to want to change careers.  So far this year, things are going well, but the not so good years really take a toll on me (like last year for instance).  Combine that with the new unrealistic requirements that government is imposing and I forsee a point where I have had enough and need to leave teaching.  I have always been good with computer and I work closely with the IT department at my school.

Essentially, I want to start prepping the way for if I do finally decide to make the career change but I don't know where to start.  In addition to having a B.S. in General Science w/ Chemistry Concentration, a M.A.T. in Education, and 8 years teaching experience, I have the following work experience in IT:

-3 years as an IT Student Technician (work study when I was in college)

-2 years Audio-Visual Techinician (1st school, didn't get the opportunity to do much with this)

-3 years Audio-Visual Techinician (2nd school, very actively involved with equipment care, working closely with IT, involves balancing a budget, and managing a high school intern)

-Hosted several Professional Developments where I taught how to use Google Drive and related services.

In addition to the above, I've done some side projects like home networking and building computers.  I help out occassionally with HelpDesk tasks from my current school's IT department if I have spare time (not to mention that the AV position is basically a HelpDesk job as I'm in the sytem as a tech).  In high school I did basic website design and I have C+ on my undergrad transcrpit, though I would need to brush up on it as it has been a long time since I have used it.

My endgame would be to move into an administrative position (similar to the position the head of the IT department as my school has).  I know the best way to go would be to start in a HelpDesk position full time and work my way up with experience.  I would like to avoid this as I think the pay would be to small.  Staying in an educational environment will be a plus since that is where my roots are but is not a requirement.  I can definately say I have 2.5 years before I leave teaching.  I would like to consider any plans/ideas that would take about 3 years or less to complete.  So far the most consistent piece of advice I have received is that certs are more important than a degree.  Certs seem like an appealing option as I can self educate and then take a test at my own pace (not to mention that I have a child at home to take care of and I will be maintaining my full time teaching job).  I'm already looking into Cicso certificates but it looks like there are multiple kinds of those so I'm not sure where to start, or if I should be looking into other certs.

Any advice on what I should do would be very much appreciated.  If there is more info that is needed on my situation, please feel free to ask."

I have a few general questions about what to expect upon graduation, and thought I'd see what you all had to say. Before I dive into those, I will roughly breakdown what we focused on in this program:

3-4 classes where we focused on R. We learned several ways to to analyze data within R and talked about ways of integrating pertinent statistics to conduct the analysis.

2 classes where we focused on SQL-- one was almost exclusively done in MySQL and the other was more of a big data class, where we learned about unstructured data (Hadoop).

Several Marketing Analytics classes where we would look at predicting things like churn, probability of purchase, etc. We used tools like Google Analytics, SPSS, etc.

There were a few other classes that were, more or less, a combination of the aforementioned classes. 

I have 3 years of work experience prior to joining this program, where I did IT work as well as Operations work. I did analytics (more descriptive than predictive) in the Operations roles and worked on a wide variety of things in IT (queries, hardware, analytics, etc.) 

My questions: What would one reasonably expect to earn upon completion of this masters? I've done some research, and it's far from conclusive, but the best number I can seem to come up with is an average of $69,000 (so I've been using this as my benchmark). I have an offer on the table for roughly $62,000. I'm also currently in an internship, but have yet to have a discussion with managers regarding potential employment upon graduation. I really like this company-- should I tell them I have an offer on the table and that, while I understand they may not be able to make an offer right now, I need to get some sort of understanding of what my outlook with them is?

This may be the wrong place to post this (if so, any suggestions for a more relevant sub would be appreciated). If there is any more information I can provide to clarify, please, let me know.

I immediately started working as an unpaid intern after that for a comedy show that I took classes in. Selling tickets, advertising in front of the casinos on the strip. Also hot, but a lot better because I ran my own thing. I left that after 3 months (August 2013 to November 2013)

While I job hunted, I decided to put some of my education to good use. I studied web design in high school (I went to a magnet school) and worked freelance for a few people. But I hated what I did, so I found some other web designers who were willing to take over the projects and left that behind. (November 2013 to June 2014).

I stared to focus more on school. But once I graduated, I needed to start looking for work. My parents own a business (that I have no interest in whatsoever), but money is money, so I would do odd jobs for them whenever. It was more of a quid-pro-quo/allowance in exchange for some tasks done kind of deal. I still have it on my resume as my longest stuck-with job (1 year 5 months).

I decided to look elsewhere though, and worked for a week as a host for a little breakfast restaurant on the other side of town (February 2015). I didn't have my own car at the time, and my parents made me quit because I was driving their car and it was about 20 miles away.

A week later, I got a job at a car dealership as a salesman (at 18 years old). It was pretty good money, but the management was god-awful (absolutely not exaggerating). One manager would make me buy a brand of cigarettes I didn't smoke with my own money, share a couple with me, then take the whole rest of the pack home at the end of the day.

After 3 months there (March 2015 to June 2015), I decided to take the summer off.

That August, I got a job at a call center selling stock options to old rich people. I didn't really get that many sales, and they were threatening to layoff those who weren't performing. I decided to leave after 3 months because I was only making $200 a week and the work was soul crushing. (August 2015 to November 2015).

I took that time off again to focus on school. At that time, I had switched my major to Political Journalism, and began doing freelance work. However, the more I attended rallies, the more I realized that I wanted to be the one doing the political work. Not reporting on it. So I switched my major again to political science and stopped journalism (November 2015 to March 2016).

To make some money on the side, I got a job at a small gelato shop (also on the other side of town, but I had a car, so it was fine). I was laid off after a month because my ""scooping wasn't on par with the others"" (April 2016). Also the only job I was actually laid off from.

A month later, I began another unpaid internship with a fringe candidate running for Senate in the primaries working as a communications staffer. I was only with them for less than a month, before he lost (last place. Bad loss). (May 2016)

I took another summer off, and in August 2016, my friend got me a job working at a shoe repair place that he was managing one of the locations for. It was pretty cool and I was making pretty decent money. However, after 3 months, my dad had said he wanted me to start paying rent for me and my girlfriend or get our own place. I told him that getting our own place was impossible on the combined amount that I and my girlfriend were making, so he talked with his friend and was going to get me a better paying job with better hours, but he told me I had to quit my current job right then and there or a) I wouldn't get the new job and b) I would be out of a place to live. So I quit. Didn't even give a 2 week notice. Quit right on the spot (don't worry, I still finished my last day). (August 2016 to November 2016).

I interviewed the next day and the guy who owned the company looked like he liked me. However, he had said that he wasn't going to hire anyone until after the new year. But a week before January 1st, I emailed him and was told back that he hired someone 2 weeks prior and did not tell me. So now I've been ""f""unemployed since November.

I'm trying to get a job in politics. Even the most minor job. Local government stuff. I'd even settle for a cashier job at the rec center.

But the problem I run into is that I've had so many different jobs for varying, short amounts of time, that I feel I'm almost unhirable by any job I actually want to do. But I also have to focus on school. I also need money though to pay bills. I feel like I'm in this awful rut. Any advice?

TL;DR: I have had a lot of different kinds of jobs in different fields of work, all very short times. Am I unhirable in the field of Politics (of which I want to go into)?"

While technically not being about TechSupport
it **is** an worthy tale to be told.

**The Stage:**

*A middle sized software development company on a grim, cloudy tuesday afternoon.  Narrow corridors spread across the floor and form a confusing maze.*

*The walls are painted in white, barely decorated and spread a feeling like a the inside of a mental asylum.*

**The actors:**

$ME: yours truly; apprentice in software development at $ProjectTeam (*I actually do support but for applications)*  
$OA:  OtherApprentice in software development but for internal software  
$NG: new guy; intern at $ProjectTeam also the ""end user"" in this story  
$TT: TechTeam; basicly our internal HelpDesk  
$BCA: BusinuessCriticalApp, in use by every employee

**The story:**

*Picture $NG sitting in his small office just barely able to fit him and 3 other co-workers.
He's exhausted.  
Enduring trainings almost daily for 8 hours each messes with people.*

$NG recently was told where to get 3rd party applications from (*Note: our company has a strict no-download policy*) and such went on to locate the installer
for a file-browser application on our network drives.  

*The scene fades away. $ME and $OA are in focus and just across the floor of $TT offices.*

They're busy studying for an upcoming exam and try to ignore the world around them.  

All is going well when...

*MailIcon of $BCA appears on $OA's taskbar*

&gt;$OA: ""Huh."" *checks eMail*

**KASPERSKY! VIRUS ALERT!!!**  
**$maliciousFile in directory: $NG's $UserDirectory**

&gt;$OA: ""Yo $ME, somebody got himself in trouble, I guess.""  
&gt;$ME: *glances over mail* ""This is gonna be fun. He's just been here a week. Might be a new record.""

*A few more words were exchanged. After about a minute $OA and $ME noticed the unread mail counter has risen from about 15 to 110*

&gt;$OA: ""Oh shit. All those mails are sent because of the virus alert! And $TT haven't even send anybody out...""

*The counter is still rising. Currently at 300 unread mails*

&gt;$ME: ""Holy shit is Kaspersky sending out mails for every second that file still exists on his harddrive?""  
&gt;$OA: ""I guess so. It `shouldn't` do that but it does... oh well.""  

*800 unread emails*  

*Noises of shuffling feet and squaks of a trolley are to be heard.*  
$TT finally sent out an emergency squad!

&gt;$OA: ""I really want to know how this plays out.""
&gt;$ME ""Well I'll run after them and have a look.""

*The counter hits* **1013** *unread emails. Shouts echo along the corridors!*

&gt;Voice_1: ""$BCA has crashed on me!""  
&gt;Voice_2: ""I can't open my inbox! WHAT IS HAPPENING?""

*Another shout is to be heard...*

&gt;GuyFromTT: ""God forbid, the server for $BCA shut down.""  

*$OA cracks down; $ME heads out the office*  

*fade to black*

*$ME arrives  at $NGs office*  

One techie is already on the floor angrily ripping out any cables going into the contaminated box 
while the other stands guard to ensure no evil-doer will enter and mess with **their** authority.

They load the machine onto the trolley, inform $NG it'll take about two days and exit the scene.

$NG stares at $ME, who visually struggles to hold back his laughter,  baffled at what just happened.

Finally he sighs in relief, the stress vaporizes into the room and he asks:
&gt;""Is it `NORMAL` here to immediatly take away the computer?""
  
*$ME nods*
&gt;$ME: ""Yes. Yes it is.""

**The aftermath:**

* $BCA server was offline for about an hour.  
* $NG got a software security training. *Again*.
* The computer came back two days later. Fully formatted and with a fresh install
* Kaspersky got downgraded from a hilariously obnoxious spambot to decently annoying antivirus.
* Still **no** backup sever in sight for $BCA.

**Edit (my answer to /u/Koladi-Ola):**  
So basicly what he ($NG) did was to google the application and just take the first link to a well known regional download site (not the official website though)
He claimed to be using that site for 15 years but failed to learn that the site ""recently"" (= for approx. 5 years to date) started to provide the software with their own custom downloader which is considered to be affiliated with a big ad-network and malware distributors (and this is a pretty known fact about that site by now)"

I basically applied to almost all of the ones in my major without reading all the details on the job description.

Second, I am looking into opening up for international shipping. Should I open it up to all countries or should I gradually expand? If gradually, what country or countries should I expand to? Would you buy anything from Juerix? 

Third, what do you think about the prices? I'm sorry the prices are in Thai Baht so divide by 34 to get the price in USD.

I got an offer from my dream company last week, which I accepted. I now need a way to handle these questions without burning any bridges. I seriously love the company and people I work with, but the new offer is way too good to turn down.

Should I:

* Be neutral until I receive an offer from current company, then reject it

* Talk to manager about not being able to extend

* Wait until someone asks me directly if I want to stay, then explain that I have other commitments, and hope the message gets around

* ???

I took several CS classes in high school, then obtained an AS in CS from community college- through both, the language taught to me was Java. I stopped to work and save money for college, since I more or less support myself as my parents don't have money, and got stuck in a loop. So, recently, I wanted to turn things around. I've gone through with the Intro to Programming course on Udacity as a refresher, learning a bit of Python and HTML/CSS in the process, and now...

I don't know where to go. They recommend mobile, web dev, or data analysis... I don't think I'm qualified for DA, don't have a Mac for Swift 3.0, and I struggle more with HTML/Android/SQL because I'm so used to Python and Java.

At home i already have a nice gaming desktop with windows 10 (for games) and Linux mint (for work).

In July I'm heading to amsterdam for an internship só i need the laptop to be enough to code (mostly Java, Python, Android, JavaScript, etc), have a nice build quality and a nice punchy screen (i didnt like the screen on my Lenovo at all).

Here is the form:

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
1400$, Portugal

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life but with the best specifications for the money.

* **How important is weight to you?**
I'm going to carry the laptop around most of the time so weight is important, anything under 3 / 2.5 Kg.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
I have no preference, i work with linux and windows at home.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
No more than 15.6"".

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Mostly IDE's and Text Editors. Maybe Photoshop.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I want the one of the best screens if no the best i can find for my money, a good keyboard, good build quality and a good amount of ports.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I would like a laptop that is enough for my work, with good build quality and good specs that make me happy in using it and lasts me a good amount of time, maybe 4 to 5 years.

I am going to buy the laptop Tomorrow so i'm relying on your answers.

Kind regards."

It is located in a large Canadian city and I am a relatively charismatic person (compared to a lot of peers I know and I don't mean to offend anyone but I know a lot of people who have hygienic issues). Problem was that I effectively spam applied and I didn't realize that the position lasted for 8 months.... Yeah so I had planned to start sophomore year in the fall but I don't know if opportunities like this are common and if I should go to school next semester or take this opportunity. I am obviously new to the CS field so I don't know much about how important an internship is, I also feel kinda unqualified since the interview was mostly personality stuff which I am really good at and a bit of basic OOP trivia which I did pretty decent on but I still slipped up on some things. I honestly don't know how to code very well and the job seems like it will require some decent amount of coding and currently I am definitely a bad coder. My GPA and school might look good in Canada too since the average Canadian GPA is much lower than in the United States and my GPA would honestly be top of the class for some Canadian schools for CS like SFU which I heard from some peers has like a 2.82 GPA average overall or something so the CS GPA would be even lower. I almost feel like I scammed this opportunity due to luck and circumstances, anyways any advice would be appreciated."

She has just told me that I am revolving my life around her and that she is worried that I am have no ambition and my only focus is her. I think it's worth mentioning that she has a son and is a few years older than me. Part of me believes that she is afraid that I'm coming over just for her for another year and that I have no ambition to Grow in life. If this is the case I am willing to change my whole attitude on life and become a better person for the both of us.

I absolutely dislike pair programming and now I will be interning this summer at a company that loves pair programming. I'm really hoping this time around I won't hate it so much but the idea of having to pair program all the time sounds like a nightmare. The devs at the company also apparently don't have permanent desk since everyone is always moving around pair programming.

Out of all the times I have pair programmed, whether it be friends, internships or a part of interviews. Not once have I ever liked it. I feel like I can't think and work freely. Theres only one time that I've paired and felt that is was a valuable experience. It was in my first internship and while I learned a few things in that session I could have just as well learned the same information from proper documentation and looking around in the codebase. 

Outside of that all my other pair programming experiences during that internship were annoying. I paired with a senior dev who basically just did all the work himself and clearly had not interest in letting me drive. Like okay I get that I was a noob and barely knew shit in comparison and he wanted to get the job done quickly but how am I suppose to learn if I don't get my hands dirty. 

The other occasion was with a new hire. It was clear she had her way of doing things and I had mine but boy did she mind. While I was driving she kept trying to tell me what to do and pointed out any little typing mistake I made as if I was some kind of idiot. By the end of the pairing session I could not stand her and mentally gave her the glare of death from then on.

I'm just not seeing the benefits of pair programming enough to warrant its implementation. 

I am currently still applying to other internships even though I accepted the offer already. "

It has been many months of coding day and night but we are excited to have over 100 listings on the site. I have personally spoken with the landlords that made most of the listings and many of them have been hosting students for years.

Most of our listings are in the San Francisco, the Bay Area, Seattle, Toronto, and Vancouver right now. If you know of any landlords that host students we would really appreciate it if you could spread the word!

This site is entirely focused on students and we have features that portray that.

1. As a landlord you can only rent for 3 to 12 months.
2. We make it clear to landlords that students are primarily looking for furnished listings and won't be able to tour the place.
3. Landlords and listings can become ""verified"" if students say they have lived there before (we also have reviews on listings, even though there are not very many right now).
4. Students can look up directions to work from each listing, right on the results page! Once you add a ""current employer"" we show you the commute to work by walking, biking, or bus.
5. Student Connect. If you click on ""Connect"" at the top (after logging in) you can see where fellow students are working. Some programs have this amongst their own class (custom Google Maps) so we figured we would integrate this into the site. Whether you want to see if others will be working near you or find out where your classmates are interning, feel free to browse around the map!

There will most definitely still be bugs, but please let us know what you think. Any feedback, questions, or recommendations are welcome :)"
5zjve9,290,2017-03-15,Plaster On My Basement Walls,akttl11,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zjve9/plaster_on_my_basement_walls/,"Hello everyone! My name is Cassie, and I am a 24 year old female, who just got her own house in a big city. 

I know a lot of you write, and there are a ton of stories about people moving to big cities, on their own, and then bad things happen. This is kinda one of them, but it most certainly isn’t your average story. 

I’ve always lived on the outskirts of a big city, and I always traveled into the city for needs, such as groceries and clothes. Cities are nothing new to me. So when I found a two bedroom, single family house for sale for cheaper than cheap, I jumped quickly to it. 

It wasn’t in a bad neighborhood at all. It was friendly looking, like the “block party” type neighborhood. I saw a few elderly citizens walking their little dogs, and a couple younger women jogging around the block. Friendly enough, right? I thought so too. When I met the realtor, Jane, she was your average realtor. Tall, small waist, proportioned hips, shoulder length chestnut hair. Thin lips, round face, and fair skin. She was very nice, and helpful on all basis of purchasing a house. 

“Why so inexpensive?” I asked with a smile. 

“The owners have retired, and are now traveling around the world, and do not want the burden of the house. They want to keep it maintained, and quote, not dusty or degraded, unquote.” She replied with her sincerest smile. “Also, they just renovated it about 3 years ago, and so everything is in pristine condition. They just don’t want to see it go to waste.” 

“Understandable! Why not rent it?” 

“Renter’s are more of a hassle, Mr. and Mrs. Lennard don’t want the responsibilities of upkeeping while traveling.” 

I thought that was a valid point. 

We walked down the sidewalk toward the porch. It’s an open porch, no railing, but still looked eloquent. It has a white floorboard porch, with white wooden steps leading up to it. There are three rose bushes lining each side of the front porch. *A nice touch to the house.* The front door is a heavy cherry wooden door, with a gold knocker on the front of it. On each side of the door there is a narrow, door length, cherry framed window for you to peak out of. 

She unlocked the door and opened it to a spacious house. First thing when you see when you walk in, is the hallway leading to the kitchen. The hardwood floors had been redone to the retired couple’s liking. May I say, they have great taste! A lighter red colored wooden floor surrounded us in all the large room. To the left of the front door is the living room, size was acceptable, since it’s just me and my cat, Snore. *Yes, I have a cat named Snore. Don’t judge.* To the right of the door, is the dining room. Very roomy. The living room and dining room are about the same size. We walked down the hallway to the kitchen, and I was beyond excited! There is an island with a marble top counter. The other counters are also marble top. They too, are newer. 

We reached the master bedroom, and it is beautiful. The same cherry colored wood floors, spacious, for my liking, maybe even a little too big. It has a nine shelf walk in closet. Three shelves on each side, and three shelves directly in front, (far back wall). Has one window facing my neighbor’s house, and one window facing the street. Decent size windows too. Easy enough to fit my slender figure through, if need to break in.  *Which thankfully, I have had to do yet!*

We visited the guest/second bedroom, and it did not have a walk-in closet, and only one window, which faced the side of the neighbor’s house. It is definitely a good office room. Oh yeah, I’m a medical intern for the hospital here in the city. No, not Grey Sloan Hospital/Seattle Grace Hospital. I have yet to figure out what to use the second room for. Currently it is a storage unit for boxes of the unknown. 

After visiting the spare room, we stepped into the hallway that led to the rooms, kitchen, dining room, and front door. She told me there is a basement, and that it was unfinished.  I asked her how unfinished it was, and she said very unfinished. As I’m writing this to you, it is still in the shape it was eight months ago when I first moved in. Unfinished, untouched, and scary. I have only been down there once, and that was because my brother wanted to look at it. 

Side note: It smelled very odd. Not musty, but not really old either. I’m not sure how to describe the smell. It just smelled… *”off”.*

There are four poles that are staggered throughout the basement, it isn’t a huge basement, but decent size. The walls are drywall, and looked like they had just been plastered to fix holes. Big holes. Assuming Mr. and Mrs. Lennard wanted to fix some electrical stuff? Nothing extremely creepy, but still, I always hated basements, so I never went down there. A few boxes were left behind, but they looked like paperwork from back when my mom was in high school. I didn’t bother with it. There was a cellar door that led to the outside world, so that was nice to have, in case of an emergency or something.  

I still haven’t used the cellar door. 

So, to the reason I’m “redditing” you guys! A few months ago, I was had a first day off in like two weeks, so I was home catching up on my favorite shows. I was scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, when I heard a bump from below me. At first I thought it was Snore, but knew I’d never let him in the basement alone. So I figured it was just the house settling or something. I mean, it is like 20 years old. I go back to scrolling and watching, and didn’t hear anything for the rest of the night. 

A few days had past, and I had forgotten about the loud bump in my basement. I was at home getting ready for another 48 hour shift, when I heard it again. This time it sounded more distant. As if I was on one side of the house, and the bump happened on the other side of the house. There was a lock on the cellar door, on the outside, which I only had the key to, so I know no one was breaking into the basement from the cellar. Once again, I blew it off, and continued getting ready. 

As I was leaving for work, I walked around the side of the house, opposite of the side where the windows were to the bedrooms, toward where the cellar door was. I noticed that the lock had been unlocked, which freaked me out so much! I quickly locked it back up, and dead sprinted to the car. I called up my brother and told him about what has been happening lately. He assured me I was going crazy, and he’d come check it out for me while I was at work. 

Later that evening he sent me a text. Following conversation below:

Bryson: *Hey sis, you be clear in your house. You’re probably just working too much and going coo coo for coco puffs.*

Me: *Uh, no, I know what I heard dude, it was a thump or bump. I heard it twice. Not crazy.* 

Bryson: *Ok whatever you say. But hey are you renovating downstairs?* 

That scared the crap out of me. Why would I, a 24 year old female, be renovating a basement that I’m afraid of? 

Me: *Uh, no? Y?*

Bryson: *Oh….well it looks like there is more plaster coverings around the wall. Like you were trying to cover more holes or sumthin.*

Me: *Noo… I haven’t done anything to the basement.* 

I asked him if he could stay at my house for the night to make sure nothing was going on. And honestly, I wanted him to hear it for himself. The thumping and bumping I heard. 

Fast forward to the ending of my 48 hour shift. Bryson had notified me that he heard thumping and banging from below the living room. Of course, being siblings, I rubbed it in his face that I told him so. I asked if he went to check on it, but he said no, it was four in the morning, and wasn’t going to be the idiot in scary movies. I laughed and agreed. 

When I finished my shift at six in the morning, I hurried home. I parked my car in the garage and walked into the house through the garage. I  found my brother passed out on the couch with a kitchen knife on the coffee table next to him. *Something must have spooked him, to have a kitchen knife next to him.* I go take a shower and get in more suitable clothes for relaxation. After I got done getting dressed, I heard my brother waking up in the living room. I walked out to the living room, and stopped dead in my tracks. Bryson looked like he hadn’t slept in three weeks. He looked awful. 

“What the hell happened to you?” I asked. 

“What do you mean?” 

“You look like you hadn’t slept in forever. I’m sorry, but you look like dog shit!” 

He did, his eyes were puffy and had dark circles underneath. He looked pale, and drug down. He seemed to have all the energy and life sucked right out of him in a matter of hours. 

“I didn’t get much sleep last night. After I texted you, I kept hearing the banging. I wrote it off as the cellar door latch broke or something, but I didn’t dare go check it out. Not in the dark, and not alone. I was in and out of sleep due to the banging, so yea, sis, that’s why I look like shit.” He gave me a sly smile and went to make coffee. 

I sat on the couch dozing off when he brought me coffee. He mentioned us looking at the cellar lock and latch to see if it somehow came undone, or broke off. I nodded in agreement and sat in silence. 

The latch was there, but the lock was not. I’m not sure what happened, but it just wasn’t there. Like someone stole it? Bryson suggested we went to the hardware store to buy a new lock. I agreed, but asked if he could go alone, since I just got off work. He happily agreed and left. 

I was curdled up with Snore in my bed and drifting off to sleep. Almost asleep, I was awoken by a loud slam/bang sound. Snore freaked out and meowed at the door. I curdled closer to the wall with Snore in my arms. I looked to grab my phone and heard another bang. Almost like the cellar door was opening and closing. 

I called 911, and then Bryson. Bryson rushed back to my place, but the police beat him there. The police had already taken a statement, and searched the house after telling them everything that’s happened. They couldn’t find anything. I even mentioned how there were more plaster smudges on the walls, and they just kind of blew it off. 

Bryson wasn’t buying it. So he did what any other logical person would do. Go to Best Buy and buy cameras. A few hours later he came back, and installed all the cameras while I was sleeping. He woke me up and told me that everything was installed in the basement, and we would catch our culprit soon enough. Soon enough was too soon. 

A few days had passed, and I was sitting on my couch studying when I heard it again. The bangs and booms from within my basement. I didn’t move, I didn’t turn the volume down, I didn’t want whatever was down there to know I knew they were there. I just sat there in silence with Snore meowing next to me. 

“Shut it Snore!” I said in a harsh whisper. All he did was meow back at me. He really has a personality on him. 

I got a notification on my phone stating there was motion detected on camera 2 and 3. I waited patiently to look at the footage until I knew I was safe to move. For that matter, breathe. A few hours had passed, and I was still staring at the white paint chip on my wall. Listening for any movement or activity going on beneath my very ass. Occasionally I heard what sounded like a grunt, and then the occasional bang. After a while it stopped and I felt safe in the house. 

I took out my phone and opened the app for the cameras, hit rewind, and pressed play. For a little bit I pressed fast forward, because nothing was happening, but then something caught my eye. 

On the screen, to the right, I saw a shed a light being let in. Previously, there was no light. Only source of light would be the cellar door opening. Sure enough, the cellar door was opening. I watched intently, remembering every detail of what I was seeing. I really wish I hadn’t. 

The screen filled with light, and I could see the basement clearly now. Only a portion of it though because of the camera’s set up. I heard a thump, which was the door opening up and hitting the ground outside. Thump number one! Still watching, I see a man, maybe 6’5, a little hefty, with a small beer belly, walking down the damn steps into the basement. 

He wasn’t alone though. There was a girl with him, maybe my age? Slumped over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. The cameras were too far away for me to tell if she was breathing or not. But I found out shortly that she wasn’t breathing at all. This guy walked over to the closet, closes to camera 2, and opened the door. (I didn’t even know there was a closet down there. I guess, being down there once, wasn’t enough.) He shut the door and walked back over by the cellar door; girl still on his shoulder. When he came into full view, he had a sledge hammer in his left hand. He slid the girl behind him on to the floor, making her land on her head. I swear I heard her skull break. He took the hammer and slammed it into the wall. One big slam, was enough to make a decent sized hole. He grabbed the girl, and stuffed her in odd angles into the hole. Then he walked back over to the closet where he got the sledge hammer and grabbed the plaster stuff, and a few other things to cover up the hole. (Sorry I’m not sure what you have to do to cover up a hole relatively big like that. Not smart in construction).

I immediately called 911 and explained to them in a frantic, disorganized way, of what I just saw on my cameras. I waited ten minutes for cops to show up. By the time they showed up I was sobbing into Snore, and praying I wasn’t going to die within that ten minutes. I texted Bryson to come over too, so he could comfort me. 

The cops did their investigation and found three bodies in the wall all belonging to females in their twenties. Three females who have been reported missing for the last five months. The police took my camera’s and phone for evidence, to help identify the man. Bryson stayed with me until we knew for certain that the man was charged and put away to prison. 

A few days ago, I got a call from the detective active on the investigation, stating they found the man who was behind the murders and they have him behind bars. Turns out, he is the son of Mrs. and Mr. Lennard. His name is Joshua Lennard. He’s 28 years old, who lives three blocks away from me. The reason why the Lennard’s sold the house for so cheap and went to travel was because of their son. 

They knew the entire time who he was, and what he was capable of doing. He confessed to the three murders, as well as five others that happened in his teen age years. Those bodies were never found though. Detectives believe that his parents were involved with getting rid of the bodies, but they have no leads to their whereabouts. The realtor who sold the house, doesn’t know where they are either. 

I’m so glad that this is all behind me now, and that he is in prison rotting for the rest of his life. Since then, I haven’t heard any weird bangs or booms, and my house feels more peaceful now than ever. I think I’ll find a roommate, because I don’t think I can live alone now.

5zjxi7,20,2017-03-15,We made a site to help students find housing during internships. Let us know what you think!,PadPiper,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5zjxi7/we_made_a_site_to_help_students_find_housing/,"We're a team of current students and new grads who launched www.padpiper.com to help students find housing for internships this summer.

It has been many months of coding day and night but we are excited to have over 100 listings on the site. I have personally spoken with the landlords that made most of the listings and many of them have been hosting students for years.

Most of our listings are in the San Francisco, the Bay Area, Seattle, Toronto, and Vancouver right now. If you know of any landlords that host students we would really appreciate it if you could spread the word!

This site is entirely focused on students and we have features that portray that.

1. As a landlord you can only rent for 3 to 12 months.
2. We make it clear to landlords that students are primarily looking for furnished listings and won't be able to tour the place.
3. Landlords and listings can become ""verified"" if students say they have lived there before (we also have reviews on listings, even though there are not very many right now).
4. Students can look up directions to work from each listing, right on the results page! Once you add a ""current employer"" we show you the commute to work by walking, biking, or bus.
5. Student Connect. If you click on ""Connect"" at the top (after logging in) you can see where fellow students are working. Some programs have this amongst their own class (custom Google Maps) so we figured we would integrate this into the site. Whether you want to see if others will be working near you or find out where your classmates are interning, feel free to browse around the map!

There will most definitely still be bugs, but please let us know what you think. Any feedback, questions, or recommendations are welcome :)"
5zjykt,2,2017-03-15,Speculations on the employability for international students during and after College?,WavefunctionX,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5zjykt/speculations_on_the_employability_for/,"Hi all, I understand this post may come off as a digression from the objective of the subreddit, but as an international applicant who intends to pursue a US education, I felt it might be necessary to have a healthy discussion on our 'futures'. Furthermore, since I am an 'Indian' this question is even more important. 

From whatever I've read about the proposed H1B reform, it seems that it wants to:
1) Reduce outsourcing and keep jobs to individuals who receive american education
2) Raise incomes for all under the H1B visa

Also to an extent it seems that the H1B will impact IT professionals from asian countries. However, this still begets the question- If 2 college students - X and Y go through the same undergraduate degree at a US college and if X is American while Y is an International student and they have the same merits, who is more likely to get a job. As of now, many are speculating that considering the fact that the wage level is to be standardised, US multinationals may recruit more american workers. 

Now these may be speculations, but it's real and it's happening. Many of my acquaintances who are relatively skilled have been denied H1B visas. What was even more alarming is that a few international students who are in their 4th year have yet to receive a placement. Some of these students are ready to work on unpaid/low paying internships at the moment. 

I'm also particularly worried about the socio-cultural environment. Considering the relatively recent shooting that took place, I'm concerned about my safety and the safety of other people who come into this land of opportunity and work hard to contribute as much as possible. I'm not pointing any fingers, but factors like these have to come into consideration because of the alarming rise in unrest. 

Hence, I'd like to call for all AOs and other experienced people to perhaps give us an idea of the possible job situation 4 years down the line. I'd also like other international students (applicants and those currently enrolled) to discuss their worries and give their views on this. 

Also if anyone knows a better place to post this, please help me do so. 

Sincerely, 
A troubled international applicant "
5zk4cc,2,2017-03-15,Unable to land work in field almost one year after graduation from engineering.,FixThisResume,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/5zk4cc/unable_to_land_work_in_field_almost_one_year/,"Hey all. I recently graduated from a mining engineering at one of the top schools for this field in my country. I was able to land a one year internship after my third year and expected that to really help me find work after graduation however after a couple hundred of applications and emails I haven't even gotten requests for interviews. I originally attributed it to the downturn in the industry as none of my classmates had anything lined up at graduation either, but now a few of them have landed some work and others either returned to uni or took analyst level positions in other fields. 
I didn't do myself any favours in my job hunt by travelling in the summer after graduation either. Now it's almost been a year and 
i'm worried that this gap is only going to worsen my chances at landing decent work. I've been doing a little volunteer work at some local shelters since getting back from travelling in October but i'm only in a couple days a month and its mostly preparing meals/ensuring good conduct. 

As much as I try not to I keep feeling discouraged and doubting myself. I'm now considering taking my masters next year in structural or industrial (1yr), or maybe make the switch into compsci (2yr program) even though its totally unrelated, but i always liked coding and the job market looks promising. 

Anyhow, I digress. Here's the sheet. Any and all criticisms are appreciated. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwzKyyALo__cc29NeEtMYVB5Rzg/view?usp=sharing

Also during my final year of school the entire final semester was just for our capstone projects where we designed and created a pre-feasibility study for both Underground and Open pit operations. I'm wondering if I should add these into my resume or maybe just cover letter or talk about them in the interview (if/when i get one lol). 

Thanks. I'm happy to answer any questions if you have any"

I am getting ready to do an ""internship"" at the company I currently work as a Junior IT admin/help desk. I am about to finish up an A.S. in Computer Programming, and all I have in my way is an internship this summer. My boss agreed to follow along, and I will mostly just do the work on my own time, and he will sign off on it. I have been with the company for 5+ years, mom and pop place, we sell copy machines, ~20 employees. 

I need help figuring out a project to do, at least somewhat related to the company. I would say I am still a beginner. I know most of the syntax for Java, and C++. I have a basic understanding of html/css, javascript, and sql as well. I took a class on Jsp/Servlets and am currently taking a game making class in DirectX. I am having trouble breaking through to an intermediate programmer, and luckily my boss is cool and agreed to sign off on this, there is no way I am ready to work in a production environment. I am literally breathing code right now, re-learning c++, and need to brush up on my java a little.

All suggestions are appreciated."

As the title says, I'm a recent early graduate (1 semester early) with a good GPA of 3.8 from a non-target school but literally no internship experience. The lack of experience is killing me right now and I'm really just coming to terms on how badly I fucked myself over by not getting some experience while in school. I've been applying to entry level financial analyst positions for 3 months now just to get my foot in the door but I'm barely even getting an interview (northern Chicago-land area).

So at this point, my question is what can I do to beef up my resume? What career positions should I be open to? Basically, what is my best move from here?"

After graduating I was working as a sales intern for the Philadelphia Soul, they said there was a good chance it could turn into a job if I worked hard and met my sales goals. I worked hard but I struggled to sell tickets and at the end of the season I wasn't brought back. That was the last time I worked in my field. Since then i've applied to probably well over 150 jobs in SM and have only a hand full of interviews to show for it. I had to move back home and eventually I settled for being a substitute teacher because I had bills to pay and it gave me time to apply for more jobs and figure out what I wanted to do or if I wanted to be a teacher. Last year, I worked as a full time gym teacher (without a licence) but at the end of the year I realized teaching wasn't for me. Now that i'm in a much better financial position I can finally move out of my house and to an area better equipped to a sport management career. I've been applying and applying just hoping someone will give me a chance, but still no go. I had an interview the other day where I was interviewed along 3 other people (all younger than me) at the same time. He said one of us would get the position. He did this exercise where he would rate us from 4 to 1 ranging from who had the best response to who had the worst response 4 being the worst 1 being the best. for 3 of the questions I received a 1 and 1 of the questions I received a 2. I felt really good about my interview. I didnt get the job. That was like the straw the broke the camels back. Since graduating ive worked many odd jobs in the summer and during the school year but i'm tired of working odd jobs. My goal has always been to return to SM but it seems like the younger college grads are getting all the entry jobs and even know im 26, i feel theres something thats turning me off to job interviewers. I no longer know what I want. I was the 1st to go to college in my family and just giving up on my college degree just seems so wrong but im trying to accept my situation for what it is. Do you think I should completely give up on my sport management career and go for something else? Or should I keep trying? I'm trying to become a new person now that i'm finally able to move so a new career seems intriguing but quitting SM is hard for me. 

Sorry for the long text and thank you for your responses. Be brutal, tell me what I need to hear. "

5zlehi,541,2017-03-15,My great grandfather used to work with Dr. Josef Mengele - Part 2,CathrynMcCoy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zlehi/my_great_grandfather_used_to_work_with_dr_josef/,"Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zdxs5/my_great_grandfather_used_to_work_with_dr_josef/

When I first found the journals I figured I would just put them aside and let them be forgotten just the way they were over the last 70 years. But then I started reading. I know my close family does not want to know anything about it. They never talked about the past and I am pretty sure they would not start now. All I knew about my great-grandfather until today was, that he was a medical student that was working with a Doctor during WW2 and that he later became a Doctor himself. Born in 1914 and raised in Leipzig, he met his wife during high school and married in 1933. He was called into the military during his medical studies in 1939 or 1940, and was assigned to a doctor some time later, who employed him for his researches. That is all I know so far. He had 6 children with his wife, my great-grandmother, the youngest child was my grandfather on my father's side, born in 1949. My great-grandfather died in 1972. He was 58 years old and nobody is talking about how he died.

I will try to find out more about him and his career, but at the moment nobody wants to talk about it, because the funeral of my uncle is imminent and there is a very tense mood in my wing of the family. We all know we are expected to attend the uncle's funeral, but no one really wants to. His cremation was yesterday, now it is time to find a date when the family comes together, but since my cousin is still in the hospital (he had an accident the day my uncle died and did not wake up yet) everyone is waiting until he can attend the funeral. Apparently he and my uncle were pretty close.
But enough about me, here are the next pages from the journal:

.............................................................................................

August 6th 1944

I do not know how I managed it, but I could convince the doctor not to place the two girls in one of the barracks where the other children are housed. I told him they needed to be examined first, that they were too thin, too weak for the operation, and he finally agreed that we should place them in the room where the boy and the dog were housed and also to provide them with extra rations of food and medicines for the time being. Fortunately, the doctor had made sure that the boy's and the dog's bodies were taken away before the girls came into the room - but I doubt that he was avoiding to traumatize the children. It was only to make sure they were not seen or found, so he had them wrapped in sheets and buried with the other dead somewhere. The doctor has to return to Theresienstadt tomorrow and that gives me time. The girls can not end up like the boy and the dog. I have to think about something, but I do not know how I can help them. How can I get time? How can I delay the experiment without the doctor noticing?

August 7th 1944

I have a sleepless night behind me. The two girls ... they remind me so much of my own little daughter, Adelheid. She is just a little younger than the two, but I would never forgive myself if something happened to her. Just because of my family, I was here at all. I had just completed an internship at the Kinderklinik of the University of Leipzig, when I was ordered to Frankfurt. A Doctor wanted to get to know me. What looked like a normal procedure for me first, became a nightmare very soon. I first worked as an assistant. Not much to do really, just monitoring patients and taking care of the Doctors schedule. But things turned to become worse soon. My wife Marta was pregnant with our third child, Reinhard, and a few weeks before giving birth, I was told that my family would be deported, if I should not be willing to give my support to the Doctor in his research. Yes, this is how they put it: ""Give my support.""

I knew that Marta's grandmother was from Romania, that never was a secret. But Matha's mother and father were born and raised in Germany and so was Marta, so we never expected her to not be a „pure-bred“ how the Doctor sometimes used to call it. But for the SS it was enough to blackmail me. Either I help the Doctor, or my family will be deported and killed. Did I have a choice?

August 8th 1944

The Doctor went back to Theresienstadt and that gives me a little bit of time to think. How can I protect the little girls? I know I should not even think about it. Or write about it. What if someone finds my journal? Right now I keep it hidden in the room I sleep in at the camp's clinic. There is a secret pocket in my suitcase where I keep my journal and the letters Marta is writing me every once in a while. She does not send them to the camp, but to a small bakery in Oświęcim. Whenever I am allowed to leave the camp I visit the old man running the bakery and collect my letters and give him money and my letters he then sends to Marta. Oh Marta, my Marta! Light of my life, love of my life, my good soul, my beauty.

How could this all get so far? How could I become a monster? How could I agree to participate in all this? Why did we not leave the country and ran when we still had the opportunity to do so? We were once so happy, remember? When we first met – me a boy of 17 years, you a girl of 15. I knew the moment I saw you, that I loved you. And you loved me – right? You love me and you know that I am doing all this to make sure you are safe. You and the children. Horst, Wolfgang, Reinhard, Adelheid and the one you still carry inside of you. All I want is to keep you alive as long as this terrible mess is going on. And afterwards, when all this is over, we will leave Germany and go somewhere else. Somewhere we can life in peace. Somewhere safe.

But what am I gonna do with the girls? If only I could save these two, it would be so much. Yes, I know I can not save everyone. But two little girls, two lives, if I save them, perhaps I will be forgiven what I have done to all the others? The images of what the doctor and I have done in the past years haunt me in my dreams. We have done terrible things to people. Innocent people. Children. Women. Elderly. So many men and women, so many lives, so many souls. And I am guilty. I did it. I gave syringes and infusions and pills and treatments with substances, of which I myself did not know what they were going to do, and what the doctor had mixed into. I've been watching how people were treated like test rabbits. I have watched it and I have done nothing. I'm a coward and a monster. But if I can save these two little girls, if something comes to mind, something that will save them or at least not kill them, maybe I can forgive myself what I've done?

August 10th 1944

The Doctor is supposed to be back in 3 days, so I need to come up with something. Something that will delay the experiment but will also please the Doctor. I went to the girls several times. They are scared, but they eat and drink and they seem to be getting better. I ordered pain medicin, it is supposed to be delivered any day soon. At least I can make sure they will not suffer too much pain when the Doctor comes back and starts testing them. I will mix it in their food, even though this makes it more dangerous for me.

At the moment, I'm considering what tests can be done on girls that do not harm them and do not cause them any pain. Recognizing colors? Feed one with meat and the other with vegetables? A daily bath for one and shower the other only once every other day? I have the possibilities. I can order extra rations of food and I can order medication. But I have to find something that interests the doctor and keeps him interested. I will not be able to keep him from his plan of carrying out the same operation as the poor little boy and the dog went through. But perhaps I can convince him that we are doing other experiments with them beforehand. Give the girls a bit more time, and perhaps the war ends before the doctor can plan and carry out the operation?

August 13th 1944

I came up with a plan that might work. We will teach them. Teach one girl writing and reading and the other one counting and calculating. That will not only give me time, it will also give the Doctor something he loves: the opportunity to observe. Since the girls never went to school before and never learned reading, writing or counting, it seems perfect. We will school them separately and then see who learns faster: the one learning to read and write or the one learning to count and calculate. The Doctor was a little surprised when I explained my very own experiment to him, but the more I told him about it, the more he got interested. But there is a catch: Since they need to be schooled separately, we need teachers. Non of us has the time to do so. So I came up with the plan to look for two teachers in the camp. The Doctor thought about it for a while, then smiled and agreed. And told me to go and find two.

That was not what I expected and not what I wanted. I always avoid the barracks where all those poor souls are housed. I avoid to go anywhere around the camp aside the clinic, the barrack I sleep at and the cafeteria. It is heartbreaking to see those children, women and men, barely alive, sick and still trying to survive the nightmare they never volunteered to attend. It's a horrible place. Since I knew that no is not an answer to the Doctor, I went out of the clinic and to the barracks. Like I wrote earlier, I avoided them as much as possible and so I was not prepared for what was waiting for me when I came closer. The smell was the worst thing I ever smelled in my life.

A mixture of sweat, blood, pus, urine, and excrements lay so thick in the air that I could barely breathe. The barrack I was reluctantly moving forward to was one of the women's barracks. When they saw me, they pushed apart like a swarm of flies. I knew what they thought: when someone came from the Medical Clinic, it could only mean one thing: death. I would take them with me, the sick and the old and the ones not looking like they will live any longer and they would not see the end of the day. I could feel the fear in the air. I waited a couple of minutes in front of the barrack before I entered. There they were, about 50 women, skinny, just skin and bones, weak, so sick and so tired. Sitting on the beds, they smoothed their clothes, tried to smile, tried to look healthy, young, and fresh. They did not want to look sick, they did not want to make the impression that they could not work anymore. They did not want to die because they seemed useless.

I felt sick to my stomach. I heared about it before. The doctor had told me how they tried to look healthy and fresh. How they stuck their fingers with needles and blades, hardly trying to harvest a drop of blood from their dried-out veins to color their cheeks and lips so that they looked pink and healthy. It was about survival and they knew it. And there I was, the enemy, the monster, the evil. I'd tear one of them out of their midst, I'd take one away and they'd never come back, they knew. I could read it in their eyes. Each one of them held their breath when I finally began to speak.
""I need two women who can read and write, count and calculate. They will work as teachers in the clinic, they will live and sleep there, and they will eat and work there. They will not return to this barrack. What they own, they need to take with them into the clinic.“ As soon as I said that, I realized how this must have sounded. Go to the clinic, take everything with you, never come back. I was not surprised that nobody came forward. But the Doctor was waiting, so I did what every monster would do: I pointed at two random faces and ordered them to pack their belongings and follow me. I felt too sick to stay at this place any longer.

I got clean clothes for the women and tonight they got real food for the first time in months. Not this watery, diluted soup, which they serve in the barracks. Real food. Potatoes, carrots and a slice of cooked pork. I've never seen anyone eat a potato so slowly. Franziska seemed to celebrate the meal every single second. Clara, however, ate as if there was no tomorrow and when her plate was empty and I asked her if she wanted some more, she burst into tears. They are so skinny. I wonder how they managed to stay alive that long.

August 15th 1944

Bringing the two women to the girls had an effect on the girls I had not expected. They began to speak. So far, everything we got out of them were their names: Sarah and Monika. But now the two women came in and the girls began to speak. To my surprise, they spoke German. And they began to answer questions, but only as long as the doctor was not around. As soon as he came closer, they were mute as fish and so were the women.

Their names are Franziska and Clara and they both are from Dresden. They came to the camp about 6 month ago, they could not say exactly. Franziska is 28 and worked as a Librarian in Dresden before she was deported directly from her work. She has no idea where her little son and her husband are. She hopes they managed to escape and hide with her husbands family in Pirna. Franziska used to sneak books to some Jews still hiding in Dresden. One of the „good“ people she trusted was the one who turned her in. Clara is only 19. She worked as a maid in a hotel in Dresden when she was deported. She was not deported because she was not aryan, she was deported because she was seen with a married man dancing in the hotel one night. I am preparing the schedule for schooling the girls tonight, so the experiment can start by tomorrow and the Doctor will be satisfied.

August 25th 1944

Schooling the girls works good so far. They learn fast. The doctor is satisfied with the results, even if the girls do not answer him when he asks questions. They answer me and they answer the women who teach them. The doctor seems to be satisfied at the moment, but in recent days he has concentrated more on his studies on syphilis. As he told me, he has infected two groups of prisoners some weeks ago and was now treating one group with a chemical mixture and the other group with tablets made of small doses of rat poisoning and flour. The ones treated with the poisoned flour tablets seemed to slowly loose their minds. They were hallucinating and showed signs of dementia. The others were in constant pain all day and night, begging the soldiers to kill them. The glitter in his eyes, when he told me this, turned my stomach around and I just managed to run to the bathroom right before I threw up.

August 26th 1944

Oh this smile. It's haunting me. Whenever the Doctor has an idea, he smiles this creepy smile. I can not descripe it. It is as if he lost his mind and is absolutly sincere at the same time. He smiles when he talks about his experiments. He smiles when he talks to patients even though he knows they will not wake up the next day. He smiles when he takes his notes. He smiles when he talkes about his researches. This horrible, crazy smile.

August 29th 1944

I had some time to talk to the girls this morning. They are from a small town called Leinburg near Nürnberg. They have two older brothers. Their father owned a small grocery store in their hometown before he had to close it. He and the brothers managed to run, but the girls and their mother were brought to Theresienstadt. The mother died soon after arriving. This is heartbreaking. Imagining how these two little girls once ran around their fathers store, playing in the green fields surrounding their home town, having not a single thing to worry about in their lives - and now seeing them being cowering on the ground, clenched together, with fear in their eyes ... I wish I could reunite them with their father, but I have no idea how.

September 4th 1944

Something went wrong. Terribly wrong. I don't know what happened, but when I came to the clinic this morning, the girls were terrified and the women were missing. I later learned from one of the nurses, that the Doctor got mad about something and ordered the women to the yard at 4 am this morning where they were shot. I have no idea why he did that. Franziska and Clara are dead. This is all my fault. I came up with this stupid plan. I went to the barracks. I ordered them to come with me. I am responsible for their deaths. I was the one who chose them. They could still be alive if I would not have taken them to the clinic. I am scared and shaking.

September 5th 1944

The Doctor wants the girls to be prepared for surgery tonight at 8 pm.

..............................................................................................

I need to stop here, reading and translating is exhausting and I still have to clean out so many things in my uncles house. All these old books and maps and drawings, plus all the stuff he stored in the attic. So many boxes full of old things and time is running. I did not have the time to look through all the stuff and it is getting late. I planned to be finished by the end of the week but the journals distracted me. There are still a few pages in this one and then there are two more journals, which I have not yet looked at. The heating turned off an hour ago and I don't know what makes me shiver more: the cold in the house or the things I just learned from the journal. I will get back to you as soon as possible!

I am currently a sophomore at a well respected University on the East Coast. Over the past few months, I have applied to many, many internship positions in either the Marketing, Sales, or Communications departments. Most companies I applied to are in the consumer product field, as my major is Food/Consumer Marketing.

Along with applying to the positions, I have reached out directly to Talent Acquisition managers, HR reps, and prior business connections in order to personally introduce myself. Many times I have been praised for showing ""enthusiastic"" effort, etc. Out of this, I have only been given the opportunity of a few phone interviews, and one real Skype interview with a brand manager, VP of Marketing, and HR rep.

Now, my problem is, I feel like I have no credentials. Being a 19 year old kid, my previous jobs include coaching, Golf Caddy, Camp Counselor... etc. On top of that, my GPA is slightly below a 3.0 .

So what am I missing? What am I doing wrong? I am becoming extremely aggravated with this process, as no results have came."

I am a third year CS student who has recently accepted a really good internship opportunity over the summer. I will be working in the Data Tech department of this company and in a conversation with the reps there I found out that I will likely be working with Hadoop or Spark or some other big data framework, along with Java. 

I am very familiar with Java and have the basic college background in databases (MySQL/PHP). As far as big data goes, I have no idea where to begin. I definitely want to get my feet wet with these frameworks before I start my internship. Could anyone point me to some good tutorials/insight, or even better, suggest an example of a small project I could develop to work on my datatech skills?"

I'm still going to minor in CS, so at least I have that going for me.

However, I have never had an internship or job relevant to either CS or Communications. I also had some untreated mental health problems, got expelled for bad grades, went to community college, got back in on academic probation, and had to raise my grades while majoring in a difficult field I had no passion for, so I haven't had the time and resources to focus on internships/jobs/extracurriculars for the first ~2 years of school.

I'm in a much better place now, but I'm really scared because I feel *so* behind and Communications is so competitive. I joined some Communications clubs and teach myself web development in my free time but idk what else to do. 

I'm applying to summer internships. How do I explain my situation to employers so that they don't think I've been lazy all these years? Would it be an advantage or a disadvantage if I inform them of how recently I switched majors?

I appreciate any advice."

5zlp2f,1,2017-03-15,"I got selected to be an officer in the USN. Do I accept, or stick with my civilian life?",fresch_one,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5zlp2f/i_got_selected_to_be_an_officer_in_the_usn_do_i/,"A little more background. Last March I moved back to my home state with the intentions of beginning the application process to become an officer in the Navy. I graduated college in 2015, spent a year doing internships, and come from a very large military family. Before finishing my internship, I spoke with my dad and decided it'd be a good idea to apply for OCS. I met with a recruiter, and he informed me that the process is lengthy (he wasn't kidding; I just found out yesterday that I was selected. One year later). 
I applied to two positions: Supply and Surface Warfare. In the meantime, I got a joke job (not trying to sound mean. But I didn't get a job I wanted to make a career out of because I wasn't sure if I'd be leaving in 6-12 months.) 
The board only meets a couple of times a year, which is why the process takes so long. And the selection rate is very competitive. In November my recruiter called and told me I hadn't been selected for Supply. To be honest, I was expecting those results because I didn't feel as qualified as some of the other candidates. 
He told me the SWO board met again in February, so we would go from there. At this point, I decided to move forward with my life. When I moved back, I began seeing this guy, and he knew I was applying for OCS, so we didn't expect things to get serious. However, they did, and we are moving in together in June. 
I ended up quitting my old job because I found one utilizing my degree, better pay, benefits, closer commute, and all around better. The last place I worked was toxic and there was no room for growth. 
Now that I found out I was selected for OCS, I'm having second thoughts about the Navy. Before November happened, I was passionate about joining. But then when I wasn't selected, my boyfriend said that he would never make me decide him over my career, but he didn't think we could make it work if I joined. He's currently deployed and in the Air Force, so he said we wouldn't be stationed at the same base most likely. (He's gone Feb till June) He's never been a dick about it, and he made this point before we got serious, as well.  
I don't want people to think I'm staying behind solely for him. But I am truly happy in the civilian world. My relationship is going well, I have a decent job which might lead to a career, and my student loans will be paid off in 4 years time, when I am 28. 
My dad is upset. He says I need to focus on my future, and that a relationship is not the reason to stay. I could pay off my loans in one year if I did the military route, have a gov't position under my belt, and leadership experience. 
Am I being foolish? I've made a pros and cons list. But I'd like unbiased advice. "
5zlsoa,2,2017-03-15,Changing careers to web development.,OrbitalOx,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5zlsoa/changing_careers_to_web_development/,"Hey everyone, long post warning. TLDR at the end if you don't wanna waste time on the context.

I am currently a staff accountant and have been in my position for a little over a year after having two separate tax internships. I am finishing up my masters in accounting but I'm really not happy in my career. I love the firm I work for which is a huge part of why I'm still in accounting because I really don't like the work. I pretty much dread the actual work I do every single day and the hours are insane (at least right now.)

I have always loved everything to do with computers and have messed with coding a little bit on my phone in the past (jailbreaking and rooting) but nothing too serious. Web Development has always interested me and about two weeks ago I decided I was going to take the plunge and teach myself HTML, CSS, and Java after my girlfriend got me some books for my birthday since she knows how much I've been wanting to learn but haven't actually started. So far I have put a few hours everyday into learning the basics and have absolutely loved it. I really like seeing my progress and actually having a visual output of something that I created and problem solving/figuring out all the different ways to do something. As of right now I think I want to try to switch to a career in Web Development but there is some hesitation. (I also want to be able to travel and work remotely/move around the country, which my current job doesn't allow for.)

My main question is, what does a career in Web Development look like in the long run? In accounting you can rise really far up the ladder but it takes a long time and then once you're at the 'top' you just stay there until you retire. I'm just afraid that if I make the switch it may not be a career that lasts as long as accounting would. I know I'm just being naive but it seems that, on average, individuals in web development are much younger than the average age in accounting.

I know I'm probably just over thinking this and I should do what I feel is right, which is making the switch, but it's a huge decision after the amount of money and time I've put into getting into my current career. 

Any advice or stories would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

I have been involved in this venture for close to two years now, but things have stalled completely due to serious issues with my co-founder. I have pulled out of this company. This venture was completely self-funded by my partner and me.

Note - Never made any money. The website was live for a very short period of time and had to close operations till we resolved our differences, which we didn't.

EDIT - Have all the documentation in place to prove this was a legit business and not a fly by night operation. Bank affidavits, commercial registration papers, partnership deeds etc. 

(1.3 years) Relationship Officer/ Financial Advisor at a large bank  - Again was based out of the Middle East. Focused exclusively on retail products like SIP, insurance plans, deposits etc. Built and managed a portfolio of about USD 300,000. I was at this job for 1.3 years. Really wasn’t much to learn after a while as the product portfolio was very limited. Wanted to shift to private banking which would have been more challenging, but manager told me straight up there are more qualified people (the bank has 100,000+ employees overall).

Note - I had been considering going out on my own for a while. I had a very serious discussion with a senior manager who happened to be a good friend of mine. He told me upfront that I shouldn’t have any hopes of rising up in the bank, regardless of my performance, because the bench strength meant there is always someone more qualified.

I can get an excellent reference from this bank. 

(9 months) Research Analyst at a domain parking and monetization company. Left the job to pursue my Master’s degree. 

Extracurriculars -

None as of now as I spent the last two years completely devoted to my business. However, over the last 6 months I have taken an active interest in my health, fitness and performance. 

My mom is a qualified yoga instructor and I was practicing for a very long time, if required, I can take a course and become a certified instructor. Similarly, I have been training myself for the past 6 months, but can take a physical trainer’s course for knowledge and certification if required. 

THE PROBLEM

I will be 31 in July and realistically have 4-5 years of solid experience behind me. Unfortunately,  I dropped out of college for about 3 years before I completed my Bachelor’s, being clueless about where I was going in life. I did odd jobs to sustain myself - nothing of note - event management, store keeper etc. This part sucks and will be the most difficult part to address, however, I did it for my Master’s earlier and can do it again for MBA.

Goal of MBA

I want to transition into Finance. Not interested in investment banking - but think large family offices, sovereign wealth funds, alternative asset management firms, maybe PEs and hedge funds if I can break in (I’m very aware that my chances are slim here without IB background)

Target Schools 

I’m only looking at schools in Europe. I don’t have much interest in living/working in the US. 
How much of a chance do I stand to get into LBS, INSEAD, HEC, IE etc. if I apply after a year (assuming I get a year of great experience at the aforementioned Big 4/wealth fund and crack 700 at GMAT)? How are employers in my targeted industry likely to look at me as a 33 year old MBA graduate? Do I realistically have a chance of breaking into Finance at that age, given my background?

Any kind of feedback is welcome. Thanks! :)"

What would you change now,ExplitPlayer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5zo2yd/restarting_mechanical_engineer_degree_what_would/,"I started off about two years ago as a Mechanical Engineering student, yet a combination of a few distractions, and being fresh out of high school and jumping into college and new math (which I wasn't the best at and continue to struggle somewhat) made me modify my decision and switch around to a few different majors over the year and a half. Just testing the waters. Well I'm back to Mechanical because I just couldn't shake the thought that my career wasn't going to be what I've always dreamed of. So I'm locked down on it now. So there's that. 

I'm going to try harder, as I flunked out of Pre-Calc 1 (accelerated) my first time in the program, because I panicked and gave up, and also don't have the greatest math background. 
-Don't bother with the ""If you aren't good at math then don't become one"" 
I'm going to get through it. It's determination that'll get me where I want to be-

Now I'm back in the program, I've been staying after class and coming in early and getting help, I beat it out with a B in accelerated Pre-Calc 1, and now I'm in the accelerated Pre-Calc 2 course, struggling like I expect to.. but hey, I'll get over it. 

Then I start back into my regularly scheduled program minus a few core classes. So I'll have a bit more time to focus on math and science. 

I'll have 4 more semesters in my community college, and then 2 years at a University. 

My question to all of you guys and gals, is:

What would you do different now that you're further along the path and looking at internships /applying?

What classes sucked and what classes were awesome?

Do you wish you took more extracurricular activities?

-Which ones did you take?

What was your average nightly study time (hrs)?



Just give me anything. I've never really spoke to anyone about any of this. I'm very curious and excited to hear any feedback and responses. I'm also wanting to be the best engineer I can be, I just want a good foundation while it's early and I can mold it into something great..

Also, just to throw it in, any Math study tips for the mathematically impaired would be appreciated. 

Thanks guys!

Hi everyone, I've been thinking a lot lately about how to structure my thoughts and deliver it in the most honest and humble manner to justify why I gave up a chance in becoming a military pilot.

Background
I've always wanted to be a pilot, but an airline pilot over a military pilot. But from where I come from, it's common for everyone who wants to be a pilot to apply to the military first. But for me, I do love the notion of flight but my early encounters with flight were with the large jets ferrying passengers around. 

So, over a long period, I just simply desire to fly the passenger jets. I remember having the chance to fly a full motion 747 simulator at 19 years old, and when it 'lift-off'... That was pure ecstacy. It just made my desire to command one stronger by the day. With that I would work hard and save so that I could buy an air ticket to return to that country and fly the simulator every year.

Military flying is as brilliant, that's where the real flying is done. So for 3 years I had been trying to enter the military only to end up calling them up to inform them that I cannot do it. I just need to be with the passenger jets and at that point of time, I didn't want to deprive others who genuinely want to be a military pilot of a chance. I hear stories of how people my age being airline pilots and I envy them so much.

So now I grapple to seek wisdom on how best to convince and justify my reason for not pursing a military career, since most of the pilots are from the military. Sometimes I feel that I shot myself in the foot, but then again, I'm just that in a relationship with commercial aviation. 

My first part-time job was at the airport as a security screening agent, the best birthday gift when I turned 17 after being issued my screening license.  I got to see airline pilots day in day out and I loved my job. Then I moved on to intern for an airline for half a year and it brought me even closer to the passenger jets! I frequent the flight deck on the job and often get the chance to walk around the tarmac too. 

I'd love to hear your opinions on whether what I did (by closing the door to military aviation) was justified in the eyes of the veterans, and how best can one honestly express the desire to fly passenger jets over military jets, without offending the veterans? I don't want to come off as an arrogant prick who never even bothered with the military, and I experienced first hand how detrimental it was to my flying dream; I never made it through PPL interviews when I was 16 and 2 years later, I tried again but they refused no matter how hard I begged them. 

Humility surely goes a long way...

My plan is to build the game with a top-down view , but to better visualize it, i want to start the animations to see if there is any issues of perspectives , if top-down it's gonna fit my game or if I have to change. I have a pretty clear image in my head of how the game should look like , just wanna achieve it.

I did a mini course in middle-school where we used adobe flash(it was a good time ago). Now I discovered that flash became Animate, and I saw some posts of companies that use adobe animate, and also one of my best game that I've played still uses animate [Dofus MMORPG] (http://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/classes/8-iop).

So I wanna know where to start , wanna know if there is any code course, book or other material, or if there is a more suitable program to work with unity. Need to learn some theories about design and stuff like that.

Could you guys give perspectives on what I should consider making this decision? Also, how strong is the tech department at g company in Tokyo? Anyone has past internship experience there?


Here are some of the advantages of each choice in my opinion. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

g company: look better on resume, cooler project, international experience, it's g

v company: Silicon Valley experience (I've never been there), gain more connections (?), learn more about tech industry

Every opinion is appreciated. Thanks!"

5zrlyf,3,2017-03-16,I'm on a graduate program and my advisor is not being totally honest about the distribution of internship resources,mvpetri,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5zrlyf/im_on_a_graduate_program_and_my_advisor_is_not/,"I'm just starting my doctorate and I joined a lab to work. I'll not have a job because I want to dedicate entirely to my project. So I applied for a doctoral internship.

In my country we gave 3 types of internship available nationally (there are some others, but I'm not considering those). Let's call them type A, B and C. A being the best and C being the worst in terms of remuneration.

My university can give type B and C. And they got me B.

But the best type (A) has a different way apply. They are given if you submit your project directly to the agency or if the professor received some quota to distribute as they want. This is the case: my professor has some available to him.

When I joined the team I asked him about these internships and he said that it wasn't so easy to give them to students, because the agency is very strict about it. Usually the students shouldn't have had any failures while undergrads, have good grades, good CV and all of that... which I didn't had so much. So I understand that it isn't that easy to get if I submit my project and CV.

But this is not 100% true. My professor can give, if he wants, to any student he wants. He just have to indicate the student to the agency directly.

So talking to him and to others I realized this: He would like to give the internship to someone with a better CV, but he is telling me that the agency wouldn't accept it and he can't do much. Currently he doesn't have any student for this particular internship (all the others already have one) so he will hold it until another student can enter the lab. And this puts me in a bad position to try to negotiate with him. All other students already have it and the newer students are starting their master's degree and I'm the only new phd student. I'm unable to use this as a leverage because ""the agency won't accept it...""

And not only that, I don't want this situation to happen again. I'll work with him for 5 to 6 years. He will have decisions that goes against what I think would be right. But he have to trust that I'll understand and respect his position. If he has a decision that I don't agree, I want him to treat me like a professional and not say that the responsibility is not his. I wasn't the best student, but I'm a good professional. I know how to separate things and accept decisions that are against my interest.

What can I say to direct him in this way? Or even to make him rethink his decision?"

Problem is I was only able to respond to them late in the afternoon so likely no one saw it until Monday. I gave some other times I was available and yet its almost been a week and I haven't heard from them. The time they suggested is on the 28th so I thought we'd have to sort that out well before then.

Did I screw over my chances entirely by sending the email too late? Should I send an email to see if they're still interested? The internship does have multiple positions so it might take a bit longer to sort through, but you'd think they'd send at least a response.

Should I proceed with caution and switch it something safer (and potentially more boring) or keep going with this? There is already a lot of talks about women in technology, but mine seems to hit some boundaries from the feedback I've received. It does criticize the larger tech companies (with public data they have posted on their own sites) so I'm nervous if I want a job down the road for X company that this could potentially cost me my career.

I have also been attending a program at my university that utilizes graduate-level psychology students as interns to help other students. The program itself is very similar to therapy with a targeted goal of helping the attendee develop skills &amp; positive habits to succeed in school and life. The program has been literally the best help I have ever had throughout my life, even better than professional therapy with reconsidering (after my diagnosis) and developing skills, habits and coping mechanisms for how my lifestyle has changed due to having an actual understanding of my mental health.

One thing that I have noticed but have not sat down to think/talk about is how my mood significantly depresses during my drive home from work or school. Normally when I am at school, I have learned how to be productive and adjust my behavior and mood to suit what I need or want to do. There are times where I can work on tasks, be productive and then head home and continue being productive. Most of the time however, I start my commute home (usually listening to music that tends to help keep me productive) ready to go home and work on housework, projects, homework, etc, however by the time I get home my mood has lost most of its potency towards productivity. This generally leads me to not complete the things I had planned for that evening, or have a very hard time doing them, which I know is typical for an ADHDer.

I am looking for advice on how to manage this, whether it be rejuvenating it when it get home, maintaining it during the drive, or relax in a way I can regain the productive mood, etc.

Thanks for anyone who read through all of this!"

I figured out late in my undergrad that I REALLY wanted to become a Software Developer and I was able to finish my BS and Minor in 4.5 years and I even secured a tech related internship for a very well known company last summer doing front-end work. 

I have been doing everything possible to make myself as marketable as possible for an entry level developer position such as creating a side project, having a tech related internship, and learning about the newest technologies (Javascript frameworks and runtimes, non-relational databases, IOS and Android app development, etc.). 


I feel that at some point I need to go back to college to get a second bachelors and eventually a Masters in Computer Science if I really want to be successful as a developer. My plan is to get an entry level developer position, and while working I would go back to college to finish my second Bachelors simultaneously. 

I have had no luck securing a junior developer position as of now so I am wondering if there is there any hope in that goal, or should I take a Finance position that I would not be crazy about and go to school from there? Are bootcamps a better option for me? I can attach my resume if that will help. 

The courses I have already taken for my minor are Computer Programming I &amp; II(Python &amp; Java), Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization and Assembly(MIPS), Database Concepts(MySQL and PHP), Discrete Math. Plus I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!

Over the course of the internship, I'll make ~$15,000, more money than I've ever been close to in my life. I could commute from home (about an hour, maybe slightly more, train ride from the suburbs) or pay for an apartment in the city close to my job (would cost about $3500 to be close to my job as its an expensive area and summer leases are tough and that doesn't factor in the cost of food). I think that being in the city for the summer would be an amazing and fun immersive experience but I would also save a lot by staying home. In the long run, I don't think the extra money will do much for me but I could probably do something cool with it too, like go on a trip, begin investing, eat nicer food, etc. Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts.

I applied for 13 school:
• MIT - deferred EA, rejected RD
• Oxford - got my interview, rejected lolll (the interview was HORRIBLE)
• Imperial - unconditional for 4 yr-MEng
• UIUC - accepted EA
• U Manchester - unconditional for 4 yr-MEng
• Georgia Tech - deferred EA, accepted RD
• Penn State - accepted
Still waiting to hear back from ...
• Columbia
• UPenn
• UofT
• UC Berkeley
• UCLA
• UMich - deferred EA

While I would probably hear back from all the schools by Apr. 1 (maybe except UMich and UofT), I would like to consider where to attend for undergrad/grad for Materials Science and Engineering.

In general, in the US and Canada:
• I can make more connections through clubs, etc. And can potentially get a job after graduation
• Math competitions such as Putnam
• Greek life
• Larger campus and more people (more friends options lol)
• GenEd (not a history person at all, so I'd prefer the UK system here)
• Many on and off-campus research internship opportunities

In the UK:
• Fortunately I won't have Trump for president (I'm not a US citizen but I do have a very strong political preference)
• 4 yrs for an MEng instead of 6 yrs in the US (save time &amp; $$$)
• Very focused curriculum
• Fixed schedule (packed w/ lectures and labs) thus not that much free-time
• Difficult to stay in the UK after graduation (though PhD at MIT for Materials sounds amazing, but I'm not sure I want to go into pure academic research)
• Not quite strong in terms of UG research and not a lot of research internship opportunities (PLS CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG)
• Easy to travel to Europe (I've been wanting to visit French)

Regarding each college,
• Manchester is the home for graphene - one of my fav materials. But not very strong academically and is located in a very industrial city (ugh)
• Imperial has a high ranking (but not necessarily very recognized in the US to my knowledge) and is located in London. Imperial also has UROP (s/o to imperial!!)
• UIUC - forget about it, I'm not going there
• GT is very strong in engineering; but prob not attending bc of its location
• Penn State is a big school, more like a party school which would be fun to experience; but its location would not be ideal for me personally

Basically, these are just some of my thoughts.
Please give me some advice on this (US or UK? which school? why?). I'll update my upcoming college decisions so I can look at the big picture and decide where I want to attend.

You hear people tell you that you'll be fine and that you've got it easy since CS is such a hot field to be in and that there's nothing to worry about, but I am definitely worrying.

I guess what I'm asking is whether getting 0 contact back from 20 or so applications is normal. It's demoralizing and I hope I'm not the only one."

I've studied programming for about 3 years now (Mostly Java and JavaScript) and feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of at least the basics and concepts. It's important to note that although I have 3 years experience I would say that it's a lot less as it's only on and off college projects and not something that I'm doing day in day out.

A few months ago, I started an Internship in a small software development company that suited me pretty well primarily using Groovy and JavaScript. My problem is that I feel like I'm really far behind everyone else (That includes interns) and everyone seems to have a much better understanding of when to use certain concepts.

An example would be with concepts like inheritance and using it in practice, yes I understand what it is but I've never thought to myself when implementing a solution 'Hey, inheritance would be useful here'. There's also concepts that I never knew existed which when told make everything so much easier, but I want to get to the point where I am the one who is realising that Java has something cool that could be used here and stuff like that. 

I don't know if I've made myself very clear here to be honest and don't know if there's an actual answer besides practice but nonetheless is there something I'm missing or somewhere I can practice this sort of stuff? I can link my github if that would help get an understanding of where I'm at. If I've left out anything important, please just let me know.

Because I would prefer to work at the company as the analyst, what would be future positions that I could hold if I were trying to advance in my career?"
601ppb,2,2017-03-17,[USA] College student looking for durable laptop for up to $750,fingwalkingparadox,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/601ppb/usa_college_student_looking_for_durable_laptop/,"* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
USA; ideally around $600-$700.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Top priority is durability.  Second is weight. Speed an specs are third. Fourth priority is privacy and security. I rarely use my 2-1 now but it would be nice.

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Pretty important. It doesn't have to be ultra light-weight but I don't want something that is a hassle to lug around, it will be in a backpack throughout the day. I love how light my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro is but I would be okay with something heavier if it meant it had better performance/durability. 

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows, but Linux seems really fascinating. It's not a deal breaker but I would like to option to one day give it a try.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
13.3 at the smallest. I could go smaller if absolutely necessary but I would really prefer something a larger, this functions as my TV half the time.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Not really. Just Bloomberg Anywhere and other finance/business applications in the future. Right now just basics like Netflix, Microsoft Office, internet browsing ect.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
If I could run Civ V or Civ VI I would be pumped but it's not really a factor in my decision. 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Durability and build quality is important. I would prefer a touch screen.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I will bring this everywhere with me; I am constantly on the go. I am a college student so Microsoft Office, Netflix and internet will be 90% of its use. I want this to last my last 2 years of college, possibly into my professional life. I would like to avoid buying a new one after graduation but IDK what my future employer's demands will be so this might not be a huge concern. If trying to factor that in makes this too complicated then fuck it. Hell, who knows what will be considered secure and strong enough for business/finance stuff in 3 years. Ideally I would like something with strong privacy but with the USA's surveillance I don't know if that is even possible. I would like something secure enough to handle things that may be confidential in internships. I'll make a table to clarify all of this info.

Top Priorities| High Priorities| Wanted but not a dealbreaker
:--|:--|:--
Durability, reliability, not heavy and at least kind of easy to carry, Specs, Speed| Security and Privacy| Will be able to handle business applications, nice screen for Netflix, touch screen, Graphics, Civ V 



**Edit:** My college does free repairs on Dell so that would be nice but its not necessary. "

So far, I've focused on mainly computer science classes and so I was looking to get another computer science internship like I did last year. However, because I didn't want to stress myself out by applying to a lot of internships around this time like last year, I applied to a bunch of internship positions around December/January.

Unfortunately, this has led me to a situation that I'm not exactly sure how I should go forward with, and would like some advice in.

--

I currently have an offer on the table. However, because I don't have access to a car, I am limited to public transportation, and as a result it's going to be a 2.5-3hr commute one way from my house to the location of the internship instead of a .45-1hr commute by car. The offer letter has stated to respond by March 20th, which is the root cause of most of my issues.

My #1 choice, which is only a 45 minute commute via public transportation, has not gotten back to me with an offer or anything. However, I have asked them to please give me an update by the 20th (as they said to do in their application confirmation letter) which they said they would try to do but it is not guaranteed, and am hoping that I get an offer letter from them sometime over the weekend (not likely) or on the 20th. 

I also have a position that I am currently in the technical test portion of. However, judging from reading the instructions alone, I don't have the current knowledge to do most of it, but I do think that if I work really hard over the time I'm given and Google a lot of stuff, I should be able to finish at least half of it.

--

I've pretty much given up on anyone else contacting me about an internship, as it's been quite a while since my application date. Also, when trying to figure out what I should do, I'm trying to play it safe and assume that my #1 choice would not extend me the offer by the 20th, even though I really hope they do. 

So, I have been contemplating a lot of things, like should I take the first offer? Should I decline it and just work 24/7 on the technical test and pray that I finish enough to be offered a position? Should I just give up on my current stuff and start another desperation burst of spreading my resume to every single internship position there is? 

If anyone could give some advice as to what I should do, it would be appreciated!"

I wanted some more experience before I graduate, as well as some savings for moving, so I got an internship at a startup in town. They give me more or less full-time work, and treat me like a new grad, rather than as an intern, which I like. The work is interesting, and the culture is great.

However, I accepted an offer which I greatly prefer over the startup, a bit before I joined. I never told them that I wanted a conversion to full time, but my boss and team lead, and the seniors are talking as if I'm going to convert to full time (and it seems the process is more or less that I can be full time whenever. There's no official offer).

I'm not sure what to do when I graduate, because my job doesn't start until mid-August, but I graduate in May. I don't want to burn bridges by going full-time, and then leaving in 2-3 months, but at the same time, I want more experience, and I want to help the startup. 

What's the best thing to do to not burn bridges?
I am definitely going to my offer I already accepted, I just don't know how to handle the startup after I graduate.

Edit: My fear is that if I put them on my resume, they will badmouth me if I handle this incorrectly. I definitely want them on my resume, as I'm doing production level work in a language I really enjoy."

I am nineteen and a junior in college. I was able to graduate high school a year early which I thought was a good idea at the time. However, I was not accepted into any colleges besides the one I am currently attending because the college recruiters could not accept someone who applied with only sophomore classes ( you apply in fall of senior year which for me was my third year ).

With the scores I received from the AP tests I took I was able to get a total of 26 credit hours, with 12 counting towards my major. I applied to some summer internships my first year however I did not apply to many because I wanted to stay at home with my family and I was still 18.  I was declined from all of them with no interview. Despite not being accepted by any company the first year, I tried applying for summer internships for summer 2017 and was not able to receive any interview or job offers. I am taking senior level(4000+) computer science courses my fourth semester at college. I have 47 credit hours left with 20 of those university core (intro to phil etc.). So the question I propose is simple, should I graduate early and take summer courses and try my luck at getting a newly grad job or delay graduation until I am able to receive an internship.?

TLDR; Graduating high school early was an awful decision. Should I graduate college early and apply for newly graduate jobs or delay graduation until I am able to receive an internship."

This has been a pretty bad week for me. I got waitlisted at 3 schools (UCLA, Caltech, and Georgia Tech) and rejected from 1 (MIT). I was surprised that I actually didn’t get flat-out rejected from Caltech, but I’m also surprised that I didn’t get into UCLA. 

I got into my safeties (found out in February) but thought that I would get into at least one school this month — but I didn’t. And it only gets harder from here. The only schools are left for me are CMU, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, and Berkeley, and after the rejections/waitlists this week, I feel that my chances of getting into them are even lower. 

In middle school, I basically got straight B’s and C’s, but when I finally found my motivation in High School, I managed to turn that around. Now though, it seems that I could’ve done way less and gotten lower grades (and spent more time just having fun), and still gotten into the same schools that I already have. Despite being in two extremely toxic friendships for over 3 years, I still tried my best to get good grades. It feels bad knowing that everyone around you is going to top-tier schools and Ivies, and you just continously get rejected time after time even though you have similar stats and ECs. Even if I get into Carnegie Mellon or Cornell, I probably can’t go due to how much they cost (got into UIUC, but can’t go either because it’s just so expensive for OOS). So this month is basically just a feelsbadman moment continuously stretched out over 31 days. 

Right now, I don’t have the motivation to actually do anything at school anymore. I still write and study fun topics in my free time, but my passion has disappeared . I’m really curious on what to do now since I expect the next two weeks to be pretty terrible for me. To top it all off, my parents tried to console me by walking into my room the other day and telling me that they never expected much of me in the first place.


**TLDR:** Grades and school performance completely sucked in Middle School, improved myself in High School and thought I had a chance, but probably headed towards an entire month of rejection/waitlist letters. Also have regret not applying to more schools (shotgun method rip). 


**Stats** (since you guys like stats so much):

Major: Computer Science

GPA (10-11): 3.96 UW, 4.5 W

603dnt,141,2017-03-18,Quick tips when applying so you don't get Cold Rejected,Yin-Hei,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/603dnt/quick_tips_when_applying_so_you_dont_get_cold/,"If you want a high chance of securing an interview, make sure you apply through a *dedicated* stream. The interview game isn't as transparent as some might think.

General tips:

* Never apply for a job that's been posted for months old.
* Scout the company's code and networking events.
* When applying online, make sure it's specific and *referred*.
* Manage your applications in some excel sheet or txt file.
* Use well-known 3rd party sites (Linkedin, Piazza).

Examples:

* Google: Codejam, G-Games, I/O
* FB: When your position reads ""SWE_ NG_{your_uni_name_here} ({semester_here} {year_here})""
* Chase: Code for Good

When you network with these companies, let's say a career fair, most recruiters will hand you a custom application link, referral code, name, and/or email. These have a very good chance at responding, especially if you get a referral email or link.

Use third party sites to passively farm connections. 

Examples: 

* Linkedin: Might fetch a good opportunity depending on your profile. 
* Piazza: Careers has a calendar with some good companies holding networking events. And an inbox.
* GitHub: Pimp up your profile with open source contributions and notable projects.
* Kaggle: If you're a data scientist, this is highly recommended.
* StackOverflow: Probably overkill. Few companies ask for this, most don't. If they do, you've got this. Same with Quora.

And for the banks: something something technology analyst something something program 2017. Common abbreviations are TAP, TDP, TLP, etc. 

Some companies offer a ""tour"" when really it's a ~~free job hookup~~ networking event. ~~Also when applying for an internship make sure you never say you are advanced in seniority, i.e., don't say you are a junior when you are on your second year, even if you have the credits. Or when you don't have enough credits to advance. Further away from being a senior the better for interns.~~

If you're a woman, attend those women-targeted events.

Attend hackathons w/ sponsors, some fortune 250s may show up.

Then those random events that show up once on a full moon. Get notified by the university's connections somehow (by email or, the worst, poster boards). 

That's all I can think of for now. Going to sleep. gl

**EDIT:**

Woke up. For internships, junior status is definitely good, but it is also generally good to start looking before then. Make sure you're in a targeted audience when applying for internship/full-time, it is denoted by ""graduating in or after 201x"".

Quotas. Most companies hire on a rolling basis, and this typically starts when they post or update their app page. Sooner the better - you don't want to get suddenly cut short.

Some companies may ask for certifications, professional licenses, and/or boot camps. Not really a necessity but a bonus and fills up the empty spots in Linkedin if they bother you so.

Examples:

* Udacity
* Coursera
* IEEE, Cisco: This one's really good to have if you're into computer networking.

Coding competitions. These are different from hackathons. Good to get your name out there. You might get called out if you do well enough or compete often enough. Also helps your DS&amp;A/problem solving abilities.

Examples:

* ACM-ICPC
* Google stuff
* Hackerrank, Leetcode, Topcoder

Professors/Industrial professors have some leeway into companies, especially the ones they currently or used to work for. Do well and get to know them, they may provide a recommendation."

But when I received my acceptance from UCLA, I am a bit conflicted now. If I ignore all the costs involved, I would choose UIUC in a heartbeat. However I am a CA resident, so paying the out-of-state tuition for UIUC is a problem for me. And also due to some financial issues, my family can only pay for the housing and a little bit of the tuition. So that means that it is up to me to pay for most of the tuition.

BUT...the problem is that I applied to UCLA as materials engineering major, which at that time, I had no idea what it was. I looked more into it and was turned off by it, but I have heard that changing majors within the engineering department is fairly easy as long as you study hard?

Another thing is that as I read more deeply into this thread, UIUC is a bit stingy on giving grants or aids or scholarships? Unfortunately, I haven't received any scholarships and only received 5K in aid. BUT!!! UIUC has that name recognition in the area of double e, and I have heard that there are a lot of start-up companies or big companies recruiting engineers, so is it possible for me to land an internship or a job and make some money to pay for my college? I know making this decision is an investment, and I just want to know that I will be able to secure a job that will cover my costs for college.

I haven't really researched UCLA in depth, so I have no idea about how generous they are with scholarships, nor with any job opportunities...

Sorry for contradicting myself so much...

Fellow UIUC reddits!!! PLeASE HELP MEEE:)

tl;dr: 26K with high chance of landing a job? or 13K with idk if I will secure a job?"

6041fb,9357,2017-03-18,TIFU by forgetting I'm not in Finland.,metalskill,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6041fb/tifu_by_forgetting_im_not_in_finland/,"So, as usually, this fuck up didn't happen today, it was yesterday. I'm an film school student, working as an intern in Slovakia. Yesterday I was supposed to be at the studio at 5pm so as usually, I took a bus to the centre at 4.20pm and went for a lunch before hitting it up to the studio.

There is this fancy eat-all-you-can type of buffet restaurant in a shopping center. It's my restaurant of chose, when it comes to filling your stomach quickly. So, I finish eating, check the clock and realize I'm almost late from work.

From here starts the chain of unfortunate events. Yesterday was a laundry day. Instead of having a nice clean suit on me, I was rocking cargo pants, hoodie and a cap. I also had a pair of sunglasses on me and as I was in hurry, I put them on. I raise from the table, ""shout"" thanks to the restaurant, put on my earplugs and tune in some lovely Finnish death metal on max volume.

From there I start to walk fast and later on it transforms into full-on running trough the shopping centre. I was only a couple of meters away from the exit when a large mall guard craps me from my shoulder and then proceeds to drag me from my hoodie.

At this point I was really confused and quite upset about the fact that a large man is destroying my clothes. I go full aikido on him and on the process of destroying his hand it clicks on me. I HADN'T PAID FOR THE DINNER! Now, I don't know how it is in your country, but in Finland you have to pay for your buffet before you get to eat anything.

So there I am. Terrified in the middle of a fully crowded shopping centre, suspect of a shoplift and assault on a guard. I raise my hands up in the air and go something along the line ""Sir, I am so sorry, I was in hurry and I completely forgot to pay"". Now of course, this guy didn't understand a single word from the sentence and back we went to the restaurant ( this time he was only dragging me from my hand, rather than my hoodie ). The guard had a discussion with the restaurant owner in Slovakian language and then the owner just simply shakes his head. I tried to explain myself but nobody spoke any english.

The guard escorts me to a side room with a chair and a table and leaves me there. At this point I'm starting to grow a bit tired of the whole situation and laugh to myself because this kind of stuff only happens in the movies. I start to text my friends about the situation and run out of battery in a couple of minutes. Gladly there was a clock on the wall and I could tell the time. At around 17.35 a pair of police officers come to the room and GLADLY one of them speaks fluent english.

Indeed I was suspected from a shoplift and I was to pay for the charges. I explained how I've been in this restaurant many times and I've paid for my lunch each and every time with no problem. At this point the officer looks at me like I'm an idiot and asks me not to lie to him. The guard had told them that none of the staff had recognized me and that's the reason why I am in custody. I explained to them how on all the previous visits I had probably been wearing a suit. I also told them how I was in hurry and had to run to be able to make it in time and the fact that in Finland we have to pay first. Then the cops ask why I didn't respond to the guard tailing me and shouting to me. I felt like an idiot and that I will never get away with this, but I answered with the truth. I had my earplugs blasting music on full volume so I didn't hear anything.

The cops finally accept the fact that it was all a big mistake. We go to the restaurant and the cops ask the owner if he recognizes me with a suit and then apparently he remembers me and says ""sorry, sorry"" and something in Slovakia. The police translates it to me, saying that the owner was sorry for the whole thing ( wasted time and the guard dragging me from my hoodie ) and said that I didn't have to pay for the lunch. I refused the offer, paid and left the shopping centre, calmly walking, without the earplugs or sunglasses.

I arrived to the studio an hour late and everyone was relieved to see me. They had tried calling me countless of times and they were afraid that I had been kidnapped or something, because during the 4 weeks I've been in here, I've never been late before. They had even called the police on me...

EDIT: People seem to be quite worried about my ears and the fact that I might not be aware of the permanent damage it causes to blast music on too loud. I stated that I had my earplugs on ""full volume"" which nessesarely is not the truth. Just loud enough that I didn't notice someone calling for me in a foreign language! Thanks for your consern! &lt;3

EDIT 2: As for the band I was listening to, most likely Mors Principium Est. Check them out, they're amazing!

TL;DR an exchange student, forgot to pay for my dinner and accidentally acted as suspicious as one could, sat trough a police interrogation and caused global panic amongst my co-workers.

(My schedule next year is all fucked up because I'm taking classes at an academy and my base school, so there needs to be a travel time between the two, meaning that I can't take as many classes.)

Stuff I'm planning on doing for the future:

- Summer internship. (I've got connections :) )

- I have a coding competition in May

- I have an FBLA State competition for cybersecurity in a few weeks that I'm studying for

- I'm going to try to get a few certifications. I've heard that the FBLA state competition is similar to the Comptia Security+ exam and the Network+ exam, so I might try to also go get those certifications as well

- I have a Science Olympiad State competition next week

- I'm retaking SAT and Subject SATs, and also I'm going to take more Subject SATs

- I'm building a chess AI by myself. Not sure if this will actually become something special though; it's just a small project I'm working on by myself to teach myself how to code an AI.

- Next year, I'm planning to start a computer science club in my school. (I missed the deadline for making a club in my school this year :( ).

- When I take the Computer Engineering class next year, they will also do some prep for the Comptia A+ exam, so I'll be able to go for that as well.

- I'm going to take the AP computer science test later this year

- I'm going to take the AP US History test later this year (I'm in AP US History)

- I'm taking the IB Math exam this year

- I'm taking the IB Psychology exam this year

- I'm taking the IB Computer Science exam this year

- I'm going to graduate with an advanced diploma (instead of an IB Diploma) because if I went for the IB Diploma I wouldn't be able to take the Computer Engineering class or Dual enrollment English"

Due to many reasons, I have to give up my well established career while continuing to live in the bay area. The obvious choice is tech, due to the fact that I do know how to program (used daily in my previous career, but at a lower/simpler level), as well as what's printed on my degree (stem ba from ucb, took a few cs courses as well).

so obviously, I've been going through ctci and leetcode and I'm planning on reviewing cs61b as I still feel unprepared, as even some of the medium difficulty questions on leetcode stump me (specifically the optimal solution, I can figure out a brute force method). Haven't even looked at the hard ones.

as for the rest, my main language is python, I can read java/c, understand complexity, not a stranger to the command line/linux.

besides general advice on how to get to the interview stage, what can be said about the following:

 * is cs61b (data structures and algorithms) all you really need to be decent? how about cs170 (upper division algorithms), or cs162 (operating systems)? I've read somewhere (maybe here) that those are necessary as well. Maybe they were talking about post-interview, what you need on the job?
 * how do I break in without previous projects, internships, open source contributions? I don't really have the time to develop a portfolio on top of the studying
 * is this even realistic in my mid 30s? I've heard plenty of stories about age-ism.
 * related to the previous, should I basically be gunning for an entry level back end software engineer position, or something else? I have no management experience
 * should I be targeting any specific type of company? I was thinking the b list (yelp, dropbox, pinterest, etc.) Maybe even that is unrealistic?
 * I don't know much about networking, how to interface with a database, the sorts of things most companies seem to based on (altavista was still a thing when I took 61a), can I pick those skills up on the job? I think I understand them conceptually though.

frankly, and I know this isn't a positive mental attitude, but sometimes the only thing that I see positive about me is a piece of paper, and the fact that I might not totally embarrass myself in an interview (if they're being nice)."

This probably isn't a very contributive first post, and I apologize, but I was wondering if any of you with more experience than I might have some advice. I'm a third-year undergraduate Computer Science student at my university, and I spent my winter break and spring break sending out applications for any summer internships I could find. I've spent the last summer working at my school's HCI research lab, and I have my resume cleaned up and featuring all of the work I've done and skills I've built up, but it looks like I've got no follow ups on my applications. Granted, I only sent out about 18 applications, almost entirely in the NYC area (I live two hours outside the city), but I was hoping that I would at least get a rejection letter to let me know what I should do next. Out of the 18 applications, I only got one response back, a single rejection. I'm a bit bummed, but it's okay, I'm aware that there are a lot of students looking for work experience in the same areas that I am, especially in the city. I come to you guys in search of advice, is there any way I could still find work for this summer? I'm very comfortable in fields such as web applications development, video game/virtual reality software development, and mobile applications development. I'm still sending out applications to small companies, but I worry that they'll go unnoticed, since most of my classmates already have their summer internships set up at this point. Any help, or direction to a place where I could look for work, would be greatly appreciated. If it helps to know, I'm a first generation student from a family of Central American immigrants, so a lot of this process is really new to me.

Its a small local company, definitely not Google or Microsoft. Kinda shell shocked at how I did, but I have never had a huge problem with coding challenges in the past .

They used remoteinterview.io which the questions where just weirdly worded and did not give great explanation for what it was asking. I had 60 minutes to complete these three problems

1.) Given buffered read, where first line is number of lines that follow and the rest of lines are string print out the reverse of each word in the string (Print line where each word is reversed)
- This was pretty straight forward fizzbuzzy, but for w.e reason even though output was identical it was spitting out that it was improper output, I spent far too long trying to get it to spit out that it was right, before realizing I should move on. This wasted about 20 minutes out of the hour.

The second was a problem, moving boxes. Given 3 numbers lets say 11 2 2, first number is number of boxes, second is number of boxes that can moved in one move, and 3rd is the number of piles of boxes that it should be divided into. If a pile has more than what can be moved it should be divided into that many piles where no pile should differ more then one then the other. So with this weird description it gave example input as 
&gt; 11 2 2
11 -&gt; 5 + 6
5 -&gt; 3 + 2
6 -&gt; 3 + 3
3-&gt; 2 + 1
So 4 boxes of 2 and 3 boxes of 1 -&gt; 7 piles

What wasted a good 3-5 minutes on top of being confused by original description was confusion about where they were coming from with 4 boxes of of 2 and 3 boxes of 1 since the wording was confusing and the example listed 3-&gt;2+1 once 
- Did this using recursion mostly implemented it but not fully

The last problem still didnt fully get what was asked. It had to do with finding a divisibility rule for prime numbers. Gave an example of 3 and 11 in which the number can be broken up as decimals into r-tuples and suming the r-tuples and seeing if their sum adds up to something divisible or something along those lines. So problem given a prime number find if the rule applies or something along those lines. Issue was there was no example given of how the number is broken up into r-tuples simply example input of one digit and its expected output. 

So, pretty bummed out but wondering if these are normal 20 minute problems for entry level position."

Last Fall, around the time everyone starts applying for internships, the CS department coordinator (and my boss, since I'm a student and I work in the computer lab) got an email from a former student that he keeps in touch with, saying that he is looking for an intern for his team at Company 1. He visits our school and talks about his job and the position, and the coordinator introduces us, because he thinks I would be a good fit for the opportunity at Company 1. The guy from Company 1 likes me, and when I apply for Company 1, my application is basically fast tracked, and when I interview with the manager for that team, it's less of an interview and more of a ""yeah we've basically already picked you but I wanted to talk to you a bit first."" Naturally, right at the end of winter break (the company's recruiters took some time off for Christmas), I got a call from Company 1, offering me the job. I told the HR rep I wanted to intern with them, because at this point I hadn't heard anything good from any other companies I applied to, and I filled out an application and background check forms with a separate company that handles Company 1's temporary employees.

Around the time I was applying to Company 1, I also applied to a couple other companies, and either didn't hear back, or I was turned down. Fast forward to last week, and I get a call from Company 2 from a different HR rep than the one I had previously talked to, saying that they got my information and wanted to do an interview. I had interned with Company 2 last summer but for a different team, and they didn't give me a return offer, but my previous HR rep encouraged me to apply to a different team if I wanted to intern with them (which is what I did last Fall). Since the team that I applied for at Company 2 was in a better location than the internship at Company 1, *and* Company 2 offered me **much** better pay last summer than Company 1 is offering me this summer, *and* Company 2 offers relocation packages while Company 1 expects us to go it alone, I decided to interview with Company 2.

Since it's sort of last-minute hiring time for summer internships, I interviewed over the phone and got the official offer within a few hours of finishing the interview, because the people I interviewed with at Company 2 really liked me. Here's a little rundown of the internships:

Company 1:  
 - Pay: $22.95  
 - Relocation Assistance: None  
 - Location: Fort Worth, TX (not terribly far from where I live, but 4-6 hours drive, so I would have to get an apartment over the summer)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops sort of stuff

Company 2:  
 - Pay: $26/hour  
 - Relocation assistance: $4000 one-time lump sum for travel and rent  
 - Location: Denver, CO (Much farther than DFW, but much, much more attractive location to me)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops type thing

So the roles are very similar at both companies, but Company 2 is offering better pay, generous relocation assistance, and a much better location (especially since I've been stuck in Texas my whole life and would love to spend the summer somewhere else). Company 2's offer is looking way better to me than Company 1's.

There are 2 problems, though:

1) I interned with Company 2 last summer, and I kind of like the idea of trying out different companies while in college so that I can get a feel for what I like. However, it's a very different team than last summer's, in a different location, and with a different role (last summer was software engineering), so it wouldn't be *that* similar. More importantly,

2) I ""accepted"" (not officially through paperwork) Company 1's offer back in mid January, and I am afraid of creating bad blood if I back out now. This is emphasized because my offer from Company 1 was very much influenced by professional networking from the department head at my school and one of their former students and professional contacts.

Is it appropriate to back out from Company 1's offer and take Company 2's offer? Or is it too late, and I shouldn't risk creating bad blood with my department head?

This is stressing me out a lot and I would love some perspective.

Thanks!

***EDIT***: I want to point out one of the other things that pushes me towards Company 2. I spoke with a friend of mine from my school's CS department, who interned with Company 1 the last two summers, in a similar (but not identical) role, in the same location. They were offered $23/hour their first time around, and $24 their second. I realize that $22.95 and $23 aren't that much different, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way that they would offer me less than the norm at their company given that I had very similar credentials to other people interning there (except I have a higher GPA than the person I talked to, and I also have already done a previous internship, albeit with a different company)."

I was admitted as a computer science major this January, and I have done a TON of research about the school. However, there are still some questions hovering in my mind. I would list out the things I know about UMD first:)

Pros:
1. Overall great CS programs with helpful and enthusiastic professors and TAs.
2. The Brendan Iribe Center will be due in 2018. (HUGE upgrade for the cs department and more resources)
3. Close to DC, which means lots of internship opportunities.
4. Beautiful campus with a welcoming atmosphere.
5. Nice people with diverse cultural backgrounds.
6. Clubs and sports are quite active.

Cons:
1. Crime rate is relatively high in the area.
2. Many great professors had left the school in the past years.
3. Dorms aren't so nice?(I don't know how hard it is to reserve for newer dorms.)
4. The cs courses are more focused on heavy coding rather than on the creative aspects.

So, here are my questions:
1. I want to be engaged in data science in the future but according to the school website, UMD's strengths is in cyber security, will it make a big difference on my class options?
2. I heard someone saying the professors in the cs department are really strict and they try their best to kick off students that are not in the top 10%, is that true?
3. There's not much information about how well UMD students do in grad schools. Are UMD CS undergrads competitive enough to get in grad schools like CMU, UC Berkeley or UCLA?(Generally speaking)
4. I really don't know whether I should go to a cc and then transfer to UC Berkeley or UCLA(major in statistics) or attend UMD directly.(I've been thru some personal issues so I don't have an amazing hs gpa, but I consider myself hardworking and bright.)

607o6v,20,2017-03-18,Middle school teacher swears/menaces student athletes and myself (volunteer soccer coach),VinoRosso96,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/607o6v/middle_school_teacher_swearsmenaces_student/,"Hi guys,

I apologize if this isn't the right thread, but I'm looking for some advice.

I'm a 20 year old college student who has been volunteering at my old high school for a few years. I've been using it as an 'internship' to gain experience in the hopes that one day I can coach my own team at a club level. Overall, the past few years since my graduation has been exceptional, it's been an incredibly eye-opening experience. 

Until this year, when a middle-aged male teacher from the local middle school took over the JV boys soccer team, and has been a total nightmare to work alongside with.

Before I go any further, I want to say that I am simply a volunteer 'team-manager' who doesn't receive any financial compensation from the school or booster clubs, I do this for fun and in my free time. I don't have (or need) lay-coach licenses since I'm not on the payroll nor over the age of 21. This is an important part in the story.

The past few weeks at the practices the middle school teacher (we'll call him Greg) has been getting slightly more and more aggressive towards me and some of the players on Varsity, whom I coach. Two of my players played a joke on him, which was a bit distasteful, and Greg lashed out in an incredible manner, swearing at them, saying ""I will knock you the f*ck out"" to a 16 year old. It was beyond embarrassing and over the top for a county teacher to be threatening two boys who are barely 100 pounds.

Last week, Greg made another jab at me over ""not having lay-coach licenses and shouldn't even be out here."" I find that strange because according to all the rules and regulations, I am in violation of none. If anything, he's in violation of gross-misconduct. I simply shrugged it off and went on about my business at practice.

Then we get to Friday night. My main head coach is sick and doesn't show up. It's me and the assistant coach of Varsity, and Greg. As I'm talking to the Assistant Coach, I question why we set up for a play a certain way, in which Greg overhears and absolutely erupts on me. 

He's swearing at me in front of the team on the bench and threatens to have me removed by the administrator on duty. Dumbfounded and furious, I leave without saying a word.

His continuous lack of respect and gross misconduct are enough to get anybody fired at any job. I'm more upset about him telling players that he would ""knock the f*ck out of them"" than for him erupting on me. His disrespect towards me will not be tolerated, and I'm now looking for avenues on how to deal with this.

Since I graduated from the High School 3 years ago, I still have an excellent rapport with the faculty there. How should I handle this? Should I have all this documented and sent to the admins at both the high school where we coach, and to the middle school where he teaches?

Sorry for the long story, I tried to simplify this as much as possible. I would be glad to answer any questions you all may have.

I'm currently very anxious approaching Ivy Day. In my opinion, in self evaluating myself, I believe I'd have somewhat of a shot competitive applicant but I'm wondering if you believe my GPA is a deal breaker when viewing my application holistically. My GPA issues are due to severe adverse living &amp; family conditions junior year that I explained very thoroughly in the application, but nonetheless has served as an inspiration for my future aspirations and something I also mention in my essays as it's an important part of my life.

Demographics:
Black, first generation in the US (parents are immigrants from Africa) From Florida. Computer Science applicant

GPA:
3.6/4, 4.1/5 currently, started low freshmen year, increased a lot sophomore year, lots of adversity that affected my ability to succeed in school junior year and had a low gpa that has continued this year.

Rank: About 10%
SAT:
1540 (790 math, 750 English, 22 essay)
ACT:
N/A
Subject tests:
Math 2: 800 
APs:

5s: Spanish Lang, English Lang, BC Calc, Comp Sci, US History, Phycology., 
4s: World History, Biology, 
Senior Year APs: Microeconomics, Government, Statistics, Spanish Lit, English Lit, Physics C
ECs:
- I'm really passionate about STEM, Politics, and just volunteering, and hopefully my ECs convey that?

- Founded nonprofit (STEM tutoring + provides computers, really eyeopening experience working with underprivileged students that I can relate to as well)

- I'm a national board member in a huge international organization (sorry keeping anonymity, but this EC is huge to me and the process to get to this point was a lot of hard work and dedication to this organization.)

- President Programming Club

- VP Debate Team 

- President Politics Club (do grassroots political work, voter registration drives, etc)

- Robotics team member

- NHS, Habitat for Humanity, Key Club member

- Lead organizer and founder of project to increase voter participation, founded with support of Mayor + City Council (big city)

- National Society of Black Engineers (Member + Tutor)

- Total approx. 450 hours volunteering

- Work Experience:
Interned twice at a global/top technology firm in technical programming/developer role. Nearly all funds spent to support living expenses + fund nonprofit activities.

Summer Activities:
A prestigious STEM camp at top universities (attended through scholarship), volunteered as mentor at local youth university programming camp, internships, most of my nonprofit work during this period

Awards/Honors:
- Questbridge Finalist
- State/National debate awards
- Couple of general state speaking awards
- Awards at regional programming tournaments (ranging from 1st-5th)
- Won 1st place at a huge hackathon
- Won student of the year  (10th grade)
- Won 1st place in an international STEM competition (sorry for vagueness, but it's really competitive, and it's not SIEMENS)
- Awarded Civic Engagement + Leadership award on behalf of city for grassroots work in nonprofit + voter project (typically given to adults)

Financial status: 50k for family of 4 with no assets or savings, but parents don't support me financially either. Overall, family situation is really fucked up which I explained in app and hurt my grades.

Recs: I feel like the teacher recs could be generic bc my school is huge, but I'm not sure.

STEM Teacher: 8/10, knew pretty well. She's active in our STEM clubs as well that I participate in.

STEM Teacher #2: 7/10, knew really well but my grade was a low B in this class.

Additional rec: 11/10. From my employer, former alum to Stanford/Princeton and also interviews students for Princeton. I read it and was ecstatic by the depth and quality of her description.

Essays:
This depends on the school, but I definitely think my best writing was for Stanford and Harvard where my CA is a 9/10 and overall I believe I described myself with genuine passion for STEM and a heartfelt analysis of my high school years and life. But of course, no one really knows what these schools like to hear exactly.

Info about high school:

Really large and one of the most competitive publics in the nation from a large city. I believe there's a bit grade deflation, if that impacts your opinion on my GPA/Rank. There are several other applicants from my school.

Thanks in advance guys! I'm really just curious if my GPA alone takes me out of the consideration from these schools, or can I make up with my essay writing, ECs, and test scores? Sorry about the ambiguity - I know a lot of people from my school are on this subreddit (because of all the competitiveness lol), so if you need clarification to base your response, please ask. "

My goal for this summer is to be more confident, and do my best towards getting a full time offer. But I still have this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I may not be good enough.

I'm pretty certain I'd like to go into Software Engineering upon graduation, and I feel that I have the determination for a competitive career in the industry. (I'm still on track to graduate on time, and I have a 4.0 GPA on a full ride to a state university and lots of academic achievements and extracurriculars.)

I didn't apply to internships for this summer because I just wasn't qualified and I'm just taking my Data Structures and Algorithms (using Java) course this semester along with some other electives (Web Programming and UNIX). I browse this sub a lot, and I know I'm a bit ""behind"" without any sort of internship for this summer if I hope to be a really competitive candidate.

My question is: What do I do this summer? I figure it's too late for an internship, so I'll likely be scooping ice cream to keep some income coming in, but I'd like to commit my free time to becoming a marketable applicant moving forward. 

Should I work on a big project? Should I teach myself more data structures and start working on CTCI/HackerRank? Both? My only reservation is that I'm going to learn a lot of these topics in the future in the CS department, but if it would be a good use of time I would learn them as soon as possible.

I have also decided to minor in Computer Science. With the course work, I have no social life, as I spend almost every hour of my life studying in a library and popping adderall -- WAY TOO OFTEN. I decided to minor in computer science this semester and this has been my most difficult semester so far. I chose the minor, because I think it will help increase my chances of breaking into the financial industry. However, I have two semesters left, and they're going to be even more brutal. I have 3 more upper-level math classes (423, 525, &amp; 526 -- in case, you are familiar) and 2 more upper-level Computer Science classes (281 &amp; elective) which are known to be very time-consuming and difficult. Now comes the dilemma: 1) I could spend my spring semester (first two months of summer) here in Michigan to take one of the Computer Science classes. After the summer school, I would intern for rest of the summer (another 2 months) at a middle-market private equity firm. OR 2) I could spend the whole summer interning and learning at the private equity firm, as I actually ENJOY my life away from school. OR 3) I COULD JUST GIVEUP IN MINORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, and solely focus on Mathematics. Here are the questions: Which options would you guys recommend? Is minoring in Computer Science really going to help me that much, in terms of career paths in financial fields? Or should I just keep grinding and finish one more year strong?"
60b20d,0,2017-03-19,Budget VDI. unRAID or XEN?,nyx_stef,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/60b20d/budget_vdi_unraid_or_xen/,"I'm an intern as sort of an IT sub-manager in a company with **super duper hyper ultra stingy** management, who want most efficient, highly available work desktops that only require almost no hardware &amp; software replacement for the next 15 years **(no joke)**. Current PCs for the staffs are already in their 4th years, with about 10% replaced and the rest are hanging on threads. We don't even have any spare PC if another breaks down, as the IT dept. is ordered to buy only when any breaks down, to save cost. Even the purchasing dept. ordered the server RAM we so **DESPERATELY** needed from the cheapest source available, and will arrive in **6 weeks**. AND IT WAS A FREAKING **1** STICK OF HPE 16GB RAM.

As staffs only use internet browser, and office programs, the PC only needs low performance. The current replacement is a bare Intel NUC with 7th gen i3 ultrabook CPU, 8GB RAM &amp; 128GB SSD, which costs around 580 USD per unit (not including peripherals). 

I had a meeting with vendor for microsoft based VDI, which proposed 150k~200k USD for software &amp; hardware for 70 users for 5 years. I had great interest in it for cutting maintenance time for IT guys due to easier management &amp; maintenance, since they're already constantly overworked, but deemed too expensive by management.

The release of Ryzen and watching some Youtube videos (by Linus) gave me an idea. Why not build a low-budget VDI using Ryzen due to its high core amount and low price, and use open-source / cheap type-1 hypervisor?

For 4 users per machine(maybe more If I can squeeze it), I'm thinking of:

- CPU: AMD R7 1700
- Motherboard: B350 AM4 motherboard from Asus / Gigabyte
- RAM: 32 GB DDR4
- Storage: 256GB SSD for Cache, 2 x 2TB NAS HDD RAID 1 for main storage
- GPU: RX 460 (optional)
- PSU &amp; case: as minimum as possible
- Guest OS: Win 10 Pro x64

So my questions are these:

1. Which VDI solution should I use, Xen or unRAID?
2. Is that hardware specification enough?
3. Is there any good, cheap zero client that I can combine with that VDI? If possible, from big brands such as HP or Dell.

Thanks a lot :)

P.S.: If you want to know why I still work there, is because my father is a close friend of company's owner, and he has been helped a lot in many business deals by the owner, so I'm kinda forced to help the IT dept.

P.S. 2: I can delve more into the shitty situations here in the IT dept. Like, using normal shelves rather than **A** locally made, budget server rack (about 1000 USD) for saving cost.

**EDIT 1:** Thanks for the input guys! It seems that the overwhelming general consensus is that VDI won't work with the situation I;m in."
60b9bo,1,2017-03-19,I have to choose between 2 summer internships (x-posted from /r/internships),intern6019,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/60b9bo/i_have_to_choose_between_2_summer_internships/,"Hi /r/Advice!

Last Fall, around the time everyone starts applying for internships, the CS department coordinator (and my boss, since I'm a student and I work in the computer lab) got an email from a former student that he keeps in touch with, saying that he is looking for an intern for his team at Company 1. He visits our school and talks about his job and the position, and the coordinator introduces us, because he thinks I would be a good fit for the opportunity at Company 1. The guy from Company 1 likes me, and when I apply for Company 1, my application is basically fast tracked, and when I interview with the manager for that team, it's less of an interview and more of a ""yeah we've basically already picked you but I wanted to talk to you a bit first."" Naturally, right at the end of winter break (the company's recruiters took some time off for Christmas), I got a call from Company 1, offering me the job. I told the HR rep I wanted to intern with them, because at this point I hadn't heard anything good from any other companies I applied to, and I filled out an application and background check forms with a separate company that handles Company 1's temporary employees.

Around the time I was applying to Company 1, I also applied to a couple other companies, and either didn't hear back, or I was turned down. Fast forward to last week, and I get a call from Company 2 from a different HR rep than the one I had previously talked to, saying that they got my information and wanted to do an interview. I had interned with Company 2 last summer but for a different team, and they didn't give me a return offer, but my previous HR rep encouraged me to apply to a different team if I wanted to intern with them (which is what I did last Fall). Since the team that I applied for at Company 2 was in a better location than the internship at Company 1, *and* Company 2 offered me **much** better pay last summer than Company 1 is offering me this summer, *and* Company 2 offers relocation packages while Company 1 expects us to go it alone, I decided to interview with Company 2.

Since it's sort of last-minute hiring time for summer internships, I interviewed over the phone and got the official offer within a few hours of finishing the interview, because the people I interviewed with at Company 2 really liked me. Here's a little rundown of the internships:

Company 1:  
 - Pay: $22.95  
 - Relocation Assistance: None  
 - Location: Fort Worth, TX (not terribly far from where I live, but 4-6 hours drive, so I would have to get an apartment over the summer)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops sort of stuff

Company 2:  
 - Pay: $26/hour  
 - Relocation assistance: $4000 one-time lump sum for travel and rent  
 - Location: Denver, CO (Much farther than DFW, but much, much more attractive location to me)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops type thing

So the roles are very similar at both companies, but Company 2 is offering better pay, generous relocation assistance, and a much better location (especially since I've been stuck in Texas my whole life and would love to spend the summer somewhere else). Company 2's offer is looking way better to me than Company 1's.

There are 2 problems, though:

1) I interned with Company 2 last summer, and I kind of like the idea of trying out different companies while in college so that I can get a feel for what I like. However, it's a very different team than last summer's, in a different location, and with a different role (last summer was software engineering), so it wouldn't be *that* similar. More importantly,

2) I ""accepted"" (not officially through paperwork) Company 1's offer back in mid January, and I am afraid of creating bad blood if I back out now. This is emphasized because my offer from Company 1 was very much influenced by professional networking from the department head at my school and one of their former students and professional contacts.

Is it appropriate to back out from Company 1's offer and take Company 2's offer? Or is it too late, and I shouldn't risk creating bad blood with my department head?

This is stressing me out a lot and I would love some perspective.

Thanks!

***From the EDIT***: I want to point out one of the other things that pushes me towards Company 2. I spoke with a friend of mine from my school's CS department, who interned with Company 1 the last two summers, in a similar (but not identical) role, in the same location. They were offered $23/hour their first time around, and $24 their second. I realize that $22.95 and $23 aren't that much different, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way that they would offer me less than the norm at their company given that I had very similar credentials to other people interning there (except I have a higher GPA than the person I talked to, and I also have already done a previous internship, albeit with a different company)."

Working for this company is a major accomplishment in the industry, and getting let go from it will likely negatively influence your entire career.

Recently, the manager of our division (a VP) has been firing people with no warning for minor mistakes or policy violations. Over time, I noticed all the people fired were from my age group, and anybody older than us was never punished for the same mistakes. I pointed it out to my supervisor who said he would look into it. A month ago, he told me the reason the manager was firing people is because he said millennials are lazy and entitled and he doesn't want them in the company because they need too much ""hand-holding and baby sitting."" The VP said they are going to hold out for the next generation (some of our interns come from it). My supervisor said every time a millennial does something wrong, all they do is talk about how many problems they have, or how they have depression or anxiety or something else. Apparently, another division in the company is doing the same thing, the company is aware of it, and doesn't care. 

I told my supervisor they are going to piss off an entire generation, and he said, ""Half of them are unemployed - who cares?""

Is this discrimination and can I report them? Now that I have discussed this with my supervisor, I am worried I will be next."

Background:

31 years old, married, no children (yet) financially stable 
Bachelor in Science in Engineering 
Currently work for a private civil engineering consulting company
Hourly wages at 84k a year plus around 5k in bonus (i am paid hourly with OT and worked approximately 2500 hours last year)
Mileage reimbursement with no vehicle stipend or gas card
My wife and I are currently insured through the company policy

I've been at my current job since the age of 19, started there with two internships while at college and was offered a position right out of college.

My company is a medium sized firm with approximately 100 plus people. I have worked in all different disciplines of the company with a ""whatever it takes"" type of attitude. I have had a couple opportunities to leave in the past as I had been offered positions at competitors firms. Every time I have came back and asked for more money my current company has came close to matching the amount offered but always promised a bigger picture of me progressing in the company. 

I have been assigned to a new division (construction) in the company last summer with a promise that there is a path for me to eventually become a manager and potential owner of the firm. Currently all owners are licensed engineers landscape architects,etc. Since my specialty is In construction I have the appropriate experience and credentials for me to oversee some of the largest projects my company designs without having a PE license. I have no desire to get my PE as that commits you to being a full time office person, whereas I enjoy spending a lot of time outside and negotiating with contractors and our clients. After seeing how things have been since I moved to my new position in the company I have serious doubts about my ability to grow within this company moving forward other then maybe 50 cent raises a year and marginal increases in my bonuses. There's a possibility of me becoming an owner in the company but it may be 5 to 10 years down the road. 

I was recently offered a project management position at a contractors firm who I have recently worked with on a project. The company is relatively new but they started on year one doing approximately 5 million in work their first season with a 150% workload increase into this year. I will essentially be on the ground floor of this firm with the opportunity to make my own destiny relative to my positioning in the firm (I would be one of two project managers/superintendents and essentially running the office side of things).

They have been able to offer me 90k a year salary with the expectation that I will be working between 2200 and 2500 hours a year (more so in the summer which is consistent with my current employer). I have been offered a vehicle stipend of 600 a month plus gas card or a company truck of my choosing with all mileage and maintenance being paid for. Bonuses will start around 10k a year depending upon performance and increase significantly as the company continues to produce. 

Deep down inside I'm ready to make a move to a new company particularly on the contracting side of my world as I knew speaking with my colleagues at other companies this is where the money is made. It's not unheard of for guys my age in this line of work making 110k with 15 to 20k in bonuses with more established firms and people who have ""put in the time at other organizations"". I'm also looking to me challenged more with larger responsibilities. As it sits now I've done great things for my company with little to no reward. 

Downsides:

If I make the move we will have to switch to my wife's insurance. Will cost slightly more but comparable benefits.
I currently get over 20 days of vacation time but due to the nature of the work the current offer on the table is for 14 days
Obviously uprooting everything I've known and the people (who for the most part I like) I've worked with for almost a decade. 

I'm just looking for some advice for some outsiders looking in what they would recommend. I have an appointment on Monday to see my potential new employers office space and my office I would be receiving contingent on my accepting the position. 

Another thing of note is that this new company would pay for my entire phone bill and new laptop. I currently am alloted a small phone bill stipend at my current position and use a company laptop. 

My gut is telling me it's time to make a jump now and try something new which may potentially allow me the ability to create my own destiny with this new firm.

I'm a sophomore in college and it seems extremely unlikely that I am going to be having an internship this summer other than the two jobs which I currently have. I am wanting to beef up my resume and do some major coding over the summer.  
I saw some comments in other posts about GSoC. I looked up finished products from past years as well as some of the proposals and, to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if I could have come up with the code that they had done. That kind of put a damper on my view of my coding skills, unfortunately.  
Nevertheless, i am going headstrong into attempting to further my knowledge and improve. So, now I am faced with a predicament. Seeing the GSoC stuff has me sheepish about what is actually out there on Github (granted, I haven't done too much looking around). I also know that my contribution should be quite major to anything which is open source. How major is that exactly? In terms of putting things on my resume, does contribution (major or minor) to an open source project carry more weight than a personal project of a similar stature (in terms of size and, possibly, complexity)? Also, looking at things such as hackathons/etc., where would I go about looking for those in my local area and what are the ones which are ""the best""?  
I'd like to incorporate all of these into my time over the summer to really give myself a strong boost to my, currently lackluster, resume in time for applying to internships at the start of fall. I'd also like to prioritize these things in terms of most beneficial to least beneficial to best make use of my time.  
My resume currently has education (expected 2019), a job in IT (8/2015-present), and an unrelated job (2011-present) with no personal projects. On my Github, I have code which is for scrum sprints in an open source project, but no additional material.  
*tl;dr* should I focus on contributing to open source projects in a small/large way, working on a personal project, or something else over the summer in order to best improve my resume."
60c2dk,1,2017-03-19,Worth going to uni still if offered a full time 60k+ Service Desk job at 19yo?,ScratchingMyBeard,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/60c2dk/worth_going_to_uni_still_if_offered_a_full_time/,"So last year I completed a full time (9-5) internship for 6 months on little pay (mainly for the experience) in an IT help desk role. I came into this internship after completing my first 6 months of my university degree in IT/Business double degree and the first hand experience i've had in my job has taught me much more than uni has. 

My employer which is a Government agency has recently offered me a full time position which pays 60k Australian $. At 19yo, I think this is quite a decent position to be in since many graduates out of 4 years of university do not make that. 

So I'm thinking whether it would be worth it to decline the offer and complete my university or take the job and hope for the best? Is experience more valuable than an education for the IT field? I'm looking into trying to get university to work part time but that wouldn't guarantee that I could work full time and my manager isn't honestly that flexible with hours.

I would like to eventually complete my university since I hope to open up my own small online business and would like to learn more business related skills such as banking/finances/trading/investing, etc.

Any advice/help is appreciated."

Neither are what I wanted to do in the first place as an aspiring software engineer, but ultimately I was not able to land an SWE internship this summer so these are my options. For some clarity, I'm a second-year CS student with no previous internship experience, but a few projects under my belt (from hackathons and classes, mostly). Both are companies that I might be interested in working at later on for full-time, so either of these seem like good ways to get my foot in the door. What worries me, though, is that I'm not sure if they (or other companies) will consider me for a future SWE internship or job because of the fact that the job I'll have had there is non-SWE, and it's experience but not specifically relevant to SWE. Is that something I should be worried about?"

I'm pretty interested in the subject and enjoyed my time doing an internship at a local university. However looking around here it seems like it's pretty hard to get a job or internship. Although I'm not afraid of putting in work and enjoy programming, I don't feel like cs is my ""passion"" in as much as I don't have myriads of personal projects and such. It seems that the culture often expects people to invest a lot of personal time outside of work doing cs things. I suppose my question then is whether my impression correct, and is it possible to have cs as a career and not be totally 100% invested as my number 1 passion? Thanks."

My goal is to get into a top tech company when I graduate.  I've done a 12 month software internship at a large company (but not prestigious) and will have another 4 month internship this summer with another large-but-not-prestigious company.

Obviously I need to work on my resume as I failed to get interviews with any top tech companies in the US. I'm afraid to apply again to full-time at the top companies in the Fall because if I fail again, then I'll have to take a full-time job for a year before applying again. I'm hoping to avoid that. 

**I was wondering if it's advisable to delay my graduation by 4 months (graduate December 2018 instead of May 2018) so I can take another shot at getting a top tech internship.** I feel like this will benefit me in 2 ways:

1. Even if I don't get a top tech internship for the extra internship I'm doing, it could help improve my resume more to increase my odds of getting interviews at top tech for full-time.

2. I'm pretty weak at coding interviews. If I attempt to get another top tech internship again it may give me more practice and even if I fail at getting the extra internship I'll have another chance when I apply for full-time and will already know what the top tech interviews are like.



Any advice or opinions would be appreciated.

60d2vx,6,2017-03-19,Transferring from UCSD to UCLA for CS,transferthrowaway777,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/60d2vx/transferring_from_ucsd_to_ucla_for_cs/,"Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone has experience or insight on transferring from UCSD to UCLA. My gpa is a 3.8x with a very math and cs intensive schedule. I'm kind of worried about it because people are telling me it's super hard to transfer UC to UC, and that I usually need a darn good reason to as well.

Specifically, the transfer requirements site says that they need physics, but they're kind of vague on just how much physics I need. I took AP physics C and got 5's on both mechanics and electromagnetism. I'm guessing I probably still have to take some more physics courses and labs, but it seems really unclear on exactly how much. Do we have to hit every single transfer requirement to get considered?

My reason for transferring is that that I am not a CS major currently and the UCSD cs department is too impacted, and they are implementing a random lottery system on who gets to transfer in, with a low entry bar for the lottery(3.3). This means a huge number of people wanting to transfer and very few spots. It makes it a pretty ridiculous RNGfest to actually get into the major. My current major is actually something called Mathematics-Computer Science, which isn't a bad major since it hits all of the core reqs of the cs major here, and is still a great major for software engineering, and in fact the optimal major for any theoretical shizwiz/crypto/data science. But, many of more niche cs electives here at UCSD are locked to just cs majors, specifically Computer Networks and Computer Security(my primary fields of interest). Because of this I'm looking into applying to other schools next year. 

I'm also worried about how many EC's they expect me to have. In high school it was easy to fill out all of the ec's, but in college I can barely name 2 or 3 things since ec's take so much more time and commitment in college.(or am I the only one that feels this way?) 

In terms of side projects and skills, I have a decent amount amount, as my interest in networks/security led me to self-learn the network stack, tcp/ip, subnetting, and some basic pentesting stuff. I had work experience at Google last summer and have another internship lined up this summer as well.

Also, how is the research scene at UCLA? Is it difficult to find cs research as an undergrad?

tl;dr currently not a cs major at ucsd and it's too difficult to transfer internally which is why I'm looking to transfer schools. just looking for advice on what courses between now and transferring and advice in general on the process. Thank you."

I haven't been a kid for the past six years of my life. My high school career ended before it even started.

Every summer was filled with studying, internships, camps, and more studying so that I can have a better shot at college. During the school year, I naturally took the most rigorous schedule possible with tons of extracurricular competitions and clubs, this left me under stress from August until May every year, after which I would get stressed out some more by my rigorous summer routines. I've always wanted to get into MIT, which is why I pushed myself so hard doing a lot of extracurricular stuff and self-studying everything that I would need to succeed in my extracurriculars at an accelerated pace.

As a result of my busy schedule, I was left with a small circle of friends that I'm not very close with. I'm not socially awkward or anything, and can hold a reasonable conversation with peers, adults, and the like (pretty witty too, at times). But when I got rejected from MIT, I felt like my entire world crashed down. I felt like I've just wasted my entire high school. I basically missed the entire social aspect of high school for nothing. I know Ivy day is coming up and I still have a shot at redeeming myself, but even if I get in, I would still have a large hole in my youth that no one else has.

Prom is coming up in two months, and it occurred to me that I've never been to a single school dance or a single football or basketball game. I'm a decently looking guy, had a few girls confess their crushes(back in sophomore and junior year), but I just basically told myself no dating because getting into a good school is too important. So I have no experience with anything. I've never even held a girl's hand.

I don't think I can find a date for prom and I'm probably going to be remembered as that loser in high school. Should I even try prom at this point?

Freshmen, don't be like me. **Work to live, don't live to work.**

edit: wow thanks guys for all the support! I never expected to see so many people respond to my troubles. Best of luck to you guys too in whatever you guys decide to pursue senior year!"

This is mainly because I've heard that the university I'm going to (University of Toronto) has a fairly hard curriculum, and I'm hoping the head start on those two concepts will up my chances of doing well in some of the Math courses.

Additionally, I'm planning on doing a side project over the summer. I made a very small one last year with Ruby on Rails, although I haven't done anything in Rails since then, so I guess I'll have to re-learn a lot of stuff.

However, aside from getting ready for the math courses and doing a side project, what else can I do to maximize my chances of getting a job in first year? I was thinking about volunteering over the summer as well, although I'm not sure where.

I changed the title for my resume since ""Software Engineering intern"" is a more industry standard title, and would avoid the confusion/vagueness of the ""Student Technology Intern"" title.

My previous role, however, was for all intents and purposes, a software engineering intern role. My mentors and bosses were all software engineers, the project I did was proposed by software engineers, I worked closely with other software engineers and built tools that they would use in their projects, etc.

I am also a junior, so this summer will be the summer into my senior year. I've done multiple of my own projects. However they have all been personal projects, and, as a result, many of them lack proper documentation, actual use, and readability. My desire is to gain some experience in the field, but I feel that my age and self-taught knowledge is a major problem. 

I self-taught myself programing through Youtube videos in middle school and coded what I wanted with my free time. But the fact that I learned a language and its syntax rather than actual programming concepts concerns me. I fear that I might be missing some crucial piece of information that may seem basic to a first year CS student, but something I've completely overlooked. Also, there are a substantial amount of subjects of which I have little to no familiarity with ie. Machine Learning, Computer Architechture, Functional Programing.... I feel that these gaps in knowledge would be a major turn off. Since I have had no experience in a large team, I am also worried that my coding practices might become an issue.

My age is also something I'm afraid of. I understand that age shouldn't be a limiting factor, but let's be honest, it is. There is no doubt I wouldn't get the same respect, and I am scared of being considered a burden on a team. I am unsure whether or not my ideas or questions would be heard, and what my status on a team would be like. Would I do actual work, or would I be the coffee boy?

Also the matter of finding an actual internship at a company I would like to work at. A quick Google search brings up some awkward job listings on Indeed which all require a High School diploma. The criteria of a Summer High School Internship seems to be filled with ""Expert Social Media Advisors"".

TLDR: As a highschool student, where and how can I find a summer software developer internship?

I still do, but I would say I am a bit more realistic (its no longer all that matters to me). I applied to several companies for summer internships during winter break and heard back from Hulu and Amazon. Needless to say I was stoked that these companies got back to me when a year or so ago all I got was rejections from them (and similar companies). Like before, however, I wasn't able to get past the first round. I had a shot at Amazon but couldn't figure out how to reverse the 2nd half of a linked list and as such wasn't able to get past their 2nd assessment. 



After some missed opportunities, I finally landed my first job, an internship at a small, local company. I like the environment, the work I do is interesting enough, and the people are cool. But *its not Google, its not Microsoft, its not Facebook, and neither is it Amazon*. 



My current internship isn't defined. Its seems like I could be working there for as long as I want really. But speaking to friends I have at school who got that internship at Amazon, I keep kicking myself. Its for two reasons really: the fact that I could be making 2x as much and that I would have that big name on my resume. And for these reasons, I am still applying to any big company I can for the summer, even though its March. But with all the extra work of applying and interviewing (I've got an IBM assessment to do), it makes me think if all this is really necessary.



Should I really be always looking for better opportunities or should I just let it eventually come to me (who knows, maybe in a year or two I'll be at Google)? Should I just be happy where I am at, and focus on work and school (grad school)?



I'm always trying to make myself better, yet I feel I might be too hard on myself, and should simply be happy with where I am at, even if I go to a state school and don't work at the big 4."

I'm starting to have a hard time growing up and really miss being  a child. I am currently in the last year of my study and following a 40-hour internship. If all goes well I will be done in a few months and 'ready' to start working. But the more I start transitioning into the adult life, the more I miss being a kid. It sounds sad but I really miss not having any big responsibilities, being able to hang out with friends at and after school, being ignorant about all the terrible things going on in the world and not having to spend my entire week working and being tired. 

When I started studying and living on my own I really enjoyed it. no parents complaining about gaming and watching tv too much or coming home too late. Deciding what to eat and what to spend my money on. Only having to go to school like half the hours of my middle school. It was awesome. But now the good days of studying are over.. I've grown lazy and unhappy.. Looking forward to getting a fulltime job and living in a world where ignorance and cruelty against animals and humans are common and accepted by many is just really depressing. It's just really hard to imagine becoming a happy person and I'm already looking forward to retirement. I'm currently in a relationship that has been struggling for over half a year and I feel really guilty because my girlfriend wants to be with me more then anything while I'm having a lot of doubt and losing the 'in love feeling'.

I can go on about what makes makes me unhappy but don't think that necessary. The things I still enjoy are nature (especially animals), gaming and hanging out with friends (though i'm seeing them less and less and I feel like I'm having a harder time acting social and happy when I'm around). As I mentioned earlier I really became lazy and tired. I try to exercise more and become more socially active but at the end of every day I come home, have to make and eat dinner and just feel like not doing anything so I usually watch (nature) documentaries, play league of legends or watch a movie and go to bed early.

Again, sorry for the long post.. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

tl;dr: I really dislike growing up and am not looking forward to my future. I really value my free time and working all day makes me tired and unhappy. I used to be happy as a kid, not anymore. How can I become happier?"
60fkwc,1,2017-03-20,"Math majors, how is it? Any regrets?",TheEternalThrowaway,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/60fkwc/math_majors_how_is_it_any_regrets/,"I'm a high school junior looking at colleges right now and I still don't know what to major in.

I'm wondering if math is for me. I originally wanted to major in engineering because I liked science and math. Then I realized I *only* liked engineering because of science and math and didn't like the non-science and math parts. So then I decided to major in physics because I liked math. But now in my AP Physics class I've come to the realization that I only like the parts of physics that involve math and not the other parts. So that leaves me with one thing. Math has always been my easiest subject, it's just one of those things that clicks. Like some people are just naturally good at art, or music, or writing, for me it's math. Obviously a lot of kids say that and college math is a lot (a lot) harder, but I'm taking AP Calc next year and I already have a basic grasp on the subject. Still, I know it's much harder in college, but I'd rather do that than something else I don't like. Plus I read somewhere that math is on the easier side as a major because other STEM majors learn math concepts in isolation while math majors have them all connected in sequence. So there's that. Anyway, I have a few questions:

1. How busy is your schedule compared to engineering and science majors? Do you have a lot of room for electives or non-math classes?

2. How hard is it to you? Do you have any favorite/least favorite parts of the major?

3. How are the job prospects? I'd imagine they're pretty broad, but I'm most interested in going into business/finance with the major. Would a double major in econ and/or a concentration in applied math work well for this? 

4. What do you do for internships? Is it work in math or work in something like research or engineering or business?

5. Any regrets? Do you wish you majored in something else? Do you wish you tacked on a double major or a minor?

Thanks in advance for your great answers"
60flkp,2,2017-03-20,Feel like getting a CS degree is making me less qualified to employers,sutehk,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/60flkp/feel_like_getting_a_cs_degree_is_making_me_less/,"I've been personally developing since 2005, and since 2012 I've had 3 jobs and started two consulting companies (in two different countries). Currently have a full time 40/hour week Rails/Reactjs job for over a year but once I graduate they want to give me a 20% pay cut (down to a CS graduates salary) and hire me on salaried (which stings) - the decision is made by people who have never worked with me.

Also I feel like seeing a 2017 graduation makes me look less qualified than not having a degree at all, and I've had people ask if I was only an ""intern"" a lot because I'm currently finishing my degree. Only reason I am doing the degree is because in the midwest it seems that piece of paper is often worth more than actual experience and also it is practically free to do my degree. 

I am a full time student and full time (well 40 hours) employee as well as consulting 10-20 hours a week. I often spend about 80-100 hours a week on education/work.

I haven't applied for any other jobs, and somewhat worried I may be seen as under-qualified because of my graduation date. Also there are only 20-30 developer jobs in a 25 mile radius of where I live and I've met most of the people holding them. I've considered remote jobs and I feel like that is very difficult because they will get dissuaded by my degree on my resume. If they meet me or see my work I'm sure they will like my work!

Does anyone else feel like a CS degree makes them less qualified than experience?"

60h8cv,1,2017-03-20,"Depressed, directionless, miserable at my job. Not sure if these feelings are justified or if it's just a rude awakening",SmittyWerbenjagerNo1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/60h8cv/depressed_directionless_miserable_at_my_job_not/,"I need some advice and insight. Apologies in advance for the fractured writing / grammar. Here's some background:

I've had a relatively privileged upbringing. I had parents who were willing to support my education at any cost. I worked hard throughout high school, and ended up being admitted to a top private school. Despite all this, I took many things for granted. I encountered some personal issues going into my freshman year and ended up becoming a stoner for a short period. In hindsight, I was depressed, lost my motivation, and changed drastically. I became a little more introverted, ""gave up"" in school despite maintaining decent grades. 

I essentially entered a state of mind that left me apathetic for much of college. I had positive influences and my friends were all hard workers but the problem was that, despite knowing the right thing to do (working hard, recruiting for top level jobs, socializing, exploring new passions) I spent a lot of my time doing nothing. I KNEW what was right but I couldn't get myself to do any of it and it made me more depressed at the time. I think I dealt it relatively well because I still managed to form and maintain many friendships (was quite popular), and took care of my body with diet and exercise. I was aware of the imbalances in my brain and was also aware the extent that my diet and lifestyle had on my emotions. Still, I abused xanax for a brief period, had a very abnormal sleep cycle for most of college, and just made generally poor decisions. This all weighed pretty heavily on my conscience.

Despite all of that, I managed to attain an internship my junior year of college, and secured a full-time job that I wasn't even satisfied with. The pay was decent but not the best (top finance / engineering, etc) and not close to what all of my friends were all getting at least. This was also huge source of stress for me. I had no confidence in myself and couldn't even bother interviewing at these places and knew that I had only deserved a mediocre job (relative to those) at the time. In hindsight, I was totally capable of doing so but I convinced myself otherwise...

Fast forward to now, i'm working that same job that I received an offer for in college and I couldn't be more miserable. My pay is great for most millenials, I don't have any HUGE student loans (scholarships, some support from parents, etc). Since graduating, I've eradicated most of my poor habits. Aside from a few nights out every once in awhile, I sleep and wake up early, I meditate, I eat very healthily, and I spend most of my free time with my family and close friends. I'm aware of what's important at this point in my life but I can't help but feel that my time here is being wasted. I've saved up enough to live jobless for a few months and am looking to devote that time to search for something either more lucrative or interesting. 

The thing is, my dissatisfaction with this job has less to do with the job itself and more to do with the fact that I'm not reaching my full potential. I'm neither amazing nor bad at my job but it's something that I have no interest in. I keep convincing myself that if I were to quit and make unemployment my full time job, I could be learning so much more. I want to seize this opportunity before I have to face ""real"" adult obligations. I want to find what I'm actually good at now that I've dug myself out of my previous, college-lifestyle-induced, state. 

However, I remind myself of how privileged I am and am disappointed in myself for feeling entitled enough to even consider quitting. There are people out there who would kill for my job and comfortable lifestyle. Everytime I reach a breaking point in this job, I end up convincing myself that I'm just being a pussy (which I know I am). After all, 99% of the people out there have it worse than I do; bound to their careers and lifestyles by their financial, familial obligations. I'm very aware of this and i'm grateful for my life. I'm also aware that the world owes me nothing and that I have to work for it but I eventually want to end up in a career where I feel like i'm genuinely creating value for something. Am i to blame for wanting to quit and seize the chance that I have to enter this new lifestyle? 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make the most of what's been given to me. I fear complacency and don't want to grow old with regrets. Please point out any flaws or inconsistences in my thinking. I need to know where I'm wrong."

If you work at a major tech company, could you explain how it's done in your particular company?

What I want to do and help others do is avoid a ""what the fuck"" kind of situation where some people are confused as to why big companies that interviewed them as a newbie would no longer even give them a call back after obtaining years of experience at other places. It is clear that there is a great diversity in career tracks, so I'd really like to know how big companies deal with this.

More notably:

If you apply for a ""regular"" SWE role and seen as over/under qualified, do they automatically move you to a more appropriate SWE level for the hiring pipeline?

For applicants that appear to have slow growth in their career (maybe poor/no mentorship, poor chances at following industry trends, no large systems experience), where do they fall into?

On a more technical level, is knowledge of programming syntax that useful or is it only important to just have to show examples of good work and/or projects?

Again, I know this varies from company to company on how it's done so I welcome anyone that can provide answers on their particular place of work."

Late December 2016, I stumbled upon this subreddit by accident where I discovered freecodecamp.com. I was hooked instantly; I spent most of my Christmas break grinding out front end projects and algorithms. 

My attention switched over to learning C++ having come across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5nd9la/tutorial_learn_to_make_minecraft_using_c_and/), and I challenged myself to do the same; build a MineCraft clone without following the tutorial. You can view my attempt [here](https://github.com/Osc10/MineClone), it's nowhere near finished but I'm proud of the progress that I've made so far and it really has taught me a lot in the process.

My initial plan was to somehow get to a point where I could apply for summer internships and be a somewhat competent candidate. Using advice from the resume threads, I decided I needed more interesting projects to pad out my CV. My initial idea was a simple C++ program that adds interesting effects to images using OpenCV. What started as an uninspiring project grew into something that I am proud of: a wallpaper app that automatically grabs images off https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper+wallpapers/top/ every 2 hours, applies a cartoon effect to the image and automatically sets it as the background. [Here is the link](https://github.com/Osc10/Simple-Wallpapers/) to the project, bear in mind it only works on Linux for now although I do intend to make it work on Windows. Feel free to critique it, I was eager to show it off however premature it was and it is probably riddled with bad practices.

But I figured if I’m going to do this I should go ahead and record it somewhere where other people can find it. Unlike some people, I actually believe in the scientific method. Or I did, at least. I’m still trying to piece things together.

My name is Miriam Stuart. I mean, it’s not my actual surname, internet safety and all that. I’m twenty-seven, and I just moved down to California for a six month forensic biology intern. I’ve been here for about a week and a half now. I figured I’d see a lot of weird stuff working in a morgue, but the freakiest thing was at the house I’ve been renting.

So last year I met my younger sister, Sariah—I was adopted and wanted to meet my blood family, y’know? She’s a sweet girl. She’s taking care of my little Virginia until I can get my career kicked off. The only problem is she’s superstitious. Not just casually, either. She spreads salt circles, burns incense—once I walked in on her writing on her arm in chalk. She kept encouraging me to at least look into it, at least just a little. I figured I met as well, right? I’ve always been kinda interested in weird pseudo–science stuff, and she’s doing me such a favor, I figured I could humor her.

My first weekend in California, and it was raining. So much for the state of eternal sunshine. Instead of spending my first break seeing the sights, I browsed the internet looking at all that weird stuff she’s into. I got really interested in these “ritual games” where you supposedly interact with spirits and alternate dimensions.

That’s when things started getting... wrong.

I opened a dozen or so tabs of different games, and I was just about to open the first one when my laptop shut off. It’s an older model, it shuts off at a stiff breeze, so I just ignored it and started booting things back up. I was going to just go back to reading but... all the tabs had changed. They were the same page, an article about a specific ritual called “The Hooded Man Ritual.”

Maybe I was tired. Maybe I jut misclicked. I really don’t know anymore.

I figured I might as well give it a go.

I chose the bedroom, because it’s got a road facing window, even though it gets cold in there at night. The instructions said to do a cleaning ritual, so I found this one with salt and ash that didn’t take to long. I closed the door and the closer, and drew shut the curtains. I won’t bore you with the steps; I turned out the lights, unhooked my electronics, and set out the cords and matches.

Once it was dark, I set out the phone, counted to thirteen, and dialed the number, I tied the cord, dialed the second number, then counted again. Just like the instructions said, I told the receiver I needed a camp, switched the cords, and burned the first. Then I walked over to the window to pull back the curtain, and once I’d properly disproved it, I’d microwave some dinner and head to bed/

There was a black taxi cab parked at the curb.

My heart started to pound as I watched it sitting there, motor idling silently. It was on, I could tell, but no smoke poured from the exhaust. Actually, it almost seemed like it was made of smoke. I hadn’t expected to see anything, so I wasn’t really certain what to do now, except, I guess, follow through with the rest of the instructions.

I locked my bedroom door and the door to the house, and put the key under the mat. I got into the cab’s back seat, rolled up the window, and locked the door. I was about to go to sleep, like the steps had said, but before I could close my eyes, I noticed something on the cab floor. It was a little piece of paper, crumpled up and kicked under the seat. I smoothed it out the best I could. It was written in blue ink, scrawled out hastily. Some of the ink had run, and it was all crinkled, as if maybe whoever had written it had been crying. It’s on my desk right now, even as I’m writing this.

“It’s closing in. The hooded man is my last chance to escape. Only God almighty can save me now.

I didn’t think I could fall asleep. In fact, I’m not really certain I did. But I did wake up. I’m the kind of person who has to spend hours drawing myself out from the sheets minute by minute, bet I felt crisp, relaxed, as if I’d never so much as slept. I didn’t even feel tired, but the instructions said to return to sleep. I leaned up against the glass window, closed my eyes, and waited to fall asleep again.

This time when I woke up, I finally wasn’t alone. A figure was sitting at the wheel, their free hand resting on the dashboard. When I’d read about the hooded figure who drove the cab, I’d imagined a long flowing cloak. But the driver wore faded hoodie with fraying stings and a low hood that hid their face. They didn’t speak, and just as the instructions said, I didn’t speak either.

We were driving down a highway I’ve never seen, each side hemmed it with tall buildings. Everything looked modern, but it was cracked and rusting, as if none of it had been touched in years. Even the road was full of potholes and debris, but the cab moved as smoothly as skin on ice. It was so silent and still, the windows didn’t even rattle. Once or twice, I thought I caught a glimpse of color—some distant orange–red glow far past the tangle of buildings on the left.

I sat in silence for nearly half an hour, still in shock as we moved through the emptiness. I almost threw up when the cab stopped. It wasn’t abrupt, or smooth. It was simply moving, and then it wasn’t. The instructions hadn’t told me what to do if the cab stopped.

The right passenger door opened. A little girl took the seat next to me, kicking her legs as she shut the door, watching the window as the cab began, once again, to move.

She looked familiar, in a way I couldn’t quite place. She had dark brown curls, and eyes as big an dark as Hershey’s kisses—the tiny thing couldn’t have been much older than my own Virginia. She was wearing a worn, mint green night gown, with a little black bow sewn to the neckline. Her feat were bare, but clean, and she had that soft friendly glow you expect of children.

I wish that had been all I noticed about the little girl. But you learn things working in a morgue. For example, you learn the smell of a formaldehyde preserved corpse. I did my best to avoid looking at the little girl too directly, but it was like seeing words on a page; you can’t see it without reading it. The faint purple color in her fingertips and her cheeks; the slight bloating across her body; slight blistering across her skin. It’s all subtle, all slight.

It’s all symptoms of death plastered onto a still–living child.

She spoke softly, her words dry and raspy, twisted with the sounds of a death rattle as she admired her window view. “I can’t wait to see Virginia.”

I panicked. All I could think about was getting out of there. I told the driver I’d reached my location. They’d nodded, but that’s all I remember before waking up in bed. I wanted to scream or cry, or figure out what I’d just experienced, but I was cared. I called the last number to thank them for the ride, burned the cords with salt, did a cleansing ritual—then I called my sister. She said Virginia’s fine, and I didn’t tell her why I was so scared, but I just—

Listen, I need this internship. I can't just leave. But if I’m losing my mind or I don’t know what... I don’t know if what I went through was some kind of fever dream or hallucination or worse, real, but I still have the note I found. I just don’t know. That little girl seemed some menacing. I’m going to keep trying to figure out what’s going on—that’s what a scientist does. I just don’t know what to do. I’m going to read more about this. There has to be answers. There has to be."

Any ideas of where they would stick someone like me into their business model. We have an outsourced tier 1 help desk with no plans on moving that in house.

60j2ey,6,2017-03-20,Am I being taken advantage of?,KaOS311,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60j2ey/am_i_being_taken_advantage_of/,"So a little background on my career so far - I graduated college in May of 2016 and then went directly into full-time as an Android developer. I worked at this company as an intern in the summer of 2015, and then worked part-time (20hr/week) during the entirety of my senior year. So all-in-all, I have been at this company for almost 2 years now. My starting full-time salary upon graduation was $60k with the promise that I would ""reach market rate"" over a period of a year and a half with accelerated raises (every 6 months instead of annually). 

Well during my first 6 months of full-time, I pretty much kicked ass. My manager actually moved me over to a relatively new venture within our company and has me leading development of the entire platform by myself. Also - keep in mind that hiring external personnel with this kind of experience would have easily cost the company $90-100k per developer. 

Fast forward to our review period, and when I get my raise, its a measly $2k. I was taken aback - $2k every 6 months was going to get me nowhere close to market rate ($75,000ish). I appealed my case to my manager and the engineering VP, but they seemed unwilling to budge on the matter. I even pointed out that I am technically performing the role of a Lead Developer (3 levels above my current position), and while my manager agreed, it didn't seem to matter in the way of a pay raise.

Am I getting screwed? Should I try to have another conversation with my managers? Should I look elsewhere? I have run out of ideas and I need some advice. 

Thanks all in advance."

I recently read someone's post that said something along the lines of: ""CCNY is great for prepping you for grad school, but not for the industry, and while they teach you cs, they do not teach you skills you need to get a job in the industry.""

That's a real doozie for me because as I said, I have no experience with any programming language. I'm worried that I'll graduate not knowing enough and be unprepared for a job. Granted, I'm sure that if I haul ass now and work towards doing projects and taking internships in college, I'll be pretty okay, but I'm still doubtful.

I could always go to a SUNY (recently got accepted into UBuffalo) but it's just so much money, even with Financial Aid, and I'm worried that I wont be able to keep up with how rigorous the courses must be for someone as inexperienced as I am.

I had applied to a data scientist position at an online marketplace startup of about 10-15 employees. They are now looking to start data science and analytics operations in the company.    

This startup is like Amazon for certain exotic items in India.        

And so today, I got a call from them informing me I was selected for the role. Naturally, I'm happy, but here's the thing -  I will be their **first ever** data scientist, and I have only about 3 months of previous experience in data science from an internship at a different company.      

There is nobody in the company who can guide me, and I'm far from an expert in the field. I am a graduate of Industrial Engineering with some knowledge of statistics.           

Here is the list of what I already did/know because of the internship -        

* Data wrangling and cleaning (of mostly structured data) using dplyr and tidyr        
* Feature engineering (transformations, PCA, imputation of missing data etc.)          
* Deploying machine learning algorithms (random forests, xgboost, support vector machines, neural networks, cubist etc.)         

I used R for all of the above. I have extensively read *Applied Predictive Modeling* by Max Kuhn and *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James et al. Both these books are my go-to reference manuals.      
____________
From the job description I was given, my new job will involve -    
      
* Generating insights from data (structured, unstructured and streaming data)        
* Building statistical models to improve company operations        

The data I'll be dealing with will mostly involve their inventory database and transactional data.

Is there any advice from the more experienced data scientists here?   

What new things do I have to learn? What should I avoid doing? I want to succeed as a data scientist, or at least do a decent job in this new role. I'm rather anxious and I don't want to screw this up.

I try learning new things for Information Technology.  But nooooo, I wasted my time of 3 fucking years of fucking around with a homelab I don't even use instead of focusing on papermills for a paper of a Bachelor's.  I spend my days and nights reading technology guide after guide. I wonder what's the point if employers want people with the stupid piece of paper.  I'm fucking disgusted by the lies that they think they know it all, fake it till you make it bullshit, social networking, and god fuck it all at least going somewhere unlike me.  Then they get a job where they want to work.

I burnt my only bridge because I was too proud by saying I could've gotten a scholarship from the NSA.  One fucking bridge at a community college with no fucking other bridges.  Noone wants to hire someone that ""can"" put in backdoors! Oh no, god forbid I do that!  Cybersecurity my ass, there's worse things to worry about than a backdoor.  No, instead of a helpdesk internship at $BigHospital, I have to work at McD with a fake smile for middle class folks who are concerned about what goes into their french vanilla iced coffee.

I'm starting to fail more classes than I am passing.  Why does depression do this to me?  Since I'm failing classes, it's getting harder for me to transfer to a university for job aspects.

I have a leatherman, why don't I just slit my wrists?  I want to break my window.  I want to destroy the $750 lab I have because it's fucking useless.  Useless, I don't even turn it on anymore.

Fuck it, lurking won't help anymore.  I quit.  That's all I do anyway, noone cares if I show up or disappear.  Lurking a sub full of weebos and middle aged men is great because it's the only thing I look forward to every friday since it's almost like getting to know how a friend is doing.  But I'm fed up, and fuck the weeabos since they're having a party by themselves and fucking shipping and fan fiction.  Is that the kind of people I should be with?  If I don't fit in with normal people or outcast people, then I go by myself.

Why should I care about other people?  Why don't I just start making viruses and not POCs, fucking up websites and not submitting bug bounties (i don't care about money), and terrorizing the Internet? Fuck the script kiddies who want a name, I'd burn everything down if I could. I could've gotten a scholarship from the NSA.  At least I know I shouldn't end up like Unabomber, I realize how similar we are.  For me, control over technology as it takes over our lives.

Noone cares I'm learing about high availability, or Linux, or Powershell, or about CCNA, or what is storage, or distributed systems, or full stack for web applications, or accounting, or business intelligence, or data science, or cryptology, or GRC, or web development so I can get into cybersecurity, or god fuck it all I can't even list what I should know.  Noone cares unless I know the right person or have a fucking piece of paper.  I want to push myself.  Take pride in my own work.  Fuck that.  Jack of all trades, master of none.

I'm 21 going on 22 this summer. Studied English Lit at a medium-sized Honors university up until a few weeks ago. I excelled pretty well, making Dean's List, heading a few organizations, publishing one research paper in a book and another in the undergraduate research journal, but this all turned out to be an issue w my mental health. I'm technically a senior but since I withdrew from this semester, I'll have to graduate in 2018 IF I can afford to return (more below). I really want to be a novelist eventually, but have been pursuing a career in journalism to pay the bills—yeah, I know—and now I work at a nonprofit news agency and write a column for a small magazine based up in DUMBO.

Recently my family ran into a financial wall because, as it turns out, my mother decided not to pay her 2015 taxes so without her tax returns or information, I can't complete this year's FAFSA to receive my usual aid. As of right now I owe the school $6000 for the fall semester. I'm meeting with the financial aid counselor again next week to discuss my options moving forward.
I also withdrew from the semester because my ongoing mental health issues resulted in me not caring about my studies anymore at all. I began missing assignments under the delusion that I'd just turn them in late, though I never did. 
I'm still trying to sort this out—setting up an appointment with a new therapist next week—but I think the biggest issue was that I stopped learning halfway through my junior year. My school is pretty good for STEM, law and accounting, but terrible for the Humanities, so for over a year now I've been teaching MYSELF the subjects I've been interested in, and last semester I was stimulated the most because I spent the semester working on one long research paper that I designed myself. In short, the curriculum was too easy but required so much time. Even my Intro to Fiction class required we do fucking 30 pages of reading and subsequent journal entries every night to the point where I got NO actual writing done in the time I took that class. The upper-level classes were worse—we were given ridiculous amounts of work covering information that was not that difficult to understand.
Meanwhile I've reading books outside of my classes that were tougher and more interesting, especially thanks to a friend at Verso Books who's been sending me free proofs for the past few months. While we sorta-kinda touched upon Zora Neale Hurston in class, I found myself spending hours researching historiography of the Harlem Renaissance or Hurston's life story and published research because those things were more interesting; in one of my classes we were introduced to Derrida's transcendental signified as if it were the toughest concept out there and never really got past the basic definition of it, so I got some books on semiotics—a word I never would've learned at my school, turns out—and never went back.
MEANwhile, I was working part-time as either an editorial intern or freelance journalist. I've had an internship every, save for one, semester for the past two (three, now?) years and since I did want a job after I graduated, I devoted a fair amount of time and effort into that as well. I didn't really have a social life at all my first semester of junior year because of this work-study combo and that's fine because I was taking my first couple graduate courses and was engrossed in my studies.
That next semester, however, is when things went downhill. I didn't take an internship because I wanted to get straight As to do an Honors project my senior year. This was when I began teaching myself things because school wasn't hard anymore, and my mental health suffered as a result. I would sit in class and zone out or fall into a depressive episode for some outside reason I still don't quite understand myself. The fun in writing essays was gone because I had too many other academic assignments so I was stressed for time when the work didn't even require that much stress. It's like the faculty replaced quality over quantity or something; give the students so much work they have anxiety attacks so they don't realize that they aren't learning that much?
I thought this was just a one-off thing because the next semester is when I did the independent study and was genuinely pretty content with my life. I also took on my last internship at the news agency which turned into a part-time job this past January, which is looking to turn into a full-time one since I'm not in school right now. Things were good!
But then, this semester, I decided to go back to the traditional course load to learn some new things and it all went downhill faster than last semester. I knew something was wrong because I shouldn't have been wholly disengaged in my schoolwork by the third week, especially as someone who actually loves school.
I wound up forgetting about assignments and then skipping classes to do those assignments, and you know that most classes only give you three absences without repercussions. So, I withdrew before my grades began to sink with the intention of taking a gap semester—something I've been coveting since last spring—but now it's looking like I might not be able to go back.
And it isn't as though I'd be able to go back if I finished this semester. It's that my last semester/year of college was probably not going to happen no matter what I did, thanks to this mishap.

My family doesn't have much money. I'm a first-generation college student from a family of immigrants, and it isn't as though we're barely scraping by (anymore, I've had a rocky past) but we also don't have $6000+ lying around. I'm not really asking what to do because I'll be talking to my financial counselor about that, but rather: 

If the worst case scenario happens, that I genuinely can't go back to school for a few years, is it really that bad considering the circumstances?
I have a good job in my field paying a living wage that's training me for a career. I have a great resume/CV from both internships and freelancing. After I gain some hard experience in journalism I want to find a job in New York and move up there, because I have a lot of friends and professional connections that I'd like to be closer to, especially considering what I want to do with my life. 
Right now I'm afloat, but I HATE not having the safety net of a real degree. I feel exposed and sometimes get anxiety attacks about the future, because what if this company goes belly-up and then I try to find another job and no matter what my resume says, they won't give me a chance because I don't have a degree? Does that actually happen? (But if that's the case, how could Ta-Nehisi Coates get anywhere? *shrug*)

I suppose I just want some outside eyes on the situation, because it really is looking like this thing I valued so much when I was younger is out of my reach, at least for a few years, and I don't want to ever go back to retail work. Is this bad? Or is it surprisingly un-bad? 

P.S. Fuck student loans. They're the only things I'm genuinely angry about; I got this far and took them out and now I don't even have the degree they were for. This is fucking bullshit."

The main questions I have are the following: 

1. Should I send this to my regional admissions officer? 

2. The three points I want to make are that I'm still interested, I will 100% attend the school if admitted, and any updates I have. Am I on the right track? 

3. Related to #2. When should I send the email? I'm not planning on sending it until after I receive all of my decisions (April 1st). Should I send one now indicating continued interest, and then another one with updates? I'm waiting on an internship. 

4. UChicago offers a gap year admission option where you are admitted to the next year's class in addition to the normal waitlist. I don't think many people are interested in this option, but I think this would be a good fit for me. I still need to discuss it with my parents, but assuming I can, would saying I'd prefer the gap year option possibly improve my chances? Or should I just say that I'm okay with either option?

I'm currently a Sophomore studying computer science and have just sent out my last round of applications for this summer (unfortunately I still don't have an internship lined up for the summer) I got a couple interviews in the fall but no luck, and now I'm really trying to get a job.

My question is - I applied for a couple jobs that I am really interested in, but I know that these companies will get hundreds of applicants. Is it a good idea to try and e-mail a recruiter or HR rep for interns now after applying to try and make a more personal connection, or will that just make me come off as bad? I'm worried that my resume will just sit in a virtual pile and not really be looked at but I don't want to come off as pushy or needy.

Thanks!

Tl;dr: Should I try to make a personal connection at a company after applying for an internship or should I just wait for a response?"

60qt5l,1,2017-03-21,To continue current internship / accept another offer?,Aspxa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60qt5l/to_continue_current_internship_accept_another/,"Hi! I've been interning at a fintech company (Company A) for about 4 months. Great pay, benefits, environment that I'm very comfortable in and people which work I enjoy too. Been doing well too that they asked me to extend. However, for the summer I'm a bit torn between whether I should continue or not because I'm somehow afraid I wouldn't get to experience working in a different environment too. 

I was approached by another company (Company B) last month for a position which was similar to my current internship, but will be more challenging because: it's a new division, they don't have many people yet so workload is going to be much more than my current internship. I'd also get the chance to explore new tools &amp; do more research since they're still building their ""workflow"" too. Now, I love challenges and all, and to be honest if they're paying me as much as I'm paid now, I'd take it for new experience, challenges &amp; all. Because of this (the challenging works and all) I went through their interviews and eventually got an offer. But it turns out that the salary they're offering is less than my current internship. I'm afraid that if I accept this offer, I'll keep comparing it to my previous experience and I can't console myself with ""at least you're getting paid as much/better for a new experience"" etc.  I really don't want to be miserable for three months should things go worse than expected...

On the other hand I also just got an interview call from Company C which I know will pay me as much as my current internship. However I'm not too keen on the role (I like the role at B better) so I'm wondering if I should continue or not. And Company C is pretty slow at responding/giving decisions so I'm afraid this would drag everything for even longer if I continue the process... but the pay and benefits are comparable to my current one + new environment too.

A couple of things I'm wondering:
- Should I choose Company A, does sticking with the same company for your internships make a certain impression on your CV? Is it a good one/bad one?
- Should I stay in my comfort zone (Company A) or try something new (Company B)? Or go with Company C?

Tl;dr current internship is too good, offered a position in another company where I can learn new things (which I love) but with less pay, benefits, and much more workload. Which one should I go with? Or should I go for interview with another company (which pays as much as my current one)?

Thank you everyone and sorry for the wall of text! Would appreciate any advice regarding this."

Liked CompSci so much that I decided to pursue a degree in CompSci. Starting an Data Analyst internship in May with a newish but very popular ecommerce platform company.

Question: maybe I'm just over thinking this, but I eventually want to work as a data scientist. I love the discovery portion of that job. I know Data Analyst position isn't a ""bad"" point to be in to transition over to data scientist positions, but how hard is it? I think I might be blowing it out of portion, but I'm kinda scared if I will be able to do that. :s

60swsf,882,2017-03-22,Story of a Self-Taught Software Engineer: Part I,Zalgo_Doge,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/60swsf/story_of_a_selftaught_software_engineer_part_i/,"I have finally worked up the courage to write my story. I was told that my path wasn't possible and that I should get my degree in Computer Science, but I was stubborn. However, there were some points when I almost gave up.

A little bit of background on me: I went to a special needs private school for 4 years, transferred to public school my junior year, graduated at the bottom 50% of my class, went to community college with an undecided major and eventually halfheartedly choosing Hospitality Management as my major halfway through my freshman year. But how did I end up as a software engineer at a big corporation? Well, hopefully you guys like this series and you'll find out sooner or later! This is my story from my first line of code in 2012 to where I am in 2017.

During my first year in college, I struggled greatly. I had a history class where I studied day and night only to get an F on an exam. I eventually dropped the class which was pretty much the story of my college career. I had no idea what I was walking into. I continued to get C's and D's all while wondering if college was too much for me.

During the summer of 2012, I decided to take an HTML class as a GPA booster. I built a website back in middle school using Microsoft Publisher, so I figured it'd be a fun skill to learn. It was online, too. So I could do the class at my own pace. As I progressed through the class, I slowly but surely developed a poorly designed and coded website that I was more than proud of. I finished the class with an A. I had a lot of fun with it, so the next semester I took a class in JavaScript to make my websites more interactive and it turned out to be a very humbling experience. 

I couldn't debug, I couldn't find out what was wrong with my code, all of my assignments were late, and I almost dropped the class. There was even one time when I cried to my mom about how stupid I felt. I somehow managed to limp through the class with a very tainted A (Thank you, StackOverflow).

I then registered myself as stupid and put coding on the back burner. and proceeded with my Hospitality Management degree and landed a job as a bellman at a Sheraton in the summer of 2013. Within weeks, I knew that hospitality wasn't for me. I then dropped all of my classes at my community college in exchange for programming classes. I constantly fought against all of the self-doubt I had and whole-heartedly pursued web development. During the slow days at work, I would be on the computer practicing my craft. All of this was priming me for an interview with a small start-up company in March 2014.

I dressed my best for the interview, brought my laptop with some personal projects on it and was ready to woo them with my words. It turns out that they weren't interested in any of that. They quickly gave me a run-down of the company and gave me a coding quiz on one of their computers. The quiz was relatively simple, I had to create a box that changed colors based on the button you clicked. I wasn't proud of my code but I managed to get it working. Before I could finish, the manager came behind me and told me to stop. He offered me more than two times the amount I was making as a bellman. He then stated that I outdid a person with a Master's Degree in Computer Science for the internship. I couldn't believe my ears. It was like I was part of a joke that was nearing its punchline.

I then quit my job at the hotel without any notice. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, after all. I arrived the very next day for my first day of work. The office was the poster-child for start-up work environments. Big Nerf guns, nice conference room, open offices, a fridge filled with free Red Bull, candy, and snacks. I of course spent a good part of my first day taking pictures and sending them to my friends who were very happy for me. On the third day of work, I got my first task.

I resembled a headless chicken as I tried to finish these tasks, all while getting constantly rejected by the manager because they weren't up to their coding standards with his frustration growing with each and every interaction. After about a couple of days of back and forth, I finally completed my first task and I was pretty proud of myself.

On the Monday of the third week of my job, I walked in bright and early ready to learn. I sat down at my desk and tried to sign onto my email, and I couldn't. My account had been deactivated. I knew what was coming. My manager walked me to the accountant's office where they took my security badge and told me that I wasn't as far along as they had hoped. I asked what I can improve on so I can grow from this and they just told me to keep studying.

I emptied out my desk and walked shamefully out of the office as my co workers looked directly at their screens so they wouldn't have to acknowledge me. After I walked to my car after I was escorted out of the building, I stared into space for what it seems was like an eternity. I burned a bridge with my previous employer to pursue my dreams, I dropped out of school to give my internship 200%, I only gained about two weeks of experience from the internship. And as I stood there, with all of my belongings in my arms, I felt as if I had truly lost.

I love my company and the CEO, but have been put under new supervisor who makes anxiety worse. Decided I want to stop working in May when I finish my Master’s and move to California. Not sure how to convey the message. 

Background

- I work in DC in the commercial space sector and am studying space policy for my master's 
- Outer space is my passion - I studied astrophysics as an undergraduate and then fell in love with space exploration and so veered to business (my concentration at the GWU space policy program is international business in space)
- My main love of the space industry is the idea of bringing all kinds of people from all over the world together to accomplish new things and explore the unknown, hopefully bridging the gaps created by national boundaries and giving people hope for an exciting and more prosperous future 
- I LOVE the work my company does (we send things to outer space, including student research and satellites that study the Earth, CEO is kooky and into ideas like sending wine and art to space) 
- I've been working consistently as an intern/assistant since May 2016 (40 hours/week over summer and 20-25 hours/week during the school year) -- I've had a flexible contractor contract since then
- I usually under-report hours or at least never report time just hanging out at office, eating lunch, or doing research on my own time about ideas I could pitch or if I want to make sure I deliver the highest quality work, but they didn't ask me to do research
- There's an expectation I will likely stay with the company when I graduate in May, but my contract is open-ended and I haven't made any promises

Recent developments 

- I used to work directly for the CEO as an intern assistant which was always super exciting and rewarding - he's been a mentor of mine for some time, is a visionary in the industry, and our personalities just mesh 
- They realized it didn't make sense to keep me as simply an assistant after I was working there part time for over a year and so the CEO put me under the supervision of the marketing director, who's also my age (23 at the time) and didn't really know what to do with me... spent a couple months aimlessly making my own to-do lists and reports 
- We spun off our education program as its own company which I found terribly exciting - so they put me under the supervision of its new CEO and we just don't vibe at all. The woman snaps and complains all the time and is just cold and makes me feel awkward all the time 
- Since the election, I've been distracted by the news and looking at ways to help people getting f**ked by the system. I'm an immigrant who's parents came here for a better life and I've benefited incredibly from affordable quality education and other American institutions. I'm also a firm believer that none of us have rights until all people are free from blatant and institutional systems of oppression and the results of this election feel like a calling to the battlefield 
- My anxiety and depression have flared up intensely and have caused me to be more flakey and call sick more often -- but I haven't told anyone at work, especially since we don't have an HR department - also it's a startup with only 10 people in the office and there's a certain expectation of always being on-call... also feel way discouraged reporting to this new CEO
- I graduate in May and my partner and I decided to move to California this summer to get away from DC and get into the space scene there -- and I would like to get more involved in the media industry to advocate for the importance of STEM and space for young people to a larger audience, advocate how space exploration and social justice can be linked, and get more involved in boots on the ground civil rights and education advocacy (also warm, sunny, chill people, weed)

I bailed on work last week and told my new boss I want to talk about a personal matter when I get back (tomorrow) and I'm lost on how to explain all of this and what parts to explain... 

Mainly I want to get across that 

- My mental health has been affecting my performance and I'm sorry I didn't bring it up sooner (??)
- I don't feel that this company is the right fit considering where I'm at in my life, but I will always be happy to support them with some contracting work here and there 
- I plan on moving and want to stop working in May 
- I wanted to be honest about my situation and future plans to ensure I am serving the company the best way I can since I believe so strongly in the vision and am so grateful for the opportunities I’ve been provided

Questions

- Is it worth explaining the details of my mental health?
- I've heard that with mental health, it's good to suggest options to help employer help you - but if I plan on leaving in two months... perhaps just offer to spend my remaining time getting records together for whoever they hire next (I'm in charge of a number of databases that only I know how to read/manipulate)?
- When talking to new boss - do I mention that her management style is stifling and flares up my anxiety? 
(with different words lol)
- Should I mention the awkwardness of changing my supervisors to the CEO? 

Any and all advice would be much appreciated!!! Thank you!!"

(with different words lol)
- Should I mention the awkwardness of changing my supervisors to the CEO? 

Any and all advice would be much appreciated!!! Thank you!!

60urht,7,2017-03-22,How doable is transitioning to a management role?,themooseexperience,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60urht/how_doable_is_transitioning_to_a_management_role/,"As a disclaimer, I'm aware this post is a lot of speculation and I'm aware it's pretty vague - I'm hoping to get many different opinions from many different areas of the field. I'm a sophomore at a target school with a decent GPA majoring in CS and also minoring in Business. I have my first SWE internship at a Fortune 50 Insurance company with a very reputable program this upcoming summer. 

I very much enjoy programming and have built a few smaller-scale projects on my own, but at the end of the day I would still lump myself into the ""work to make a good salary to afford what you really enjoy"" category. CS isn't my life, and for all intents and purposes let's say I'm most interested in making money in my career (which is often stigmatized here, but I feel that it's totally okay to want to work to make as much as possible). 

Anyway, my question is as the title states: how difficult would it be to switch to a management role? I know CS can have a bit of a salary cap, where as the more people you manage the more your pay tends to increase, seemingly continuously (spending some of my younger years living in NYC I have seen this firsthand). I would say my social skills are probably the strongest part of my ""complete package"" and I have no issue managing people and being proactive and, for example​, straight up asking a boss for more managerial type work if the opportunity presents itself. 

So, do you personally have any experience with or know anyone who has transferred from a programming role to a management role? And if so, how?

60w2qf,2,2017-03-22,Young mechanical engineer laid off for 2nd time in 1.5 years - how to move forward?,jedi_andcheese,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/60w2qf/young_mechanical_engineer_laid_off_for_2nd_time/,"Hi all - I'm a young engineer, graduated in 2015, and have been laid off for the second time since graduation this week. I'm going through waves of seeing silver linings (a chance to become healthier, try some new recipes, reconnect with myself and family, read, exercise, etc.), but I also go through waves of 'why me', 'is this somehow my fault', and general hopelessness. I was recently diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and OCD, and cannot help but think this was part to blame for me to become a less efficient employee, and therefore was one of the few to get cut. I am thankful for my medication, and I don't think I would be able to handle this second lay-off without the recent stability the SSRI's have provided me. 

I've got a BS in Mechanical Engineering, with a couple internships, and just under a year and a half of engineering experience. 
I'm considering continuing into this niche (energy engineering, i.e. running simulations for virtual buildings as part of utility incentive programs), because I think it's awesome and I love thermodynamics. But, I'm looking for advice because while I love energy engineering, I am concerned about continuing to be laid off. I have taken a couple Python Coursera courses, and have enrolled in a few other, as well as basic HTML and Java courses. I've always been interested in data science and higher level math, but unsure of the chances of getting involved in that type of work with only a BS in Mechanical Engineering. Does anyone have any experience in this? 

As far as finances go, I don't have much savings, living alone in Somerville, but I anticipate unemployment which should keep me afloat for 4-5 months. Leaning on my family isn't really an option - they are barely making it themselves. I was only at this company for just over a year, so I'm not sure if I'm eligible for severance but figured I'd call HR today/tomorrow and give it a shot (anyone have any experience with this)? One comfort is that I have received overwhelming amounts of support from various other engineers who have reached out and passed along their support, kind words, and offers for references/to help out any way they can. I really enjoyed my time with this fantastic company, could see my progress and knowledge increasing, and honestly pains me to see that job end. Unfortunately, these engineers are in other parts of the country, and working with any connections they have does not seem to be in the question. Any advice on any of the above (thoughts on pursuing energy engineering in this political/environment climate, transitioning to data science/computer science with the help of Coursera with only a BS in Mechanical engineering, how to move forward, any kind words)? 

When I was laid off before, I sort of slipped into a dark hole for a few months, and did a fantastic job of isolating myself. I'm trying not to do that now. "

During the interview they said I'd hear back in a week or 2 to tell me if I got the job or not. Can I count on this being my summer internship or is there a possibility I still don't get it? I have 4 or 5 references if they really want to talk to multiple people and have nothing that will come up on the background check.

When should I begin discussing pay and how many hours per week I should expect? Is it too early to be asking these questions?  As a Junior going into my Senior year as a Computer Science major with 1 year IT experience what is a reasonable wage to ask for? The internship is in Washington, DC."

60wjet,1356,2017-03-22,He wakes up when I go to sleep,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60wjet/he_wakes_up_when_i_go_to_sleep/,"Humans don't have a physiological need to sleep. Over time, chemical levels of Adenosine build up which cause the sleepy feeling, but that is simply a trigger designed to force our bodies to rest. Some scientists have theorized that this is an evolutionary mechanism intended to prevent us from wasting unnecessary energy while keeping us hidden during the night. Well there isn't any shortage of calories to consume, and there's nothing going to eat me in the night, so as far as I'm concerned, sleep is just an antiquated fetter which humans should leave behind.  

We don't need sleep to live, but we cannot survive without dreaming. And if you stay awake for long enough, you'll start to dream even while awake. The more you try to fight those dreams, the more real they will become. Pretty soon you can't tell which is the dream and which is real, or whether there is a difference at all. That's the story I told the police, and my attorney, and it's the story I'm sticking with now. 

It started when I read an article in my psychology class about this Vietnamese insomniac named Thái Ngọc who hasn’t slept in 43 years. It said he had some kind of fever, and then never felt the urge to sleep again. Even working full time, it’s like he has a vacation every night. 

I don’t know about you, but for a stressed out college student always trying to cram for the latest test, that sounded like a lifesaver. I’m paying my own way through college with a work study program, and trying to maintain a social life in the half-hour break I have between class and work is absolutely impossible. I'm tired, and stressed, and missing out on what is supposed to be the best years of my life because I never have a free moment to be myself. If I could find a way to waste less time sleeping though, maybe things would get better.

I did some more reading and became obsessed with the idea. If we sleep for 8 hours and are awake 16, then eliminating sleep would be equivalent to adding around 40 years to my lifespan (assuming an 80 year life). I found some studies about a drug being tested on mice called Orexin-A which was supposed to completely eliminate the need for sleep. It hadn’t been approved for human trials yet, but there weren’t any negative side effects found in the mice. If anything, they seemed more active than ever. And the best part was, research for this drug was being done right at UCLA where I go to school!

Well I was able to find where the lab was easily enough, although I didn’t expect them to just hand me the chemicals. I tried to get an internship there, but they required at least twenty hours a week and I couldn’t even begin to fit that into my schedule. I forgot about the whole thing until I overheard Ricky, one of the other kids in my psych class, mentioning that he got the internship.

Ricky was boasting about using the keys to sneak into the lab at night and get high off the anesthesia they used on rats. If he doesn't sound like an idiot yet, then add a tank top that says ""I party with sluts"", a hat with the ""obey"" sticker, and a skateboard which he carries around to look cool but doesn't know how to ride. You got the idea. 

But that was fine with me, because it made it a simple matter to pretend to be his friend. All I had to do was turn my hat backward, make a couple dumb jokes about the blonde sitting in front, high five him when she bent over, and voila. Suddenly we were bros. Future of American science right here.

It didn’t take many hints before he invited me into the lab. I found where the Orexin-A experiments were just by looking up the faculty directory in charge, and before my “buddy” finished coming down from huffing anesthesia, I had a whole backpack full of the little spray bottles of Orexin. It was nasally administrated, but I didn’t care as long as it worked.

And holy hell – it worked alright. Twenty squirts up each nostril (seemed like a lot, but I controlled the dosage to 1mg/kg body weight, which was equivalent to the dose the mice were getting). I played Skyrim straight into the dawn. Okay, so it wasn’t quite self-actualization, but I hadn’t had any free time in awhile and it felt great to have the constant pressure off me. The night was so quiet, and by the early morning it felt like the entire world was made just for me. I didn’t even feel tired until the following night, and I just took another dose and all the weariness washed away. I spent the second night reading Shakespeare just for fun. How else would anyone ever have the time for that? There was so much to do and learn about the world, and finally I had the chance to do it all. It was the best thing I could have ever hoped for.

The one thing the mice hadn’t mentioned during their experiments, however, was that you can still dream without sleeping. They started on the third day, little visual abnormalities that danced around the corner of my vision. Patterns, or shapes, or textures just drifting idly by. I actually enjoyed them at first, but the longer I went without sleep, the more real they became. By the fifth day I actually started seeing fully formed people walking alongside me. They were always in my peripheral vision, and as soon as I turned to face them, they disappeared. 

It was the evening of the sixth day when I opened my bedroom to see a smiling figure sitting on my bed. It didn’t even have a face – just teeth which wrapped all the way up around up to where its ears should be. I splashed cold water in my face and the thing disappeared, but it still freaked me out. 

I decided to take a break from the drug then, but even without it I couldn’t sleep that night. There must have still been some in my system. I tossed and turned, and every time I got up, that figure with the teeth was there watching me. Every time I jolted myself awake, it would linger a little longer in my room. Just silently smiling.

I managed to get through the next day – still off the drug, and still seeing the creature out of the corner of my eye wherever I looked. I got used to him though and even began to nod off during the psych lecture. After class, I decided to call in sick from work and just go sleep. Ricky was trying to talk to me, but I was so tired I couldn’t even figure out what he was saying. It was hard to even look at him with the creature standing next to us. I just mumbled something and turned to leave, but the idiot kept following me.

I shouldn’t have shoved him, but I was so tired I couldn’t deal with pretending to be his friend anymore. He stumbled back a few paces – right into the smiling creature. The weirdest thing was, I swear he bounced off the creature and looked over his shoulder. It seems stupid to think he could see my dream, but I was so tired I wasn't thinking straight. I just bolted and ran. 

Ricky was still following me though - he was insistent. Something about there being a security camera at the lab. That we had to get our story straight about what we were doing there. I don't know. I just wanted to get home. I just wanted to sleep. I ducked into an alley between the psych and sociology buildings, but I couldn't lose him. He grabbed my shoulder and pulled me to the ground, and I didn't have the strength to fight him off. I was too tired to get up, so I just lay there and let him yell at me. My mind was so numb with exhaustion, even the sound of his shouting faded into a gentle white noise, and I must have fallen asleep right there on the ground.  

His body was mangled almost beyond recognition. The police told me there were witnesses who saw me jump on top of Ricky and bite his face into a bloody pulp. They said I had some kind of inhuman strength, and that it took almost a dozen people to drag me off him. They said I hurled him like a rag doll into the building, dislocating both his shoulders and smashing one of the bricks into powder. I don't know how I could have done it while I was asleep. All I know is that when i was about to drift off, I saw my creature standing behind Ricky, and the last thing I saw before closing my eyes was its teeth sinking into his neck. 

The court blamed the incident on the drug and I've been transfered to a rehab clinic. It's been four days since I've last taken Orexin, but the creautre hasn't gone away. Every time I close my eyes, it’s sitting a little closer. Sooner or later I’m going to fall asleep, and it's going to take control again. I'm writing this because if I can't stay awake, I want someone out there to know. 

Don't blame me for what he does when I'm asleep.  

I'm fighting it for as long as I can.

This was originally posted as a comment on one of the threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/60bm5m/special_snowflakes_part_4/df56v01/?st=j0l7saw2&amp;sh=99e29aa0). It happened 2 years ago and I was not present for any of it, but I have two eye witness accounts that depict the collosal idiocy. One is from my mother (not tech savvy, but knows enough of the ""computer speak"", as she puts it) and she had no part in story development except that she is the original source for this story to me and rellayed the gossip to me (but will be mentioned nonetheless), the other is from my friend who was part of the team that created the software in question. This has little to do with actual TechSupport, because the team in question was denied the right to do the software by the book and had no chance to actually do any TechSupport because their support contract had ended abruptly.

Cast:

* $Boss = CEO of the company (50-ish)

* $BTW = $Bosses Trophy Wife (late 20s)

* $CTL = Contracted team lead

* $CTF = Friend that was on the job (graduated CS last August)

* $TS = ""The software""

* $ArchiveSorceress = My mother (name explained later)

* @ML[2] = Men of Law

* @SG[2] = Scape Goats that took the fall, aka. the accounting team

* $EL = Expensive/Elderly Lawyer ($CTL's dad)

Let's commence!

**(The Idea)**

$Boss made it big selling shoe polish and then decided to mix things up. He bought vinegar processing factory and wine cellary, leaving his shoe polish days in the dust. He got a divorce and married this unsatiable, unbecoming woman that just got fired from ""the big, proper company"" and who started to ~~change everything to the way it was at her old office~~ raise the quality of the work environment. $BTW had some nice things done, but for not so good of a reason. Only one thing was missing. Partly because of the routine, partly because she was a golddigger, $BTW wanted to have access to the accounting info and remembered $TheOriginalSoftware and how someone was praising it for being ""so goddarn easy to use and had all the info one could ever need"". The problem was that she had no idea what set of 0s and 1s they were using at the old firm so she had an epiphany - ""I'll have $Boss make one just like that, but made easy so I can count every single $, £, penny, cent, button,... that gets into our bank"" - and relayed all she ~~wanted~~ had at the old job to her ~~gold shitting retriever~~ husband. He wasn't excited by it, but he was compliant.

**($Bosses incompetence)**

$Boss rushed forth boldly to make his damsels wish come to existance, but, unfortunately, he had no idea who to contract as the only IT in the small town of $Cantpronounceitwithahumantongue had no idea how to do that. $CTF was a junior and started an internship at $CTLs firm. His mother was so proud that she told everyone that her son was ""a big deal IT, and not yet out of college"" and eventually someone told $Boss about it. As it goes in this part of the ~~shitter~~ world, $Boss called $CTF directly and said roughly:

&gt; I have a job for you and your team. It's super important to get here as fast as you can

&gt; $CTF : Who was this again?

&gt; $Boss : It's $Boss from $TheCompany. A little bird told me that you are a big shot computer guy in $TheBigTown4hrDriveAway and I have just the job for you, you will love it. Get your team and be here in half an hour *click*

&gt; $CTF : *screaming internally*

$CTF was no Encino man, but a man of intellect, so he told $CTL how he got offered a job from $Boss that would possibly need a whole team and that the meeting was already set. $CTL was unhappy how he wasn't contacted first, but agreed to go there and check things out with $CTF.

**($CTL's incompetence)**

$CTL and $CTF mount the German chariot with 450 horses and a crosshair on the frontmost horse and rush to $Bosses work quarters where $Boss informs them on his needs. No pleasantries, just a cup of coffee and down to bussines they go.

&gt; $Boss : I need a software that works with our accounting database.

&gt; $CTL : OK, what kind of software?

&gt; $Boss : I want to be able to make financial reports and have some nice graphics. Also, to add, update and delete entries. And it needs to look decent from my iPad and iPhone, so I can check the progress on some jobs.

&gt; $CTL : It can be done. *counts the dough internally*

&gt; $Boss : I'll pay you a $SizeableCrapload for it to be done until the end of the month (about three weeks time), and you'll do support when we need you.
$CTL has ~~a fuckup in mind~~ an idea.

&gt; $CTL : $CTF here is one of my best workers and he will be onsite to be accessible to you, he needs a desk, we will supply everything else.

&gt; $CTF *are you kidding me, I'm not up to it* : ...

&gt; $Boss : Sounds great! Let's get some schnapps and celebrate! $SG[1], print the contract and bring it here!

$CTF consults $CTL on the idea he had in mind

&gt; $CTL : Do you know the phpMaker?

&gt; $CTF : Is that the one I worked with on the first assignment?

&gt; $CTL : No, this is much simpler. you need to connect to the database and make a frontend, it's idiot proof so you'll do well. Do everything as he wants and call me if you don't have a check box/radio button/menu that does exactly that.

&gt; $CTF : Thank you boss, I will not fail you.

**($BTW's thoughtlessness and $CTFs work)**

$CTF checked out the software supplied and saw all the options available, so he jotted that down and decided not to mention anything else, just for his convenience. $Boss and $BTW pull him into a meeting.

&gt; $BTW : It needs to be accessible to us. I want you to make it so I don't need a password.

&gt; $CTF : I think it's against your companies policy.

&gt; $BTW : Screw the policy, it's my company.

*no it's not*

&gt; $CTF *remembering what $CTL said* : Ok, so no password, just a username.

&gt; $BTW : No username. I don't want to memorise such irrelevant info, I do a lot of work here, it'll be too much.

&gt; $CTF : But,... *stops dumbfounded* ...everyone will have access to it.

&gt; $Boss : Come on, don't make this difficult to us or we'll report you to your boss.

&gt; $CTF *gulps*

$CTF gets the unimportant (for the story at least) details settled on and goes his marry way. He shared office with $ArchiveSorceress (she holds all the WiFi chants, potions for god-like deeds on the servers, Skeleton keys, Accounting Almanacs and such...) and she was told to share all the info he needs, but inform $Boss if he is asking for something suspicious (he did no such thing). He was done before the deadline, $Boss was pleased, $BTW also, everything worked from their offices, the @SG were trained to use it proficiently and given his contact details in case they needed anything. He informed $CTL, got 10% from the job, regretted telling him about it, and he was done with it for good, *or so he thought*

**($CTF's struggle)**

So everything was fine until the new contract was struck and added to the database. $BTW wanted to check it out from her home, but it just wasn't there, invisible to her measly intelectual capacity. She was enraged, her combo counter ready, target a few beeps away.

&gt; $CTF : Hello?

&gt; $BTW : Listen to me you bastard, you need to get $TS back up right now! I can't access it at all! It's not there! It disappeared from the internet!

&gt; $CTF : Who was this again? (He has zero tolerance to bullshit, so imagine every word that he says following this reply in the most condescending tone he can pull of - about 31.41592% condescending)

&gt; $BTW *in no 'e didan't mode* : You son of a ~~bitch~~ mother, it's me! You made that piece of ~~shit~~ software that doesn't work for me, and it's your fault it doesn't work!

&gt; $CTF : OK, calm down. Tell me when did this happen?

&gt; $BTW : I don't know I haven't used it in $num days

&gt; $CTF : Does it work for @SG?

&gt; $BTW : I don't know.

&gt; $CTF : Can you go ask them?

&gt; $BTW : I can't, I'm at home and if I hang up now, you won't pick up later, I know your type, you good-for-nothing computer dork.

&gt; $CTF : Are you remoting in to your server?

&gt; $BTW : What kind of question is that? Are you trying to confuse me with your computerist (had to use this expression it's just too good; I do not hold the rights to it) mumbo-jumbo?

&gt; $CTF : It's a standard question if you are not on site. Since you don't understand that I'm gonna assume you don't even know how to do it, so I'm gonna explain this simply. If you are not connected to your internal work network, you cannot access it. Capisco? You need to connect remotely or actually be there.

&gt; $BTW : I'm calling your boss right now.
$CTF has some time before she gets the number and tells $CTL what happened and how he reacted. He gets a look of disapproval and just before he gets put in place the phone bell interrupts.

&gt; $Boss *in a calm tone* : I need to see you two at my office tomorrow so we can settle this

**(Inflection point)**

$CTF was scared although $CTL assured him it's nothing. They were both escorted by $ArchiveSorceress into the Executive Meeting Lounge($EML), chatting along the way, no idea they were about to get the greatest news they could've hoped for. In the $EML, on his throne, $Boss, beside him his ~~leech~~ faithfull $BTW, and under his feet two panting lawyers clad in cheap suits and armed with ~~pikes and shields~~ pens and briefcases.

&gt; $Boss : I want to end the contract with you, the lawyers say it's okay since our contract excludes the support and we didn't sign the one about that. I want you to do just one more thing and never see you again.

&gt; $CTL and $CTF : ?????

&gt; $CTL : Can you elaborate a little bit?

&gt; $Boss : $BTW doesn't like the way you treat her, and neither do I.

&gt; $ML[1] : We need the source code for $TS and we need you to execute the final request so you get compensated your trip at least.

&gt; $CTF : The source code is with the $ArchiveSorceress.

&gt; $ML[2] : Good, so we can go on to the next thing. Go put $TS on the internet

&gt; $CTF : Do what now?

&gt; $Boss : Put it on the internet so we can see it from home

&gt; $CTF : But, it....

&gt; $BTW : I told you he was like that, he can't do it, so he didn't do it in the first place.

&gt; $CTL wanting to relieve some of the pressure : Can we consult on this issue for a minute?

&gt; $Boss : Sure, but I need to see you through the glass so you don't run away.

&gt; $CTL and $CTF in unison : Thank you!

Outside

&gt; $CTL : What's the problem, why won't you do it? I'm sick of these people already.

&gt; $CTF : The password.

&gt; $CTL : What password?

&gt; $CTF : Exactly....

&gt; $CTL : ....

&gt; $CTF : They have no password on it.

&gt; $CTL : Are you kidding me? You know the procedure, right?

&gt; $CTF : But they explicitly asked for it to be removed. That ~~bitch~~ lady was complaining about how hard it is to rember it.

&gt; $CTL : Let me call my lawyer. What's the licence on it?

&gt; $CTF : No liability on our part for improper use.

&gt; $CTL : ~~Let them be the victims of their own stupidity~~ You just made my day.

*Cue the $EL carrying the usual mumbo-jumbo he drew up with $CTL some time ago with a few sentences added (goto below)*

&gt; $EL : We need you to sign this thing before we execute the end of contract papers.

&gt; @ML *in unison* : What is it?

&gt; $EL : Standard contact stating that we do not have anything to do with $TS once we end the contract, (:below) and that you demanded our client break your Security Policy.

&gt; $Boss : Gimme dat! *signs* Put it on the internet now, I'm sick of ~~you~~ this

Flip of the switch (virtual) and hitting the door. Chariot awaits, expenses were paid, $EL offers to drop $CTF to class. They are happy with how things turned out.

**(The Epilogue)**

The page was indexed. It could be Googled and popped out right after the generic $AlmostADecadeOldCompanyWebsite hosted from the same server. Work continues as usual and after some time they notice some of the records have been added 

'ClientName: ~~ButtHead~~ Beavis; Amount: One Gazzillion to be payed; Due: $CurrentDate; Added: $CurrentDay-12h(not working ours);' 

Everyone jumped to the conclusion - THEY WERE HACKED. Police were called, $CTL and $CTF also (they refused to show up until the police ~~busted their door~~ politely scheduled a meeting with them. Data was lost. No backups, except for ~~the paper trails printed~~ Accounting Almanacs in possesion of the $ArchiveSorceress. Police shunned them for wasting time on their stupidity, they sued $CTL, but they were rejected at first hearing and so @SG took the blame for not caring for the data and had to do unpaid overtime for 3 months to get everything into the database the old way. @SG both retired since. $TS was scrapped and never used before. $CTF was questioned extensively by me for the 4 hours, and still came short on details, therefore, aforementioned embellishment. He moved to another company since and is still condescending (unfortunatelly, I had the chance to intern there for 2 months and he was my ""mentor"", thus pointing all the condescension towards me). The company survived and $Boss never listened to $BTW again (or at least I wish it were so). $ArchiveSorceress had a surgery and is recuperating for 2 more months (still gets calls about the WiFi chants)."

i am 23 and live in La Paz Bolivia a city in the hearth of sud america, im finishing my degree in systems engineering next year and thinking about moving to US, i have some questions about this:

-wich are the best states for working in software development?

-should work and get experience here before triying to go to USA?

some information about me:

-i started making video games 3 years ago, im a game designer and a programmer in the dev team we have, we use C# in Unity3D for development, also have used Fmod, OrkFramework, and a litle of Wwise plus some other small assets, we have some small games that i plan to put in my portfolio, nothing too fancy, we are now making our first serious game that we are planing to be a narrative ARPG, the first prototipe got elected as one of the best in the 2016 national contest Eduardo Abaroa.

-i know its hard to live by making videogames so i am also learning web development, i can use HTML, CSS, GIT, also a litle of mysql and im learning javascript, angular and planing to learn D3 next, hopping to have a working web portfolio by the end of the year and start adding web and game dev proyects there.

-i am the team leader of our litle dev studio, tought we are a thing only in the bolivian videogames asociation that is not well known even here so that may not be of any help?

-i have some litle experience in desktop applications and movile apps made with java, i dont really like that but if it gives me a work i take it.

-i got really sick a year ago and had to leave university for a year so that lowered my averagte score a lot, wich was just regular to begin with, maeby that will be a problem?

-i have worked with a small company as an intern, there i helped with web dev and some augmented reality in unity3D for android.

If you have any recommendation for the citizenship process that may help too
Also if I should be pointing towards other place I can take the advice

**Pros:**  
1. Undeclared/Undecided - I originally applied as a Computer Engineering major but was put into Undeclared.  
2. Flexibility - say I don't like engineering, I could pursue something else  
3. Cheaper - While tuition is more here, I live close by and will commute after dorming the first year, cutting the cost.  
4. Comfortable with the area(Irvine)  
5. E-sports Lounge  
6.  Can Easily find an internship/job because of the growing industry in the area  
7.  Food in the area is good (personal preference)  
8. I will probably purchase a Disneyland Pass!  
9. I will get a car that my parents will pay for if I commute  
**Cons:**  
1. Irvine is too close to home, therefore making it seem like an unauthentic college experience (I think its overrated anyway)  
2. Irvine is apparently socially dead(I'm pretty much an introvert but I want to socialize and connect with more people)  
3. The school is not as well known as SLO for engineering  
4. Commuting seems like a drag because I have to live at home.   
5. I want a change of scenery and Irvine doesn't have that much new scenery since I live close by  
6. Since I am undeclared, it will take long for me to get the classes I need especially since its in computer engineering.  


Now here are some pros and cons of Cal Poly SLO:  
**Pros:**  
1. It's far enough from home  
2. New Scenery/Experience  
3. Computer Engineering Program is very good  
4. Employers from big tech firms tend to hire from SLO  
5. From what I hear, SLO is pretty sociable with a lot of parties  
6. Since I am already in my major, it won't be as hard to get my classes.  
**Cons:**  
1. If I don't like my major, it's difficult for me to switch out  
2. It is more expensive because of room and board  
3. Uncomfortable(which could be a good thing)  
4. The area around SLO doesn't have many employers since it is a college town(this is what people tell me), therefore making it difficult to get an internship during the year  
5. There isn't much to do outside of SLO besides Pismo Beach and nature  

My background: Asian male in a middle class household.  
This is one of the hardest decisions of my life and I just need some input from anyone. Thanks!  "

I frequent this sub a lot and I appreciate all that you do. I am about to graduate in May and I am trying to revamp my resume, I feel that it needs some work.

[Here is my Resume.](https://www.scribd.com/document/342752151/Resume)

My last two years of school I have really been specializing in cyber security. I currently hold a cyber security internship, but I am casting a wide net by applying to both cyber security jobs (of which there is few entry level) and software engineering jobs (a lot more entry level). I feel like I will need to build two resumes to tailor to each type of job I am applying for.

I am currently working on cleaning up my github, on which I have a couple of school projects and security tools that I wrote for my capstone.

I feel like I need to revamp the ""skills"" portion of the resume to showcase those tools once my github is up to date and documented. Also should I bother listing the freelance web development experience I have? I basically just built simple webpages and ecommerce stores for people using wordpress, etc and am really not interested in web dev.

Any tips, recommendations, and insight will be greatly appreciated.

60ytr6,73,2017-03-22,(NY) Roommate is trying to move in her boyfriend and/or not pay an agreed upon amount of rent. What are our options?,Nettubs,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/60ytr6/ny_roommate_is_trying_to_move_in_her_boyfriend/,"My boyfriend and I rent a 2 bedroom apartment with a third person. The leaseholder is my boyfriend, and the roommate and I are listed as residents. We agreed to split the rent per person living here rather than by bedroom. We are all students.  

The first issue is that my roommate sent us a message telling us (not asking) that she was planning to move her boyfriend in for the summer because he can't stay in campus housing due to not having a lease the following year. My BF and I asked about splitting rent between the 4 of us because she failed to mention it. She explained that he will split her portion (1/3) with her and that's that. We explained that we didn't find that fair because we originally agreed to split it per person and that adding a 4th person should go along with that. Her response was ""Well I'm trying to cut down on my own costs."" 

My boyfriend also has an internship this summer that is out of state, which he knew about and we all discussed before moving in. This is the second issue. The original discussion we had ended with the two of us (roommate and myself) splitting the rent in half until we finished out our lease. My boyfriend would move the lease to my name. However, she claims she never agreed to this(I believe we have it in writing somewhere). So, I suggested that with moving her boyfriend in she could ask him to just take over BF's 1/3rd if the rent, keeping her payment the same rather than making it go up. 

Her response was that she/he couldn't afford this, so I offered to split the rent per bedroom like before, allowing her to split her half with her boyfriend at her discretion. She did not want to do this either because it's not the ""cheapest option"" for her.

My boyfriend and I are wondering what we are able to do if she decides to not pay rent or attempts to move her boyfriend in without our permission. Ideally we would like to come to some sort of agreement about payment and have us all sign something in writing. This girl can be particularly vindictive and petty and we aren't sure if this will happen. Is it within our rights to evict her? If she decides not to pay my boyfriend is solely responsible. 

TLDR- Roommate can't agree on amount of rent to pay and wants to move her boyfriend in without discussing it with us. Advice? 

*Edit- clarification/rewording



Edit 2- Thank you everyone for the advice. My boyfriend and I both read this over and are actively discussing our options together, from giving her notice to move out and finding another roommate to possibly trying to break our lease and put the whole thing behind us. We are still trying to have a sit down conversation with Roommate before making any official decisions but considering she seems to be avoiding us and not coming home, it might take a while. "

The last two years of school I've been specializing in cyber security, as I personally find it very interesting.  I lead my schools cyber defense team, have competed in the USCC as well as CCDC and the ICPC.  I currently hold a cyber-security internship with a defense contractor.

However in applying for jobs I find very little cyber security entry level positions.  So far my strategy has been to cast a wider net and apply for software development jobs as well.  Don't get me wrong I love programming and have put together a suite of cyber security tools for my capstone and personal projects.  I feel like the best way for me to understand certain cyber security topics is to try to implement something related in code.  

From what I can gather it can be difficult to get that first job in cyber security, and I'm also worried that what jobs I can get would be more of an IT-role.  I'm interested more in the secure-coding side of things, as well as penetration testing (also difficult to get into I've heard).  I feel like my priority should be to land my first job after graduating, and then pursue to transfer into the job that I want.

Also I feel like my resume needs work, currently I have it set up to target cyber security jobs, but I think I need to make another that targets software development jobs.  Those that want to check it out, here it is:

60zdhx,1,2017-03-22,Career advice for an entry-level electrical engineer,portland_engineer,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/60zdhx/career_advice_for_an_entrylevel_electrical/,"Hi guys,

I'm a bit frustrated to say the least. I interviewed for a position at my company in the Portland area for new college graduates, which I was able to apply to since I've been with the company for a year and a half since I graduated... as a technical writer. It required an electrical engineering degree due to the nature of the company (semiconductor software), but it is still obviously not an engineering job. There were several openings for the type of engineering position I applied to, but I was initially told I couldn't apply since I already worked for the company. I found out this wasn't true, so I applied to the last opening for this year.  

Anyway, I didn't get the job. I had LTspice, Verilog, object-oriented programming, and of course EE experience. Not as directly tied to the job, I also have materials science experience, optics experience and have some graduate work done towards a masters. I even knew a guy on the team. The team works on the other side of my hallway, so the hiring manager's office is the first office I see everyday I walk in. The interview went fantastic and they spoke as if I had gotten the job. When they notified me that I wasn't hired, they said it was close but that they went with a candidate with ""deeper experience"". This position did accept master's candidates, so I'm thinking that's what happened. However, it's still really disheartening that I couldn't even get an entry level position which I was highly qualified for within my own company that I've been with for 1.5 years.

I spent 5 years in college getting an electrical engineering degree with minors in both chemistry and math. I worked 14-20 hours a week my last two years of college at an internship doing field work for the power company to support myself while in school taking 18 credit loads a term. I took additional mechanical engineering coursework, and have received a grant to work on research. I have experience working in a machine shop as well. 

I've already been told by several different engineering managers that I'm qualified and a great fit for the engineering role I've been trying to get into. The role I got turned down for was for both a technical and customer interfacing role. I prefer a role that lets me interact with people. I had two different engineering managers approach me about this 4 months into my career (although they didn't have openings). 

I'm applying to a lot of different types of electrical engineering and customer interfacing engineering roles in the semiconductor industry, but I'm afraid that being a female that's taken a technical writing position has greatly hurt my chances of being taken seriously as a candidate. 

I was looking at other people's resume's online and noticed back in 1996 you could get a computer science associates degree from a community college and get a job as a software engineer. Within a year, that guy got a job at Intel that now takes a masters/phd and 15+ years experience (I know this because I saw the same job posting today). Back then you could buy a house on that salary and not have any student loan debt. It makes me frustrated how much easier it seemed back then.

So, what advice do you have? I feel like a completely inadequate failure and I don't know what to do besides spam out more jobs and hope I get a bite. I keep my linkedin profile active and try to reach out to people that I can. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

60zk1d,2,2017-03-22,Career pathways for nuclear engineering student (United States),human08425,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/60zk1d/career_pathways_for_nuclear_engineering_student/,"I will graduate with a BS in nuclear engineering from UW-Madison next spring with a minor in nuclear materials and a minor in math.  I am considering many options for my future career path based on my education, job market in engineering and trade skill sectors, and preferred working hours.

On a previous co-op/internship (8 month) I had worked with reactor core engineers for an electric utility and was given some of their responsibilities.  I mostly stared at spreadsheets and tested nuclear core software, and I  left work most days feeling unsatisfied with my progress and having a strong distaste for office work, despite doing excellent work in improving and automating data processing and documentation.  This has shown me that my desires rest in more active and social work.  I’m not sure if other engineers share the same notion.  I have also learned that I do not have a need for the salary that engineers earn, I’m not opposed to it, but earning $20/hour in a 40 hour week was far beyond what I spent in the internship, and I saved up over half of my earnings over my 8 months.  

From all that I’ve learned about how and where I should work, I know that the most satisfying work is from skilled trades.  My philosophy intervenes here, being a utilitarian, and I end up arguing myself to work for some greater good of humanity, that being creating and promoting clean energy sources.  If the industry is saturated with engineers (which I feel it is), shouldn’t I step aside and let someone who would happily look at spreadsheets do the work instead?  Without making my mind up on how or if I should solve nuclear problems, I feel that I’m standing on thin ice on a foggy night.

Note that I use very few modern amenities and am quite happy this way, I can survive on poverty level wages by cooking and repairing things myself (my friends call me amish).  I’d like to live in a town or very small city and would be happy working any job that comes my way.  I enjoy welding and other trades, but have never gone beyond casual under the counter work so I could not be considered professional.  

The career options that I am considering are below:

1. Graduate with BS, find entry level nuclear engineering job at utility or national lab

2. Graduate with BS, find ANY job at utility or national lab

3. Graduate with BS, find job or apprenticeship in trade skill like welding or carpentry

4. Don’t graduate, find ANY job at utility or national lab

5. Don’t graduate, find job or apprenticeship in trade skill like welding or carpentry

6. Transfer to trade school, find career in skilled trade

7. Graduate with BS, apply for graduate studies in welding metallurgy or nuclear materials science


Here is a general overview of my skills.

– Computer (c++, matlab, latex, maple, bash/zsh, linux, CAD, vis basic, general IT knowledge)

– Trades (light MIG/TIG welding for 2 years, some automotive, some woodworking, private pilot license)

– Communication (I believe that my communication is clear and concise, solid presentation skills)

– Given my time with other students in the nuclear engineering program,  I think that I am exactly average on problem solving intuition and general aptitude of nuclear physics.

I have the following concerns which should be criticized:

1. The market for nuclear engineers is declining (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/nuclear-engineers.htm)  and the 20+ schools that offer a nuclear program and prior engineers should be more than enough to fill the need for nukes.

2. Very few plants will come online in the next decade, potentially only 2.

3. National labs will only hire nukes with Ph.D's or MD's with much experience.  My expected graduating GPA (~3.1) will put me out of preference for graduate school, and I would prefer to avoid grad school.

TL;DR  -  I feel that although the nuclear industry is very important, and I will always advocate for nuclear power, my career prospects might be limited and I may not lead a happy life with a career as an engineer for the same reasons I would not enjoy life in any office job.  I am almost done with college, and feel that it would have been wasted if I went off to become a welder or any other tradesman.

&amp;nbsp;

Since in NYC, many start-ups offer no salary for interns which is like crazy illegal in Minnesota where I come from. I used to get $22/hour working as an intern in Rochester, MN.  But here almost all start-ups offer no salary for interns.........so I assume the new price I'm going to get will be very low. 

&amp;nbsp;

But I don't know how low that would be and I do need a bottom line reference since I will quit if my boss tries to de-valuate me. This morning I heard a smaller company offers an iOS guy $5 per hour.........which makes me super uncomfortable. I don't know what's happeing to this field, really. Bubble bursting? 

&amp;nbsp;

So does anyone know what's the average market price for a part-time web/iOS developer in NYC start-ups? Thank you!

PS: I have about 6 months experience and a BS in CS from a decent state-university. I'm 100% sure that my boss likes me a lot and I get along with my colleges. It's a 15-employee start-up company. "

I've been trying my best to apply to internships and such to really strengthen my resume, but have had no luck. I'm paying for college alone and taking out loans, so I've been getting kind of desperate. All of a sudden, at a frat party, two MBA professors walk in. I think to myself, damn this is my time to shine. My biggest talent is networking, I can make friends with anyone. So I go up, we talk, I mention my interest in being an entrepreneur. One guy gives me his card, then I set up a pong game for them! I emailed him two weeks later and I have a meeting with him this Tuesday to talk about internship opportunities over the summer.

I am so fucking happy, man. Wish me luck.

I am a 29 year old Female that just finished a masters in Linguistics. I have spent the last year taking pre-req courses as a second degree student in CS at my state university as well as a few CS courses (3 Ruby on Rails courses, SQL &amp; Intro-CS). I started an internship at HP a week ago so it's too soon to judge my impressions there.

I am here because I am not sure what I should pursue and would like some advice. I have three routes I can take:

1) I can study next year taking linear algebra, prob/stats, intro CS 2, data structures, and systems programming, as well as continue the undergraduate research I am doing in NLP. Then go into the Masters program (2 more years) focusing on NLP. Seems like a natural pairing with the Linguistics but I am not sure if I can cut it. I am interested in NLP and ML in general but a little worried that the meat of it will chase me off. I am simply not the type of person to eat, breath, and sleep this stuff, which isn't to say I wouldn't work my ass off, I just won't go reading about it every time I have a spare minute. I believe in work-life balance and don't plan to be someone who is completely consumed by their work. I have other interests. (3 more years of school)

2) I forget about NLP and just get another undergraduate degree in CS. I find this particular track the least appealing but maybe it is necessary. (3 more years of school)

3) I really enjoyed the Ruby to Rails certification that I did, which made me consider if I should just round out my web dev with some extra javascript, angular, and even the C# &amp; .NET stuff offered through my local Code Camp and call it a day. 3 more months of training and I am ready for a job. I am a little antsy to get into the work force since I have been at uni for 8 years now.

Basically, I am tired of being a poor college student, I am almost 30 years old, and I am not sure if I can be successful in NLP without giving up everything else I enjoy in life. Any advice about going with a particular route would be appreciated. "

I am nearly 29 years old. I graduated with associates of arts and then a bachelors of business administration - finance. I chased money with finance and was never reeaaaaally interested in the type of work which led me never to pursue a job or internships in finance.

The last few years I've been in sales, but I never really enjoyed it even though money was ok. I've always been interested in software development but I felt the need to chase what i believed would net me the most money, so I never have gotten more into it than a few college courses

Going home grumpy everyday because I hated my job really wore me down and caused me to, understandably, lose some relationships. I decided I wasn't going to live my life doing something I wasn't happy and fulfilled doing.

Which leads me to now. I'm struggling on what best option is to begin a career in Software Dev. I posted in a few other subs and got some decent feedback.

Most of what I got was to forego more traditional schooling. I still have old student loans I am paying off and don't want to get into too much more debt, but I am willing to work multiple jobs and go to school if need be.

I guess my question is where should I begin? I have been looking at some ""bootcamp"" style options such as bloc.io and the Firehose Project and was wondering if anyone has experience with those and if they would be good for someone like me struggling for direction on how to start.

Firehouse seems shorter, but much more affordable. 

Any advice on these or if I should be looking elsewhere would be incredibly helpful. I'm tired of chasing my own tail around!"

I've posted here a few times before and gotten some responses that seemed more targeted for people recently out of college or looking for internships. I have 7-8 years of working experience. Unfortunately a lot of that was in a city in the Midwest at not great companies doing mostly web development, so I'm a bit behind. I have good reasons for it -- shitty job market, was in a relationship, etc. -- and I now work for a fairly successful startup in my home city, but I'm looking to leave to a better job market where I have more options. I'd like to move into a mid-level backend engineering role, somewhere with room to grow. My current company has little career advancement opportunities and I haven't found anything else very appealing in the area.

I've been studying for a year or so now and interviewing here and there to get practice but I wanted to see if anyone had been through a similar experience. What did you do to convince recruiters you were worth it? Did you do anything besides practicing coding problems to prepare? I tend to struggle on the algorithms / challenge questions more so than the verbal / behavioral questions where I am strongest.

Should I Stay?,floridaguy25,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/612xw2/trouble_keeping_talent_in_government_should_i_stay/,"I work within the federal government in R&amp;D, and we recently lost our intern (BS Mech, pursuing MS Mech) after 2 years to the private sector.

Our offices manage different projects within DoD. It can be very hands-on -- we work closely with different companies who develop the technologies we request, and a lot of the products are really cool.

But, we're also project managers, and there's a mountain of paperwork that always needs done. Very often, more time is spent on paperwork than real engineering activities. And given the seniority of other engineers on our team who dislike paperwork, our intern found himself constantly dealing with documentation since they were more than happy to delegate.

I think this is one of the primary reasons we lost him. He's just starting his career, and he needs to be developing his skill sets. As a mechanical engineer, he wants to do more design work and other hands-on tasks. I wish we could have provided that opportunity, but the day-to-day emails, forms, and bureaucracy kept getting in the way of true engineering.

I completely understand his situation, because I used to be the intern before I was promoted. But, after spending time training him how to do the engineering and the paperwork, only to see him jump ship, I'm wondering whether I should jump ship too.

*****

I'm also just starting my career (BS and MS Industrial Eng, under age 30). But with the serious lack of young people in the government, somehow I skipped the work that junior engineers typically do and catapulted into project management, research, and publishing in scientific journals. There's a big need for it, and the government has trouble recruiting and keeping talent.

I'm afraid I did this too quickly though, and I'm afraid if I try to make the leap back into the private sector, my skill set won't match what those companies are looking for for someone my age. I think our intern felt the same way.

On the other hand though, a significant portion of the federal workforce is retiring in the next 5-10 years, including half of my team, which means there might be significant upward mobility.

I'm not sure what I should do. I'd really appreciate any advice!

TLDR:

BSIE/MSIE under age 30 weighing whether to keep a bureaucratic government engineering job with strong likelihood of promotion...

or

... jump ship and go to industry (after seeing my junior engineer do the same thing) before it's too late to develop stronger engineering skills."

I'd honestly be okay with even an offer 10k less than my current one but I don't want to be rude by basically saying ""pay me this or I won't accept"".

I'm basing my expectations on their glassdoor salaries and also her reaction when I originally told her a number I was expecting and it sounded like it was too high. I'd basically be telling her that that would be the minimum I would be willing to accept (which would be 10k less than my current offer).

I'm about to finish up my second year at a small state university majoring in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Software Development. I know that my major immediately puts me lower in the applicant pile for potential jobs/internships so I've been doing personal projects to make up for the lack of an actual Computer Science degree.

I've found that I enjoy Android Development the most so all of my personal projects on GitHub are android apps. I like to think that I know android development to an intermediate level (my personal projects have used REST and Firebase integration with a material design UI).

My main concern is padding my portfolio enough to make me an attractive applicant for internships in Summer 2018 which will also pave the way to a junior developer job after graduation.
Would it be worth it to go through the process of getting an [Android Developer Certification](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/) as well as continuing to develop personal projects in my free time? The certification costs $150 but it would be worth it to me if it helps pad my portfolio enough.

One option is I work part time with a company during my studies fall and winter (year 2 onward).

Another thing to note is that I will get a full-time offer from this company when I am out of school. This is with a smaller company (you might consider it a start up).

Alternatively, I could work part time for a year with said company, and seek internships during the first summer. Is it worth voiding my future part-time and full-time offer to gain some potential big-name internships (1+, I'm relatively confident (72%) I can land a decent one next summer, 2018)?

**Options:**

1. Do intermittent part time (fall/winter) and full time (summer) work with a small company for the next 2 years, and be guaranteed a small-time job after?

2. Take a year of part time (1 fall &amp; winter), get an internship(summer), and then see what I can land after graduation?

$Selben turns to his desk and has WAAAY too much open to open another report, and offers to go back to $Intern2's desk instead.

I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying computer science. This summer I have an opportunity to do research full time doing some stuff that I think is pretty cool. I'm not sure if I would be better off in the long run trying to get more traditional experience with an internship - I don't plan on going to grad school or working in research after I graduate. I have had an internship before, so its not like I don't have any experience, but because I'm going to graduate soon I'm getting a little anxious and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot or anything.

What do you all think? "

Long time lurker first time poster. I graduated in December, started looking for FT in January and the results were better than I expected, got 4+ offers (None from Big 4 but got close 2 times). 

The two main offers were from Company A and B (currently been at A for ~1month).
Offers:

A. 100k Base with ~8% bonus

B. 110k Base with stock options (monopoly money at this point), catered lunch expense dinner and various other perks (ex fully paid insurance and gym.)

I wound up going with company A, due to laid back atmosphere and good hours (Ex: get in @ 10 leave @~530ish), which agrees with an inside tip a friend who works their told me (works on a different team). The downsides with company A I knew going into it were tech stack. They utilize a monolithic PHP driven app/api to power their system. However, they are a major player in their space.This coming from two internships in Python was a downer, but I did not think I would be unable to program in another language as I have always stood behind that languages are just tools. Also the app is hosted on a private data center, with only new modern services being hosted on GCE. I do get a little discouraged/frustrated when tasks that would take me 1hr in another codebase/language take me 5-6 hours in my current spot. The whole app was built in house and not with an OS framework, so things are done as they were originally implemented. I've observed 3 different ways to obtain query parameters from the request ./shrug.

Company B on the other hand utilizes Python/Java on the backend with Mongodb as the DB for certain services and Postgres for other. The overall architecture here seems much more modern and with the times,smaller modular microservices. The perceived downsides of company B was they came off a bit ""stuffy"",but that is mainly for the part of their company that is client facing. They are a medium sized company (so is A) of ~200 people. They also had some ex-Googler's/Big-4 people with some impressive resume's on hand and in key positions. Last round of the onsite interview was with the CTO, intense smart guy who called BS on something I claimed I did during an internship (called BS by asking me to pseudo-code it on the spot). Their interview process was much more rigorous and typical of what is posted on this board with, easy-&gt;medium'ish leetcode type questions. The people who interviewed me were chill, and one did respond with a lengthy answer to a lot of questions I had afterwards.

Anyway I am a month into Company A, and having some doubts. I may just be new to PHP and their code base but I find it cumbersome and sort of dislike it (I recognize my opinion may be biased because I have 1000's of hours with Python ). I am just not as enthusiastic about using it as I am other languages. Partly because I feel investing time in it won't be so transferable for the next place I go. Additionally, I am on a small team, and on any given day half the team is working remotely. Which is awesome for future me, but not so awesome imo now. However, the job is comfy and the team members are chill af and so is my boss. But I do believe this team does not have the rigor a lot of people discuss commonly on this board. On the flipside the place is super chill, and is no BS in regards to the work life balance.I read a lot that your first job or first two years as an engineer is when you should learn most. While there is much to learn here, I have my doubts. 

What should I do fellow cscareer'ites. Ride it out for a bit and see if PHP and such grows on me, or reach out to Company B and tell them I may be in the market again and give them first dibs. Is enjoying your work/the tool you use important to you."

My problem is that I have absolutely no projects to put into my current resume (I tried to use my school projects, but I can't access the test data for the unit tests, which makes my projects look shady if I have nothing to test).

I'm sure most of it is mentality, but I'll try to give the TL;DR

1. Had terribly hostile high school experience, never really gave thought to what I wanted to do due to dealing with this. I was isolated and addicted to video games.

2. Very intelligent, but didn't ask questions due to not wanting to reflect badly on my race (African-American) (which was an incredibly stupid line of thought and dumber for not asking questions 

3. As a result, cultivated a bad relationship with the more complex maths and sciences. Last time I did ""real"" math was junior year of HS, statistics don't count imo. Well they do but they're for a different purpose.

4. Went to Sacramento State in Fall 2011. I was in ""fun/chill/play"" mode and literally chose a major without doing research- I thought it sounded like what I needed- Digital Video (within Communications) to work at Pixar (LMAO). Found out it wasn't for me, didn't do research again so I decided to stay in the major but change concentration to org comm.

5. Picked up a minor in management of human resources STRICTLY to feel better about my choice of major.

6. Like always, I felt like I was going with the motions, I didn't feel passionate about what I was doing. It felt like a slog. In the Spring 2016 semester discovered an interest in STEM (specifically something with computers, maybe programming, IT, or cyber security). I was too far into my major though, so I went ahead and finished in december 2016.

6. Working at a city hall as an adminstrative intern (such an insulting title given what I actually do), and at hte grocery store around the corner from my house (which makes me think why did I go to college every day that I work that job).

7. These things are temporary but I'm not sure as to the best way of moving toward my goal of working in tech. I'm thinking etiher IT or software development- I Just want to make a difference. I have an interest in working in software development for the healthcare industry but I'm not sure what that looks like.

**tl;dr: Went to school. Chose wrong major, like I was on auto pilot the whole time. Discovered interest in STEM, specifically software development or IT, but might be interested in something else in STEM as that's how I think. Unhappy with the temporary jobs I have.**
What should I do?"

617s5l,3,2017-03-24,TAG into UCI or UCSC?,DemiPixel,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/617s5l/tag_into_uci_or_ucsc/,"So recently I was rejected from UCI but I was accepted to UCSC. I'm interested in majoring in computer science. Here are the two options I've been considering:

**UCSC**

It's not a bad school and, although ranked lower than UCI most of the time, is still a UC. Unfortunately, it seems to be a tad more of a party school (or at least has a reputation for that), and Irvine's dedicated computer science school makes it a more attractive option. I could always apply for standard transfer to UCI in November, but not much will have changed other than getting senior grades (which probably won't hurt my GPA but won't boost it either) and receiving new AP scores. Overall, I wouldn't be surprised if I was rejected again.

**CC with TAG**

My AP's complete 50/90 required credits (as well as covering things like calculus and physical sciences), so I could theoretically do a single year in CC, apply for TAG in September, and as long as I complete all my required CS requirements (done about 8 years of programming, not too worried) &amp; English requirements, I should be set, right? It guarantees me a spot at UCI as a junior assuming I keep my GPA up (should be easy if I just take some CS classes where I already know the content). I live in Silicon Valley, so coming back for internships wouldn't be an issue. Negative is the slight chance of under 3.4 GPA, and also missing out on some of the ""college experience"" for the first year.

******

Arguably they're both great school, however I keep finding myself finding reasons why Irvine might be the right choice (e.g. UCSC is closer to Silicon Valley but UCI has been getting more attentions from companies in that area. UCSC has more of a fun social aspect, but I've heard some goods things from UCI students, and I'm not exactly a party guy anyway).

I'm sure half of you will say ""UCSC is a great school, just suck it up and go there, not everybody gets what they want"", so I'm interested if the other half thinks my idea is too much effort and has too many risks or might be worth it.

******

I plan on talking to a few people at the school(s) as well, I'm just wondering if it's even worth it ignoring all the figures."

1. I heard that you take Data Structures later on around sophomore/junior year. This is problematic isn't it for internships/interviews Freshmen year summer and sophomore year summer? Would i have to self-learn data structures/algorithms if i want to land an internship during those times?

2. How do specializations exactly work? If I specialize in data structures would it solve the first questions problems.

3. How is the social/club scene at UCI? I want to go somewhere where I can make a lot of friends interested in CS. I don't want to feel isolated. I don't necessarily mean I want to collaborate on every homework or anything just to make some friends with similar interests.

4. How are career fairs at UCI? Do most major companies attend and recruit?

Thanks!"

Right before I graduated with a finance degree and minor in economics. The business has been great for me and my family.

But as of last year, with Brexit (Im American) I had alot of clients go out of business which dented my business but not too much. Then overtime more clients are looking for in house marketing specialists with degrees in marketing. Which really didn't exist when I was in school.

I also realized I wanted to change paths of owning my own business (more for security) and apply for outside in house Marketing positions.

What my issue is, is that I just have my own company as a list of what I've done the past 11 years. Most told me they are looking for those that have worked in a team enviroment (even though my teams of managing 20-30 virtual workers and freelancers was mentioned) So Im always turned down. 

Other positions I've been told Im over qualified for jobs unrelated to my current business.

Im 32 and I cant intern because As my business has slowed down from clients going toward prospects with papers that prove they have the education, my 11 year experience and numbers dont matter.

Ive networked and partneted with lots of people but in this industry, once one gets the upper hand, they leave you on your own

So now I fill like I made a mistake starting a business straight out of school before building credentials.

So Im in a spot where Im not sure how to get into a career path because most I dont meet the criteria.

Any advice is appreciated and anyone with experience with head hunters too would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance"

I have an incredibly extensive portfolio and experience with a reputable company, but most jobs state that a degree is required.

Finishing the degree program really isn't an option right now, but I am overly qualified for most of the jobs based on skill level.  I often wonder if the degree requirement is to weed out people who have no formal education, which I have, just not the degree.  I know the worst case scenario is they don't hire me, but I do want to be respectful of the requirements.  Is it worth applying or no?

61b5yb,29,2017-03-24,I believe programming is one of the best careers for somebody with ADHD.,VISUALBVSIC,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/61b5yb/i_believe_programming_is_one_of_the_best_careers/,"First, I want to say that some people may disagree with me, but it's just my opinion. I also want to mention that grammar isn't my strong suit so I'm sorry if my grammar is bad.

For a little bit of background, a couple years ago I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I was just out of high school, and I had a lot going on and I would've been happy being a manager at a pizza place for the rest of my life. Not that there's anything wrong with that, It just wasn't for me. I'm sometimes bad with customers. But anyway, I decided to start programming after 6-8 months of being out of high school and enroll in some classes at a community college. I finished most of the assignments early, and got an internship over summer. I decided to skip the next semester to focus on the internship, and wait until spring to go to a university. 

The greatest part about programming, in my opinion, is that there are so many different languages, and so many different things you can do. You can create web pages, web applications, learn about artificial intelligence and create neural networks, create scripts for machine learning, learn about computer security, be an ethical hacker, create iOS or Android applications,and work on databases, the list just keeps on going. There are SO many possibilities, and right now programmers are going to stay in demand with how much technology is growing. If you start learning HTML and get bored, go work on learning another language that can go hand in hand with it, like JavaScript. Just pick a certain topic and start learning, you can bounce around as much as you want, and you're still learning. And with some languages, the syntax is very similar so you'll pick them up faster.

If you're stuck trying to figure out what you want to do with your life and haven't at least tried learning programming, I would highly recommend it. It's really fun to have an idea and be able to go in and create it and try and figure out how to do it. And for me, I feel a lot better about hyper focusing on creating an application, than I do when playing a video game or something. 

If you're interested, just get on YouTube and look up some tutorials, or download a PDF of a book (not that I encourage pirating, but a lot of books have PDF's that somebody uploaded online).

I really hope this helps somebody or encourages somebody to look into programming!

I want to get (back) into CS but I am finding my title is getting in the way.  I have essentially been working in operations for the past three years and have risen to the rank of ""lead senior service performance engineer"" - leading a team of 4 others.

My CS experience is limited to several summers of internships in undergrad and graduate school, and one year working at a defense company in-between undergrad and my master's program. 

I have never worked on code on a team, or had senior members around to provide mentorship or even had code reviews.

When I apply places, or when recruiters reach out to me, they always seem to be expecting a senior developer or senior data scientist (thanks to my job title).  I typically get dropped out of the running due to lack of experience and/or not meeting their expectations for a senior role.

I want to move out of my current position, despite its healthy salary and job title, due to the infuriating division between ops and dev at my work.  I am fighting the division now...But it is so draining.

Any advice on applying to companies for much more junior level positions than what I am currently holding?

I got two host-matching calls back to back for different projects. 

The first project made me really excited because the host was really chill, the project itself is perfect for me, and it's in Mountain View (first choice location). 

The second project also had a really nice host and we had a really nice conversation, but the project didn't interest me as much and the location is one of my last choices tbh (NYC). The host immediately said she was interested in working with me, while the first project's host didn't say that.

I already told my recruiter that I was interested in working with the first project, but I don't know what to do about the second one because I'm not as interested. I would say no, but I also don't want to start this process over again if the first project's host says no to working with me. Here's a pros and cons list to get a better feel of what I'm factoring:


**First Project:**

**PROS:**

* Great location

* Better familiarity with project and more interest in it

* Good host

**CONS:**

* expensive to live in MTV

* I would be on the other side of the country from family and SO

* host might say no

~~

**Second Project:**

**PROS:**

* Good host, already said yes to working with me

* Closer to family and SO

* A bit cheaper to live in NYC? (not sure though...)

**CONS:**

* I don't like NYC AT ALL

* Not familiar with project and not as interested

Company B is a startup, also wants me to do intern stuff over the summer, and sent an offer starting me at $20/hr.

The good news is there's no contract involved, so at any time I can give notice and terminate my agreement with them, and can stay with company A should they hit me with a better/more stable offer.

So a few months ago, I found out that I got Temple's Presidential (Full-Tuition) scholarship and a $4000 stipend to be used for research or study abroad. Here is my financial aid: http://imgur.com/u939EOv 


Yesterday, I found out that I got Drexel's liberty scholarship which is also full-tuition, except with grants, I recieved 75K in scholarships so it covers everything and goes beyond the cost. Here is a picture of my financial aid package: http://imgur.com/a/A7MIm


I'm still waiting to hear back from Vanderbilt and Brown, but I mainly focused on Temple and Drexel.

My dilemma, I guess, is that I do not know which school would be better? For temple, I really like the community, the school spirit, and how it focuses on having interdisciplinary education (I wanted to minor in either Spanish or a specific history minor), and how I would be able to study abroad. My worries though, is that Temple's engineering program is not that well-know and the program is small. I am worried that it would be really difficult to get internships during the summer. I've been volunteering at a lab at temple for the past two years so the connects could help but who knows. Also, I would have to take out around ~4K in loans every year which I do not want to (first-gen, dislike having to owe anyone).

On the other hand, Drexel has an amazing engineering program (5-year/3co-op). I would like to go into aerospace when I finish college so I feel like Drexel could open those doors to me. Also, due to the financial aid package + co op, I would have a lot of money saved up which I could spend on finding a job farther away. But at drexel, I feel it is too stem-focused, too dead (no school spirit etc), focused too much on getting a job instead of enjoying your college experience, and I wouldn't be able to study abroad, and the schedule is really tough imo (10 week quarters), which might make it difficult to join clubs AND do research. 

So my question is do I go for Drexel, which gives me the most money and opportunity but is really stressful and has a dead community, or do I pick Temple, who gives me less money and less opportunity, but has a school environment I enjoy?

But what's tough at both schools is the diversity. I am a female so it kinda sucks that there is just so few girls. 

I would like to hear your imput into what made you decide to go to your school, and what you found to be the most important qualities to you! :)

I'm currently finishing my second year of 'Systems Engineering' (It's actually some kind of mixture between CS and Software Engineering) in my country. I have a scholarship and without it I wouldn't be able to attend this school (I'd be able to attend a public one though). The thing is that I feel like I've take the wrong approach to learning during the first 3 semesters. I currently have almost no mathematical background of any kind, even though I've already finished all math-related courses, even some of them with perfect scores. The thing is that I have to take quite a few (for my learning method, 6/7) courses every term because of scholarship requirements, which means that I end up learning just to pass the tests and then remember almost nothing at all because of lack of time to really understand the fundamental concepts. I did that with most of the math courses (and the DB course, nice mistake) in order to focus more on the CS related ones. I think it worked well enough to keep the scholarship and learn the basics of programming (specially in terms of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms), but I feel like I'll never be able to pursue postgraduate studies with conficence considering my current math background, and that it took too long to learn just very basic stuff.

Now, my corcern is that I'm getting 'close' to graduation (and an internship I have to do just before that) and I've noticed two things: that I know nothing of even basic real world development (e.g. creating a basic Adroid app that connects to a database) and know even less of math in case that I want the replacement for intership (or job) which is joining a investigation group.

I've already had offers to join investigation groups, but they asked me to learn a few things before doing that (Computational Geometry for the CAD group and basic Biology for the Biological computing one, for instance, because those subjects are not in my curricula and I don't already know about them). The thing is that I have very few time to do that, so I didn't accept. I also had some kind of offer to join a Graph related group, and even though I'm informed about plenty graph algorithms, I can only implement them and can't really prove why the work and don't even fully understand why they actually work in some cases, which I know would be a problem there.

My idea was to learn that back background I've missing through MOOCs/books (or even joining a public school to study math) so I can join the interesting groups and take the cool courses (in my last semester I have to take 4/5 postgraduate courses and also have 2 free election courses left), but that probably won't happen because of time. My last concern is that after graduation I'll have to start earning money somehow, so probably won't study anymore, and then will have fundamental concepts missing basically forever.

I've thought of stopping for a semester to get 'in-shape' for what I've discussed but, would that be wise? I turned 18 years-old a few months ago btw. 

In case that stopping is not a good idea, is it 'safe' to get into market with my current conceptual gaps? 

Thanks in advance. If you know about learning techniques to speed up my learning in the mentioned fields it'd be awesome to hear about them too.

So, I'm looking to transfer in to an Ivy League or other top computer science focused school that can potentially offer me a scholarship. If i'm going to pay the same amount to attend an ivy league, I would prefer the more prestigious school and change in atmosphere during junior year.

I was hoping to hear about others' experience with transferring from a UC to an ivy league. 

&amp;nbsp;


##Some questions I would have are:

&amp;nbsp;

1) What was your GPA and how high should I keep my GPA? I messed up for my first 2 quarters and got a 3.92, and I'm hoping that hasn't set me too far behind.

&amp;nbsp;

2) What are some criteria that would set me apart from other applicants in the transfer pool? I've been able to pick up 2 software engineering internships (one during Fall and Winter quarter and one during the summer) and leadership positions at my school, but I know this may not be enough to keep me competitive.

&amp;nbsp;

3) Can I reach out to University admissions through Linkedin like I do with my job search?

&amp;nbsp;

4) If you were admitted, did the university offer you scholarships?

Recently, I've been offered to stay for 5 more months with a full-time contract. However, I am not sure if I would accept this, because it's very unlikely that I'll be offered a position afterwards. Still, the money is good and could help me cover my living costs and save some extra. 


Anyhow, I am graduating soon and wanted to do an internship in banking, because I lack the banking experience which would be relevant if I want to go for a career in banking. 
I also have internship experience in business development &amp; strategy from mid-size and SMEs.


Thus, I have the following questions:

1) With no banking experience, but ~1.5y of internship experience and a major in corporate finance would it be difficult to land a job in banking/ big 4(no auditing, though)? Not necessarily investment banking... (I also live in one of the financial centres/ hubs)

2) Would you opt for the temporary contract or would you rather do an internship (I haven't landed any internship yet)


Thanks a lot to all read until here :) and I would be glad to read your suggestions.


Cheers and enjoy the weekend"

Saturation in the near term?,panchilly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61gjd5/software_engineer_bubble_saturation_in_the_near/,"The field of software engineering is absolutely exploding in a way that not many predicted. Undergraduates are FLOODING into Computer Science departments, coding boot camps are popping up all over, and armies of international students are streaming into US masters programs. They are all trying join the software engineering gravy train. 

There is a huge wave of software engineers that will be hitting the market soon. Will this trigger over saturation and wage stagnation? This surge combined with an economic downturn could be devastating for the industry.

As a developer with 10+ years of experience this is concerning me. I've heard stories of the last bubble peak (2001) and what is was like after that. From 2001-2004 being ""senior"" and out of work for a full year was not uncommon. As a junior, it was a *very* hard time to break into the industry. I personally knew ivy league CS grads in 2003 who could not find jobs. In the summer of 2003 I was still in college and had to take a summer job doing construction work since internships were incredibly scarce. On that job I met 2 former CS majors that graduated but could not find employment and had to settle for this work. Both of them were from solid schools such as WPI and UConn. 

To me, 2017 seems a lot like the happy days of 1999-2000. It could all come crashing down just as it has before. "
61go03,4,2017-03-25,When should I apply to my dream job?,lupaluposa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/61go03/when_should_i_apply_to_my_dream_job/,"Ok, I little bit of background.
I have a BSc in Physics and during my entire undergraduate, I worked doing research in university labs. I may not have the best GPA (for US standards), but I do have a lot of research experience, more than the majority of undergraduate students. I've always wanted to work in the materials science field applied to energy storage and conversion.  


Two years ago I moved to the US with my husband (he has an H1B and, therefore, I have an H4 and, therefore, can't work) and initially I thought of applying for a Ph.D. and continue with my academic career but a part of me always wanted to work for the private sector, at least for a little a while, just to know how it is and if I would like it.   


The past 2 years haven't been easy (being an H4 is really hard) and right now I am enrolled in a Community College to keep my mind working and I am also volunteering in a physics lab of a university. So, here where it gets tricky, we are half of way of a green card process and I am expecting to get my work permit (hopefully) by the end of the year, so I started searching around for jobs, just for ~fun~, to see if there is anything out there for me. Turns out that I found a start-up that does research on batteries and they have an opening for an R&amp;D position. The company is 5 minutes from my house and the job is basically what I wanted my entire life (at least my adult life).   


Ok, basically they require some experience in a lot of stuff that I do have experience with, but it's been a while since a worked with that stuff and I would need a little time remembering and adjusting, I don't know if that's ok and expected or I need to know everything about every requirement on my first day at the job. I have always been in the academic setting and, besides the horrible stuff we hear about it, it is a learning environment and everything is okay and enough as long as you commit to learning the expected subjects, but I've never worked in the private sector and have no idea if it would be the same.   


Because of my academic background and experience, I feel the urge to apply for the job and in my cover letter tell them my immigration situation and propose that I ""volunteer"" (for free) for the few months that I don't have my work permit, as I learn and remember the things I need for the job, and I get hired after I have my work permit (in that way I will have the perfect experience for the position), but I have no idea if this is a great idea or the stupidest idea. At the same time, they have summer internship positions coming up and I could apply for that but, again, I don't know if it's a paid position or not. Also, I am afraid that if I apply for the internship or I wait for my work permit to approach them, the position will be filled and I would have lost my dream job that I know I would be perfect at.  


What do I do?"

For instance, I took an internship doing frontend work since we don't have any similar classes at my college, and was so glad that we didn't because if I had taken that as one of my first CS classes, I might've chosen a different major simply because I hated it so much. I was wondering if liking certain classes would indicate that someone would like certain fields/companies/projects/career paths.  I'd really like to hear people's thoughts on this in general.

Personally, one of the most rewarding classes I've taken to date is my OS class; we got to work with the Linux kernel as a code base, and I really liked the fact that for most of the projects, I had to understand not only what my code was doing, but what the code base and my project members were doing. I enjoyed it because I felt like I had to have a more comprehensive understanding than I did with individual homework assignments. I have 2 internships coming up with 2 relatively large tech companies, and I haven't matched with a team yet. I was wondering what kind of teams I might enjoy, or I might want to try (infra, ops, prod, application development, etc.) Thanks for any advice! :)"

I am trying to decide which of two professors to ask for my last (3rd) recommendation -


Professor A:
Have been working with this professor since September 2016. Worked with one of his graduate students until Mid-February, didn't achieve much and didn't publish a paper. I got lazy towards the end because I could see that the research was going to hit a deadend and I wasn't interested in the material. However, my research focus that I have developed since then came from a subproblem of this project, in which I did deliver results (but the results became meaningless in the context of the overall project). Since then, I have been studying independently with the professor on this topic and have produced some really exciting results. I think I can publish at least once, maybe twice by December. Also, took his undergraduate class last semester and got an A-. It wasn't a hard class, and an A- puts me in about the 60th percentile (I'm guessing). Overall seems enthusiastic to work with me, but I am unsure if he can write me a strong recommendation based on my weak start and the fact that I got an A- in his class. This professor went to my second preferred school.

Professor B:
Just started working with this professor two weeks ago, hit the ground running. I'm working with one of his phd students and I am optimistic that we will publish one paper by October. I am taking one of his graduate level courses next semester, I expect to get an A. This professor went to my top choice school. By application time I'll only have known this professor for ~9 months as opposed to professor A, who I will have known for ~15 months. Also, while I plan on continuing this research over the summer, I will be doing it remotely, as I have an internship in the bay area. So really, face-to-face time is closer to ~6 months.

Overall I am more interested in the work that I am doing with professor A. I am currently planning on doing my senior thesis with professor A, but that could change if I decide to pursue professor B for a recommendation. I think that professor B will have seen more of my good side but for a short period of time, while professor A has observed my maturation from being a mediocre researcher to a good one, and also helped develop my focus research area. But again, weak start and A- in his class makes me hesitant to ask.

Any help would be appreciated :) "

So thank you everyone who posts career advice here and who makes this an overall helpful and beneficial community. I followed advice that I got directly from this sub and did whatever I could to get out of my comfort zone to land an internship. I sent out 350+ applications, cold-emailed recruiters, messaged people on linkedin asking for mentorship, went to career fairs, talked to professors, etc. 

Overall I'm happy to be pursuing a field where people help each other and I've seen people give crazy good advice and even offer to hook people up who are down on hard times with interviews. Makes me proud to be in this field so thank you!

P.S. to students: It is definitely not too late to land an internship. The only reason I landed mine was because I emailed someone from my career fair 3 weeks after we exchanged information. I figured its been 3 weeks they probably filled the position already but emailed him anyway asking him to take a second look at my resume.

Come this fall I will matriculate in a top 20 LAC in the US. I am a Hong Kong passport holder (which qualifies me for working holiday visas in tons of countries as well) but I was recently given a one-time chance to convert to Singapore citizenship. This leads me to my first question: Should I convert so 4 years down the road, I can go for a H1B1 visa instead of a H1B visa? Can I even trust that H1B1 visas will still exist with someone like Trump at the helm? How hard is it to get a H1B visa as someone from a top 20 LAC? What if I do the 24 month OPT extension for STEM majors instead? Can I transition from that to a green card (EB-2/3?) What are the odds of success for the various routes? (STEM OPT -&gt; H1B/H1B1 -&gt; EB2/3)


Am I correct in thinking that the most likely pathway for acquiring a work visa and subsequently some sort of permanent residency in CA/UK/AU first requires me to work in the US? From what I have read, Canada requires 2 years of professional experience and UK has a tier 2 visa. How competitive are the different options?


Further to the question, I was also wondering - what major/career would make it easier to stay and eventually earn citizenship/permanent resident status in US/UK/CA/AU? I intend to pursue 1 practical major (math/econ/CS) and 2 minors/majors I am interested in. (French/Spanish) Career-wise, I am thinking of gunning for consulting/banking/silicon valley. How feasible/what other options are there for an international student like me? Is this advisable?


Whether I should stop purely at a Bachelor's degree is also something I am thinking about. At least for now, I am interested in going to law school in US afterwards (which will leave me with about 250k in loan debt probably, i.e. a terrible idea, but likely to be very employable. I know pretty little about credit scores and such, but it seems to me that if 250k in debt were indeed so terrible, nobody would do JDs at Harvard then). I may also do a PhD (if I am admitted to a prestigious programme) instead. I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with the above options as an international student and the various possibilities after graduation.


Another question I have is how I can prepare for this, given I am only 19 now. How difficult/advisable is it to gun for summer internships to secure post-graduation employment? Is it possible to graduate in the US and then work immediately in Canada afterwards? How would that work?


Oh yes and lastly pay/some sort of career advancement is pretty important to me. Would my attempt to migrate/secure permanent residency somewhere stultify my career advancement?


I appreciate any responses! Thank you very much in advance!

By now I've heard back from all the colleges I applied to, but I never found the college that I loved and could get into. At this point, I need to pick a college from the list of schools I've been accepted into and I'd love to get some opinions on this. 

Here are the colleges I've been accepted to minus some I feel comfortable ruling out:

* ASU - Barrett Honors program and scholarship
* Colorado Boulder - 6k per year scholarship
* RIT
* University of San Francisco - 16k per year scholarship
* Santa Clara University
* Case Western Reserve University
* Boston University - 20k per year scholarship
* Union College

To personalize this a bit here's some information about myself. I will be majoring in computer science and would like to participate in undergraduate research along with summer internships throughout college. When it comes to the location I do like an urban environment so I'd be happy in a big city and I don't mind being anywhere in the United States it just has to be nice.

It might even be common sense to a lot of you, but it was somewhat of an epiphany to me. Confident people tend to think anything good that happens in their lives are because of their actions/abilities. Anything bad is because of something that’s outside their control.

For example, I have a friend from college who (in my opinion) isn’t the brightest. He got his post-junior year internship through a family connection, and he is at his dad’s firm now. But he carries himself like he derives a great sense of accomplishment from his work. And I’m not saying this to bring him down at all, I know he works hard and earns his paycheck fair and square.

On the other hand, I work for a Tier 2 company in my industry. For a long time, I’ve subconsciously told myself that I’m only here because the Tier 1’s rejected me. In fact, whenever something bad happens in my life, I instinctively relate it to a belief that my inadequacy led to the outcome. X happened because I wasn’t good/attractive/smart/cool enough.

I’m starting to apply this logic to social interactions as well. Every time something goes well, I’ll say it’s further proof that I’m a normal, functioning human being. If something doesn’t go well, I’ll say the other person was busy/in a bad mood/etc. Hopefully, this will help me build up my confidence and someone else’s too."

I worked my way up to management in 2 years, and have since moved on to a larger company in a big city. 

I've been here 2 years and am about to have worked my way up to T3 in a company who's support team has highly specialized knowledge in our industry. We support and repair online streaming by encoders running in a cloud based environment. This job has given me the opportunity to get my hands dirty with some pretty new technologies and our company is regarded as the ""cutting edge"" of our industry.

*All of that being said, I'm still very young and if I go back to college for my BSCS, I'll graduate in 2 years (at 27) with over a decade of experience in IT/Support, 4 years management experience, and 2 years as a high tier support engineer in a technically demanding company.*

I was extremely confident that this would have given me a leg-up (as it seems most people can't even get internships) until I started reading this sub's opinion of the ""dirty stain"" that is being labelled as technical support.

Then I thought about the way the SWE department has treated ours since I've been there and it made total sense. This is really disappointing since (in our company) it seems that the majority of them have their heads planted firmly up their asses. 

It seems like the age-old divide between an engineer and a mechanic. Yes, an engineer has much more technical knowledge than the mechanic and understands things that the mechanic doesn't even consider. But often mechanics have wisdom about the difficulties which arise based on years of use and wear or typical consumer mistakes that the engineer doesn't even think to consider.

This divide is extremely disheartening. In my opinion, our industries are two sides of the same coin and in-depth knowledge of the kinds of issues which arise in the application of products should be regarded as an over-all positive.

...but that's just like, my opinion man.

Anyways, I'd love to hear your thoughts on my situation and how best to tackle it! Thanks guys!

**TL;DR:** I have built a fantastic resume over the last 8 years, but based on this sub's discussions about ""technical support"" stereotypes.. I'm beginning to question even pursuing a BSCS degree.

So, will it hurt me? Help me? or not even matter? I'd hate to throw away a decade's worth of progress in a career.

I'm currently about to finish up my second year in a Computer Information Systems program at a small state university. Since I was young, I've always wanted to do software development so I've declared a software development emphasis at my current school. 

However, I've recently been thinking about switching universities to a school with an actual Computer Science program to increase my chances of getting a dev job right out of college. I understand that CIS is often viewed as a lesser degree and therefore I have to work on personal projects and reach for internships a lot more than a CS student. 

The closest university near me with a computer science program is an hour away - more with heavy traffic or bad weather. I currently live at home and can not afford to live on campus, so my only choice would be to commute roughly two hours each day.

Is the commute worth the more valuable degree in the long run? Or would it be a better choice to stick it out at my current school and hope a CIS degree is enough to get me hired doing software development? 

Thanks guys! 

Edit: There is also the chance that a lot of my credits won't transfer. Some of them will, but I'm reasonably certain it would add at least another year to my graduation date."

I just completed a final round interview for a summer internship/full time job (internship over summer, full time after I finish school) that should let me know by the end of next week. I am worried that telling them this after they offer me a position will seem suspicious or that I was lying on my resume.

I have a lot of questions and I thought this sub would give me a good range of answers.

The areas of specialization I'm most interested in are Computer Vision, Robotics, and Signal/Image Processing. Which ones have the strongest chance of me getting employment (with just the MS) and research opportunities? 

Also, what should I do to be successful in a Master's Program? Two years seems like a lot less time to develop useful skills. And I feel like networking is a lot more important, but I'm honestly not sure how to go about it. Any tips/advice?

Thesis or non-thesis? Industry job is the endgame, but I'm not opposed to doing a Phd if I could get funding. I'm leaning towards doing the thesis, but I'd love to hear opinions from a EE perspective. 

In undergrad, they really emphasized the importance of being active in clubs, both relevant to your major and otherwise. Does this same sort of thing apply in a graduate degree? In a similar note, are personal projects something people do? (Or are supposed to do?)

Are internships during the summer common? Or do people just work on research? And if I were to try and get an internship over the summer, what would I have to do to appear competent. Again, I feel like one year is not a lot of time, and I'm not sure how I'd show a company that I'm worth investing in in that short amount of time. 

Lastly, is there anything I should do/buy/learn/work on before starting the program to help set me up for success?

I'd appreciate any perspective on any of the questions. Thanks so much! "

Despite preforming well in school, it's never been my cup of tea and have really have only dealt with it because it's seemed like the best path. I love CS and learning in general, but for me college has always just felt so redundant, slow, unexciting, etc. I ended up dropping out of high school my second year for similar reasons. 

Anyways, I have an internship at a big4 company coming up this summer and I'm curious if it'd be realistic, possible even, to convert this into a full time position afterwards without going back to complete my degree. I'm pretty confident in my abilities, so I have no doubts about getting a return offer, but I assume it'd be contingent on finishing my degree? 

Just going through the motions at school has been making me pretty miserable lately, and at this point I don't really learn anything new or useful there. So I guess my specific concerns are 1) if and how I could actually make this happen, and 2) how much difference an uncompleted degree would make further down the line.

Thoughts? Has anyone done or wanted to do this, or am I just having some sort of existential crisis lol? I'd like to hear your opinions and advice!"

I've been lurking through this forum for the past few months while embarking on my own journey of getting ready for the GMAT and applying for B school.

I have started to reach out to mentors, people that have went through B school and those currently in it to learn more about it, specifically in terms of relationships. I'm currently in a 1.5 year relationship, and will be moving in with the love of my life this summer. The only issue is that my girlfriend is fixed into the city that we currently live in due to a program she is in, and will likely have to do an internship after this.

The issue becomes this, I can apply to B schools this fall for entry in 2018, or apply next year for entry in 2019. If I apply this year we would be apart for three years, next year only two years. 

I'm looking for help into making a list of pros and cons for when I apply. Some current ones are length of time away from each other and my yearning to break into strategy earlier rather than later (might drive me nuts having to wait). My girlfriend also is recommending I take the extra year so I can beef up my application, with another year of experience and potential ECs. That would mean I'd enter B school having just turned ~27 years old.

My profile is a 3.4 GPA, 730 GMAT for a top 5 program for Chemical Engineering. I have worked for about 31 months at an F100 company in their R&amp;D labs, getting a promotion at roughly 24-25 months in. I am currently on 3 patents, with potential for more in the coming year. ECs involving teaching children at a Sunday school, involvement with United Way, and co-captain of work league v-ball team.

Would the extra gap year help me? Any other things that I should think about when deciding my timing?

I am almost finished with my associates in computer programming and plan to attend a different college to obtain my bachelors. I am having the school help me search for internships for the summer but as the title says I have been having extreme anxiety. 

I have done all the C++, Java and Visual Basic classes required and I use Java for my personal projects and it is the main language I use. I want to become really good with Java rather than know a little about each language as for a beginner I feel that would make me more valuable. I have been using Java for about 2 years. 

Looking back on my beginner projects its obvious that I have come far since then. I recently finished an ftp application and am now working on a bus business system. Some days I really think I am doing good but a lot of the time I never feel like I'll know enough when the time comes to shine.

Would love a bit of advice from people that have gone through this process before. I’ve a self-taught developer that has only been coding for about year and a half. The main resource I’ve used has been the freecodecamp curriculum, and then supplemented with a bunch of books and videos.

Right before I finished the front end part of the project I landed an internship (sooner than I thought I would) in a startup doing full-stack work. It was unpaid, but I figured it’d be worth what I’d learn. It started slow and then rapidly increased. I learned more in that first 3 months than I did the year previously. I was hoping I’d finish the 3 month internship and be in a place where I could apply for dev jobs and land one. I’m switching careers so I’m working full-time in a different industry. Working full-time and doing my internship for an average of 25 hour a week just sucked. But I figured I needed to put in the time. Fast forward another couple months, about 40 applications, 15 phone interviews, and 3 in person interviews, I still don’t have a full-time gig. I’m still technically with the start up and working on a limited basis, but I’m not getting paid. I’m still learning from them, but I put so much of my work for them into a pretty large project that isn’t launched yet, so I can’t really put it in my portfolio. Also, during that whole time I dedicated everything to that project, so I wasn’t working on other side project. It seems that during my job interviews it looks like I’ve accomplished nothing. I don’t have cool side projects to talk about. I have one now that I’m doing since I’ve slacked off on the work for the startup, but I’m not sure how to move forward. Do I stop working with them and risk now learning from a team but building a portfolio, or do I stick with them to keep learning. I don’t get the job search so far. Some of the interviews I felt like I bombed I’ve made it to the 3rd round. Others that I felt like I did amazing, I never heard back. 

This whole process is draining. I feel like time spent prepping for interviews is taking away from my coding with the group, but I feel like if I don’t do that I’m not prepared. Advice on moving forward? Encouragement? 

TL:DR Working full-time, interning, and job search is wearing me out. Do I just suck it up and realize that is what I need to be doing?"

I'm currently applying for Fall of 2017 and was wondering if it possible to get in with only two letters of rec given my background. 

- Bachelor's in Mathematics from MIT (2016, 4.2/5.0 GPA)
- decent amount of relevant coursework during undergrad: Intro to Algorithms/Data Structures, Intermediate Algorithms, Intro Data Science, and Intro Machine Learning (all in Python)
- didn't do too well in these classes (B's, one C), but found the material very interesting
- never got close to professors so unable to ask for a letter of rec from school
- three internships all with the same tech company as an operations analyst, mainly wrote Python scripts to parse customer data and created visualization models

I currently have two letters of rec, one from an old mentor/teacher/employer who knows me very well personally and the second from one of my supervisors during my internship. I could potentially ask a secondary supervisor from the same company, but I didn't work extensively with him and I don't see a strong letter there. Would it be better for me to ask him anyways to have a third letter, or would it be fine for me proceed with just two?

Thank you in advance!"

I will assume that I will not be able to transfer into co-op for second year due to intensive competition. In this case, would the school's name be of much value to me? I have also been accepted into ryerson for computer engineering. They do have an internship program, but you would need a certain minimum average to be eligible. The internship also takes place during the summer after second or third year. I have also been accepted into UTSC for CS co-op. Given these offers, which would be the best one to accept? In short, is Waterloo's name valuable for my CS degree without co-op? Would going to waterloo for CS without coop be more valuable than going to another less prestigious university for CS but with coop?"

**Coms Log of Bioengineering Department** 

Duuarn watched as the screen continued to compile the petabytes of data in front of him. The chemical compositions of every molecule in the nucleotide, fractions upon fractions.  Numbers in the billions of base pairs, numbers of an unadulterated strain. He revered those numbers. Duuarn reached for his medipen and slid the needle with ease under his wrist. He had been tampering his schedule times, claiming rest periods while stimming himself in secret. He couldn’t rest, how could he? Rest was for other people, people who didn’t have to worry about the fate of the universe at large, who clung to traditions for comfort. Schedules, protocols, request sheets, all of it was so tedious, how could they stand to uphold such frivolity when the salvation of the entire galaxy was being forced through a single Genome compiler??

Duuarns ground his toothplate, the stims twitching a tendon in his arm, a known side effect but he wasn’t worried, he had plenty of practise ignoring it. His team had only managed to analyse a quarter of the biopsy samples they had taken of the male. A single cell was all that was needed to extract the composition, but it was hours worth of processing time for each one. At this rate it would take [weeks] before they could properly fabricate an exact copy of the specimen. 

That was time he didn’t have.

Any number of things could go wrong,  The Raiders Isk was convinced existed could actually show up and attack, the specimens could die whilst in captivity, the Galactic Council could turn around and demand the specimens back. THAT was what Duuarn feared most, Essander was only a start up after all, barely 20 million employees, they had received the project on the basis they were the closest and the cheapest. The Galactic council, or any of the creator solidarity governments could demand access to the data he was working on, it was imperitive they finished the work as soon as possible before it was ripped from their hands. Larger Companies could buy them out, merge them into the larger entity and then drop them on some citizenry planetoid thinking that infinite credits would be enough for his silence and compliance.

He wouldn’t let the universe cheat him of his karmic work.

*He* was the one pouring himself into the work, *he* would be the one to be rewarded with his name forever pronounced in the Dynasty records.

Duuarn unclenched his jaw and sat on his desk stool. There was too much work to be done with so little equipment, they needed a larger facility. Uleesia was just too small, too far away from the resources it needed. When the engineers he requested from Head Quarters came and saw exactly the scope of what could be at stake, they would have no choice but to support his efforts. 
Maybe then he would be transferred, to Klona, Tarnend, *Clentesia*… 

The Humans may have been responsible for the copious phenotypes he was ogling, but creator species were just bureaucratic nightmares. The Universe was always changed when a new player entered the arena. Duuarn tapped his toothplate together. If this is what they did to their test subjects, what had they done to themselves?

“Bioengineering Department” The door chimed, Duuarn turned his head and frowned.

“Ceaan, where’s the specimen?”

The fellow Qzetillian was taken back, shocked that Duuarn was *still* in the lab.

“The living quarters…” The assistant answered flatly. 

“Why?-” Duuarn cut himself off and rose from his desk, he clenched his grey hands together in order to control the twitch which had now run rampant up his entire left arm. 

“The specimen has been confiscated by subject Jasmine for an undetermined amount of time”
Ceaan stood firm, but refused to move more than a foot away from the department door. 

“You know, I feel the word *‘Why’* isn't enough to express the exact amount of confusion your presence here conveys;” The department head made his way across the room, his tasteful lab coat billowed out with his strides “and repeating it in the multitude of questions I have is just going to insult both your intelligence and my integrity”

Ceaan narrowed his eyes towards his superior, extra stims made him extra obnoxious.

“I came here to submit the perception test results-”

“Because the *results* for a simple perceptions test far outweigh the specimens *where abouts* and *well being*.” Duuarn could barely contain the joy he derived from belittling his assistant, sarcasm on thick as he delivered the line “Ceaan, I’m *so* glad I hired someone of your forethought and judgement.”

“I felt it was the best course of action.” The assistant defended himself. “Subject Jasmine had no intention of hurting the thing-”

“But you had every *intention* of letting an unauthorised alien interfere with my work? What did you do? Just let her walk off with the specimen?!” Duuarn laughed.

“You weren’t there Duuarn, it was a tense situation, the human looked like she was about to spit her digestive acid on Nyk-”

“You *actually* just let her walk off with the specimen?...” Duuarn was dumbfounded.  “You’re supposed to be a willing and helpful assistant but not a complete *drone*!” Duuarn thrust his right arm behind him “Go and monitor the compliers analysis before I request your ‘nomes be culled from the company recruitment database” 

Ceaan gave a disagreeable toothplate snap, before following orders, standing in front of the compliers screen. Duaarn watched him, muttering a ‘tsk’ and storming over to his Coms terminal. 
How long was it going to take to clean up this mess?

---

**CMO Krydon**: CMO Krydon speaking-

**Dr Duuarn**: Chief, what happened to my specimen?!(&lt;...&gt;)

**CMO Krydon**: Oh, Duuarn, I was wondering how long it would be before you called, Ceean took his time getting back to your lab I see…

**Dr Duuarn**: As much I would love to discuss the incompetence of my staff, I'm here to discuss the incompetence of yours. Subject Jasmine and my specimens should never have crossed paths, how did you let this contamination happen?

**CMO Krydon**: Duuarn, your User specimens are not exactly willing patients, the male almost always needs a security escort and sedation which hampers the results. Your two females insist on pulling out their external translators and only growl refusals when asked why. The delays with their cooperation caused the test times to overlap.  Have them properly calibrated and maybe we’ll both be able to avoid these delays in the future.

**Dr Duuarn**: The translators calibrations are not the problem, they’ve never tried to remove them in the enclosure or the lab. Maybe they just don’t enjoy your lackluster procedural manner. 

**CMO Krydon**: Ah, there’s the sword tongue. Duuarn I’m not going to get into a snarl with you. I have other work to finish.

**Dr Duuarn**: Well I would be happily continuing my own work but now I have to Com around and figure out why the supposedly *professional* staff of this station allowed an *unauthorised, undocumented alien* to bypass all regulation and stride off with another specimen!!(&lt;...&gt;)

**CMO Krydon**: [snort] I’ll send you the footage Duuarn. Maybe you’ll figure it out and save us all the trouble of hearing you speak.

[*Link Terminated*]

Duuarn gave another ‘tsk’ and impatiently waited for the footage to arrive at his terminal. The file was less than 4 minutes long, his black eyes focused on the screen in front of him. First he hissed as he watched the intern Nyk restrain the specimen by the throat, lifting it off the ground. He’d have to be reprimanded for ignoring handling regulations but his eyes widened in shock as he reached the end of the video. The ‘Human’ demonstrated both Zenthi telepathy and Arvas frequency manipulation in simultaneity. He’d only seen such a combination of abilities in the GC’s Millitary gene archives and even then they were restricted to GCR special forces regiments. They were only to be used if the Rajava launched another attack on civilized space. Duuarn brought his left hand up to his chin and deliberated. So *that* is what the humans did to themselves...

***[One Message Received From Behavioral Studies]***


Duuarn sighed, his nimble fingers hovered over the acceptance key, he couldn’t answer Kyda’s message now, as much as he wanted to. He had to get his specimen back, Duuarn begrudgingly made the link to Security.

---

**CPT Rynard**: Security, Rynard speaking [yawn]

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard, I need you to go the living quarters and retrieve my specimen from Subject Jasmine. (&lt;...&gt;)

**CPT Rynard**: Huh?

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard for the sake of the universe would you just listen to-

**CPT Rynard**: Look, Dr Duuarn I know you like to think your job is more important than mine-

**Dr Duuarn**: -it *is*-

**CPT Rynard**: -But you gotta understand that you have to call Isk and not my direct line, I'm off duty and you just woke me from my sleep cycle, I *like* my 4 hours of peace.

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard, Subject Jasmine has confiscated my specimen, she threatened the staff and has both Zenthi telepathy and ‘Royal’ frequency manipulation. She’s a danger to *everyone* on the station and I demand you get off your overpaid tail and retrieve it from her unharmed!(&lt;...&gt;)

**CPT Rynard**: Whoa there… That's a lot of accusations, even for you.

**Dr Duuarn**: I'll send you the footage, I expect immediate compliance and an apology with my order!

Duuarn flitted over the short file and sent it to the witless security guards dataslate. Ryanrds Com link pinged, the corner of Duuarns mouth curved up, maybe Ryanrd had listened to reason.

**Dr Duuarn**: Bioengineering Dr Duuarn speaking-

**CPT Rynard**: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard, once again you have proven yourself less useful than a clogged bidet, this is serious- 

**CPT Rynard**: Oh ha ha, the universe weeps!! I forget how sheltered you *bulge brains* are!

**Dr Duuarn**: *Bulge brains*??!!(*&lt;insulted, infuriated&gt;*)

**CPT Rynard**: Yeah! That was the funniest thing I've seen since I got here! and that’s including when that one tentacle thing got stuck in the atmo’ vent! They all looked like they’re about to stiff it!! Ha ha ha.

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard! How can you possibly see this as a joke?!

**CPT Rynard**: ‘Cause! It’s just like new recruits at basic hearing a Princess for the first time! They think they're so tough then Blam! Funny then and hilarious now! 

**Dr Duuarn**: There’s confrontation and then there’s overwhelming frequency aggression! You know, the thing we hired you to protect us from?!(&lt;Disbelief&gt;)

**CPT Rynard**: That was not Frequency aggression, well, maybe a little, but you science types have no idea! I’m actually kinda shocked you all have so little resolve! Might have to get you all to go through some aggression resistance training heh heh heh.

**Dr Duuarn**: We don’t have it because we don’t need it! What good is resistance to a researcher?! That’s what we hired you for, now go and do your *one job Rynard.*

**CPT Rynard**: Well, *I’m off duty*. Contact Isk if you want a guard, I’m going back to sleep! Heh Arc and Suk are going to love this-

*[Link Terminated]*

A fury drove the tremor in Duuarns arm up his neck and caused his head to shake unsettlingly. He was surrounded by incompetence and indifference. He steeled himself, he would actually have to send a request to the operations manager to get his captured specimen back. The Universe had better have a substantial Karmic reward for the amount of fecal matter it was dumping on him.

---

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Calm&gt;*) Operations Manager Isk Speaking.

**Dr Duuarn**: Isk, this is Dr Duuarn, i would like to make a formal request for security action.(&lt;...&gt;)

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Smug, Satisfied&gt;*) Nice to see you falling in line Duuarn, Now what was your request?

**Dr Duuarn**: I want a member of our overpaid and underworked security team to retrieve my specimen from the Subject Jasmine *Immediately*…(&lt;...&gt;)

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Smug&gt;*) Formal request has been Submitted... and Denied. Please reschedule your research quarters accordingly.

**Dr Duuarn**: What?!(*&lt;Infuriated&gt;*) 

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Smug&gt;*) Dr Xant has already informed the Director of the incident and I have received orders that nothing is to be done until the Director has met with the Subject Jasmine herself to negotiate an amicable solution. Answering aggression with aggression only leads to escalation Duuarn...


**Dr Duuarn**: The one time i follow procedure and you're denying me?! Need I remind you *Isk* that my specimen is pregnant? Her vitals and condition must be constantly monitored-

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Annoyed&gt;*) and they *are* being monitored. Subject Jasmine’s room has a camera installed and Krydon’s office hasn’t reported any vital distress signals from any of the offending parties health detectors… (&lt;Suspicious&gt;) Speaking of constantly monitored, this quarter is supposed to be your rest cycle, what are you doing in the Bioengineering department?

**Dr Duuarn**: I Instructed Ceaan to report to me immediately if there ever was a disruption with my research, even during rest cycles. This work will change the very dynamic of the Galactic Council Space and must have the highest of priorities, I thought someone of your *integrity* would understand that.

**OP Dr Isk**:(&lt;Confident&gt;) Oh I *understand* all too well Duuarn. Your dedication to your work is admirable, but your lack of professionalism is holding you back. Your research can wait half a [day] while we negotiate with the Human. I’ll send you the audio when the Director has finished, This Project isn’t just about *you*.

**Dr Duuarn**: I know it isn’t about *me*! It’s about the Universe… It’s about the *company*! If we can get these Pheono-types pattened before the Human Creators start claiming distribution rights we could be on the verge of restoring Qzetillian *lineage compatibility*. Esaander would be pronounced as a *Progenitor Company*!

**OP Dr Isk**:(&lt;Frustrated&gt;) Once again Duuarn you fail to see the herd from the prey, we need to keep the Humans who created your little specimens appeased. If letting half a [day] of research go wasted means that in the future; we’ll have access to their entire genetic library, then that’s a half a [day] I can overlook. You have two other specimens Duuarn, finish with them before your requested Bioengineers arrive on on station.

---

The tremor in Duuarns body finally ceased. He sat defeated in front of his Coms station. No one in this entire facility had any idea what they were doing. The Qzetillians would be indebted to yet another race if they waited for the Humans approval of the genetic material. No, they had all the information they needed right here, to fix the deterioration, why were they insisting on waiting on the whim of an unknown? Did the Creator Subject even have any understanding of the situation at all?! How long would it take to inform her? Would she even say yes?...

***[One Message From Behavioral Studies]***

The Coms terminal reminded him. Duuarn sighed, his nimble fingers allowing the message to play.

---

**Dr Jess**: Marsen. I know you're going to be very busy arguing to get your specimens back to take my advice now, so I’ll just leave a message for you to get back to me, I might have a way to make you the lead of the User and Creator projects. I'll be awaiting your transmission.

---

Duuarns lips curved into a smile. It was always nice to hear Kyda’s voice, especially when she sounded like she had a plan underway. 

“Ceaan, I’m going to my quarters” He announced unceremoniously, a bounce in his step as he walked. The last time Kyda had spoken a plan to him so breathlessly they had succeeded and accepted the positions as Department Heads together. He couldn’t wait to hear what she had come up with this time.

The problem now is that I don't have an internship lined up for the summer.

I'd like to find something close to the area I'd like to get into, but I'm feeling a bit lost and confused in thinking about what exactly it is that I'd like to do


I'd love to take my CS major and apply it to the medical field somehow. I think doing something like helping improve medical technologies or improve treatment methods would be awesome and super fulfilling. The problem is that I get so lost when I start trying to look into this stuff. I've read about Health IT, Health Informatics, Computer Information and Research Science, and so on, but it's all so confusing and I don't really know where to start. I'm trying to get a better idea of what I want to do so I can (hopefully) find a summer internship closely related to that topic/area, I'm just having a lot of trouble narrowing everything down. I should mention that one potential issue is that I have pretty much no background in biology/chemistry/etc- I only realized that combining CS with something in the medical field could be a sweet combo fairly recently, and I hadn't taken much of anything in the life sciences. Only have 1 semester of college left, so it's a bit late to get into that as well


Apologies if I'm not doing a great job at explaining this stuff, every time I get into it there's just so many different fields with technical jargon and so many different options, hard to tell what's a job for a CS major vs. a biology major, and I just end up feeling more lost than when I started.

Experience: 4 years total programming experience, 1 ½ years as full time software developer. 

- 3 month internship at web development agency (LAMP stack)

- 3 months of my own projects (continued LAMP stack)

- 1 ½  years working full time for a recruiting company on their internal software. Following a lot of best practices here, have learned a lot, and played a big role in our launch of new resume/candidate tracking software as they had outgrown their legacy system. Mix of PHP and Java. Doing mostly backend work as that is my strength. 

Recommendations: 3. 2 current supervisors, 1 formal supervisor. May reach out to one of my professors if needed.

Comments: Realized late in college career that CS was what I wanted to do, but was too late to switch majors so I stuck out Accounting. I stacked up and took about 4 more classes than I needed to for the minor, including: Software Engineering, Web Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

I am enjoying what I do but feel my time was cut a bit short on what I could learn while I was in school. Don’t want to stagnate and would love a chance to learn more and explore my interests further while also getting the official Master’s designation as a step up from the Minor. Just wondering what my chances are realistically since you guys seem to have a good idea of what it takes. I would love to get in for Fall but also realize that window is getting tight with a month left.

So far I've got a solid handle on Java Fundamentals as well as a good understanding of HTML and CSS as well as some JavaScript. 

However since Im going to be applying to places in Toronto as thats where all the big companies are, I was wondering how to stand out against people who are attending more prestigious schools. I know everyone here says to upload some projects to Git, and I'm in the process of brainstorming some projects to tackle that will showcase what I can do, without looking too sketchy.

621ebr,44,2017-03-28,Why it pays to be nice to the Children (Part 1,McCainOffensive,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/621ebr/why_it_pays_to_be_nice_to_the_children_part_1/,"Okay, I need to lay down some ground rules. Recent events notwithstanding, I am legally bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement from hell. I cannot tell you where this happened, I will be circumspect about when it happened, and I cannot go into detail about the science behind what I witnessed working as an intern.

So why am I even writing something that could violate an agreement that will let a certain company own me, descendants, and our souls? Like I said, recent events have changed a few things. Just knowing the Children are still out there somewhere fills me with an indescribable dread because I know, better than anyone still alive, what they are capable of. 

This happened a long time ago, I was in high school then and I’m well out of college now. It started out innocuously, just a summer internship. They started putting up fliers about a month before school was out, advertising that summer intern positions would soon become available at a new research lab and that we should apply now. It would even count as a semester of science credit on top of paying well (to the tune of $10 an hour with a promised end of summer bonus if we stuck with it).

A lot of people applied, but only a handful of people were all called in for individual interviews with the man in charge, whom I will refer to as “Professor” or “the Professor” for reasons already outlined. He was friendly and disarming, and after what I thought had been a terrible interview was over, I was offered the position. 

The amount of paperwork I had to sign was daunting. The four of us, two girls and another guy plus me, spent the better part of three hours signing all of it with the assistance of the lab’s lawyers. One of girls, Gina, cramped her wrist about three quarters of the way through. We were frustrated, but this was only the beginning of the injuries we would see working here.

We started working on a Monday, and that was just to orient us to our new environment. We were paid for a full day even though we were only there for about four hours. Looking back, I realize what they were trying to do. They progressively introduced us to stranger, more complicated duties while also increasing the incentives to do so. The credit wouldn’t count unless we completed the entire summer internship, for one.

This lab was involved with some shady stuff, to put it mildly. The facility was relatively isolated but still within driving distance of suburbia. It was built on old government land, but I was surprised to find that the newer facility was built over a large underground complex that had been retrofitted and refurbished so it looked like a hospital, only cleaner.

Don’t try to find the name of this company. I need to say that, for your own protection if anything else. It doesn’t exist anymore, and even when it did I don’t think it was anything more than a shell company. Now it’s a trap. Trust me. 

I first met the Children about three weeks into the job. I was the one brought in to see them at first, why I’ll never know, but the Professor grabbed me from the station I had been cleaning and walked me to the elevator to the sub-levels. I asked him what we were doing but he wouldn’t say, just that, “It’ll be mind-blowing.”

I need to point out here that I didn’t come up with Professor. Most of the scientists addressed him that way and I won’t give the one name I heard. 

He ushered me out the elevator into the sub-levels and took me through multiple layers of security. If you understand the concept of an airlock, that’s what these checkpoints felt like. Professor would enter a code or give some kind of biometric verification, usually both, and the final layer actually had him answer a question Ravenclaw style. 

When we finally got through that last door my mind was racing, thinking about all the mad science that could possibly be going on down here, half believing it at this point, but nothing I came up with prepared me for what I saw. I was expecting an AI server farm, genetic mutants, people reading minds, bioweapons, that kind of stuff. 

Looking through an elevated window into a large viewing area, I at first thought I was viewing the aftermath of something. There were these large dark splotches of liquid that covered the wall, floor, and ceiling. 

As soon as I came up to the window and stopped, the dark stains *moved,* coalescing into blobs of what looked like oil as they rolled across surfaces, leaving no trails. 

A few the blobs climbed the wall and hung from the ceiling, looking like drops about to fall. I thought something must be inside that mass of oil, but the Professor assured me that they were composed entirely of that substance. 

“What are they?” I asked, not realizing I’d spoken.

“We don’t know exactly,” The Professor said. “When we first found the original sample, we thought it was an alien organism just because of how different it is, but evidence seems to show that the raw organic material oozed up from the mantle.”

“Whoa,” I said. “They’re organic?” I was thinking they were some kind of ultra-high tech liquid metal terminator. 

“Organic, yes,” Professor said. “But unlike anything that exists on the surface. This isn’t just a new animal, this an entirely new type of organism that doesn’t fall into the domains of Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea.”

You need to understand how surreal and dreamlike the Children seemed. They were basically living pools of oil that coalesced into large blobs. They moved in their area after they got bored with us and started, playing I guess. They were distinct from each other, and looking down I could see thirteen numbered tanks. The Children were identified by the number of the tank they came from. 

The scientists had tracking software that identified the Children when you viewed a feed through a computer rather than looking through a window. The window in question was about six inches thick and specifically constructed to fit that opening with as little space between window and mount as possible. 

“When we first let them out,” The Professor went on, “they couldn’t even do this. They were basically just a colony of cells, like the original sample, but they’ve grown since then. They can grip any surface, using the semi-fluid tissue in such a way as to fill in microscopic gaps and propel themselves along.”

One of the blobs extended its form into something resembling a worm or a snake. It shot up the wall and reached the ceiling, much faster than I thought was possible, reforming as a blob and hanging from a thread while it tried to do something else. 

They weren’t pitch black, there was a dark iridescence on the surface of their bodies, and a small circular indentation formed on the hanging blob. The indentation on the Child in front of me grew deeper and the hole closed around the hollow that was forming. 

The Professor didn’t like that. “Black out the window. Make certain no visible light enters through this opening.” 

The technician obeyed and the hanging blob pushed the air pocket out. It fell to the floor and landed with a thud, not a splat, which piped through the speakers.

“They learn quickly,” The Professor said, still looking out through the one way mirror. “But curiously, they learn at different rates. One is exceptional, though it tends to be less social than the others.”

I looked back at the blobs and saw that they were throwing themselves against each other and even though they enmeshed, they were still apparently distinct. After the combined blob thrashed around a little bit two small blobs disentangled and slid off in opposite directions. 

I also noticed how they were arranged. I could almost pick out three distinct groups, but two of the four loners stood out. The first was more active and inquisitive than the others and moved around significantly faster. This must have been One. It seemed to want us to realize that it was better than the rest, or was working hard to make that assertion a fact. 

*Strange that it seeks outside validation when it shouldn’t be able to understand that other life forms exist.* The Professor had explained that the Children had been born and raised in a sterile environment, no organic material aside from algae cultured to feed them.

As soon as I had the thought a curious thing happened that I never thought was important until now. The iridescence on the skin of a little more than half the Children seemed to brighten as One’s darkened just enough to be noticeable. At the time, I attributed it to the two way mirror because the eight or so Children that brightened were to my right and One was on the far left. I mistakenly thought polarized sunglasses and two way mirrors were the same kind of glass. 

Now I wonder. Were they aware even at that early age that there were other beings outside their little world?

Eleven, the other Child that stood out, simply hung from the top of its tank. It never came out or interacted with the others, and for the most part they left it alone. It stood out for the sole reason that it was the only Child that had never once moved or left its tank. 

The only Child that bothered Eleven was, as you might have guessed, One. One seemed to like taunting Eleven, wrapping around its tank and covering it completely, or later by tapping the glass and trying to dislodge it. 

Eleven was the Child who showed the scientists they had no idea what they were dealing with.

621gwv,8,2017-03-28,Is my lack of motivation just depression or a sign I should leave my doctoral program? Advice and similar stories welcome,egshef,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/621gwv/is_my_lack_of_motivation_just_depression_or_a/,"**tl;dr: 1st year PhD student on medical leave, chronically ill and depressed, lots of personal life struggles, unable to complete work and function in an academic environment, thinking of leaving this behind and working industry**


Hey /r/GradSchool, I've had a really challenging year and am debating leaving my PhD program. Here's why:  

2016 was a roller coaster year for me. With the ups, like acceptance to my dream PhD program, came with huge downs, like my mom being diagnosed with cancer. I had a lot go on and because of it my stress took off and so did my chronic illnesses, chronic sinusitis and endometriosis. 

This past August I was working industry for the first time. After a few weeks of impostor syndrome BS I settled into work, found my groove, and made a good enough of an impression where I was offered to continue interning (If I didn't already sign a lease I would have seriously considered staying at that job). It also felt really good to be competent in the workplace in case I didn't get or want a job in academia (when I applied I said I had teaching experience and enjoyed it but wasn't sure how much time I wanted to offer to teaching). 

The point of this, though, is that during that my internship I often had to leave to deal with my pain but it never made work totally unbearable, and worst case scenario I worked from home or made it up on a weekend. My sinus surgeon, who wanted to clean me out in September, let me wait until December so I could have surgery between semesters. I debated deferring but had no idea what that entailed or if I even could. I don't regret not deferring but in hindsight it would have been a smart move, and I think I was anxious to relocate and start this new part of my life. 

The Fall 2016 semester started off pretty strong but by October I slowly started to become a mess. My sinus symptoms worsened, my endometrosis started to bother me more, and it became difficult to do work. Some work I could power through but other work (like research I felt my advisor made me do for her out of my best interests) I just stopped doing and started making excuses. I began answering emails later and later and avoiding professors. This is when everything started to feel like it was going to hell both physically and professionally. 

Luckily my program director and professors understood that I did a really bad job explaining that I was sick and that what I needed desperately was a medical leave. I left the fall semester just focused on getting healthier and nothing else. The intention was that once I had recovered I would tie up any loose ends (I took incomplete for the semester) and restart full time again this fall. 

When I came back after surgery this February I was excited to work but started to lose interest quickly. The previous semester I attributed my inability to work and lack of motivation on illnesses, but now that I'm not as sick it doesn't make as much sense. I started sleeping more, putting off emails even later, and became a recluse. I actively avoided my cohort and professors and only did what I absolutely needed to for my job. My depression settled in along with random crying, feelings of hopelessness, and legitimately not caring if I could be dropped. I didn't want to do my PhD because I didn't want to do anything in life, let alone be alive. I started seeing a therapist because it got the point where getting out of bed and maintaining good hygiene seemed impossible. Endometriosis has definitely contributed to my poor life outlook, and a big blow was having a specialist close by have to reschedule my appointment 2 months later than I anticipated, delaying the pain relief I thought I would get sooner. 

I'm at the point now where I feel depressed but better, embarrassed to go on campus and talk to professors, unmotivated to work, and I don't know how I will get myself out of this hole. I feel like the only support I have is my boyfriend even though I'm certain everyone wants me to succeed. I know all I have to do is the work since a PhD is more about persistence and passion than intelligence but everything seems overwhelming. When I think about research it seems appealing and I'm still excited about theory and ideas but actually doing it just feels impossible as of this point.

I was supposed to schedule an annual evaluation with my professors and program head but have been putting it off. There are jobs in my area I could apply for and probably get, and if not I could work remotely. I'm seriously looking at one place hoping they hire me on as summer intern and possibly fully time once I have a better handle on my situation. I don't necessarily need a PhD for industry work but it will be a bit of an uphill battle and I'll need to prove myself more than the average candidate given my background. As of now I'm not sure if I want to teach but I don't want to close that door until I feel certain about my status in the program.

Sorry this was long and ranty at parts. Last year was one of huge personal growth and development and I just want perspective as to if why I feel the way I do is because of just depression and personal problems or if I should just make the jump to industry and forget about teaching. Thanks in advance.

I just started a new internship where I will be working on an internal app. The intern before me, who was new to web dev, programmed the first version with jQuery and Node. All things considered, he got the job done by doing what was asked, but the codebase is an unmaintainable mess.

No best practices are followed and the frontend file is 700 lines of jQuery hacked together.

Now, my new manager wants me to add-on some features, make an admin portal, the works. Currently, the site outputs some data into a few tables. I have experience making web apps and was thinking about doing a rewrite with Vue, but the majority of my experience is with Angular 1. 

It took the original guy two months to build what is currently there. I feel like a rewrite couldn't take more than two or three weeks.

My questions for you guys are:

- Is a few weeks realistic to rewrite this into maintainable code with Vue or some other framework/library?
- Do you think a rewrite to get rid of the jQuery would be worth it?
- How can I best justify using a couple of weeks to rewrite the project to my current manager?

Thank you for taking a look!

The only programming languages I've worked with are C++ and Perl, and I literally haven't written a line of code in 10 years. Furthermore, I have neither the time nor the patience to learn any new skills while job searching; this is a semi-emergency situation, and I can't afford to spend any time on things like Codeacademy.com or Coursera until I get at least a McJob. 

Anyone have any advice? I'm really downhearted."

I am returning to my home country (Belgium) where most software jobs are short-term contracts or full-time positions ""requiring a master's degree and 5+ years experience"". Despite this, many anecdotes point to an apparent severe lack in good developers.

If the brain drain for developers exists, then I would consider myself to be good enough to get job offers, but my status as a student might throw an extraneous circumstance in the recruiters' decision-making process.

In general, how do you guys hustle during the summer for paid experience?

622vrj,22,2017-03-28,Does passion really show?,ThrowawayHahaXD,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/622vrj/does_passion_really_show/,"So I've had a question at the back of my mind for some time. I've mentioned before that I go to TJHSST, one of the most competitive high schools. At TJ many people do things solely for college apps. There are so many people here who are not motivated by passions (and in many cases even by themselves), but because they do _so much_ for college apps, with 3 summers of internships and awards like ISEF or Regeneron, they get in to top schools anyway. I'm not saying what they do isn't impressive, but I feel extremely disadvantaged compared to them. I do almost everything of my own accord and on my own time, so while I'm really passionate about certain subjects, a lot of my ECs are quite ""unofficial"" and by TJ standards probably nonexistent. I'm gonna work my ass off to try and craft stellar essays and make myself stand out, but I don't have any big flashy awards. I could still try applying to competitions, but my environment would make it very difficult to win anything. My final question is: is intense passion for subjects and homegrown ECs unique or impressive enough, even in my competitive environment?    
P.S. I feel like I should bring up the cheating culture at TJ. In recent years, especially since I started, it's become a serious problem. In fact, within the past year violating the honor code has turned into a meme of sorts (""honor coding""). The kid that sits in front of me in my CS class has 30 honor code violations since the start of this year in that class alone (a bit ridiculous tbh actually, but it's a rumor). Anyway, back to my main point. While not cheating, like I said before, so many people do things just for college apps, and even if they don't get those awards, there's a chance that they'll say they got them anyway. It makes me feel so hopeless: I work very hard for my grades and for my activities, but these students go to better schools than I do in the end.     
P.P.S. I feel like this turned into a vent near the end. Sorry about that, but I needed to share my thoughts."

I started out as an intern working on a small data entry project, but as the project comes to a close I’ve been offered and practically given a position that opened in their social media dept. Naturally, I’m ecstatic because this means I will be able to stay with the company!

All’s well until a friend of mine in the web dev dept. tells me they may be looking for someone full time to do some front end stuff, am I interested?! Of course! I’d rather be working in dev because that’s what I actually do and am getting my degree for. But I’ve pretty much already accepted the other position and have even started some training :(

What are my options here? Will expressing interest in the development position look bad even though it makes the most sense? I’m pretty sure that’s why they hired me in the first place, the project I’m working on is very simple, anyone could do it, but I assume they choose me because of my design background. Still, I’m fairly new to the company, only two months in, and I don’t want to do anything that would make me look bad or unprofessional. 

Not to mention, the company is very small - 30 people max - and a friend in the social dept. joked that I was a 'social climber' when he heard me inquiring about the other position, presumably because I was pining over the social media position believing it was the only way to stay with the company.

Basically, I switched my major to MIS halfway through my junior year and due to external circumstances I wasn't able to find a relevant internship. Now I'm 2 months from graduating and have no idea what to do next. A lot of my classes were project based so I have that to show for at least. I developed a website and database for a small business and I'm currently working on a similar solution for another, did various business/data analytics projects, coded a portfolio website from scratch for myself, etc. I put these under my resume because it's something at least.

My skills consist of knowledge of the SDLC and systems analysis methodologies, data analysis skills such as linear programming, regression analysis, basic data mining techniques, and data visualization in Tableau. Strong Excel knowledge (pivot tables, vlookups, advanced functions), SQL (worked with stored procedures, triggers, basic functions) and relational database design, basic project management in MS Project, broad general knowledge of IT and e-commerce strategies/technologies, and basic coding skills in HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, and C++.

I'm more interested in the business-side of IT so I think a business/systems analyst position would be a good fit but I'm really concerned that I don't have enough experience to get there.

Should I apply anyway, or is there another stepping stone that will help me get there? Basically, I want to know what I should be doing today so I can land an entry-level position. I might need something in the meantime to pay my bills but I have my living situation sorted until late July so I can dedicate 100% of my energy, barring finishing my degree, on taking the steps to find something and continue learning. Are there internship opportunities for post-grads that I should be looking at, or should I just apply to something like a QA-type position? I'm located in NYC if that makes any difference.

Edit: Also, my GPA is 3.4 and major GPA should be even higher, if that matters. Just trying to give as much information on my situation as possible."

It's a small company but I'm earning experience in my field which will be valuable once I graduate.

They have started, recently, micromanaging me. 

What started with a small email here and they're turned into mandatory meetings every week.

From there on it turned into indirect phrases of discreditation.

At first I thought I was reading into things too much but now my coworkers have raised the same concerns that I had regarding to my treatment

It's come down to where I do not want to go to work anymore and I want to quit

I dread waking up every day going to work and it has made me somewhat miserable

But then when I received offers, the difference was almost $4/hr for Juniper, and I'm wondering if the experience I'd get with Juniper would really be that much better. From my understanding I would work as a single intern at Juniper, while Optum has teams of interns.

Also if you have interned before what was the Guru interview like? Do they ask alot of technical questions?


I am also curious what are the best locations for interns. The options are Redwood City, SF, San Jose, Austin, Cleveland, Yorktown Heights (NY), and Cambridge (MA) among others."

Haven't really had a CS internship before, so I'm scrambling trying to find something for this summer. I'd like to find something close to the area I'd like to get into, but I'm feeling a bit lost and confused in thinking about what exactly it is that I'd like to do


I'd love to take my CS major and apply it to the medical field somehow. I think doing something like helping improve medical technologies or improve treatment methods would be awesome and super fulfilling. The problem is that I get so lost when I start trying to look into this stuff. I've read about Health IT, Health Informatics, Computer Information and Research Science, and so on, but it's all so confusing and I don't really know where to start. I'm trying to get a better idea of what I want to do so I can (hopefully) find a summer internship closely related to that topic/area, I'm just having a lot of trouble narrowing everything down. I should mention that one potential issue is that I have pretty much no background in biology/chemistry/etc- I only realized that combining CS with something in the medical field could be a sweet combo fairly recently, and I hadn't taken much of anything in the life sciences. Only have 1 semester of college left, so it's a bit late to get into that as well


Apologies if I'm not doing a great job at explaining this stuff, every time I get into it there's just so many different fields with technical jargon and so many different options, hard to tell what's a job for a CS major vs. a biology major, and I just end up feeling more lost than when I started. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!"

6294dp,5,2017-03-29,CMSC250 Withdrawal Advice,cmsc250throwaway,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/6294dp/cmsc250_withdrawal_advice/,"(Specific questions are bulleted below)

I think I started off on the wrong foot with CMSC250. This was the very first time I ever worked with this type of theoretical math. I think I was just very unprepared, and the introduction to the course was pretty lackluster, for me, in saying what the class was about. The lack of practice problems also threw me off quite a bit. The homeworks were always pretty confusing for me and our section's homework grader was very slow, so it was hard to tell what my answers were supposed to look like. The whole course in general was just pretty mystifying at the beginning of the semester. Looking back, I realize that I should have studied more and asked my TA's for help more, but I don't think I realized how little I really knew until I was studying for the first midterm.

I am also enrolled in MATH241, which I also struggled with at the beginning of the semester.

I think the main reason I struggled in both of these courses is the lack of time I dedicated to them, not because I found them fundamentally difficult. Especially for 250, I do not think I took it seriously enough at the beginning of the semester and didn’t dedicate enough time to studying the content.

Now that I'm further into the semester, I've started to understand the purpose of CMSC250 more and what I'm doing in the course. I have started dedicating more time to doing the readings and studying in general.

However, my grade in 250 is pretty low because I bombed the first exam. It was way below average, and way lower than I expected. During midterm review Gasarch pretty much said that if you got below a certain score (which I did) you should drop the course. My homework and quiz averages are also pretty low. To get at least a 70 to pass the class for my major, I would have to get a 70+ on both the second midterm and final, as well as bringing up my quiz and homework grades a bit. This seems doable although risky.

However, if I continue to take 250, this would inevitably give me less time for MATH241, which I also need to bring my grade up for. I am pursuing a math minor (I realize that I should really get it together with my math classes) and it would be unlikely for me to get a B- in CMSC250, which I need to get in order to exempt me from having to take MATH310.

So I am considering the possibility of withdrawing from 250, to give me more time to work on 241 as well as my other classes (216 being one of them, although I am doing well in that class) and also giving me the chance to pass 250 with at least a B- when I retake it. If I did follow through with this, I was thinking of retaking 250 over the summer.

I would still be a fulltime student (I would be taking 12 credits) if I withdrew from 250.

I am not a freshman, so I could not take advantage of freshman forgiveness.

Here are some specific questions I have about all this:

* How bad does a “W” look on a transcript? Searching on this subreddit most people seem to say it’s not a huge deal for most. I don’t intend on going to grad school.

* Is there a way for me to just be signed up for the summer 250 class and not pay until I’m certain I will retake it over the summer as opposed to next semester? It doesn’t look like this is allowed (understandably so), as these are the consequences of not paying immediately (“...you risk being canceled or withdrawn for non-payment, blocked from future registration, and financially responsible for the course”). I do not want to pay early if there’s a chance I would not take the course (for example, if I get a good internship that is incompatible with the summer class times, which leads to the next question).

* One concern I have with taking 250 over the summer, is if I have a job or internship, would I be able to schedule around the class? For example, the 250 summer class right now says it would be from 12:30pm - 2:00pm. These seems like it would be right in the middle of a normal job. I've only ever had one job that was 9-5, so I am unfamiliar with the flexibility of hours.

* How would the summer class differ from the regular class? Would there still be TA’s helping students? It’s clear that the course would progress faster, on the flip side I would have much more time to study the content.

* If, when I complete 250, I get below a B- and have to take MATH310 in the future for my math minor, would MATH310 be less difficult after already taking 250?

* This might be hard to answer, since the course has changed quite a bit over time, but traditionally, are the topics/exams more challenging as the course progresses after the first midterm? Gasarch said that the course only gets harder,  and I did not do so well on the first part of the course already I don’t think it would be a great idea to continue.

* For current students: do you have any advice for doing well on the homeworks and quizzes? I feel like some students might be working together on these, but I do not know if that is allowed or not. Jason posted a pretty ambiguous announcement on this, and I guess I should email him about it. I've just assumed that this is not allowed though. Anyways it would be nice hear some general advice for the homeworks, quizzes, and practicing in general, as I will have to pass 250 eventually.

That's pretty much it. Thank you if you read this. I will appreciate any and all advice."
629bw7,3,2017-03-29,Is it better to take interesting courses or easy classes that will guarantee me a higher GPA?,pizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzza,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/629bw7/is_it_better_to_take_interesting_courses_or_easy/,"I have the option of taking a very interesting religion class about ethics in decision making (in healthcare, business, religion, etc) that has many difficult, dense readings or a very, very easy, somewhat interesting class about Asian development of languages and cultures.

I am also taking an intro to economics course that I want to focus on and do very well in and a class about American Dramas (which is also a fairly easy class, reading a play a day).

I don't know whether I should challenge myself with an interesting, thought-provoking class that I might not do extremely well in (as I've never taken any courses on religion and am not strong in the areas the class covers) or a class that I will be guaranteed an A in.

I'm worried that my GPA will drop with later, harder classes (I'm also a computer science major/minor), so should I take easy classes now to help me in the future or a harder class? How much does your GPA matter for internships and will companies/firms judge me poorly for taking easier classes with higher medians?

Background: I've been working as a Helpdesk member in a company for the last 3 years. I am 24 and get paid pretty crappy because this was an entry IT position that I got without a degree or any certs. I've been through another internship IT job before while I was in another school. I've taken programming, networking and security classes. C Programming was very interesting to me and I did like it but I hit a wall and stopped coding a couple of years ago. I've tried getting back into programming but find it hard because I find it hard to read books (more on this below). I will be finishing my degree in Computer Information Systems very soon so I will finally have my Bachelors along with experience. I want to work on certs next but don't know what to study/learn. 

Issue 1: I don't know how to move forward? I'm bored being a Helpdesk member as it's mostly the same things over and over. It's been the same since about 6 months into the job and never really saw a change. I like being challenged and learning new things. I find it fun to not know anything about something but in the end figure it out. Usually I'm one of the people they ask to do something when the rest of the team can't figure it out. I can literally spend hours trying to figure something out and don't like stopping until it's done/completed. I'm very persistent. But I have one major flaw, I really don't learn from reading books. I try and learn to code but I just get so bored. I like being active with my hands and I learn by learning from other people. The thing is that it isn't always an option. I find it really hard to sit down, read books and learn from them. I guess I have ADD because I have a very small attention span and can't sit still long enough to read.

Issue 2: IT in general has so many different and interesting opportunities that I don't know where to poke my head into next. I like Networking, Security, Programming, Virtualization, Administration, I mean I can go on and on. I was always the type of person to be neutral about everything and never really liked ONE thing. I've always had interest in many things. I don't know how to explain it lol

Anyways I'm looking for something that will be I guess ""future"" proof. Something that will be used in the future and I can learn, somehow. Also do you guys have any tips on what helps you guys learn? Maybe some reading tips that might work for me. What do you guys recommend I start trying to learn? What are good ways to learn if you're like me and find it hard to learn by reading books. What are good certs to pursue? I mean any advice would be helpful! I'm in a tough position and just feel stuck. I don't want to feel stuck anymore feel like I'm wasting my time in a way. Also staying in this company isn't an option as I don't really like the way they handle things. 

Thanks!"

62ahlo,24,2017-03-29,Practical advice for new CS students,advphx,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/62ahlo/practical_advice_for_new_cs_students/,"I've just passed the halfway mark in the program, and I just wanted to share some lessons learned and help others survive the steep learning curve at the beginning. Many questions on here revolve around new student advice, so I figured I'd chime in. These are things I wish I had known before starting the program. As always, YMMV.

* Learn how to study for computer science. I came from a social science undergrad, and I have an MBA as well. Those degrees encourage you to jump right into assignments, whether they are papers or business cases, or even accounting and math problems. With CS, that's exactly the WRONG approach. Understand the material clearly before you start programming. And then plan out the program in very specific terms. Otherwise, you'll only succeed through trial and error. (And you'll waste countless hours doing so, while having a higher likelihood of creating bugs.)

* As a corollary to the above, recognize when you have a knowledge gap. When that happens, try to google the answer or search Stack Overflow. Then, if applicable, read the relevant documentation online. If that fails, post a question on Piazza. Then take a break. For 99% of the problems you'll run into, this sequence of events will help you get there much faster

* Be patient, and realize you will run into frustrating roadblocks. It's part of the learning process. I can't think of a way to avoid this entirely. However, minimizing this feeling is key. Use frequent breaks to keep your mind fresh and frustration low.

* You will debate about quitting at times. I started this program and was only getting B's, with a hazy understanding of what I was doing. I wondered if I had the capacity to finish the program. I struggled with pointers in particular. Now I'm doing fairly well in all my courses. My secret? During any breaks between semesters, I studied what I felt like I missed from prior courses. It has made a world of difference.

* Start interviewing before you graduate. It'll give you practice and you'll understand what employers are actually looking for. Even if you aren't planning on a pure developer role.

* Plan your semesters smartly. Pair a difficult course with a less demanding course. Some classes have the workload of 2 classes, where others are fairly light on overall workload.

* Piazza is your friend--ask for clarification from professors and help from classmates. It's such a powerful resource that I don't think every student uses well. (Which is why you see so many duplicate questions and students who are still lost on the basics by week 8 or even later).

* Don't get caught up with finding the ""best"" IDE, or the ""best"" programming language. (I totally got sucked in when I started.) There's a ton of options, and no shortage of online arguments to lead you astray. During the program, I'm moved from Vim to XCode(started with a Mac), switched to Windows and used Visual Studio, and have recently been using Sublime Text. During the program, I've used C++, C, Assembly, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, a little PHP, and some Java. Each has a purpose but learning a new language is basically the same once you have a knowledge base.

* Computer Science does not equal Programming. You will not magically become a L33T-level programmer at the end of this program. You'll need to have your own side-projects or internship experience for that to happen. That said, it shouldn't take long for you to develop those skills, but the CS degree is not enough by itself.

* If you need to vent(respectfully), this reddit is a super-duper awesome place to do so. Lots of really good people on here, and the alumni can give you some great post-school advice.

The people were great, but sadly that doesn't make a workplace for me. It was nothing but Autodesk software, lighting analysis, and electrical plan analysis.

Also, my major is Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science so that didn't line up too well... Even though I could do it.

62arst,24,2017-03-29,CS Quarter Life Crisis,Super_Sand_Lesbian_1,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/62arst/cs_quarter_life_crisis/,"I'm a Second Semester Junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Starting last semester, I began doubting my abilities and interest in the field after encountering harder courses and beginning serious searching for summer internships.

I came into college wanting to go into CS and enjoyed the lower level courses that involved learning programming concepts, object oriented programming, basic machine architecture, etc. However, upper level courses, such as Automata Theory, Operating Systems, and advanced architecture, I have found uninteresting and difficult to pay attention in, which is further compounded by the general natural dislike of just sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher drone on for an hour that I have had since grade school. Other related math classes I have had a similar experience with. 

Applying and interviewing for internships has been stressful, and I am very worried about not getting one for the summer despite not really looking forward to actually doing one. I have to work in the state for 5 years after graduating as a part of a STEM scholarship I have, and I don't know if I can get a job without any relevant experience. I'm applying everywhere I can, since I'm not sure what I would even enjoy doing and just need to try everything. I have aspirations to be a game developer, but that feels too lofty and insecure to be realistic goal, at least in the near future. 

To go along with that, I hate the general culture and lifestyle that seemingly goes along with being a CS major/professional. I know this doesn't apply to everyone, but a large amount of people that I have encountered in my field are overweight, eat poorly, and spend nearly all of their time doing work or projects related to CS. A friend of mine has also expressed similar concerns, has said ""I just don't know if I can just sit in front of a computer for the rest of my life,"" and has considered switching. What he said resonated with me. I am big fan of video games and spend a lot of my lazy time sitting at a computer of TV anyway, but recently I have picked up a number of other hobbies/interests that allow me to step away from the computer, but it often feels wrong that I am doing them. I have become very interested in working out and gaining a better, healthier body, but this can't be done when I need to sit on my ass in a computer lab until midnight to work a computer project that takes an indefinite amount of time. I am living on my own in an apartment, and have really been enjoying learning to cook and make healthy and tasty recipes, but these take time and often I need fast food just to get energy so I can work on some CS homework. I play electric bass and have recently composed music for an orchestra club I help run, but I could've used that time to instead practice coding questions and brush up on my running time complexities and data structures. Fun. 

Hackathons are the pinnacle of what I find wrong with this lifestyle, yet they are talked up as being one of he most important things a CS major can do. Stay up for 24 hours drinking soda and eating junk food while stitching together random APIs for random tech and software and then present it to random company representatives, only for them to say ""Huh. Cool."" Being at hackathons just makes me uncomfortable, as I am surrounded by these overzealous people who give you funny looks for not being interested in the latest CPU of SDK at 2AM when I would much rather be sleeping. I have forced myself to go to these to have at least SOMETHING to talk about and post on my GitHub for interviews, but I never look forward to going to these things. Coding challenge competitions have been better for me, but I am still surrounded by the same kind of people.

I just don't enjoy spending all of my time doing CS related things and want to pursue my other interests. I know that achieving a balance of these things takes time and work, but I find myself getting depressed when I have to sacrifice things like a workout session in order to study for a test or do homework for these classes. 

My current Operating Systems class has pushed my over the edge. I could not care less for the subject material, I hate the professor, the programs take forever, and the guizzes and tests I take just make me angry, and I perform appropriately. I just got a pretty low test grade. My overall and major GPAs(just CS classes) are 3.38 and 3.54 respectively, and the thought of them going down infuriates me, despite my inability to truly put all of my effort into doing well in the course. I am hoping to get into the B range for this course, but it just makes me feel terrible when I see these peers talk about their seemingly flawless grades. So many professors have said ""Grades don't matter in CS,"" and yet my peers love to flaunt them. I try to make grades not be the end all be all of my self worth, and yet a bad quiz or test grade brings me to my boiling point.  I surprisingly enjoy my Data and Design Algorithms class, and I am taking a cool Multimedia Systems class, and am doing well in both, so at least I am definitely still doing well overall. But again, I don't feel like pursuing more relevant information outside of what I am learning in those courses.

I just feel all of this pressure to do so many things that I don't feel like I signed up for with this major. I enjoy the act of coding and creating working elegant programs, but I hate low level architecture as well as really high level abstract concepts. I don't even want to imagine the idea of switching majors at this point, as the reaction from my parents and the prospect of doing even more school to switch makes me depressed. I feel like I don't belong at times, but I don't even have any idea of what I would do otherwise. I am on track to graduate a semester early, but I am considering getting a minor in math to fill in that extra semester and graduate on time. I don't know if it would be better for me to graduate early or do the minor for whatever the minor would be worth in the future.

I'm just rambling at this point, thank you for reading if you did, and sorry for posting something pretty negative about CS in a sub that is generally really positive about the field. "

Maybe it is cocky but I am pretty sure I would be able to get a job however my concern is the location and pay. Right now live in a fairly low cost of living area and make around 90k. In order to make the best decision I feel like not knowing what offers I could get limits my ability to fully weigh my options.

So after all my ramblings, is it reasonable to apply for a job 7ish months out, or what is reasonable? Would the security clearance impact how far out I could get an offer? Any recommendations about transitoning from another career field or the military into CS?"
62bndr,31,2017-03-29,Graduated - My Journey,AJmtnsWA,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/62bndr/graduated_my_journey/,"I completed the program (yay!) so I thought I'd share my personal journey through it and finding a new job. I started Winter 2015 and took 2.25 years (9 quarters straight) to complete it.    

###Background    

Throughout the entire program I worked full time as an engineer, 40+ hours per week plus 1 - 2 hours of commute time per day. I am married with a very understanding/patient spouse and no kids. My social life became more nonexistent as the program went on. I finished my first degree 6.5 years before starting this program and it was in aerospace engineering. I had some exposure to programming during this degree using Matlab and Fortran, so I was comfortable with the very basic concepts but nothing object oriented. I’m not going to talk about my admission process because it sounds much different than it currently is.    

###Schedule    

Here is the schedule of classes I took, my estimated average time commitment for each per week, general balance of workload throughout the quarter, and the drop rate that I kept track of (I &lt;3 data). 

|Class  |  Term   |   Hrs/Week  |  Workload  |  Dropped|
|:-----:|:---------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
|161   |   Win15 |   20  |    Consistent  |   23%  |

|290   |   Fall15  |  15 - 20  |    Heavy last 2 weeks  |    9%  |
|340   |   Fall15  |  5  |    Heavy last 3 weeks   |    4%  |
|271   |   Win16 |   15 - 20  |    Slightly lighter at end   |   1%  |

|372   |   Win17 |  15   |    Consistent   |     2.8%  |
|467   |   Win17 |  15   |    Consistent   |    1.3%  |    

*362 was java based this quarter    

###Resume Building    

During 290 I decided to do a side project and recreated the game I had made for my final project in 162 as a web based application. This was all I had before searching for internships.     

Throughout the first 2/3’s of 2016 I also worked on another personal website that has an in-depth search feature for what’s basically a blog. It utilized a NoSQL db through Firebase. Nothing spectacular, but it gave me something to talk about in phone screens and interviews. I was passionate about my project and I think that made it easier to express that passion/excitement in interviews too.    

I did a hackathon at the beginning of spring quarter 2016. It was a great experience and I encourage everyone to participate in one if you have any interest, don’t let perceived abilities/experience hold you back. You’ll be able to contribute something and you’ll learn a lot, and hopefully have fun.    

Last, for my full time job search, I think the biggest resume boost I had was my internship. Certainly talked about that experience in my interviews.    

###Job Search    

I live in Seattle so all of my job searches were solely in the Seattle area. I feel pretty grateful to have landed some opportunities. My advice: be persistent and apply to everything that you can.    

I applied for internships fall 2015 so I had completed 161/162/225/261 and was in the process of 290/340, which I completed in time for the actual interviews. Having 290 really helped for my interview as it was project based. The numbers: I submitted 24 applications to 17 companies. I got 2 interviews and 1 offer. I interned summer 2016.    

I planned to graduate winter quarter 2017 so I applied for full time jobs August 2016 through November 2016. I read most of CTCI and did a handful of problems on leetcode in preparation. Admittedly I would have liked to do more problems but I just didn’t have the time outside of work and two classes. I also started reading /r/cscareerquestions. It helped give me an idea of some interview processes and hear about others’ experiences. The numbers: I submitted 25 applications to 18 companies. I got 5 online coding challenges, 3 phone screens, 1 virtual interview, 1 onsite interview, and 3 offers (one was from my internship). Note, not every company followed the entire process of online challenge to phone screen to interview.     


Thanks for reading this far. I'll do my best to answer questions and good luck to everyone!"
62d9pa,58,2017-03-30,i just have to share my first day as teaching alone.,[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/62d9pa/i_just_have_to_share_my_first_day_as_teaching/,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/5zx1aw/updated_from_i_dont_care_give_me_a_f/

So Im currently doing my internship for 6 weeks. Today was my first day being 100 % alone with the classes. Ive previously posted about some troubles, mostly due to being placed in lower ages than Im supposed to be with and such.


Its my 3rd week now. So Ive had some connection with them, however.. Ive never really held a lesson yet due to having a lot of reading / text discussions etc so its been planned for a while.


----------------

As the lesson start, they ask where the real teacher is. I tell them shes gone for the day and I hear people cheer ""Yeaaah, we can chill"". 


This class, the older one. Has never heard me speak with my real voice, nor heard me raise it. 


So once they all sat down. I raised my voice and said ""So, now were starting. Get to your places."" 

(Note: Not yelling, I have a habit to lower my voice due to people saying I sound mad when I speak with my normal voice. So I often use a softer voice as normal voice). 

I said, youre all on your correct places? Because in 10 sec, Im gonna take up the sheet and everyone on the wrong place. Will get late attendence. 


People started to see that I did not fuck around. 


Started to talk about source criticism. Which they found boring as fk. However, as I started to use real exampels (""Alternative facts"", how its on university and such), let them read some facts thats just sound like bullshit and news articals, they started to really listen. 


After some time, I showed a few videos about fake news and sites etc and I said, you have all behaved great, if you want and have no questions, we can end 10min earlier. They had loads and loads of questions (I knew this),  so those 10min turned into 2min. 


They asked if we could begin next lesson ealier and end it earlier, which I agreed. 


But before the lesson, I told them. This is your one and only chance. Show me you can behave, show me you can respect me and I will respect you. If you want me to keep letting you have some freedom, end earlier sometimes when possible and come up with super fun lessons. SHow me you can handle it. Show me youre about to be an adult. 

Lesson started and they had a free period (Not my subject) to study for their test. 


After 5-10min and they settled down. I turned on some music (piano study music I use for my own studies), and some said ""Youre not allowed to play music"", which I told them... When you behave, you get privileges. 


The classroom was dead silent. They all studied with 100 % focus. 


A few students left for group rooms and when it was 10 min left, I told them to come back. When they entered some students noticed that they were talking, which 90 % of the class didnt like. So I told them all, so either show me you can handle the stuff I told you about before, or you can stay with me for the whole lesson. 



After 10min, I told them. Get to your correct places calmly. They all went to their places without making a SOUND. I couldnt believe it. 


Here we had a class, which all teachers ive spoken with... said were the loudest. being 100 % silent. 



So I told them, you have earned these 10min, wasnt this a nice lesson? Youve done more today than you do on two lessons. 


Which you know what? They didnt leave. 


They wanted to stay the extra 10min. Everyone. 




When they left, I heard them talk about how this was the best lesson ever. They have never been this calm and they wish ever lesson was like this. Some students came to me and said they wanted me to start working here. I told them I still have 3 years, but its likley Ill have you in high school. 



When they were in the ""break room"" or whatever, they were so calm. A few teachers came to me and asked if something had happened. Because, they are never this calm. Some couldnt believe me and thought I was bullshitting when I discussed what happened at the lunch room. 


I had some cheat, due to the loudest student was sick today. But still... 

---------------------------------


So what have I taken from this? 


I know this wont be every lesson.  But after these two, hearing them discuss when they thought I wasent near. Felt me with some feeling that Im home. Its strange to explain, most of the time I dislike the kids, I get frustrated, I hate the school admins.


But still.. Im home. Ive found my place in the world and its to be a teacher. Through all the shit, through all the hate, Im where I am supposed to be. 


And I know Im finally on my way to finding myself. What kind of teacher I am going to be. 



EDIT:


I wrote this during my lunch break. After my lunch, I had a lesson with the younger kids (which I wrote about in the link). Same thing here, I gave them the option, even tho its a boring reading lesson (AGAIN. But my teacher didnt want me to start something brand new with them, so they got to read) that if they behave, I might let them go earlier. I drew two lines on the white board and told them ""Each line is 5min. Im not gonna raise my voice once, instead, I'm gonna start removing the lines until you get quiet"". I only had to remove 1/3 of a line, which meant, they got 7min to spare. Expect, they had loads of questions also so they got 2min. 



But what was so great here, is that... The ""trouble"" kids, wanted to change books. So I gave them a suggestion. They got the book and read 40 pages! 40 fucking pages! They normally dont even open the book. 


After the lesson, they quit for the day and fooled around, I had to tell them off because they were running into other classrooms and stuff... But they had a discussion about the book! Can you fucking believe it?! 

The first one I suggested the book, was further ahead. The ones starting today told him not to spoil anything, they wanted to read it. 


I told them that there is a harder version, which they wanted to read after they had read this ""easy read"" version and they even wanted to watch the movie later on. 


Same thing here.. The students were so relaxed and enjoyed the lesson so much because it was quiet. They didnt mind reading because some even got through 5 chapters, when they normally only read 1-2.  



Students that normally disrupts the class, where telling others to be quiet. It was amazing to see.



EDIT 2: 

After all lessons, I was almost drenched in sweat. But I kept my cool, because I knew that one moment could destroy the whole great atmosphere"

However, I don't practice interview questions with it, so the api's are not as familiar to me, and it definitely hampered my ability to succeed. Is this frequent? I know that the big 4 doesn't do it, but is there a general subtype of companies that I should be aware of doing this?

Yet I can't get any interviews for both full time and internships and almost never have been able to. I've had two interviews during my whole college career despite applying for internships since freshman year in the summer. One was actually Facebook and the other was some small company. Both just said they weren't going to continue my consideration with no feedback despite my request. I felt like I did amazing on both interviews and the engineers seemed impressed.

I've applied to every company you can think of. I have a normal resume, the job I did in high school and a personal project I've worked on since freshman year that I've slowly been building up. I definitely don't have anything weird that would stave off recruiters and all the career advisors here have told my me resume is as good as it can be without work experience. Obviously I have nothing else to put on it without getting a job. I almost never get replies from companies which I think is the biggest problem. I don't even get the chance to prove myself.

62didm,1,2017-03-30,"Grad school reject, what now?",kbanta11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62didm/grad_school_reject_what_now/,"After being rejected from every US institution which I have applied, I'm a bit lost on where to go next and was hoping for some brutally honest advice.  I guess I'm not extremely surprised I got rejected, considering that I have a somewhat unrelated degree to computer science (actuarial science).  I received my bachelor's in actuarial science from a small, unknown US school with a very high GPA (3.9+) and passing 3 actuarial exams, but having not been a CS student in undergrad, I feel like my transcript has big holes which might have doomed me.  I also don't have any research experience in undergrad due to the nature of the actuarial program (head down, studying for actuarial exams and working internships).  I realized after finishing my undergrad that I didn't really want to be an actuary, so I took a bunch of online courses (udemy, udacity, saylor, etc.) for programming, data structures and algorithms, etc. to build a knowledge base (I had always enjoyed programming since High School and had kept up a little bit with it and wanted to make a run at switching my career to that).  I was able to land a job as a developer, but I have further aspirations.  A part of the actuarial world that I really enjoyed was being able to analyze and make sense of data sets.  I'm really interested in and excited about using computers to make sense of that data with machine learning and was hoping to be able to pursue that further, through grad school.  After now being rejected from my US options, I was wondering what I should do next.  I'm considering going overseas (Australia, perhaps) for postgrad (if I can get in overseas somewhere), but I'm not sure if there are many (any?) good/comparable programs outside of the US.  I've also been considering the Udacity nanodegree programs or one of the online master's programs (I've GT and Columbia have decent online master's programs, any others?), but I think I would benefit a lot more from being in a university setting than remote online.  The thing that excites me most about machine learning is it's potential applications in healthcare, which I feel like I would need to be at a university to be able to learn and research a lot of the health related ideas.  I would really not like to have to push my whole life off another year to wait and apply again (I decided to go to grad school just after the application deadlines for a lot of schools two years ago so I had already kind of been pushing everything off for a year to apply this year).  I'm not sure waiting to reapply again next year would provide me much better of a chance to get in considering my odd background.  Do I need to go back and earn another bachelor's degree, this time in CS?

I'm rambling quite a bit, so my apologies, but I'm just generally a bit lost as to how to get where I want to go, given these rejections.  Is it worthwhile to take the online route or overseas route?  Is it a better option to go back for another bachelor's and then reapply next year?  Are there any schools with spring enrollment for these programs (most of the ones I found were fall enrollment only) that I could apply to still now?"

I got degree in History with the intent of going into teaching, but that never panned out (no money in it, decent paying college level too competitive). I've been coasting from job to job ever since, trying to find a career that works for me.

I'm 26 now and currently a mortgage banker with a fairly large company, been here a year and a half, and I've quickly found that sales just isn't for me. LOVE working with people, HATE trying to convince them to do things they normally wouldn't do. So I'm looking for a change.

My biggest regret is getting such a useless degree, I don't feel qualified for anything, and I'm worried about being left adrift with no marketable skills if the economy tanks again.

My idea is to head back to school for computer science. Programming is something I think I'd be interested in, it's relevant to today's economy, and it's definitely a marketable skill with high income potential. I'm getting married this summer however, and plan on having children soon, so I think my best bet would to be to go full nuclear: Work a waiting job or something similar (relatively high income with flexible hours) and get as many credits per semester as possible, intern, the works. Basically do everything I can to make it happen as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Basically, find the holes in this plan. I want to make sure I've considered it from every possible angle before pulling any triggers, and I'm sure I've missed something.

Thanks for the help.

Quick PS, I've looked into Programming boot camps, they don't seem to be the best way to go. My brother has been in programming for five years and told me employers prefer degrees and experience (school and internships) over boot campers."
62e0ou,11,2017-03-30,"[Long Post] Got my first salaried job and have been here for two months. Slow pace and lack of tasks is not working for me, and I feel guilty for job searching. What should I do?",boardingtheplane,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/62e0ou/long_post_got_my_first_salaried_job_and_have_been/,"also posted in /r/careerguidance 

Hi all, I don't really know how to make this more concise, but I'll include a TL;DR.

I graduated with a BS in Urban Planning June 2016, and had been job searching for the last 6 or 7 months. In February, thanks to pure luck, I was hired to work at a small but successful engineering firm. I ran into a high school friend and her dad. We caught up for a few and when I mentioned I was looking for a job in transportation planning, her dad gave me his card. (not sure if it's worth noting, but he's VP/COO of the firm. His father is CEO and has recently stepped down from a daily role.)

I interviewed and had a job offer within a week! I am extremely grateful for the opportunity he's given me and I like being here, but of course, the honeymoon phase is over.
I'm basically a glorified intern. I'm on a 9-month seasonal contract making $35k (or about $17/hr)- so no benefits yet. I get along with all of my coworkers, but there's obviously a disconnect. I don't mind it much right now, but if there's been no change in the last two months, what's to come?

I've learned a lot about the industry, and have managed to get some training, but there's a lot of things they won't give me permission to do at this time. I had a direct supervisor that always had something for me to do/learn about, but she left about a month ago on maternity leave... Since then, I've gotten assigned about 1/5 of the amount of tasks I used to have.
Most of the work I've submitted has never been fully looked-over. Presentations and reports I've prepared for my supervisors have been set aside and I've been told ""great job! Sorry I can't look at this right now, but we'll get to it later!""

I've taken it upon myself to start doing some training during this downtime. I'm currently learning how to use AutoDesk AutoCAD- even though I've asked and they won't let me use the program at work. I've just been taking a video course and following along at home. I've asked about other things, but they claim that they aren't ready for me to do any of that unless the licensing is affordable and can be easily transferred to my desktop.
The firm I work for deals with rail engineering, like the NYC Subway, LA's MetroLink, Amtrak, etc. I thought this would be a great stepping stone towards where I really want to be. My real passions are for aviation and transit planning. My dream is to have a career working in airport/airline management, or anything that would put me right in the heart of a major airport and its operations. I believe I can make a horizontal shift to similar work in the aviation industry.

I was job searching yesterday and came across a job posting for this exact position, but at another firm, dealing with aviation planning, and for about 50% more money than what I'm getting paid right now. This made me think if it's even worth it for me to stick it out here until at least October, or just start job searching again.

**TL;DR: I got my first salaried job out of college and I'm bored to tears here. I feel like I'm wasting their time and mine by being here. I get paid more than $100 a day to read articles and do powerpoints. At this time, I am feeling unchallenged, supervisors are not willing to let me learn useful skills (like drafting programs), and I have no relationships with coworkers. I'd like to move to a job in aviation planning or airport management.**

*It seems like the situation won't improve any time soon, so should I just start looking for better options? How bad of form is it to leave a position like this after only a few months into a contract?*

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice."

My last year was hard. The courses were damn tough but I also had personal problems and set backs that crushed my worldview and my dreams/aspirations...

To make matters worse, my interest in CS started to wane at the end of third year. I had an internship at a bank and lots of concepts were very difficult and I felt like not being intelligent enough to get how things work. Also, I found that after around 5 hrs in front of computer I am very dead tired and want nothing to do with computers after that.

Now, I was diagnosed with depression by my doctor and therapist. I'd it is combination of stuff that crushed my worldview, realization that maybe I study something that does not come naturally to me (I studied with people of probably 130+ IQ across the class) and felt rather dumb compared to them. Due to all these worries, I can't sleep for more than 4hrs a night and live my life in brain fog that ruins my performance in interviews. I seem to get them and was told my resume is strong but my brain just don't want to function. I solved over 100 Leetcode problems and still fail interviews that may even be variation of problem I did on Leetcode...

I am honestly not sure what it is. Is it me really disliking the field or is it my depression and tiredness talking.

I do all the right things: cook my food lift weights, have friends(no gf though) and simply see no point in life after graduation. I feel like last 4 years at uni was a waste of my time. I don't feel more intelligent or like accomplishing something.

Did anyone feel like this in their senior year? I am feeling rather conflicted. Failing interviews mean I lack skills but then I can't find motivation to become better in this field. What is crazy is that I can get lost in coding for hours when feeling like it but still feel rather dumb frequently. I wrote C language compiler on my own so I am not hopeless case but still feel like it is nothing and I am inferior to others out there."

I've seen you mature from kids who seemingly only care about prestige and where you get in and writing obnoxious braggy essays, to young adults who are giving each other truly awesome advice and pieces of wisdom. It has been an amazing process to watch. Your support for each other is real. I'd never been part of an online community before or spent any time online actually, and I had no idea what to expect, but i certainly wasn't expecting this level of bonding and care for each other.  You all are incredible kids. You really need to remember that today. And tomorrow. And next week. And next year. 

So, I want you to do me a favor today. Gonna take the focus off college acceptances for just a few minutes and mods, I hope you'll bear with me here. I want each one of you to write to me today and for the next few days or the next week or hell, forever, and tell me three things in your life you are grateful for.  You can respond here or pm me if you'd rather. You come from around the world and so many different circumstances, and I know many of you have struggled with parts of your lives. I've heard your stories, but today I want to focus on the good stuff. So tell me three things you are thankful for. Big or small. 

(Please feel free to respond even if you're not a senior!)

I'll go first. 
1. I'm so happy that my son suggested that I see if there was a subReddit for college applications. I have learned more here from you all (my Reddit kiddoes) and all the moderators and admissions officers than from all the books I've read and classes I've taken. Thank you for that!

2. I'm thankful for my own kids. They are a little wacky. All very different  and from them I've learned that there is no one certain way to live life. I have my oldest son who's going the path-following route and becoming a doctor. And I have my middle who's turning down Columbia law school to follow a career in comedy. And then my baby who is a happy college kid, looking for summer internships in the music industry but really who knows? They are all smart, yes, but I'm most thankful for the fact that they are nice. 

3. I'm thankful today that I had a mom who supported me no matter what decisions I made or whether she agreed with them or not. I miss her a lot because she died two years ago, but she taught me a lot about caring for others. She was dedicated to helping low income first generation college kids get an education.  I have been on here with you all this year partly in honor of her. She taught me that I am In control of my future and that life sucks sometimes, but that doesn't mean I can be or will be a sucky person.  My mom had some bad shit happen to her; her life wasn't perfect. She graduated from college at age 44 and then went on to get her masters.  After that she developed and was the head of the early childhood department at her local college until she died. 

Those are some of my big things. I have lots of little things I'm gonna add in the next few days.  Now it's your turn. I can't wait to hear from you.  

Edit - forgot to remind you to breathe😊!"

62g7z7,5,2017-03-30,Econ or Stats?,scurtis28,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/62g7z7/econ_or_stats/,"Hey guys,

So to give some quick background:
I'm a sophomore non-target in the undergrad b-school CURRENTLY double majoring in finance and econ (with a minor in stats). I interned last summer in IB with a boutique shop, I interned in the winter at a L/S equity HF in an ER-type role, and I'll be doing a shadow type internship at an MM in NY in their consumer retail coverage group this upcoming summer post sophomore year.
My question is do I stick with my current majors in finance and economics OR do I keep finance and take on statistics as a second major? 

My long term goal would IDEALLY be to work in HF, obviously short term goals being to go somewhere in IB/ER and even S&amp;T (which all have some level of opps to go to HF). Considering I'm from a non target and need to stand out as much as possible, stats seems appealing as well as the idea that it'll give me a quantitative edge in S&amp;T type spots. Another pro is that the HF field is becoming far more ""quant-natured"" and while I'm not looking to be a full on quant/algo developer, people I've connected with across the HF industry have said there's substance to a more quant based degree.


That being said, the cons are:
1) Statistics major is harder than Economics, may take a toll on my GPA and
2) It may lead IB/ER guys to question why I studied statistics to which I probably won't have a great answer


Obviously, an easy solution would be to either target solely S&amp;T jobs or IB/ER jobs BUT I'm trying to keep my search and networking efforts as broad as possible and I'm very interested in all 3. Considering there's only one or two BB's that do recruit at my school (for a VERY limited amount of IB spots) and how HF jobs out of undergrad are incredibly hard to come by (esp. from non-target), I figured a broad approach to getting to the long-term goal would make more sense.

I'd love any insight! Thanks!"
62gd9l,1,2017-03-30,"Health sci background, looking to get into CS",powawowwow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62gd9l/health_sci_background_looking_to_get_into_cs/,"I have read previous posts regarding a similar question, but they are rather outdated. So here we go:

I am in my last year of undergraduate in a health science program. I am minoring in health informatics at my university, so I do have some coding experience (or I will have some coding experience (Python and C++) at the end of my UG). I am also currently taking CS50x online. I do this on the side because I have a full-time internship as an analyst in the health field.

I enjoy programming a lot and I love to problem solve. This is why I feel extremely unhappy in my program and wish I had pursued CS from high school. Unfortunately, such is life :/

My end goal is to work in the tech industry. With that, I am not sure what my next steps are. Compared to other people my age, I am obviously under-developed as a programmer - and I do not have the same job experience. At the same time, I don't think going into a second undergraduate degree in CS is practical financially. I thought about getting a Master's degree in Health Informatics /Bioinformatics, but that would mean learning strictly from a health/science perspective, something I am not sure I am down for - but it seems like the only option for me right now. 

Does anyone in this subreddit have any advice to offer? How does one just break into the tech industry without a CS background? What are things I can do to make myself employable in the industry? Or is there a degree I can that that would help? I am not sure if there is anything out there. But any advice will help. 

Thank you to all who replied in advance, I truly appreciate it."

I don't hate programming, but I hate the interviews and I don't think I would enjoy being a software engineer in the long run. I've interviewed for both types of roles and I enjoyed the product management interviews a lot more. I actually had fun doing them and didn't feel the same crippling anxiety I feel during coding interviews. That said, I was sadly rejected by a startup in California that I had high hopes for because I had passed the first three rounds and was flown onsite. I did well on all the interviews onsite except for the last one but I thought I still had a shot. However, they told me they were interviewing other candidates so they likely found someone with an MBA degree or prior PM experience. I was still proud of myself for getting to the onsite interview with only a college background. But, now I'm panicking because it is already April and I am left with no job leads (please no one tell me about the ""window being closed"" because I am aware of my time running out and I see that a lot on here). I have been feeling depressed since I got that rejection because I was really hoping I could finally end my job search and work at a company I actually really like. The fact that I was so close makes it even harder to stomach, and I've been interviewing and job searching for a few months now so it's hard not to feel like I am simply unemployable and that there's something wrong with me. 

I have also been applying to all PM jobs that I would qualify for, but I know that PM is difficult to get into as a college grad (though not impossible). If I cannot get a direct PM job, I am willing to take on positions that can help me gain experience so that it is easier the next time I apply. What kind of positions should I look out for? Are there any steps I should definitely take? Should I try to email/send LinkedIn messages to recruiters and ask if they have anything for me? Also, I realize there is a stigma around this, but if I could get a well-paying internship in PM that could lead to a full-time job I am open to that as well. I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has gone through a similar transition before."

Got an offer from a pretty well known tech HR company, they'll pay $25+ an hour and it's pretty close to the school I'm going to, but they ran out of summer slots so they're only offering me a fall one. However I want to recruit in the fall, where I'm pretty confident in my ability to get an internship at a Big-N company. I made it to the final rounds of Uber/Dropbox/Qualtrics/Yahoo etc this spring however made small mistakes in each one due to lack of practice/experience (I started leetcode prep in January and interviewed in Feb/early March). I'm confident that over the summer I will be able to get my whiteboarding and technical knowledge up to par with Big4 company standards. Additionally I will have referrals to Microsoft/Amazon/Pintrest and my recruiters at the previous companies I interviewed with are interested in reinterviewing me again next year. However, I am also in talks with a few startups for internships this summer and although they're not as prestigious and pay jack, I hope to learn a lot.

TLDR: Want to recruit in Fall, don't want to take summer classes. choices: Take decent/good fall job offer and summer classes OR work at startup this and try for a BigN in the fall.

I'm leaning towards the startup route however I don't know how much companies will care about me working at an unknown startup vs at a pretty well known tech company when it comes to recruiting. Thoughts?"

I hope that this post can be only encouragement for new kids looking at this sub who want to start working in the tech field, wherever that may be (Networking/Programming/Administration). 

My father died a couple years ago from cancer and it put of a lot of perspective on my life in terms of what I wanted to do as a profession. My first two years of college I was a business student studying marketing (I was 20 at the time) with no idea what I was going to do in the future. I was very scared as to what I would do to support myself in the future because I instantly knew that I would have to help my Mom as well. 

At first, I was obsessed with the Anonymous movement on social media, which I quickly realized was totally ridiculous, and starting reading real posts from people here saying, ""If you really want to be a hacker, get your CCNA first and develop a true understanding of Networking before you even attempt to write/use programs to infiltrate networks."" No advice could have been better for me in terms of developing a career. I instantly realized that there was a whole different side to ""hacking"", which was defending networks and having a true understanding of networks to where you could program your own tools and not be a ""script kiddie"". 

This instantly got me hooked and I committed myself to get my CCNA Security and learn Python in and out. I can say that I have never been guided in a more right direction than getting the feedback from people here on this device. I still consider myself a complete amateur in Network Security but achieved my CCNA Security and have written several Python IPV6 petnest tools in the last couple years and could not have done it without this sub-reddit.

I officially got an internship with Cisco starting this next January and I broke down when I got the confirmation. I could not have done any of this without you all and hope you know that your advice, even on little things, has been such a help in a world that I still am learning. 

Cheers!

To anyone looking to enter the field:

Work hard and be humble. never be afraid to ask others for advice and learn constantly. My favorite resources are this sub, Stack overflow (for programming) and Cisco DevNet for learning automation. If you are someone who wants to enter Cyber Security (Infosec), I highly recommend getting a Sec+ and learning Python well.

62kvtf,15,2017-03-31,New job making me feel worthless,unsurejackal,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/62kvtf/new_job_making_me_feel_worthless/,"I'm sorry for how long this is.

I recently graduated college a year ago and a short while before that i was employed as a network technician and loved it but the pay wasnt great. At the start of this year i decided to get a new job and hopefully get paid enough to move out. 

I managed to get a job at a small company after two successful interviews and the pay was alot for someone with my lack of experience and so i was optimistic. I spoke to the person in charge and in the interview and when i first started they spoke positively about the company growing and expanding rapidly and me becoming a senior member. 

I quickly noticed early on that i wouldn't be involved in anything like i have before and this position was more about giving presentations (which i suck at), project management and writing system processes  to use when dealing with customers. 

I didn't lie in my interview and even showed them examples of what I've done (set servers up, write scripts etc). I don't have business written anywhere on my resume.

Depsite this i thought I'll try my best to see if i could get good at this and saw it as a challenge. 

Fast forward to today and it's really getting me down. If my boss doesn't call me into his office at least 3 times a day to criticise me or micromanage me i view it as a good day.

My boss called me in today and bought my work up(writing business processes) and said this work is useless to us and all your previous work is and my interns did a better job and basically suggested if i need to improve quickly. I ask for help but all i get is i don't want to show you how to do things i want you to come up with new ideas but i feel stupid because i don't know.

I'm not an emotional person but after this when i was alone i burst into tears at how stupid I look.

In my previous job i was the goto guy for help but here I feel like nothing i know applies and i feel worthless.

Am i being too sensitive? Or should i look for a new job and put moving out on hold?"
62luhw,2,2017-03-31,[Question]Campus IT Job Vs Internship,PhlyingHigh,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/62luhw/questioncampus_it_job_vs_internship/,"I am currently a Junior in college and plan on graduating May 2018. I am a Computer Science major but have gotten into IT work on campus and really enjoy it and will most likely peruse it after college. 

I currently work for my college's IT department as Desktop Support for the college of Education, biggest college on campus. It is a great part time job and I am getting a lot of experience, it is a Tier 2 IT position. The manager has talked about how a few of the workers graduated from the college in my position and instantly got a classified job with the University.

I got an offer from an nonprofit HR development company to be apart of their IT support staff. I have not asked what tier IT it would be considered(Should I ask that?) but from the description and what they have told me it sounds like I'll be answering phones and helping troubleshoot for other companies using the HR software. The pay is about $5 more an hour which would be nice, but my end goal is to get a job out of college not make an extra buck right now.

When a company is looking at my resume for a job after college would they prefer to see 1 year Tier 1 IT, 10 months of Tier 2 IT, and a summer internship of Tier 1 or 1 year Tier 1 IT and 1 year of Tier 2 IT?"
62m76m,2,2017-03-31,Do I bother asking for raise when I have very little leverage? Need to figure out before the end of the day.,throwaway123123322,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62m76m/do_i_bother_asking_for_raise_when_i_have_very/,"I'm a high school senior who interned last summer at a local software engineering startup as a software engineer. The startup is doing quite well right now, dozen employees and business is ramping up. The CEO is pretty chill, he offered to pay me even though I initially was cool with doing an unpaid internship. 

I was being paid $15 an hour, which to me at the time was quite reasonable considering I had 0 experience working in software at a company level. I worked extremely slowly on projects because I essentially had to figure everything out for the first time. CEO and coworkers were always willing to help me out and teach me new things and I appreciated that a lot. I had only taken two computer science courses at my high school, AP Computer Science and a data structures class. Overall though, when I made my final presentation covering everything I did that summer, I realized that I actually provided a decent amount of value to the company because I worked on a few projects that have saved our engineers a lot of time since they were implemented last summer.  

I accepted an offer to work again part time during this school year and during the summer. Pay hasn't come up, but I'm almost certain I'll be paid; he asked for the hours I worked this month for payroll work today.

So this is my dilemma. I'm heading into college next year, and my family is paying $35k a year for education (cs degree obviously) at a top uni in the US. I'd like to help them out obviously so I want to earn as much money as I can this year. Plus having extra money to spend on random stuff is nice. I am perfectly fine with working for $15 an hour, but if I could get a raise that would be amazing. I've read the entirety of http://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/ , but I've already accepted the job, not to mention I don't really have much leverage as a high schooler with no degree and little experience. I literally do not have any sort of BATNA. I got really lucky finding this internship and I don't trust my luck in finding another one. However, I am confident that my work output will be much higher than it was last year. I definitely don't want to come off as ungrateful/risk losing this job though. So if you think that I will come off this way, please let me know. 

So three questions, do I ask for a raise, and if so, how do I go about doing so tactfully (help with wording would be appreciated), and how much do I ask for? I was thinking of sending over my hours as requested and including a note about a possible raise over email to the CEO. I feel like all I have going for me is my perception that I'm better than I was last year. Any and all advice is welcome.

Thanks guys!

62md4a,9,2017-03-31,How to automate a workflow that creates a new geodatabase with a new raster dataset within?,ganzas,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/62md4a/how_to_automate_a_workflow_that_creates_a_new/,"I am an intern trying to create a model converting asc files to a raster, and then extract 3D values to points following some steps a colleague put together.

The first step is to select a location, and create a new file gdb there. Then, I want to create a new raster dataset within that new gdb. How do I go about linking these two processes together, seeing as the gdb doesn't exist until the model is run?

If this would be easier to put together in a script, I can try that too. I'm a beginner in terms of python, so while it would be a great opportunity, I don't know how to set up and run a script . I know how to write a for-loop, and I  know some basic syntax rules,  so I can definitely learn it. It's just real-world implementation and testing that I've never seen!

Any tips with this? Or some online walkthroughs for more complex models or GIS scripting? Most of the people I work with don't use any scripting or modeling, so I don't have any mentors that can point me in the right direction."

They assigned me a take-home assignment which I was able to complete and then I had to come do a on-site interview. 

At the onsite interview I didn't do all to well but I was able to complete all the problem though not in a timely fashion. After the onsite I had a meeting with the CTO of the company(it's a small-sized company) and she asked me how much I was making at my previous internship. I told her $14 and today I was emailed with an offer at $16.

 I want counter with at least $20 due to some debts I have to pay off and was wondering if this is fair despite the fact that I just changed my major to CS and have been mainly self-taught."
