1bgpmf,0,2013-04-01,Considering switching out of engineering. Rough idea of where to go next. Help please?,PrinceRhaegar,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1bgpmf/considering_switching_out_of_engineering_rough/,"I'm a second semester sophomore EE major, and for this past semester, it seems like with each lecture I go to in my engineering courses (Electric Circuit Theory, Mechanics I, and Intro to Logic Design), the more and more I think to myself ""Wow.  I really fucking hate all of this and wish I was somewhere else right now.""  Not a good sign.  The biggest problem is that since I'm already half way through with my degree, if I switch now my major's set in stone, so I'm a little hesitant.  Another problem is that most of the other fields that I'm interested in (music and film) aren't exactly lucrative, and after spending $100,000 on a college education I don't want to get a bullshit degree that'll likely only leave me the option of working in a restaurant come graduation.  I would go for other sciences that interest me, like math or neuroscience, but I really have no intention of going to grad school and the unfortunate reality is that a bachelor's degree in either of those fields isn't going to give you shit (as far as I know so correct me if I'm wrong).

A friend of mine's been going through a similar situation, and we both have a rough idea of what to do next, but I'd appreciate any advice I can get before making a decision as life altering as this.  My school also has a school of communications that offers degrees in general communications, journalism, and film &amp; TV.  I'm considering switching to something like that, but what's holding me back the most is the fact that communications has a rep for being a useless major.  My friend said that if I do something like that and do a minor in engineering (which I'd only have to take like 2 more engineering courses to finish), I'd be specialized and if I do a couple internships that I'd still be able to find a job working for a technical company even if I wouldn't technically be an engineer.  But do jobs like that even exist?  Would anyone even look at the fact that I have a minor in engineering and can program in 3 different languages or would they only see the communications degree and base everything off that?  What sort of career options are there?  And if all else fails what else could I go for that wouldn't leave me in massive amounts of debt?  Comp Sci maybe?

Apologies in advance if I came across as a bit of a dick so far.  I have 2 exams this week, not feeling confident about either of them, and combining that with the stress of having no idea what I want to do with my life, I hope that my sounding a little irritable is at least somewhat understandable.  Thanks for any advice you can give, sincerely."

I have an informational interview for a summer internship position this week at a UC Berkeley-affiliated museum.  This is my first interview for an internship position rather than a job, and also the first informational interview I have ever had.  Nowhere in the listing I responded to or the correspondence I have had with the museum is there a specific mention of attire for interviews.  I have been looking for clues in the email I received, trying to read between the lines and assess how formal I should be, but I'm not certain.  It doesn't help that being Berkeley, sometimes things tend toward the more informal.  Here is the email I received from the museum:

&gt;Hi madprudentilla,
How about date at time? The interview process will take about 30
minutes, and we can speak more about the project and show you the
photography set up. Let me know if this time works for you, then I can meet
you in front of the museum gallery (location).
Thank you,
-Person from Museum


How should I dress?  Is it appropriate for me to ask my interviewer beforehand?

Thanks!!!

1be4ke,1,2013-03-31,Some Motivation For Those Struggling with Job Searching / life,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1be4ke/some_motivation_for_those_struggling_with_job/,"Hi Everyone! 

The purpose of this thread is to motivate those who feel like they are about to give up. And at the same time, this is necessary for myself to keep things in perspective and to remind myself that I'm worth it, and that things work out! 

This day, about two years ago I was homeless living in the Salvation Army. The exact reason as to why I ended up there could be subject for another post, however the point is I was homeless. Almost nothing to my name and on the verge of loosing any and all family support. I was in a dark spot and anyone familiar with living in a homeless shelter can attest. 

After getting acclimated to the conditions and to the brevity of the situation I got myself into, I created several goals to accomplish. And one of those goals was to get back into college and finish my degree. After sticking it out almost 1.2 years at the Salvation Army, I finally got accepted into school. Talk about a culture shock. Going from living in a bed bug invested communal homeless shelter, to a college campus is quite the upgrade. So Yes, if anyone is currently homeless and looking to get into school with little to nothing to your name there is hope! 


Anyway, from there I set another goal. To graduate with the highest marks possible. And come May 2013, I will be graduating with honors and a degree in business administration with concentration in financial planning. 

From the time I moved out of the homeless shelter, to this present day, networking has been key to ensuring a payable job. I learned at the shelter the importance of communication, friendship, and networking. I networked with Social Services to get on food stamps. I networked with several colleges to get admitted. I networked with financial aid to ensure maximal funding for a homeless 21 year old with virtually no money to his name. 

Anyway, the importance is networking. I joined groups associated with my field of study. I networked with non profits around here as soon as i got out of the shelter and on campus. Through networking I found a nice spot volunteering for a refugee school. And ended up designing their financial reporting system in Excel to ensure sustained federal and state funding. I networked with professors, ensuring good referrals if graduate school comes around. I networked with the president of my school to give me pointers before my first ever business breakfast meeting with people established in the field I'm studying. 

Alas that gets me to where I am today. At that breakfast meeting mentioned above, I networked with a very amazing individual who today is my mentor. We ate a delicious breakfast; listened to a terrific speaker, and out of that grew a job offer as their first ever intern. After working there for about 2 months, I received a full time salaried position post graduation in May. 

I am so very blessed to be where I am today. Through hard work and networking, I went from living in a homeless shelter in one of the roughest parts of town, to graduating with high marks and a salaried job position. All thanks to hard work, luck, and networking. Although, at times, the trauma associated with what happened during that very dark period of my life sneaks up on me, telling me I'm not worth this. Not worth the amazing things in life. You see, I lived a very chaotic and unhealthy life for a while, and sadly I found comfort in that. So I need to do things like this to remind me how strong I am, how far I've come, and how the darkness is a scary place and should never be returned to. Rather it should be used for motivation for myself and others!"

Current CS Junior, CS GPA a sliver under 4.0; I am very good at the types of questions that are typically asked in these interviews (Have been reading books/studying/etc. for some time). I have zero extra projects, or internships besides some minor CS tutoring work.

For this summer I have been offered several internships, and am hoping to apply to google summer of code as well. What should I do to maximize my odds of getting interviews with the Big 4 (Google, Amazon, FB, MS). The offers are as follows:

1) 20$/hour, Basically junior IT. Some shell scripting, likely not much more than that. I literally live next door to this place as well.

2) 15$/hour, Android/iOS development. Long commute to this place, was not really 'feeling' the workplace when I interviewed there.

3) 24$/hour, some sort of work with databases/SQL. Not really sure on what is going on here and they were rather vague with me which leads me to believe I may end up being a coffee bitch. Long commute to here as well.

4) Google Summer Of Code, 5k/summer, working with one of various companies on open source projects. From my research this is not a full-time thing and I could do this nights/weekends while doing one of the other 3 during normal working hours.

5) GSOC + Independent project. I am not to keen on this, but if there is a specific type of project I could do that would make me more attractive to the big 4 for that initial interview then that is what I would do.

1bjixk,8,2013-04-02,[US-&gt;EU] Recently graduated and looking for career options that would allow me to spend a couple of years in Europe gaining work experience before returning for an MBA.,DerogatoryPanda,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1bjixk/useu_recently_graduated_and_looking_for_career/,"I graduated not too long ago and I'm planning on working for a few years to gain some work experience before trying to get into a good MBA program. I would love it if I could find a job that let me do this in Europe. Is it a pipe dream? Perhaps, but I'm an optimist. I studied abroad in Ireland while in college and also had a Summer internship at a Non-Profit in London. My degree was in International Relations with a specialization in Europe. I also had a minor in Business and one in Political Science. My situation is a bit tougher because I need some sort of job that would look good trying to get into business schools, so I can't really go the teaching English route. My degree seems to push me towards two options for this pre-MBA work period: the business option and the political/diplomacy option.

My question for you all is what fields/types of businesses should I be looking into? Where should I be looking? I would be content working for a company based in Europe or for a business based in the US that either had a branch in Europe or simply required travel to Europe. Working for a diplomatic service, political entity, or a non-profit are also all viable possibilities as long as I am gaining valuable experience towards apply to an MBA program.

I currently work part time with a title of ""Helpdesk Administrator"" at a manufacturing plant making ~$15/hr in order to help support myself. I've been there for over a year already and am happy there. I am hesitant to leave the job due to not having much financial backing.

I feel that I have a fairly competitive resume, yet even with following up on paid internships I never hear anything back.

 Does an unpaid internship provide enough value over my current job to take the pay cut? If I choose to forgo an internship this summer will future employers see a steady job as an asset?

I work for an independent game studio that does contract work with publishers to pay the bills, then self publishes games when the money is good. We don't have a flexible budget, and get a lot of use out of awesome interns from the nearby university, my new hires are not these people.
I've managed a coffee shop before, and a bar, so responsibility is normal to me, a long with handling difficult employees, but every one of my subordinates at that job was at least competent. What's worse, is that these two hires, (one unpaid intern, the other paid) were brought in through nepotism, and not actually interviewed. One of them is my managing director's nephew, and the other is the girlfriend of our systems administrator, the guy who single-handedly runs our network, and is extremely valuable to the company. How do I deal with an intern who is so awful at this job, and makes more work for me and my other team members, without any option to fire him, because he's my boss's nephew? (He was my personal intern the last month, he just went back to school, it was literally the longest month of my entire professional career.)

Here's the twist, the girlfriend is also my roommate, so is the SA, and she's also completely incompetent and useless. I only worked with her for a brief time before I moved into the company fully (when I was an intern and she was just finishing her internship) and when she left to go back to school me and the other two members of my team had to pick up her slack, which was everything she was supposed to do in the 3 months she was there, which made for a ton of overtime.
The worst part is that she has an extremely strong sense of entitlement, and wears her boyfriends status as her own, and since he's been here for 6 or 7 years she feels like she's god's gift to the company, like they are both irreplaceable 'veterans', I've been here for one year and I will be her team lead. At some point I just know that I'm going to have to correct her, like any normal leader would have to do, I'm going to have to lead her, and due to her strong sense of entitlement I see her very easily taking it negatively and personally, then I have to go back to our shared house.

Another bit of added information, I will be moving, but by that time I will have worked with her for 6 or 7 months, my husband and I both live in this house with the two of them and another coworker, it's just that moving in the area we live in costs an extreme amount (damage deposits are equal to 3 or 4 months rent, plus a 1-2k euro fee for the Realtor) of money and we have to wait until late summer/fall before we can escape the roommate situation.
Any advice? I've had subordinates before, but never ones that were so incompetent, and NEVER any that were so closely related to my boss, or so closely connected to my home life. Halp.

Edit: It's not really a 'how do i be firm' question, it's more about the fact that how do I handle it when 1 is my boss's nephew that he holds in such high regard and the other is my roommate that has the potential to make my life hell at home based on how I deal with it at work. "

Any other advice also would be appreciated, I just do not want to be worried that I am screwed or something. 

Thanks for your time."

1bkvxj,3,2013-04-03,Looking for advice from the graduate ECE students,Beignet,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1bkvxj/looking_for_advice_from_the_graduate_ece_students/,"First off, it's long, so if you make it through to the end, thanks for reading. 

I'm a undergrad at Georgia Tech double majoring in EE and applied math. I'll graduate at the end of the calendar year, in the fall semester, Dec 2013. I always thought I'd go to grad school, once I figure out what I'd like to focus in. I still don't really know, but at least I have a better idea and I'd still like to go to grad school. I wanted one summer away from school so I've been applying to internships, but haven't been accepted to any, and it's really made me question my aptitude, and now I'm wondering if I can get into grad school here, or elsewhere. 

The more I think the more obstacles I find. I don't speak up a lot in class, so a lot of professors don't know me, so the list of people I can get recommendations from in short. I'm more involved in my math classes, and I've been working on getting to know my professors this year, though I've still got maybe two good recommendations. I also don't have any real research experience. I spent a little bit of time at a professor's lab, but I was more of a code monkey, and didn't do any real work. So when people say research, I still don't really know what that means. I have two other internships that were spent at a small company doing work I also became disinterested in. And since then I got really discouraged at my major and had a few other life issues, overall making me a little depressed and unmotivated. 

What I do have is an alright GPA, about 3.7, which supposedly puts me pretty high up here. It would be higher, if it wasn't for a semester where I did really badly (3 C's made for a 2.3 that semester, and a 3.55 cumulative). I'm afraid that'll show up badly on my transcript, but literally every other semester has been 4.0s or close. Instead of research I've also been a TA every semester I've been in school, just not in ECE classes, but various MATH courses. I've also been involved in IEEE for the past year, doing various projects and competitions, which looks good for employment but I don't know about academia. I'll also have a buttload of classes completed. It's at least 2 majors and a minor's worth. That took nearly taking the maximum allowed credits every semester, so getting those 4.0s weren't easy. If getting into grad school is about work ethic I'd like to think I've got that in spades. 

Still, I'd definitely do it over differently if I could. Take some less classes, be more involved. I'm pretty sure I could get the required GRE scores for here, and most schools. Can I redeem myself with the above? I understand it probably means no funding, but I would definitely try to get funding if I could first get in. 

Also, I wasn't planning on taking classes this summer, hence trying to find internships. But now that's not panning out the way I want it to, so I thought I'd take one or two classes to lighten my load in the fall, all the while doing my own side projects and study for GRE. I would also ask to do research with someone, but is that asking on short notice?
 
Basically anything anyone can tell me would be great. And thanks for reading. "
1bkpy7,1,2013-04-03,Job Search Advice,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bkpy7/job_search_advice/,"Let me start from the beginning. 

I graduated in May 2011 with an Associate's in Special Business in Computer Systems. My only job experience at this point was the internship from the program. I found a job through a temp agency in June, doing Internet call center support for CenturyLink, making $10 an hour. I have an hour long commute, each way. In Feb 2012, they hired me as full time, and bumped me to $11 an hour, and in August, I got promoted to level 2 support at $11.36 an hour. Last week I got a raise to about $11.85 an hour, but that was just a yearly cost of living. At this point, there isn't much elsewhere I could go with CenturyLink. I live in York, PA, and since New Years I have been searching for better paying jobs. 

The real issue is, I don't see many decent IT jobs in York, and the ones I do see all require tons of experience, or experience with things that I am not even familiar with. When I was getting my AA, we learned a lot about Server environments, but since then I feel like I have forgotten most of what we learned. I kinda feel like what I really learned was how to google things efficiently and learn as I go. CenturyLink gave us paid training, is this common with some companies? I am worried that I will end up getting a job and then being unable to perform it since I won't understand the software that the company uses. I am 22 years old, I feel like I should earn more than this with a degree, even just an AA. I am starting to consider going back to school for a Bachelor's in Computer Science or maybe a Business Degree.

I have mainly been looking online (spending several hours a week just searching every site I can and submitting my resume to most positions I feel I could qualify for) and I hear nothing back. Is there a better way to go about this?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What does infrared astronomy help to observe than other methods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ttl6?context=5)|Looking in the infrared is awesome when your sources are enshrouded by dust, which prevents you from observing in the visible of ultraviolet wavelengths.
 |There are large quantities of dust inbetween us and the galactic center (we're on the outer parts of the Galaxy so think of the spiral arms). So it's impossible to observe the center in visible wavelengths; however, in the IR we're able to see through all of that dust and find out what's going on (see the picture!)
[Does the same principle also work with radio telescopes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v567?context=5)|Yup! And with radio telescopes you can observe in the day.
[How much do you get paid to do this, and if I want to be you; how much time and money do I have to put in? Also, are these all from tax dollars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vabs?context=5)|I get paid pretty comfortably. But keep in mind that this is coming right out of undergrad so not technically having a real job. I know my friends who pursued careers in business are making much more than I am.
 |The time and money is all pretty much put into going to undergrad and doing good there. Unfortunately, most people don't have that opportunity which always leads me to wonder about all the brilliant minds that are out there that go on never fulfilling their potential (sorry that was a bit off topic)
[What altitude do you fly at and why can't you preform the same operations from earth?  Also can you tell us what were looking at in the first picture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96u0yw?context=5)|Ah, sorry for not being more descriptive about the picture. It's the inner 20 lightyears of our galaxy! That ring that you see is a ring of hot dust circling around the supermassive black hole 4 million times the mass of the Sun in the galactic center. Those bright Y-like streamers are streamers of dust and gas falling into the supermassive black hole.
 |We fly at altitudes greater than 4000 ft to get above the clouds. This is key! We can't perform these same operations on land because the clouds prevent us from observing in the infrared.
 |Also, since it's not a space-based observatory we can make changes/upgrades to the plane very easily since it comes back home everyday.
[Where can we find more pictures?  It looks like a giant pissed off flame ouroboros, and I need to put that fear to rest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v8dl?context=5)|Haha, here's another image of it in the radio ([Link to ircamera.as.arizona.edu](http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/images/sgra_lg.jpg))
 |Notice that we see the full ring in the IR, as opposed to that radio image!
[Wouldn't the movement of the aircraft screw with the pictures?  How is this compensated for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vsz2?context=5)|The German-made telescope assembly is really well done, and effectively isolates the telescope from movements of the aircraft.
[Wait, it's a picture of sagittarius A?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vo66?context=5)|We can't actually ""see"" the black hole at our wavelengths. We can see the structures that have formed from its gravitational influence. The region is referred to as Sagittarius A West.
[Why do clouds stop infrared light, but dust doesnt? Well its obvious that the specific wavelength interacts with the watermolecules, but why? What makes water special compared to the dust?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c97nhxb?context=5)|You've got it right that it has to do with the specific wavelengths that are absorbed by water. But different molecules have different absorption properties. Dust grains in space will block UV and optical light much more than it does infrared light because of the different wavelengths (infrared light has longer wavelengths than UV and optical light).
 |However, if you have a dense enough concentration of dust, it can even block out the infrared light.
[Wow that is amazing, thanks for sharing! Is there a website with these photos? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w6iy?context=5)|[Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/13-010HQ.html)
 |There will hopefully be more in the coming year!
[How does it work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96typ2?context=5)|SOFIA is really an amazing feat of engineering. It is literally a 2.5 meter telescope mounted in the fuselage of a Boeing 747. The project was in the works for over 10 years since they had to strip down the airplane and retrofit it with new electronics to operate the telescope and run the instruments made for it.
[I worked with a guy that helped to engineer the telescope mount in the back of the aircraft. Nothing like digging an old 747 fuselage out of storage and adding extra structure to support massive amount of sensitive equipment. Or so I'm told.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2ie?context=5)|Hah, it would've been cool if they just made an entirely customized plane from scratch.
[What exactly is your assignment on board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2ie?context=5)|My role on board is mainly just to look at the data form our camera in real time to make sure things are looking ok, and also to do some quick image analysis.
[How quickly is that, as in how fast paced is your work? Do you get a new image every few minutes or is it somewhat slower? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v5vi?context=5)|It can be really fast-paced, especially since we're essentially at the will of the pilots and the flight path. This means we can be looking at a huge series of images over several minutes, but we also have some downtime when the plane is changing directions so we can look over our data.
[That's cool, I would've thought I'd be slower than that though. Thanks for answering. Another question, how long is your typical flight? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v85u?context=5)|About 10 hours. It's pretty much a red-eye flight except you're landing in the same place you took off.
[""red-eye""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vvb6?context=5)|Haha it could be.
[Do they charge you extra for the telescope? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v5kl?context=5)|We actually get reserved observing time on it! but we can't touch it or we get in trouble.
[How do you feel, knowing that you're sometimes Higher than Snoop Lion ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v7oz?context=5)|Like a G.
[How difficult is Astronomy to get into, such as work load, study time and other courses you decided to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ui02?context=5)|You typically major in physics in undergrad, which can be a lot of work. I'm actually done with taking classes but in my first year of grad school I was taking courses as well as TAing which took up a large amount of my time.
 |It's a lot of hard work but I find it to be incredibly rewarding both teaching and shedding light on the crazy unknowns of space.
[Will you come back and do an AMA when it's done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96tyqu?context=5)|Sure! It might not be very exciting though.
[Can you take some pictures of the cockpit? I love the old 747 classics, especially the SP. I'm jealous you get to fly on one! And of course do amazing scientific work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vp5o?context=5)|Sure, I can do that. They completely redid the avionics so it might to look a little different. There's actually a picture of it floating around some where...
[ off, very awesome! Second, what kind of camera equipment do you use up there? Has anyone used a DSLR like a canon 60da up there? As for the telescopes you are using, what are they? And how do they work? As for the photos, do you/your company stack these photos for a final image? Or are they just single shots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96u8mx?context=5)|The camera is a one of a kind thing that costs millions of dollars. It has two 256x256 arrays that can image in the short and long infrared wavelengths simultaneously. They need to be cooled to a temperature of 4 degrees Kelvins (4 degrees above absolute zero!) in order to work properly. Here's some more information if you're interested, the camera is called FORCAST ([Link to www.sofia.usra.edu](http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/instruments/instruments_forcast.html))
 |The telescope is a German-made 2.5 meter telescope mounted in the fuselage of the plane. It's quite an amazing thing, it rotates on a single bearing and is isolated from the vibrations of the plane. So it's really awesome to see it in flight, especially in turbulence.
 |The image processing that goes into creating our images--keep in mind that our atmosphere emits heavily in the infrared and so it introduces a large amount of background which needs to be subtracted. The images are averaged over a large series of data.
[Do you guys come up with the acronym first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ub8b?context=5)|I actually have no idea.. I always thought it happens at the same time, like when you're writing a song and you have both the lyrics and the melody in your head if that makes any sense.
[If you could have picked the acronym, what would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v60a?context=5)|I actually like SOFIA, but I'll think about it...
 |Ok how about ICARUS. Infrared... something.. Stratosphere..
[Well, if you take out the Infrared part, you'd be doing visible-light astronomy, which is often done from the ground, so you'd end up just sitting on a SOFA. Not nearly as cool. Therefore, leave things as they are and enjoy sitting in a plane for ten hours.  Oh, wait...  Anyway, the better acronym is GREAT (German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies\), which discovered two new molecules not so long ago. One of them was OD, the deuterated hydroxyl radical, so my question is: How do they tell it's OD and not OH just by looking at spectra?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vist?context=5)|Ah, I haven't seen that yet. I believe OD will have different emission lines than OH.
[If any, what kind of training did you have to do for this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uabq?context=5)|4 years of undergrad as a physics major and several years of grad school. I actually joined the project right as our instrument was finished and being installed on the plane. So it's been a crazy experience getting involved with flying aboard the plane and doing some amazing science.
[Also, coke or Pepsi?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uabq?context=5)|I don't really drink soda.. but coke.
[How much pussy have you gotten since the axe deodorant commercials came out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v4m0?context=5)|I'm pretty sure there's an anti-correlation between axe deodorant and getting laid*
 |*assuming you're not in high school.
[So wait you haven't taken the suit out to the beach yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v6ng?context=5)|Nope, nor out to a burning building.
[I'm not an astronaut but I pay taxes and if you're not getting laid then it's time to start this country over. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v8m1?context=5)|Thank you for your concern, gnipeekitlaer.
[As a real and legit astronomer, how would you encourage young people that doesn't even understand your job and your contribution to the world, and how would you tell young people what could we achieve if there is more people in this area? Thank you sir. May god bless you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uyok?context=5)|I actually went back to my old elementary school a year ago to talk to them about what I do and what it means to be an astronomer. They were incredibly bright and it's amazing how aware they are of what is going on in the field--I had several ask me about exoplanets and black holes.
 |I simply tell them that it's not the astronomers of this generation that are going to solve all the problems of the Universe.. It's their generation that will ultimately drive forward and build upon the progress we've made. Witnessing the look on their faces when I told them that was one of the most rewarding things I've experienced as an astronomer.
[What about the magnetic fields?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v9sl?context=5)|&gt; :(
[What can be learned from the pictures you will take up there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uxn3?context=5)|That picture that I put up there is the sharpest image of the galactic center at those wavelengths. You see the clumpiness of the ring? It's not quite like Saturn's rings which appear more smooth. That's because something interesting is going on around the vicinity of the supermassive black hole and we're trying to figure out what it is.
[Also, how valuable would my background in development be? My guess is that it can definitely come in handy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w5wr?context=5)|Having a background in software development will definitely come in handy, since a lot of what is involved in astronomy/astrophysics is running models and messing with data.
[What does your typical day include as an astro grad student and how long exactly is your grad program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2mf?context=5)|Typically people take about 6 years.
 |A typical day is really quite boring. I sit in my office in front of a computer and analyse some data.. Then at the end of the day I realize what I did was wrong and spend the rest of the night or next day redoing it. Rinse and repeat.
 |Somewhere in between, science gets accomplished.
[How do you handle calibration images with SOFIA?  I imagine the bias and dark images are the same as ground-based scopes, but how do you take your flats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uaa1?context=5)|Calibration as you can imagine is incredibly difficult, we take a series of images of different calibrator stars throughout the night using multiple filters to characterize any sorts of variations from flight to flight or from being at different altitudes.  Don't even get me started on flat fields... we've spent countless hours in the lab trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it the end it feels like we've just been chasing our own tail.
[What would your advisor say if he/she knew you were on Reddit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w8h9?context=5)|""your username is Ultraballer2000?""
[Why not chuck this  thing in space as a long term observatory?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2ez?context=5)|Because we can have it come down everyday to do changes/upgrades to it. It's incredibly expensive to fly up to space to make repairs and changes to space-based observatories.
 |Ultimately, it comes down to money and fulfilling a method of observing that isn't accomplished by the other observatories out there.
[Thx for the reply, could your project be achieved with a budget comparable to Hubble, or is constant adjustment fundamental to the concept? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v5q9?context=5)|The running cost of SOFIA is cheaper (but not by much) than any of the space-based observatories like Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel, or especially JWST.
 |That's why airborne astronomy hits that sweet spot between cost and getting above the atmosphere to achieve ideal observing conditions.
[What are the goals of the observations?  Are you looking for certain things in particular?  Is it possible to image other galaxies or is the focus on our little patch of stars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uwt2?context=5)|The goals in our flight tomorrow are pretty much just to run a series of tests with our instrument aboard the plane to make sure everything is in order. Our real observations are taking place in June, where we'll be getting more images of the galactic center.
 |As far as studying the galactic center, we're looking for an understanding of what's going on there. There's this huge ring of dust around it that is slightly difficult to explain. There's clusters of massive, bright stars--even one that's believed to be the brightest star in the Galaxy. It's an amazingly unique place in our Galaxy that seems to be full of surprises. The latest one being this gas cloud falling in to the black hole and is expected to be crossing its event horizon in January.
 |We have definitely imaged other galaxies, so we are capable of seeing things far beyond on own galaxy.
[ITT: People who don't know the difference between an astronomer and an astronaut.  He (she?\) is not leaving the atmosphere, guys. They're just hopping on a badass 747 that is a flying telescope. Still cool nonetheless.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vfms?context=5)|Haha thanks. It's way better than mixing up astronomer and astrologer.
[Whats the average flying altitude for your plane? Is it higher than most jet airliners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vyab?context=5)|It's about 41000 ft, but I believe it can fly higher. It's higher than most typical commercial airliners.
[It's actually comparable, commercial airliners also can go up to 41000 ft.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w5p8?context=5)|Yeah, you're right.
 |SOFIA can actually go up to 45000 ft.
[What is your worst fear, of what could happen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vigk?context=5)|Worst rational fear would be that the instrument/telescope/airplane electronics fails and we don't get anything useful from the flight, which would push back our schedule and potentially my thesis.
 |Worst irrational fear would be that I oversleep and miss the flight.
[That Space Dragon in the first picture. How do you plan to destroy it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vhq0?context=5)|My side project.. but the jedi must never know.

I've never really looked to in depth at the requirements to becoming an astronaut. I think NASA was looking for astronauts a year ago or something, here's a PDF I found just doing search on that ([Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/606877main_FS-2011-11-057-JSC-astro_trng.pdf))

In other words, have you gotten laid because of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uued?context=5)|I'm in an 8+ year long relationship so I suppose you can take that into account for both your questions.
 |I don't think she cares much for what I study specifically, but I know she supports the crap out of what I do.
[Congrats, man. Is she also in the science field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uyhi?context=5)|Public health. So she is actually pursuing something that directly focuses on improving peoples' lives.
[Will you be my friend? Also, what's your take on DOMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96u1wa?context=5)|Haha, sure. It's awful and it's sad to me how there are so many people that are so devoted to denying liberties and happiness to other people.
[What's your opinion on UFOs? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vvi8?context=5)|There's gotta be life out there somewhere.
[Not exactly really specific for your job, but I'm extremely curious; How long did it take you to get your job? And do you ever see people that don't have masters or doctorates getting hired? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96tr6f?context=5)|I'm 25 years old and came to grad school right after undergrad (as a physics major). Most of the people working on the science have PhD's or are students associated with the project. We have several engineers on the project who designed our instrument from scratch, and I believe that doesn't require a masters. 
[Do you have a favorite space picture? If so what is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vbgn?context=5)|There are so many awesome images, but I'm particularly biased to this one ([Link to www.mpi-hd.mpg.de](http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/home/som/2009/12/images/Som_12_09_p0.jpg))
 |It's my current desktop wallpaper!
[Can you explain what exactly we are looking at? What exactly is the  red/yellow/white stuff ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vkvp?context=5)|The blue is x-ray emission, red is infrared, and yellow is near-infrared.
[I think most people see pictures like that and think, oh cool, that's shiny and I bet here and there are some stars.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vkvp?context=5)|The small point sources are luminous stars and the extended features are regions of ionized gas that I believe are shaped by strong winds from the stars and the strong magnetic field in the Galactic center. 
[Do you or have you played Kerbal Space Program? I'm so addicted to it! That first time I got into a circular orbit was magical!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vomh?context=5)|I've never seen that before, but the trailer looks awesome..
[I'm surprised that SOFIA is viable, given that the 'scope has to a. track continuously; the vectors must be much more complex than a ground based instrument, b. compensate for atmospheric distortion as well, and c. run on a budget that includes aircraft maintenance, fuel, and flight crew. How can this be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w3v2?context=5)|Airborne astronomy has actually been pretty big, but SOFIA is definitely the most ambitious project as of yet.
 |We don't have to worry too much about atmospheric distortion since we observe at longer wavelengths, but we do need to worry about the background emission from the atmosphere.
 |The project is employing lots and lots of people, so I think it's great that it's providing lots of opportunities for people (including myself!). You're right though, the costs are fairly high; but it still comes out to be cheaper than launching and maintaining a large space observatory.
[It has adaptive optics, right? i've always wondered how this looks in action. can you actually see the micro-mirrors moving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vwxh?context=5)|Nope, no AO. I think there are some videos out there of the adaptive optics in action on some other observatories.
[Hmm, i must have misread this.. would make sense on a moving platform, no? anyways, have fun in the stratosphere!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w58x?context=5)|We don't need to worry too much about atmospheric distortion in the IR wavelengths so AO isn't a necessity. it's always a good time up in the stratosphere.
[You're doing fantastic work! Is putting a 2.5m telescope on a plane cost-effective compared to the somewhat more stationary 10m Keck and 8m VLT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vder?context=5)|It's more expensive than those ground-based observatories, but less expensive than space based ones.
 |We have the advantage over ground based observatories in that we don't need to worry about the weather or 99% of the atmosphere.
 |We have the advantage over space based observatories because we can fly home every night to do upgrades, repairs, or changes as needed without flying in to space. However, we don't quite get the ideal observing environment that being in space allows.
 |So I feel like it's a nice blend of the two. 
[Does mirror size always correlate to image/data quality? Is it possible to make smaller telescopes that can do the same things as the larger ones? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vcnj?context=5)|I like to think of telescope size like a bucket. The larger the bucket, the more water you can collect in a set amount of time. Same thing with a telescope and photons. And you want as much photons as you can get! Larger telescopes also grant you better resolution, but this also depends on the wavelength you are observing in.
 |It all ultimately comes down to what you want to accomplish. A series of smaller telescopes have been used to discover transiting exoplanets, so it really all depends on the kind of thing you want to do.
[Are you nervous about whats gonna happen when you poop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vblw?context=5)|I've pooped on planes many times beforeso I feel like I'm ready for any poop-related challenge.
[Hey, pooping anywhere is good business, but what about when it comes out ready to look you in your eye?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vgsp?context=5)|That's the stuff of nightmares.
[Hello! This is just stellar \[excuse the pun :D\] to see an AMA on one of my future career choices. My question is, what more about our cosmos has this mission discovered as of yet? If nothing, than what is its eventual goal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vriz?context=5)|The SOFIA mission is really just getting revved up. The image that I posted and the other images taken in that flight series tell us about the environment around the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, which gives us an idea of what's going on in the center of other galaxies.
 |Ultimately, SOFIA's goal is to probe the Universe in the infrared wavelengths to reveal things in greater sensitivity and sharper resolution than most other observatories.
[I may be too late, but here it goes, just about every kid says they want to be an astronaut, is this something you always pursued? Or did you think about doing something else before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w0yy?context=5)|Hah, I should probably clarify this in my initial post but I'm not an astronaut. I'm an astronomer flying on a plane with a telescope that doesn't quite go into space.
 |I'd love to be an astronaut, and it would be awesome to someday get that opportunity. 
[Well you'll be closer than the rest of us down here. Good luck on reaching those dreams.  Edit: ...and the stars.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w32n?context=5)|Thanks so much for that comment.
[Can you name a nebula after me? That would be pretty awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v81l?context=5)|The operating_bastard nebula does have a ring to it.. but so does the Ultraballer2000 nebula.
[Is it hard to become an astronaut? Is it really as unrealistic to become one as it seems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vq3i?context=5)|Sorry to disappoint but I'm not an astronaut, I'm an astronomer. Although I think it would be awesome to be an astronaut, and I think it is pretty insanely hard to be one.
[Why aren't you getting a good night's sleep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v74y?context=5)|Because I need to get on a late-night observing sleep cycle. Our flight is from 5pm - 6am.
[Have you always wanted to be involved in space studies? I imagine with your grades you probably could of been nearly anything you wanted.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v6e6?context=5)|Not always. I actually only got interested in it in my sophomore year of undergrad when I had a conversation with one of my friends about how much we don't know about space. From there I went on and did an internship at a research institution and got a real taste for what doing research in astronomy is like and loved it.
 |There's this awesome sense of freedom involved in pursuing research, and as I mentioned in a previous comment it's incredibly rewarding.
[That picture need some major this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v7et?context=5)|I joke about this with my advisor way too much.
[What does he or she say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vira?context=5)|Just laughs at how stupid it is to take 4 scrambled pixels and then ""enhance"" to resolve a license plate.
[Are you afraid of what might happen when you lift off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ujbg?context=5)|Not anymore so than on a typical airplane. The take-off and landing are very much like a regular flight, except I get to sit in first class. They even have the fasten seat belts and no smoking signs.
[You should tell him, that if mcgyver can do it it can be done.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vo0u?context=5)|That might be my new motivational motto.
[Have you ever met other fellow astronomers who have dealt in finding exoplanets? If so, what did they say their jobs were like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w48k?context=5)|Yup. I think we're starting to evolve out of the phase of finding exoplanets, and into a phase of trying to characterize them--to see if we can find one with conditions similar to Earth. My office mate is working a project involving exoplanet characterization, trying to determine the contents of an expolanet's atmosphere. It's really cool stuff and just shows you how close we are to finding the ""holy grail,"" a truly earth-like planet around a Sun-like star.
[What inspired you to be an astronomer? Also, how many hours do you work per day? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vz5l?context=5)|I was probably inspired most by finding out how much we don't know about space. There's so many fundamental questions that we have only begun to touch the surface of.
 |Yesterday (or today..) I worked about 10 or so hours. But it varies a lot since I work on my own schedule pretty much.
[Would you rather float away to your death while in space, or burn up coming back into the atmosphere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vaw8?context=5)|I think it'd be cool to end your life in a fiery blaze of glory descending from the sky, but maybe that's just me.
[Yeah but think about how cool it would be for your body to float by mars one day, your remains would probably last longer than human civilization.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vdvk?context=5)|Haha that's quite beautiful/creepy imagery.
 |It would be cool though, but I still like the fiery blaze.
[My first thought since I heard about this: what about vibrations? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96viom?context=5)|Yes, this is actually kind've an issue. The Germans did a good job with the telescope and isolating it from the turbulence experienced by the plane, but it still affects our images. This is especially true since the telescope is exposed to the air (there is no window!) so air can be trapped in the telescope cavity and introduce some noise.
[Do you have Twitter and would you be able to post some photos of it all? :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vvmo?context=5)|Nah, I don't have a twitter. I can try to post some pictures tomorrow! They might not be very exciting though.
[Holy crap, you have an awesome job. Any advice for a high school senior who's considering astronomy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vf18?context=5)|Keep an open mind and ask lots of questions! And if you're serious about it, major in physics in undergrad.
[What puzzles you most about our universe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vgpi?context=5)|I could use this opportunity to make a social commentary..  but I'll avoid that and say dark energy.
[Seen anything from out of this world? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vnu4?context=5)|Everyday.
[What's the strangest thing you have seen? I have seen quite a few things that I consider to be not from this Earth. Maybe I am wrong..maybe I am right. It is what I believe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c982e27?context=5)|This square-shaped nebula has got to be one of the strangest things I've seen.. ([Link to img585.imageshack.us](http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1183/redsquaretuthill960.jpg))
 |Most nebula are somewhat spherical since if you have material expanding outwards with the similar velocities (like a firework). So that square-nebula really is something else... (Have you ever seen a square firework?)
[What's it like to pee in space? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vmci?context=5)|I'm not technically in space, but peeing on the plane is pretty normal.
[In your opinion what is the single most impressive thing you've captured? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w2ls?context=5)|I would definitely have to say it's that image I posted. It's just crazy to think that there's this huge ring-like structure in the center of the galaxy, right in the vicinity of the super massive black hole.
[Hope I'm not too late, but I'm planning on being an astronomer. I'm only fourteen right now. But I just wanted to know what your favorite part of the job was? Astronomy always fascinated me because of how much of the universe is unknown to us and how much is waiting to be discovered.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c984poh?context=5)|That's exactly why I wanted to be an astronomer. The thing is, the more we discover the more we realize we don't know.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you critique obits or know when a writer like you wrote it? Oh and do you always read obits since you write them?  I picture you on vacation reading an obit and thinking ""Ha, this is definitely hack work! Survived by!? Come on what is this 1999!?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9586aq?context=5)|Ohhh yes! I don't read obits on vacation (I try to forget about work), but I do critique obits written by people I know. And even people I don't know. People in my area are really awful writers.
[Why do obituaries rarely tell what the person died of? I mean, that's really the only interest I have when I look at that part of the paper. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957y9j?context=5)|It's up to the family and/or the funeral home. Most of the ones that I do include it. It's a personal thing, not a requirement. The reason we don't make it a requirement is because if the person dies by suicide, we don't want to force the family to include that information.
[I can think of many more reasons why a family would want to leave out the cause of death.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95llps?context=5)|Well yeah, of course. Our main reason is that we don't want to force the family to give out that kind of information, and that's the example we use when saying that it isn't a requirement isn't enough for people who call in to complain about the lack of a cause of death.
[People actually call in to complain that your obituaries don't include a cause of death?  What the hell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c96upbe?context=5)|People love to complain. It's really annoying.
[Have you ever done this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958718?context=5)|HAHAHAHA. No, oh my god that would be terrible. We make typos sometimes and when they're submitted they often have mistakes, but I hope that something like that would be caught before printing. Obits go through a pretty serious editing process before we publish for that very reason.
[Whats the most interesting obituary you've wrote?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957us2?context=5)|Our best obits are WWII veterans because they are usually filled with little historical tidbits. I once did an obituary for a guy who served under Gen. MacArthur. I also did an obit for someone who was part of the [Caterpillar's Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_Club). The most interesting obit I did was a double obit for a married couple who both served in WWII - I think he was Marines and she was Air Force, but I don't remember perfectly - and died a week apart. Their obit was very long but it told a beautiful story of their life together. Brought me to tears.
[I have 24 hour window to post about the caterpillar's club before it is no longer a valid TIL. I wont post about it, but thank you for giving me the option.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95bybk?context=5)|You're welcome, though I think you should post it.
[How did you get the job?  How much does it pay?  Have you ever had anyone who was dissatisfied with your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957v8z?context=5)|I applied for it after seeing the notice online. I make $12/hour, which is standard for entry level positions at a small local paper in the midwest USA. We don't send proofs, but we do make sure that we print only the information requested. The only complaints I get are from readers of obits who are pissed that we didn't include a church's address (which may change the price, as our prices are based on length) or something dumb like that. They don't even know the person most of the time. 
[Let's be honest, finding a job at a newspaper in 2013 is nothing short of a miracle. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959875?context=5)|Depends on what part of the country you're in, but yes. I'm constantly looking for a reporting job but I'm not having the best of luck. Our newsroom is full of young reporters though, and a lot of smaller papers are like that.
[Ever had to write/edit an angry obituary? Where the person who died was hated by their family, so the entire obituary was just about how shitty of a person they were? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957pjl?context=5)|No, because we don't tend to print stuff like that. However, I have talked to family members that were angry they had to do an obit. They just wanted the basic information and said, ""If it wasn't for the fact she had a lot of friends here, I wouldn't be doing this."" They didn't even list survivors.
[Do they HAVE to do one? Why would they be angry about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959g21?context=5)|They don't have to do an obit, but they felt pressured to do it because she had a lot of friends in the area who kept calling and emailing them asking about their grandma. They just said that they didn't like her. I didn't get why because I didn't want to pry - could have involved abuse or something.
[Are obituaries written differently if the person dies from murder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957y4h?context=5)|Nope. The way obits are written are purely up to the family, funeral home and/or writer. And sometimes the newspaper. My newspaper is very affordable for obits, but bigger newspapers can cost upwards of $300 or more dollars just for two sentences.
[Why do they cost so much?  Does that include someone else writing it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a7sh?context=5)|Because it takes up space in the newspaper, and that's valuable space. It's cheaper than an advertisement, but it's basically the same thing. The bigger/more popular the paper, the higher the cost.
[What's the most outlandish obituary you ever wrote/edited?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957t9g?context=5)|We don't really get too many outlandish ones. I think the strangest one was for a guy who died after drinking a gallon of vodka everyday for 30 days. We didn't end up including that info in the final obit though (at the request of his landlord, who submitted the obit).
[Is it usual for a landlord to submit ab obit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a988?context=5)|Oh no. Usually it's a family member - child, spouse or sibling - or the funeral home.
[I enjoy writing obituaries for fictional people who lived awkwardly tragic lives.  Is it possible to have my obits published in a respectable newspaper without confirmation from a funeral home or any other source?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958tio?context=5)|I highly doubt it. We require verification at our newspaper, and we won't even begin writing an obit until we have verification from a funeral home, cremation service, medical school (in case someone donates their body to science) or someone else who handled the body. I'm sure that this happens at bigger newspapers too.
 |ETA: The main reason for this is to avoid angry friends or family members who submit an obit for someone who is dead to them, but still actually alive. I haven't had a situation like this, but someone I used to work with did. She ended up leaving the person who submitted the obit a voicemail and never heard back. 
[Does anyone ever request a negative or bitter obituary? If so, what do you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9584ty?context=5)|Never have, but we wouldn't print it, depending on how bad it was.
[What about negative sounding but positive intentioned?  ""SmartBacon was a salty old fart and the world is sadly a sunnier place without his griping, rest in peace friend.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95axeo?context=5)|We've never encountered anything like that, but we'd probably discuss it (our whole department and probably a senior editor) and decide. I'd say probably not, even though it'd be funny.
[Have you ever found out about a friend/acquaintances death from having to write their obituary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958a38?context=5)|I haven't, but my co-worker did. It wasn't a person he knew too well, so he wasn't broken up about it. I'm writing a short story about a person who finds out about his mother's death that way, though.
[Did you ever packed an easter egg /hidden joke into one of the obituaries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9599ki?context=5)|We haven't, but the funeral homes do sometimes I think. We had someone who died of an accidental electrocution and somewhere in the obit, it said, ""the world is now a dimmer place."" We lol'd a lot in the office at that.
[Do you ever get emotional when you are writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958dez?context=5)|I used to when I first started, but not anymore.
[Do you see death in the same way still?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958qy8?context=5)|Not at all. Actually, when I first started, I used to have panic attacks if I thought about death too much. I didn't realize writing and editing obits would be part of the job until my first day. Writing/editing obits and working with funeral homes and mourning families has really made me more comfortable with death. It's just a thing, now. I still have panic attacks, but they're rare.
[I DO NOT WANT an obituary.  is there any way to make sure my horrible parents don't make an obituary for me even though they know it's against my wishes?  (child abuse, sexual abuse, you name it.  and i will die before them most likely.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95aros?context=5)|Put it in your will that you do not want an obituary printed in the event of your death. That's the only legal way that I can think of if your parents are still in your life and you die first.
[How did you get into the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958ded?context=5)|I applied at the newspaper I work at. They had a notice online for it and I needed work.
[What is the most badass story the family asked you to put in the deceased's obituary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958slm?context=5)|We had an obit for someone who was part of the [Caterpillar Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_Club). That's super badass.
[What do you think of this man's obit? Link to imgur.com  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959sj5?context=5)|That's really, really funny. I don't think we'd print something like that, but we would print ""He loved cars, guns, booze and women"" or something like that. There's some opportunity to have fun in obits.
[Why do obituaries need to include the names of the deceased's parents, even if they aren't still alive? I understand it could be for identification, but it seems to detract a bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a2p0?context=5)|We don't require it, but I understand why a lot of papers do. Obituaries were originally started for genealogical purposes. That's how families were tracked over generations and family trees were built. We prefer to have them in case anyone starts looking back into family history. Obituaries are an easy way to connect all of that. 
[Can you write a pretend obituary for me? I'm a 19 year old poor college student. You can make up my cause of death:\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95akv0?context=5)|Sure. I just need to know your gender identity/preferred pronouns and I'll whip something up for you.
[Awesome! I'm a male - don't really have preferred pronouns, just be as creative as possible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95atrz?context=5)|Okay, give me a bit. I'll work on it.
[Good one..made me laugh. Someday I would rather have an obituary like this that makes people laugh. Maybe I should write my own to use someday in the future. Great AMA, thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95f7sg?context=5)|Thanks! I definitely suggest writing your own - or at least having an idea. The funny ones are rare but they're the best.
[Wow this is fantastic! What goes into this work and how long does it take you to finish someone's whom you do not know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95fysx?context=5)|Thank you! :) We talk to the family member(s) pretty extensively. Once we have all of the necessary information, it takes about half an hour to write it up and edit it well. Sometimes longer, depending on how much information the families give us.
[Do you enjoy your work? Would you rather write about something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9584hn?context=5)|My work isn't awful, but it isn't what I want to do. I eventually want to get into reporting.
[Can you please decode the common euphemisms? Like ""died at home"" is suicide. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959qv9?context=5)|I think you're reading too much into obits. You can definitely die at home without killing yourself. Old people do it all of the time. A lot of people go to sleep and never wake up. We get calls on the police scanner all of the time. The only common euphemism is the way people say ""died.""
[Have you ever written your own obituary for ""fun""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959bfz?context=5)|Nope! I refuse to tempt fate. I know what I want it to say, but I'm only 23. I'm not giving the powers in the universe any reason to justify killing me early.
[Why don't obituaries include cause of death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9587j0?context=5)|The family or funeral home doesn't include it. Many of the ones that I do include the cause of death though.
[Are you guys allowed to publish home addresses? We are not for liability issues. Also, do you guys have a special program that you work on that transfers the obits to the press? We have a program called Mactive. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95aeiz?context=5)|We will publish home addresses in certain circumstances, but we don't like it and we'll do our best to convince the family not to include it, probably for the same liability issues you guys want to avoid. Sometimes we just outright delete it. We receive obits via email, and then we put it into our CMS and start editing.
[Has anyone been angry about an obituary you wrote?  Why were they angry?  What happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b0sn?context=5)|I get angry phone calls from readers who usually aren't related to the person who's obit they're calling about. They complain that we don't include the address of the church, or we don't clarify maternal grandparents vs. paternal grandparents, or things like that. I just tell them, ""if you know the family, you can call the funeral home for a rerun. If not, then you can just make sure that your obituary has all of that information.""
[Do you ever wish you didn't have a job? I mean, I know everyone dies. I'm not even a person that normally wishes less people would die (I see overpopulation as a very serious problem\), but a job like yours must be tough sometimes.  So, do you wish that a job like yours wasn't needed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95l589?context=5)|I mean... I don't want people to die, but at the same time I understand that death happens. I would like it if overpopulation wasn't a problem and we just all were immortal beings... but it doesn't bother me that I work with death, and I'm glad that my job exists. When people ask me questions like this, I think of like a robot/computer taking over my job, and that makes me sad for two reasons: 1) the families of the deceased wouldn't have someone to talk to about their loved one, which really does comfort them and 2) journalism is already hard enough to get into, getting rid of more newspaper jobs is more depressing to me than death.
[Is it true that you don't print the address and funeral time in the same Obit anymore?  I heard y'all stopped doing that because thieves would strike, knowing that everyone everyone would be out of the house at that time.  Any truth to this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95aipt?context=5)|At my paper, we generally don't like to print the home address of the deceased for that reason. We'll say if they lived in a nursing home or assisted living center. We also don't like to put ""Memorial contributions may go to this specific residential address"" for the same reason. Anytime a family member wants to print an address, we pretty much tell them all of the terrible things that could happen and convince them to let us take it out.
[Has this changed your sense of humour?  Do you feel you could cope with personal death any little bit more from finding yourself immersed in mourning much more than the average person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b37p?context=5)|Yeah, definitely. I'm a little more morose in my humor now. I think I'd still mourn a lot if someone I loved died, but I'd be able to go through the motions of taking care of arrangements a lot better than I would have a year ago before I started doing this.
[Have you ever thought about who you would want to write your obituary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959n6m?context=5)|I've told my coworker that if I die while we're working together, he and my boyfriend and parents need to work together on it, but to give it some personality. I'll eventually write it myself when I'm older, but I do feel some superstition about writing my own obituary at 23. I'm not trying to tempt fate.
[Have you ever got an unusual request?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95azwe?context=5)|Someone wanted us to just get all of the information from the hospital, which we can't do because of HIPAA. One person included that people could send memorial donations in her honor to President Obama's re-election campaign (this was last June), which is really funny regardless of your opinion of Obama.
[I research, google street view and contact the families of the deceased (i get the names from the obits\) to see if they have a quality used car to sell (they usually do as someone just died\) and always get a good deal. have you heard of anyone else doing this as their business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95eqmc?context=5)|Nope, nobody around me does that as far as I know. I personally would be a little creeped out by that, but if it's working for you then keep it up. 
[How am I going to die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95bjbm?context=5)|You'll have to write your obit to find out.
[Do you have any good stories about mistakes made in obituaries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95auur?context=5)|My ex-co-worker once put her own birth date down for the birth date of a dead person, and the family thought it was funny. Most of our mistakes aren't funny mistakes, unfortunately.
[What do you want you obit to say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95ao0u?context=5)|I want it to be straightforward (say I died rather than I went to meet my maker or something like that). I want it to include any of my accomplishments and career info and my family info. I don't want anything fluffy though - no ""she loved life and never knew a stranger."" I'll probably write it out as I get older.
[Have you ever got a fake obituary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b0va?context=5)|Nope. We tell everyone who isn't a funeral home that we need to talk to someone official who handled the body (funeral home, cremation service, medical school) before we can run the obit, so that prevents us from receiving fake obits.
[Are there other newspapers that you think have particularly good or bad obituaries?  Is there any particular newspaper whose obituary section you look to for ideas when you're stuck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95at0s?context=5)|I think the bigger papers that write obits in incomplete sentences and don't include much information - especially their survivors and predeceased family members - all suck. I think people deserve a little bit more than that. I also think that most large papers charge too much for obits. I understand why, but they forget the point of obituaries when they charge so much and forget about at least including immediate family information (parents, siblings and children).
[Have you written/seen one like this?  He was my aunt's ""boyfriend."" Yes, we share it often. I almost peed myself when I read it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95ah8z?context=5)|I love when people include their pets (I assume that's the part you find funny) in their obit. That's a really funny way to list the pets - most people just say ""and their furry children, Fido and Fluffy"" or something like that. Our obituary style is a little different than that one. 
[It's actually the loved by two women part - and the pets. My aunt was ""the other woman."" It was creepy that they both went in on the obit. They also split the ashes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b1zb?context=5)|Ahhh, I guess I read that as first wife and then girlfriend or wife after the first one died or they got divorced or something. That is really funny and a bit creepy, but hey, that happens! We haven't gotten anything like that but we'd run it for sure. No reason not to if that's what they want. I do think it's weird/funny that they split the ashes. Ashes still creep me out a little.
[I've read that at major newspapers, they write the obituary before a well-known person is dead, so that it's on file. While obviously you presumably are not at the New York Times or anything, have you ever written a obit (even as practice\) before the person was dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959a65?context=5)|Nope, we don't do that. We get 15+ obits a day on average, so there's plenty of practice.
[You ever read Daytripper by Gabriel Ba and Fabio Moon?  ABsolutely beautiful story about an obit writer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95ehp4?context=5)|No, but I'll check it out!
[Amish are stoic about *everything*. Are you from Lancaster? ""People in my area are horrible writers"" reminded me of Central PA. And now with the Amish?

[My husband's mother died about a year ago and her ESTRANGED ex-husband quickly wrote and submitted an obituary without anyone's permission or input.  is this really allowed?  it seems wrong.  it was very painful for her children.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95g5mz?context=5)|Unfortunately, there's nothing that the newspaper can do to deny the estranged ex-husband from submitting the obit first (or at all). It's really best that we don't get involved with family situations. Situations like that do happen, and it's terribly, terribly sad. That's why we at least offer to run a second obituary at my newspaper. Granted it starts at $25 for the second obituary and goes up from there, but we do try to give families that option.
[What do people do to be remebered the most, What things stand out to you as being the most amazing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95rtsq?context=5)|To me, the most interesting obits are people who were my age during WWII, because they have little tidbits of history in them. I like the people who write about their travels or their relationships with other people. My favorite obituary I ever partially wrote/mostly edited was a double-obit for a couple who died a week apart. Their obit was more of a love story, and it was so sweet. Their kids really paid a great homage to them.
[I have a similar job, but obituaries aren't the only thing I do. We've had competing obituaries come in before -- where the family is so divided that they can't agree on an obituary for a family member. Has that ever happened to you, and what were the circumstances?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95abn0?context=5)|All the time! Usually one side of the family wants it written a certain way, or they intentionally left out surviving family members that they didn't like. Our rule - which is the fairest thing we can come up with - is that the party who submits it first has the free option and then the second party has to pay a second day publication fee. Usually the second one is submitted a few days after the first one.
 |Edit: a word.
[Do you realize how important your work is?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95gtyt?context=5)|Yes, definitely. We tend to be humble and make it all about the family, but I think that's what makes the families and funeral homes we work with so thankful. I just try to treat people right, because it's the least I can do. Going through the death of a loved one is hard enough. If I can ease a small burden, I'm glad.
[Hows the job market nowadays?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95smq1?context=5)|Pretty bad. We just hired a part-timer and we're looking for free interns. Most newspapers just don't have a lot of ability to pay salaries and benefits for a lot of people anymore. I'm looking for a reporting job and it's not going well.
[Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a865?context=5)|Why what?
[Who will write your obituary when you pass?  Live long and prosper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95uhmd?context=5)|I'll have it pre-written once I'm older (probably in my 60s, depending on my health). That way, my spouse and/or children won't have to do much.
[How long are these obituaries usually? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95e6r5?context=5)|At our paper, anywhere from 3 column inches to 20 column inches. Most are between 6 and 10.
[How many words would that be? I can't really picture column inches :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95fgdi?context=5)|Eh... best do it by characters, because words can be varying length. Six column inches in my newspaper is about 1,100 characters - spaces, letters, punctuation marks.

[When my dad died, I wrote the obit with my mom. Our first rule: say what he died of, because people want to know. I hate guessing based on ""donations to the hokey-pokey foundation"" instead of flowers bullshit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95bhfp?context=5)|Yeah, I plan on including cause of death for any obits for family members that I'll probably end up writing. I like to know the cause of death. Some funeral homes that we work with a lot will call us and talk about the dead person though, so sometimes I get to find out even if it's not in the obit.
[I work at a funeral home and provide the information to newspapers for their obituaries. Rarely (in my area\) is the cause of death printed. It's usually something along the lines of ""went to be with the Lord"" or ""Entered into rest"". ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9586vj?context=5)|I love seeing how creatively people can say ""died."" Most people say ""died"" or ""passed away"" in obits at my paper. The best one we got was, ""went to her Heavenly feast to be reunited with the Lord Almighty Jesus, son of God."" 
[I edit obituaries as part of my job, and my favorite of all time was ""reunited with her creator spirit.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a89i?context=5)|Oh my gosh, that's awesome! I like the more spiritual ones or the religious ones that aren't Christian. We get so many Christian ones that it's just a nice change sometimes to see a creative wording for ""died"" based on a different religion. There's nothing wrong with the Christian ones, I just like seeing things changed up.
[That's pretty... Out there. I've see families put ""Gone to be with her maker"" or ""Left her place here on earth to join God as angel"". People can be creative. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9595ht?context=5)|We have one funeral home in particular who gets REALLY creative.

[The problem with euphemisms is they are confusing to people, especially children.  People trained in death notification (doctors, police, clergy\) are taught they must say explicitly that the person is dead or has died.  I realize obits not the same, but still, it shows a deep discomfort with death.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958duz?context=5)|I would say this is true. Usually the most religious people get pretty creative with the way they say ""died."" The Amish people in our area (we have a small community of Amish) just say ""died"" though. They're pretty stoic about death, from what I understand.

I just recently graduated from a Canadian University doing a math major a few months ago and am on track on doing the CFA L1 in June. I am still actively looking for a job in financial services. 
Right now I'm ideally looking for some entry level analyst positions or anything that gives me relevant experience in analysis/research, but I am open to almost any jobs that can help me start my career in finance. I have pretty limited work experience, did a minor quantitative analysis intern role last summer and some marketing jobs prior to that. 
Anyway it's been really tough so far trying to find a job locally. I had some interviews and some leads from recruiters, but no actual offers. I want to expand my search to other cities and hopefully land a relevant role there. Does anyone have any tips on how to negate any worry to employers about relocation? Also how can I set myself apart from the local candidates (if possible) based on my background?

Thanks!"

I think I might get an offer to do an internship that involves server provisioning/maintenance type stuff, but I'd rather do something more related to actual programming. Now, the admin gig is fine and I'd be happy to do it, but if I get an offer to do actual programming, I would take it. Am I obligated to let them know that I'm still hunting for a programming gig and that I'm going to take it if I find one?

I was on the premed train but now am planning on a career in Computer Science. I have been taking intro courses so far, and probably will end up with a minor.

So I have been offered two amazing opportunities considering my crap GPA, both CS, for this summer. The first is a summer internship with a local government. I will be using Microsoft Access, Excel and Visual Basic to analyze database information for their contracts department. The position is 12 weeks.

The second is an REU at Clemson University, for computational neuroscience, analyzing MRI scan data. I contacted the professor that I would be doing research with and know I am very lucky to have been accepted. This program is 8 weeks.

The stipends for both are around the same amount. Both are 40 hour work weeks. Both would definitely give very good recommendations/resume entries. On one hand, the first will give me real world job experience. For the second, I will get research experience which may help in applying for grad school. The first does not offer housing or food, while the REU does. 

I am still undecided about what I will do in the future with CS as I have not learned too much yet but hoping to get your opinions on which would be a better option. I am currently leaning towards the internship, just because I want some real world experience working in an office."

1bmyww,1,2013-04-03,Somebody who knows something about psychology/psychiatry please help me,Ankshis,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1bmyww/somebody_who_knows_something_about/,"I would really appreciate an opinion, a comment, or a suggestion from a fellow redditor on my situation before my next scheduled psych appointment which is in a little over a month from now.

I'll try to keep my story as concise as possible, for your sake (it will probably end up Long so I apologize). I have experienced what I believe to be an abnormal level of anxiety for my whole life. I have suffered a range of mild to possibly severe panic attacks since childhood, the worst of which I remember to be during my early middle school years. A few of these episodes, most of which occurred in the evening, left me crying in bed with my parents at night over fears of irrational ideas and nightmares. The reason I can not say these panic attacks could have been considered severe for certain is that I am now almost 21 and I have a very poor memory - an effect of the ADD that I have suffered from basically forever, and that I have been receiving treatment for since early this past fall semester. 

Long story short, my ADD medication greatly improves my memory and goes a long way towards alleviating my other symptoms, but I am left with a sporadic sense of anxiety that I need to control. There are days when I can't get one single negative thought out of my brain and there are others when I feel relatively fine. The most frequent occurrences are mood swings that are generally triggered by the memory of a recent negative event that leave me feeling physically ill and unwilling to do anything. These typically last a few hours. 

I have been smoking pot on and off since I was 16 both for recreational purposes and also to help me sleep at night.. I have had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember and pot worked wonders for it. More recently I've been using it as a way to relieve the stress that always seems to plague my mind. Now that I am seeking internships and jobs, smoking pot is no longer a viable method of coping with anxiety and ADD symptoms, so I've looked into other options.

 A caring friend has given me a few 1mg klonopin tablets (which she is prescribed to help her during her panic attacks), which I have divided up into .25mg quarters and have been taking once a day in the mornings along with my other meds. I know, it's bad to self medicate and everything, but I've done the research regarding inter-drug interactions and health risks and everything and I'm pretty positive the very low dose I'm taking is safe. 

Anyway, I've got to say that this little pill is life changing. I never realized how chronically distracted I am by the minuscule, unnecessary worries of life that are beyond my control. The last few days on this 1x .25 mg dose of klonopin have been the most relaxing days I've had in ages, even though I still have the stress of maintaining my schoolwork and relationships bearing down on me. 

I know that benzodiazepines can be physically addictive and dependence can be built quickly, so I am hesitant to try and maintain this crutch until I can see a new psychiatrist in about a month and see if my situation warrants a legitimate prescription. It's worth saying however, that I have several oral reports to give in front of my college classes in the coming weeks and without a benzo or other aid I fear that I will embarrass myself beyond belief, not to mention take a serious hit to my GPA. My performance anxiety has always been a bitch.

What do you guys think...
Should I get a few more klonopins to get me through my next appointment so I can talk to my doctor about anxiety?

Do you think my mental state is out of the ordinary and could benefit from medication like this?

How do I approach my doctor about receiving medication for anxiety?

I don't have a very impressionable mind so various meditative, hypnosis, and other self healing techniques have helped me very little in the past. 
I'm tired of typing so that's what you get. 

Tl/dr: anxiety, add, weed, medication, klonopin, haaalp mehh

1br2b5,0,2013-04-05,Quit internship or no?,csthrowawa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1br2b5/quit_internship_or_no/,"Background: I am a 20 year old CS student working on finishing my degree in ~1-3 years from now. I will be transferring to a 4-year college hopefully within a year. I have been teaching myself programming since middle school. I've learned Java, C#, PHP, Go, among others throughout this time. I live with my parents. At 15 years old I sold a gaming-related site I made in PHP for $20,000+ to some company (split with friend who did design/graphics). Southern California.

Current Position (Numbers are as ranges for anonymity): ""Software"" Intern, however actually doing report automation (business intelligence) (This is my first job of any type). This position is more IT-related and is almost too easy for me. My pay is $20-22/hour. I have been at the company for 1 year and 6-10 months. I work 5 days a week. I have been told that there may be a potential position open for me soon, however it may be IT-related. I want to make software/websites instead of producing automated reports (which is essentially IT). In my opinion the company also has a talent drain ever since they declared a focus on Sales talent instead of Engineering at the latest quarterly meeting.

Current feelings: I do not enjoy the work that I do at my job as it incredibly under-utilizes my skills (which are Java/C#/Go, etc). The pay is also kind of low. I dread going to work everyday as the work does not use any of my skills, and is 80% office politics. I don't like going to work anymore.

Question: Should I quit and work on my own skills/projects while finishing College? I have notecards full of side projects ideas to work on (ideas/businesses, or just projects for my portfolio). (I have always wanted to do this.). Or, should I stay with this company for one of the full-time positions I can eventually get, even though it may be IT-related? (Perhaps would look good on a resume, and would be good additional pay, instead of just an internship). I feel that the only reason I would stay around for a promotion to full-time would be for additional money, or for my resume in the future. I don't necessarily need additional money to live right now, as I am just saving up and living at home. Or should I do something else?

Let me know what you think. Thanks"
1bqpkg,7,2013-04-05,I need advice on deciding between an online college or a traditional college in less than a month.,usagikami,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1bqpkg/i_need_advice_on_deciding_between_an_online/,"Good afternoon everyone, I am seeking some feedback/advice.


I have a major decision to make in the next month and I have been driving myself a little crazy thinking about it. Here is my situation.


I work full time, M-F, 8-5pm for the state government in a secure job with rather nice health benefits. Since this job offers a State Tuition Waiver, I decided to go back to school to finish my BA in International Affairs with a minor in Asian Studies at FSU. I can only attend classes in the Summer and Fall. I cannot leave the office between Feb. - May because of the Legislative Session. 


I asked my boss how he would feel about me attending classes during the day, part time, making up the missed hours with a combination of Annual Leave and Comp time. I even offered to work late but that was shot down. I had three reasons to ask this. I cannot use the State Waiver for online/distance learning classes, I must take a language class for my degree and the one I want is only offered during the day, and there are no classes for my major offered during non-working hours during the Summer. Let’s just say some stuff hit the fan, my job was threatened, and I have pretty much given up all hope of the person in charge of approving the use of the waiver ever allowing me to use it.


My Plan B was to switch universities to American Military University and complete their BA in International Relations. I can take all my classes online so it would not interfere with my work. I would give up learning Japanese in a classroom setting, a chance for a study abroad, access to the FSU career center, and any benefits of getting to know my classmates and professors/networking, etc. BUT I would have my degree and keep my job.


My Plan C was to look at my budget, quit my job and look for part-time employment, get health insurance through FSU, and bust my butt to finish my degree while looking for scholarships, internships, volunteering, and tutoring Japanese.


Here is my goal: Get my degree, do the JET Programme for one or two years, apply to the Foreign Service, and if the FS doesn't work out, pursue work as a translator or with a company that has branch offices in Japan (Hyatt, or perhaps another hotel chain, etc.).


Ladies and Gentlemen, I am 35 years old and I have some student loan debt already. My current student loan payments are $280, though they will go into deferment while I attend classes. I have no credit card debt and about 5k in savings. As much as I would love to think I can get some scholarships, I am thinking that I will have to take more loans. How crazy am I to even think about giving up a full time, pretty secure job to go back to school? The job I am at now is not one I want to make a career with. I plan to leave this state as soon as possible.


Thank you for listening and I’d love some thoughts/advice/whatever!

[What happened with the piano when Wayne forgot how to spell ""Howard""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mhxp?context=5)|My biggest screw up on the show, and that's what people remember the most!
 |There's a button on my keyboard marked ""ACC"".  I never used it or even noticed it was there, but there are a million buttons on a keyboard that you never use.  Apparently it stands for ""accelerate"".  As I was playing I started laughing and must have accidentally bumped it, but since I didn't know it was there I had no idea what was happening.  I couldn't figure out what made it speed up like that, so I just had to turn it off.
 |The best part for me was watching Colin trying to keep up with the dancing as it sped up, and the totally baffled look on his face. 
[Has there been a time on the show when you could no longer play the piano because you were laughing too hard? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mn28?context=5)|It doesn't happen often.  When you're playing for improv like that, you have to be so focused; listening to the singer, thinking about where you're going next, etc.  that things don't sort of register as funny the same way they do when you're in the audience.
 |That being said, there was a  Three Headed Broadway Singer we did where it was going great, and Drew got all swept up in the moment, and sang a whole bunch of words ""Won't you take me on a...""  When he realized what he'd done, he looked so genuinely surprised.  I had a hard time keeping it together for that.
 |Just so you know, when I'm not playing, and just watching like an audience member, I laugh my head off.
[Do you have the hoedown song permanently stuck in your head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mn50?context=5)|OMG, till the day I die!  And what they cut out of the shows was how long I often had to vamp between singers...they'd be thinking  and thinking, and I'd just be going round and round forever. Ahhh!
[What do you do during the games where no music is involved?  You don't talk on the show (except the time you messed up the piano and sped up the music way too much for Wayne Brady\).  Was this a requirement from the director(s\), or you are allowed to talk, but choose not to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mldh?context=5)|When they played non music games (the least interesting part of the show if you ask me) we would hang out on the side lines, freezing our butts off because they kept the studio really really cold. We would just watch like the audience members.
[What is your favorite type of games?  One with music and one without?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mldh?context=5)|Of course the music games are my favorite.  Even when I'm watching an improv show and not playing, I like the music improv the best. 
[Were you supportive of the show bringing on Linda Taylor and Cece Worrall in later seasons of the original run?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98meny?context=5)|Linda also played on my band's cd, we scored a short film together, we've done live shows together. She's the best.
[Also, which hoedown was your personal favorite?  Drunk mother, going bald, director, zoo…there were so many great ones! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98meny?context=5)|But Linda's the one. For one thing, she's a totally badass guitar player.  We became such a team, and worked so well together that when the new shows came up, I didn't want to do them if she wasn't going to be there too.
[Will she be joining you on the new Whose Line as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98o9jt?context=5)|Yes, yes, yes.  I love working with LT.
[How much pre-show taping rehearsal time did you normally have? Did you know which styles of music you were going to play in that episode? I've heard lots of accusations about the show not being completely *improvised*, and the music games are so tight and well-done they seem like likely culprits of pre-planning. Would you tape multiple takes for the edit or are we watching it raw as it happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nxr1?context=5)|I've said in a different thread how our process worked.  Even if we played around with a style before the show, the guys never heard the suggestions ahead of time, and we never did multiple takes of one song.  However, the show is edited.  We would do 5 or 6 Greatest Hits and the producers would pick the best 3 for the show.  So we were really improvising, but you're only seeing the stuff that went well... Or sometimes the stuff that went horribly wrong, because that can be funny too.  But what you're not seeing is the stuff that's just mediocre. 
[Who else is coming back for the show?  EDIT: Woo first famous person I have gotten a reply from! Thanks for the reply and I can't wait to see it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98o1l8?context=5)|Ryan, Colin and Wayne.  New host, Aisha Tyler. Some new fourth chair people.
[How much were the musical parts of the show practised beforehand? Did you or the players know what tunes you were expected to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjgm?context=5)|We would do a music workshop about 5 days before tape days.  The producers would throw a bunch of styles at us, maybe 60, and we'd fool around with them. Sometimes we'd need to do more research on a style (like when they brought up Slack Key Guitar for example). Sometimes the singers would have to do some work if they were going to do an impersonation, and we'd have to find a good key for them to do the vocal impersonation.
 |When the weekend of taping started, the producers would let Linda and I know what 25 or so styles might show up in the three tape days. But we never knew when they would show up, and of course the guys never knew what the subject would be till we were taping. And of course Ryan would often throw us a curve ball in Greatest Hits and throw whatever he wanted out there.
[Hi, Laura! Thank you for doing this AMA! How was your career affected by the role you played on Whose Line is it Anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mmqj?context=5)|It's been a great foot in the door for lots of things, from my band, to teaching, to film scoring, to some cool live improv gigs. 
[What other live improv gigs have you done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nal4?context=5)|I was touring for a while with Drew Carey and the Improv Allstars.  Right now I don't have any group I play with regularly, but I sit in with different people when I get a chance.
 |My favorite is with a show called ""Opening Night: The Improvised Musical"" at the iOWest.  And yes, it's a full on musical, with  dialog, songs, choreography, all improvised off one suggestion.  They're brilliant!  www.improvisedmusical.com/
 |There's also an all girl group in Austin that does the same thing, ""Girls, Girls, Girls"".  Amazingly talented! [Link to www.gggimprov.com](http://www.gggimprov.com)
[I would love  to hear more about your band!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98obtl?context=5)|Go to our website, and give us a listen.  [Link to www.thesweetpotatoes.com](http://www.thesweetpotatoes.com)
 |We started because my husband, Rick, made a short film and cast Kelly to play his girlfriend.  While they were working, he realized that her and I like a lot of the same kinds of music (Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin, Dixie Chicks, etc).  So he suggested we should try writing together.  I was like ""It's more complicated than that"", but it turns out he was right.  We love writing and singing together, and now Rick sings, plays bass and harmonica.  When we're on the road he jokes that it's not as fun as you'd think touring with your wife and your girlfriend. 
[I have a few questions: -What was your favorite game to be a part of? -What was your favorite game to watch? -Who is your favorite Whose Line member?  -Are you close to Wayne, since most of his shining moments were with you? -Do you know how we can get tickets for the new season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mgth?context=5)|And, along with my husband, I'm teaching song improv which is tons of fun.  I alos made a cd called Improv Karaoke that helps people learn how to do it. It's got all these great improvisors on it, like Keegan Michael Key and Dan Castallenata to help teach Here's that link: www.improv-karaoke.com.
[Just cleaning up your question for ya.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|Alright, I won't have to answer anyone else after this ;)
[What was your favorite game to be a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|Either Three Headed Broadway or Greatest Hits were my favorite.
[What was your favorite game to watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|I always liked Film Noir, when Ryan and Colin played it.  It's so stylized and cool.
[Who is your favorite Whose Line member?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|The one who can always crack me up is Colin.  There's just something about him.  I also think Greg Proops is a genius.
[Are you close to Wayne, since most of his shining moments were with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|Wayne and I aren't especially close, just cause since Whose Line we've both been doing really different things.  It will be great to work with him again.
[Do you know how we can get tickets for the new season? Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|I have no idea how to get tix, try the CW website.
[Greg Proops isn't JUST a genius, he is THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE WORLD.  (don't believe me? Check out ""The Smartest Man in the World"" Podcast w/ Greg Proops\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98npgo?context=5)|His podcast is great.  And yes, Greg deserves more love. 
[How did you prepare for the show? Did Drew ever ask for an artist or genre you didn't know and did you wing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mohb?context=5)|Yes, one time Drew said Elvis, and for some reason I thought of Elvis Costello and Linda thought of Elvis Presley (which makes way more sense). We had a big crash and burn moment.  But I think it was edited out.
 |Not to disappoint anyone, but the show was edited. For example, when we played Greatest Hits, they'd usually use 3 songs, but we probably did 5 or 6, and they picked the best ones.  So when people ask ""Were they really improvising? They can't be that good all the time"", the answer is yes, they were improvising, but they weren't that good all the time.  Its just the nature of improv.  
[How did you get the Whose Line gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mo07?context=5)|I started out as a Musical Director at The Second City in Chicago, and also played with other improv groups like The Annoyance Theater, Improv Olympic, ComedySportz, Theater Sports, etc. One of the guys I toured with at Second City, Ron West, had been on the British show, and was hired as a producer on the American version. He got me the audition.  I auditioned along with Wayne Brady and Brad Sherwood, so it was easy. 
[Does it pay as well as other TV acting/writing jobs? (i.e. six figures per year\)? And do you still get royalties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mo07?context=5)|No, I wish it did pay six figures!  It's a totally different scale because it's considered a game show.  I am still getting international royalties (they love us in Australia). But since the reruns aren't on ABC Family anymore I don't get American royalties anymore. All those YouTube reruns don't bring in any royalties at all!
[A game show? Didn't anyone tell them that the points *don't matter?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98q3pc?context=5)|No kidding.
[Having been Musical Director at The Second City, do you know Tiny Fey or Amy Poehler or worked with them at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98phv9?context=5)|I am a little bit older than those two (just a tiny bit), so I had already gone by the time they started.  Some of the people who were there when I was were Richard Kind, Mike Myers, Dan Castellenata, Rose Abdoo, Ron West, and toward the tail end of my time, Steve Carrell and Stephen Colbert. I did one touring company show with Chris Farley.
[ the Irish Drinking song theme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nd1h?context=5)|We never did the Irish Drinking Song as much as the Hoedown, but it had the ability to get stuck in your head too.
[OOOHHH...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nd1h?context=5)|When I would drive home after work, I'd have to play music, any music, loudly in the car to get one or the other out of my head. 
[Great followup question! Also, have you ever been hired to play blind folded at a random unknown location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ofe0?context=5)|No, but I did play where I couldn't hear.  I did a live benefit show once with Robin Williams.  He turned to me and said, ""Let's do a gospel number"", but when he turned back to the audience I couldn't hear him at all. It's hard to improvise with someone when you can't hear them.  So I was watching his back, seeing how he was breathing to get an idea of how he was phrasing. I must have done okay, cause when we were done, he turned back and said ""That was great""
[Blame the sound booth guys for not feeding you his signal through your monitor/foldback or earphones! Speaking of which, did you use floor monitors or in-ear monitors on Whose Line? Which do you like better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98pnw4?context=5)|In the first episodes that we did with Clive Davis you'll notice I was wearing the world's ugliest headphones, but luckily that didn't last.  We used floor monitors, but the guys did have to be careful not to come to close because they had clip on mics on that feed back easily. 
[As far as improv goes, do you have any jazz background? Also if you could play any other instrument, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mn82?context=5)|I do have some jazz background, but like many of the styles we did on Whose Line, I can flirt with it, but I'm not a pro at it.
 |I do play a few other instruments: guitar, accordion, ukulele, melodica, percussion.  I'd love to play tenor saxophone. The two time's I've tried, I practically passed out from all the ari it takes.
[1\) What is your favorite memory from the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98moh2?context=5)|My favorite memory was the Three Headed Broadway I mentioned above, where Drew sang a bunch of words at once.  There was also the time when Wayne accidentally made a girl he was singing to skirt go up and kind of flash the audience.  He was so embarrassed, and she was totally a great sport about it.
[2\) What can we expect from the rerelease of Whose Line is it Anyway? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98moh2?context=5)|On the new shows, we'll have a new host, Aisha Tyler.  They've also auditioned some new people for the ""fourth chair"" spot, and there will be some new guests as well. Linda and I have all sorts of new gear and ideas, so we're amped to go. 
[Was there any joke made on the show that offended you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mpaa?context=5)|Never on the show, only on the tour bus ;)
[If they've been filmed yet, Who was your favorite guest star? If not, who are you looking most forward to having on with you all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ml6k?context=5)|We haven't started taping the new ones yet, we start in a few weeks (and they'll start airing mid-July).
 |I don't know who all the guest stars will be, but I do know they've been talking to Keegan Michael Key, who I love and adore.  I'd love to have him do the show.
 |In the old shows, Sid Caesar was my favorite,  funny and smart and  a perfect gentleman.  I also love meeting Florence Henderson, who I grew up watching on The Brady Bunch. 
[Hi Ms. Laura Hall. Everyone give Laura Hall a round of applause; Ms. Laura Hall on the piano.  A little while back I was watching a documentary of all the iterations of Whose Line is it Anyway, and they mentioned in the UK tapings, the piano player was actually an improv artist who also played the piano. Because of his musical talents, he almost never got a chance to do anything besides play the piano.  My question for you is, did you find yourself in a similar situation? Where there any times where you wished you could have participated in other games where your musical talents (which I believe nearly all of Waynes points that, ""didn't matter"" could be attributed to your skills as an improvisational musician\) weren't required?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nx5y?context=5)|People ask me that a lot.  I love doing the music improv so much, I don't ever wish I could do the acting part.  I admire it, and it certainly is more out front and visible, so people a lot of times assume I'd want to do it.  But I've been a musician all my life, it's what I love to do. I love the collaborative process of being in the world of improv, but I love it from my end of things. 
[A big Whose Line memory that stands out for me is the Richard Simmons episode. What was it like being so close to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oifr?context=5)|Like standing near a tornado.  
[Is Kelly Macleod related to Kevin MacLeod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mkee?context=5)|No, Kelly is not related to Kevin Macleod. But she did used to play in a band called Private Life, that toured with and was produced by Eddie Van Halen.
[Do you have a ""go to"" key that you use more then others cause you know most actors on the show are comfortable in it?  And inversely do you have some keys you avoid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nu27?context=5)|Interesting question.  There are certainly some keys for some singers that are better.  But because they sing in lots of different styles they use their voices in lots of different ways, so different keys are good. hows that for a vague answer?
[When you first heard about the show, did you think it was going to even make it past one season, or did you think it was going to become as big as it did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mxax?context=5)|Every season when we got picked up it was a surprise and a miracle to me. Not because I didn't think it was good, but just cause that's the nature of this business. 
[What was your favorite game from the show? (I liked ""Props"" personally...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mxax?context=5)|Besides music games, Film Noir was my fav.  I liked Moving Bodies too. 
[How many points have you gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oi4t?context=5)|I have gotten some, but I've never added them up.  And one time Drew was throwing around $100 bills, and  I got one of those. 
[Is Colin Mochrie as funny in person as he is on the show?  Everything he does just seems to be so deliberate, and like he's been planning it for ages even though it's all improv.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oiuc?context=5)|Colin is just straight up funny no matter how you slice it.
[Wow, thanks for doing this AMA!  Did you ever have difficulty improvising for so long? I do blues jams in the area and after a while I begin to run out of my bag of tricks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mo71?context=5)|I know what you mean.  But I think because we played in lots of different styles, each one had its own bag of tricks. 
[Are Ryan and Colin close in real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nwli?context=5)|Ryan and Colin have know each other for a long time, like maybe since high school. Yes, they're old pals, which is part of how they improvise so well together.
[Did you major in music in college? Where did you go if so? I'm a music education major, which is why I'm curious...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nxl5?context=5)|I did get a general music degree from Mundelein College in Chicago (which is now part of Loyola)
 |I learned how to do music improv at The Second City in Chicago listening to the great Fred Kaz, who basically invented the genre. 
[I'm so glad I caught this AMA before it was too late. I'm a huge fan of Whose Line, I've seen every episode at least three times and am currently in the process of watching them all again in preparation for the comeback this summer. I couldn't be more excited.  How much did the producers interfere? Do you think they'll be as strict this time around, or less so since it's on The CW instead of ABC Family? Probably too early to tell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ojny?context=5)|And it was always the censors more than the producer who would limit what we could do.  I have a feeling the CW will be less strict.  It's also 9 years later, and there's a lot more on tv that couldn't be 9 years ago. 
[What's one or two great moments you can think of from the song portions that never made it to air? Wayne liked to push the boundaries a lot, especially when working with Chip (such as the... what was it, squirrel eating through the golf bag? Then several lines about balls.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ojny?context=5)|Some of these I've answered, but I want to say, my favorite was when Chip and Wayne did the music together.  They both challenged and pushed each other in really good ways.
[How did you get into the world of Improv Musicianship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98o0fh?context=5)|When I was in college in Chicago I got a job waitressing at The Second City.  I wasn't particularly interested in improv, I wanted to be in bands, write songs.  But I got hooked.  Fred Kaz played there, and he was a great mentor.
 |The summer before my senior year I got asked to take a demotion from being a waitress to go out with the touring company.  My school allowed it to be called an internship, and that first year of touring I would go back to the hotel after our shows and do my homework.  So the lesson is Stay in school, kids!
[Do you have a guilty musical pleasure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98n5uu?context=5)|I'm a big fan of the show Nashville (which Chip Esten is on, but he goes by his big boy name of Charles).  That's sort of a guilty tv and musical pleasure.
[I'd like to ask you about this weird little kids' show you did called *Wheels on the Bus*.  What was the story behind THAT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ohvz?context=5)|It was my first chance to do any film/video scoring, and I jumped at the chance.  Plus I got to have Roger Daltrey come to my home studio to record his tracks. It was wild!
[Why would they do what?  Not play only music games? Keep the studio cold? Or, not give her a mic? Actually, now I'd like to know the answers to all of those.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oc3d?context=5)|Why would they not play only music games?: I don't know, I think it would be a great show.
 |Why would they keep the studio cold?: Most taping keep the studio cool so the audience doesn't get sleepy. Tapings are long, and can get tedious while they're doing some of the technical stuff.  But they kept it REALLY cold on this set.  Linda and I wore winter coats and gloves when we were off camera. check out the picture of us in our arctic gear.

[Hi Laura, I grew up watching Whose Line and will always love it. On the show, did you get to work closely with Drew, Ryan, Colin, and Wayne? If so, are they as cool as they seem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mpqa?context=5)|They are all great guys, and really fun to work with.
 |The only thing with hanging out with improvisors (as compared to hanging out with musicians) is that they never stop talking.  They're always riffing on something, trying to make each other laugh.  Some of the funniest stuff that happened was between games, when the cameras were off and they were just goofing around, waiting for the next thing to start.  
[Hi Laura, thanks for doing this!  Asking for my brother since he doesn't have an account, but he was wondering how you and Wayne worked together onstage (as if you guys had any hand signals or the like\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oid5?context=5)|Wayne was very good at telegraphing physically where he wanted to go, although we never worked out specific hand signals. 
[I play a bit of guitar myself and I was wondering if you had any advice on learning different genres of music and improvising in them. Is it just about knowing the established conventions theory/composition wise (I IV V progressions and things like that\) or are there other things to know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mu42?context=5)|It is largely about really listening to what makes a style sound like that style; rhythmically, harmonically, tonally, etc. and then copping it, but not worrying about being too authentic.  Playing for improv is more like doing sketches than full on paintings, you know?  At the same time, you have to think about playing things that will be not too hard for a singer to follow, and doing lots of leading as the accompanist. Sometimes you have to compromise for that.  For example, if the suggestion is Sondheim, his stuff is super complex harmonically, and would be really hard to improvise to, so you have to tone it down a bit.
[I seem to remember you using a Roland XP-80, what other equipment did you use and was there anything interesting or unusual about the setup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oif9?context=5)|I think Linda has the Roland.  I used a Korg i30 which is actually a rather cheapy keyboard that they don't make anymore.  But it was easy to move around in quickly, which is essential.  Also I use a Boss 440 drum machine, again for the same reason.
 |For the new shows Linda and I are upgrading all our gear, so we will  be sounding better than ever. 
[Don't know if it has been asked yet, and I can probably Google, but what is your musical background and how did you realize you had a talent in music and at what age?  BTW Looking forward to the new episodes, I never understood why it was taken off the air.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oi9k?context=5)|I started playing piano when I was 9, with classical lessons.  Around 7th grade I was interested in all kinds of music, and my big sister was dating a guy in a band, so I started teaching my self to play by ear, etc.  I did get my degree in music, and I started touring before I finished college.  I've been really blessed.
[Any quick tips for song improv for piano?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oibt?context=5)|I have a blog about this that's got several.  [Link to www.improv-karaoke.com](http://www.improv-karaoke.com/blog.aspx)

[Ryan hated them the most.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98monu?context=5)|Yes, Ryan hated them the most for sure!
 |I'll just say that I found the other games like Greatest Hits and Duets way more fun because you could be freer.  The hoe down is such a specific form, it's kind of like playing Mad Libs or something, you're filling in the form, rather than creating the whole thing more from scratch.  
[I, too, want to know if the musicians were allowed to talk. (Edit: After watching the ""Howard/Horward"" song, I see that they didn't really have speaking mics to talk into.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mno6?context=5)|I suspect they might have had to pay us more if we talked!

But how do I do it, I originally planned to go to university abroad, but it's looking like places like Canada are out of the question because of money, but I've decided that's where I really want to live in the future. As of now I might be going to a English Uni which i don't want to at all but have no choice to. 

What are my options realistically? Could I up and spend a year doing an internship somewhere (like Canada...) on a year long visa, where I could earn money to fund a uni abroad. 

Are there any loans or funds available to international students? My grades are terrible so no scholarship due to me having no motivation in any part of my life, it's a wonder I passed with how I feel day to day. "

I'm planning on majoring in Computer Science (Option IV).

1. How hard is it to sign up for the required CS classes to declare my major? I've heard it's a pain because there are so many people. Does it often take more than four years to graduate because you can't sign up for all the required courses?

2. Is there a limit to the number of people that can declare a CS major in the EECS department? Do most people who apply for a CS major get accepted?

3. As a student in EECS, is it hard to get into classes for other majors, for example a computational class in the bioengineering dpt?

4. Are the advisors generally available to answer questions about majors and classes, or are they overwhelmed by the number of students?

5. Does the career center help with internships, or do the students generally just contact companies on their own? Which is more common?

Thanks for any help, especially from any current EECS students!"

I am a senior in high school and going to college in the fall and I am very confused on what I should be doing. I am very interested in Computer Engineering and I do know that is the direction I want to go in. There are two colleges that I am very interested in but I am not sure which one would be better for my future after college. Here is some information about both.

College A: Large public college. Less expensive so I will graduate with less debt. For this college, I would major in Computer Systems Engineering and if I keep my grades up I can get a Bachelors and Masters in 5 years. There is about a 50% chance that I can get a co-op or internship during this time.

College B: Very small private college. Very expensive and I would graduate with a lot of debt. In this college I would be doing a dual degree program so I would go here for three years and get a Bachelors in Computer Science then be automatically transferred to a very prestigious university and complete a bachelors in Computer Engineering in another two years. In this time, I would have a 80% chance of doing and internship of co-op.

If I wasn't clear I am sorry, I am not a very good writer. I really need some advice or any type of direction would be grateful. I need help with the pros and cons of each. "

Over the years of my program I have noticed a trend towards major corporations in pushing engineering to not benefiting society, but towards individual wealth by major political parties.  I wanted to focus my studies on saving the world and designing new energy efficient plants/ industries; however, my university pushes working for companies such as BP (in fracking), P&amp;G (exploiting environment), and other such companies.  Lately I have been finding that hard work and studying does not pay off in grades and exploiting cheating/ dedications towards an uncommon goal has been how to succeed in this major.  I am now trapped into my university though credits both in transferring and major wise, yet I am against what engineering currently is and what my university supports through internships (offering $8-10k for a 10 week internship).  Should I pursue my degree even though I will not make over my average starting salary for my engineering degree, or am I looking at the world in the sleep deprived/ depressed mindset?"
1bs7zg,3,2013-04-06,"Graduated a little while ago with a BS in CS. Didn't interview for jobs until recently due to health, what do I say?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bs7zg/graduated_a_little_while_ago_with_a_bs_in_cs/,"I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from a decent university. I did not have a gpa over 3.0 (unless you consider my in-major upperdivision gpa). (I am above 2.5 though, if that means anything). I also changed my major fairly late into college, so I don't have any internship/work experience. 

Unfortunately, due to some health reasons, I didn't apply to jobs since I've graduated (late 2012). The health reason, which I'd rather not state, was not cancer, and did not require me to be in a hospital. However, due to its nature, I became very depressed, and didn't apply to jobs after graduating. After dealing with said health condition, I am much better now, and it no longer affects me. However, I realize that it is now an uphill battle applying for jobs since 1. I'm not as recent a graduate as I was in 2012, 2. I don't have any work/internship experience, 3. My overall gpa and major gpa are both below 3.0, 4. I don't have much/any experience with programming languages and technologies such as: web development, scripting, databases, app development (for tablets/phones/web).

I realize after searching for jobs online that I pretty much only learned what university taught me, and a lot of it is useless. I know sometimes people on this subreddit like to criticize and make fun of people who do this, but after changing majors so late into college, I honestly had no time for internships or any projects outside of school. I was taking a ridiculous amount of units each semester, and having never programmed before college, taking solely CS classes was a major learning curve for me.

I've started to practice interview questions to at least prepare me for those. But they mostly have to do with data structures, and trivia questions on the only languages I know (core java/c/c++). I've only very recently started to get into web development to build up my resume (ruby, html/css). But I'm in the very beginning stages, and I'm also having trouble trying to come up with a decently large-sized project that I can work on that is presentable to employers on my resume.

I'm feeling really down right now, and I suppose I would just appreciate some honest advice about what to do about my job search. 1. Particularly, if you can give some advice on ideas to develop fairly-large web apps/projects you think would look really good on a resume (more than just a plain html/css website). 2. What to say to employers if they ask why I am applying to jobs ~6 months after I graduated? Can I mention that I was sick? Would that make me look bad, or is that not allowed? I'd rather not mention it at all, since they may consider me a liability (or a whiny brat) 3. Which sites are particularly useful for -advanced- web app development? (depth is more important to me, than coverage)

Thank you for reading my long post, and I appreciate any advice/information you have to offer me."

I'm doing an internship right now, and I started two months ago. I realize that's pretty recent, but bear with me here. I'm pretty relaxed at work, I'm not sitting there all nervous. I work in the IT department of a recruitment agency and I help out with the helpdesk and that kind of stuff. The work is fine, nothing I'd want to do on a long term basis, but I am actually learning a lot, so that's good.

However, when I'm at work it's like I can't... think straight or something. I'll ask someone something I could've easily checked myself for example, or I'll be on the phone with someone and I'll ask them something that with a tiny bit of thought I would've known was pretty stupid to ask. Or someone will just ask me a pretty obvious question I should easily know the answer to, and I can't think of an answer untill they tell me it and I'll think shit, why didn't I think of that myself, I already know that. And I'm never like that outside of work. 

I constantly think that whatever I'm doing isn't good enough, which makes me nervous. I honestly have no clue why I'm like that at work, and it's really annoying. Outside of work I'm really comfortable with myself, my confidence is pretty good but as soon as I arrive at work something changes, and I'm almost never confident about my decisions. 

I realize that sounds like a confidence issue and that this might be the wrong subreddit for this, but because it's something that only happens at work I think it might also be a social thing, because outside of work I never worry about other people thinking I'm stupid because I asked something I could have easily found out myself for example. It's stopping me from asking for help when I need it, which also isn't good. 

I really could use some outside perspective. I realize I'm completely new at the job with no prior experience, but that's not what I'm worried about. It's that I constantly feel that whatever I'm doing isn't good enough, and I can't seem to think straight, even in moments when I don't feel like I'm under any pressure. Maybe being in a serious workplace around people who are much better at what they do than I am (which is normal) is what's causing this, because at my previous job at a supermarket where I worked for years I never had this.

Long time lurker, wanted to get the thoughts on my future CS program from current and past CS graduates.

Quick Link to CS Program:http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/CSc/

One thing about the course that worries me is that everything is revolved around Microsoft Technologies i.e. C#, Visual Studio, Windows 7. However, Java is also a primary Programming Language in the course which is good. There doesn't seem to be much Linux involved in the course whatsoever. 

I was wondering what you guys thought personally of the program? Particularly, on graduation of the course, would top Software Companies look favourably upon the course. Cliche, but I would like to work in the Bay Area in the future. I understand that I also need personal projects on the side and I have lined up an Internship with an IB during the summer. 

I do have an offer for the University of Edinburgh also. However, my life is currently based here.

There are *a lot* of career paths out there:


**Web developer:**

* Front-end developer / JavaScript developer / UX developer. To be honest I don't know the difference between UI and UX.
* Backend developer / Python|PHP|Java|Rails|Perl|Node|ASP.NET|what have you developer

* Jack-of-all-trades full stack web developer


**Mobile developer:**

**Miscellaneous domains**

* Data scientist / ""statistician with software development skills""
* Computer security professional / information security professional
* Scientific programmer
* Quant / financial software developer
* Embedded systems / robotics / home automation (Arduino / Raspberry Pi being popular with hobbyists)
* Operating systems / compiler developer
* Hardware industry / CAD? / low-level drivers


So here's my career choice dilemma:

I want to work on indie game projects in my free time. But I'm a junior without an internship lined up for this summer, so I'm feeling a lot of pressure to develop other, more profitable skills in order to build my resume for general software development jobs.

At the moment, I'm developing my web skills so I can hopefully work as a web developer somewhere. Web development holds some interesting usability problems, but I feel like it's the kind of job that people work on beyond a 9-to-5 work day. Even as a student, I'm spending all my free time working on (or at least thinking about) web projects to build my resume, when what I really want is to invest that free time in making games.

**TL;DR** In college, coursework and career worries bleed into free time. When I graduate, I don't want any obligations beyond a 9-to-5 workday. Is web development the right career choice for me? Is there another industry that actually has these magical 9-to-5 jobs?"

College sucked. My entire 3 years there to earn a shitty diploma consisted of school work, work, and occasionally sleep, 7 days a week. I spent thousands of extra dollars also doing night school to learn Japanese for an internship to Japan - only to be told at the last minute that it was cancelled. I spent 3 years of my shitty life working as hard as I could only to be bent over and fucked in the ass without lube. Now I have a shitty diploma and several years experience washing dishing so I can make 30k/year, and cap myself at 60k for the rest of my life. Woo-hoo. Also, I hated every fucking second of my job, working with lazy cooks, and self-centered waitresses - neither of which should be allowed to breed. All so I could afford to waste my life in a shitty community college.

The only girl I have ever been with I met in college. The only reason she was with me (and only for a brief period of time) was because she used sex to garner attention from men (she told me this a year or so later after admitting to having a problem). I was 17 and getting laid though, what did I care? Oddly enough, she was also a sexual abuse victim at a younger age. I think it's funny how broken people tend to find each other.

Now I'm in my second year of university and nothing has changed. I have no friends, no prospects for any, and no hope for the future. I've tried joining clubs, only to be ignored by the members. For example, I would go to a club during club week, and asked for a schedule. I would send multiple emails to the clubs I wanted to join only to be ignored and brushed away. During my first year, I tried to kill myself twice using huge amounts of sleeping pills, alcohol, and bottles of Pepto Bismuth. The first time I tried to do this, I swallowed ~5g of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (generic sleeping pills), a bottle of vodka, and of course some weed to top it off (I love weed, my only real friend). This was after my roommates were having a new years party where literally everyone was a boyfriend/girlfriend pair, and I was alone. Sadly I threw up the pills after about 5 hours of sleep. The second time I tried to do this, I thought I'd be a smart-ass and drink a couple bottles of Pepto-Bismuth (an anti-emetic to prevent vomiting) to go along with 10g of sleeping pills, a bottle of vodka, and of course a few hits from the bong. Sadly, I threw everything up. I want to note that the during day of this attempt, I was more happy than I had ever been in my entire life. I felt almost euphoric knowing I was going to die later on. I even bought a can of Pringles to celebrate the occasion. This was the only time in my life I ever felt truly happy, and I really want that feeling again. The feeling of happiness I felt was better than any high I've ever had. And I've done almost every drug other than crack, meth, and heroin.

Of course through out all of this I've been under the trusty care of a doctor, and more recently a psychiatrist who I see for 30 minutes every two weeks. I don't really understand the point of speaking to a psychiatrist other than to receive anti-depressants. I don't see how anything can be accomplished for 30 minutes every two weeks. And none of our sessions thus far have done anything to help me. Truthfully, I'd rather not waste this doctor's time as where I live there is roughly 1 psychiatrist for every 35k people. There are more important and/or sick people that need this help. Wasting public resources isn't a terribly ethical thing to do.

Now I'm at the point in my life where I keep in my room a set of tools that should be able to accomplish what pills couldn't do in the past. I have a bottle of ammonia, a bottle of bleach, a garbage bag, and a string. The method is simple: write ""Poison: Do Not Open"" on a piece of paper near me, put both bottles in the bag standing upright, remove the lids, then I put my head in the bag, and finally I tie the bag around my neck and spill the bottles. The chloramine concentration should easily exceed 2000ppm which should ensure death. The only thing I don't know is if it will be quick or slow, painful or painless. Every night I flirt with the idea of death by putting my head in the bag, tying it up, and tilting the bottles at such an angle that the liquid almost comes out. And every night I get closer and closer. After writing this I'll do my nightly ritual of putting my head in the bag, go to sleep, and hope tomorrow I have the courage to actually go through with it.

I want to be clear that the problems I am experiencing are my fault and no-one else's. I have tried to fix them, but failed."

I've done a few days worth of work without pay just to establish my technical abilities, but before we really dive into the meat of the application development I want to ensure that I'll receive compensation for my work, but I'm not sure what I should be asking for.  My only experience with getting paid for programming is internships at large companies, so I'm going to have to negotiate for something reasonable given the situation.

The way I see it is, I can ask for a deposit at beginning and then a lump sum at completion, but I currently intend to keep working on this after primary development is complete.  Or I can ask for hourly pay, but since I'll likely be working from home there's no easy way to insure my hours are being properly tracked.  Lastly I can ask for a percentage of the profits (i.e a stake in the company) once the application is complete, but I'm not sure what a reasonable amount is to ask for since I'm currently the only developer and in the event the product doesn't take off, I could be left with nothing.

So I ask, how do you usually handle getting paid for your work and how much do you usually get?  For estimation purposes, I imagine the project would take me 1-2 months to complete.  Any advice is appreciated."

1bxwyb,0,2013-04-08,"I've been programming for awhile now, but am I employable?",immranderson,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1bxwyb/ive_been_programming_for_awhile_now_but_am_i/,"Hi! I've hit a bit of a crossroads in my career and have been looking for guidance from anyone that's willing to offer.



   Awhile back, I took a intro to computer science course and eventually went on to make my entire way through this [textbook.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Java-Interdisciplinary-Approach/dp/0321498054)



   At the time of when I was taking this class, I was also working a temp job as an administrative assistant doing miscellaneous tasks, such as sorting documents and doing data entry tasks. The data entry involved analyzing forecasting data in an excel spreadsheet format, and then uploading the excel spreadsheet in a pre-defined template. I went on to code up a program using JExcel to compare the new data with the old data and update the information accordingly... 



   After the end of that temporary employment, I went on to get hired on at a different company as a sales representative, and couldn't get enough of using my coding skills to automate various tasks. For Instance, everyday we would have to log in to a website, download 100's of Purchase Orders in PDF format, rename them, file them away, and update a master excel spreadsheet using information pulled from the PO's. After this, we'd distribute the information internally to whoever needed it via e-mail. I went on to automate that entire process using the PDFBox and Apache POI libraries and wrapped it all up in a simple GUI interface so that all my co-workers would be able to use it as well.



   Aside from that, we had thousands of quotes and parts lists stored in tens of thousands of excel spreadsheets scattered throughout our shared drive. Everything was managed by employees going into the excel spreadsheets and modifying the data.



   Every single time we wanted to create a new quote, we'd have to go and visit several spreadsheets each with their own standard pricing tiers and paste a lot of that information into our own format.



   ASIDE from that, we'd have to re-copy and paste a lot of that data into our customer's format to submit to them. So I went and created a GUI that could pull the data from our internal quotes and display it in a far more readable manner. I also then made it so that employees could build quotes through this GUI format and then regenerate the quotes in the customer format if so desired. So! My best explanation of what I had done so far was build an easy to use front-end to build/view quotes+part structures using all the pre-existing excel spreadsheets that we had as a back end. This way employees who were slower to adapting to change could keep building and modifying the data through excel, while other employees could use the new front-end I had built to manipulate the quotes.



   My plan was that I'd create a choice for the employees, with a clear hope that the option that I had created would be preferred. Overall feedback was pretty positive from my co-workers, so I was pretty happy about that. Eventually I had hoped that the department would make a full switch over to using the front-end that I had created so I could focus on organizing all the data from the spreadsheets into a database.



   So, I was going insane from how our data was organized, using thousands of Excel spreadsheets as a back-end... So I started picking up MySQL and JDBC and started tinkering with how I could manage to migrate the data from all the excel spreadsheets over into a database. I had built a rough prototype, but then my Significant Other got her dream job in the San Francisco Bay Area, so we ended up relocating and I wasn't able to finish my project...



   I'm still jobless at the moment, but I'd seriously love to work in some sort of software development field. The thing is, I don't even know if the things I had done would still be considered in the ""beginner"" side of things or if it's even note-worthy.



   My entire career, I've been the only one in my departments that could code, so I haven't had any feedback on where I'm at, skill-level wise. I also have gone through a few online courses in Python development, and took a few university courses programming in C and Assembly. Unfortunately, I still don't have my bachelor's degree, but I do at least have an associates in Mathematics to float on. I'd love to finish off a bachelor's degree in computer science but I just don't have the finances to back me up, so I've been spending much of my time taking algorithm classes on coursera and studying up on data structures. I'm also currently working my way through the django tutorial [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/) and the ruby on rails tutorial [here.](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)



   So I'm curious, what else do I need to do to be employable in a software development field? All these entry level job postings that I'm stumbling upon are overwhelming me with their requirements, and unless I'm mistaken, I can't really do an internship since I'm not currently enrolled in any university courses. Any advice or help would be deeply deeply appreciated!"

My major was ITI (basically IT + Communications) with a minor in English. I'm looking for jobs in the area of IT management or support, or jobs that are more creative (like advertising) since I am a good writer (not try to brag, but when I try, writing is my strong point).

My big problem now is that I just don't know where to find jobs. I don't really have any hook-ups (no family or friends that can really give me a job) and I don't really have a big network of people for me to talk to about this. I have tried to use my school's career site but I have found it to be very inconclusive and haven't even gotten a call from it.

Really, all I do now is browse job board sites (Monster, CareerBuilder, Indeed, etc) and apply for anything, but all I get mostly are Sales jobs or high level software programming jobs. 

Where can I look for jobs? I am getting super nervous because I feel like there is something everyone else is doing that I'm not. All my friends are getting jobs and interviews and I feel like a huge loser."

I drove a forklift in a warehouse. The factory closed down around the same time I inherited about $40,000. I had no qualifications so I saw it as an opportunity to go to university to make a better life for myself.

I'm now 29 years old and coming to the end of my third year in university, after this summer I have one more year to go before I graduate in 2014. 

I recently interviewed for a summer internship where 40 positions were available. I was told by HR they interviewed 45 people and I still couldn't get the fucking job. I would take a guess and say most of the 45 people interviewed were 20-22 years of age with little work experience.

Since leaving high school over ten years ago I've had 10-15 interviews for entry level office jobs and I've never once got a job or a second interview. Last year alone, I had 4 interviews and didn't ever get a response. Any job I've ever worked was manual work through a family member or friend.

This last rejection hit me the hardest as I had almost a 90% chance of landing an internship and for once getting a break and I still couldn't get it. Even though my grades are good I'm starting to question whats the point. I obviously come across terrible in interviews so when I finally graduate at 30 I'll have no professional experience just low end manual work so I'll probably struggle to get a job then too.

On top of this I'm single, money is tight and I live hours away from my few friends and family. All I really seem to do now is study and go to the gym.

Can anyone offer me some advice?"

I'm a Computer Science Major about to graduate in the Fall of 2013, and I am looking for summer internships. I did apply for a bunch of local internships but I haven't heard back from any of them. I do have some research experience, but I was really hoping that I could get some industry experience this summer, so that I could make an informed decision on whether or not to go to grad school. 


I do have one offer from a company I interned at before, and that would involve me creating an app for an SAP-based system. 


I also have an offer from my advisor, where I would work on developing a web-based music recommender system for his research, but if I take that offer I forego any chance of industry experience over the summer.


Is my resume ok? Also, I am working on several projects at the moment - should I put them on my resume at the cost of removing experience? Which option from the above sounds like the best in my situation? Is it too late to keep looking for summer internships?


Thanks so much - I've seen a lot of valuable advice up here and I was really hoping for some good input.

A little about me. I am an engineer who has a phone interview tomorrow with a major defense contractor.

Now I want to know what a good answer would be if HR (which most likely will) ask why I want to switch jobs and work for them.

Now my major answers to this question are very selfish. I want a full time permanent position with benefits. I addition, I am doing my part time Masters so they might offer tuition assistance. My current job has very lousy benefits, no vacation, etc. However, I do want to get into the defense sector again and I interviewed at this company three years ago for an internship, but didn't get it.

1c0dt0,1,2013-04-09,Computer Engineer: Game Programmer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1c0dt0/computer_engineer_game_programmer/,"Hello! I posted this question to /r/gamedev and a user directed me here, so let's give this a shot.

I'm a Computer Engineering major at a well-known Engineering school and I am going to graduate in December. A few months ago I had a bit of a dramatic realization: I will probably be miserable with a career in Engineering. I'd known this in the back of my mind for a while at this point because I'd done a couple internships which I could feel slowly draining my soul over the course of three semesters. More recently however, I've come to embrace that Game Development is what would really make me happy and I'm willing to sacrifice the job security that Computer Engineering offers to pursue it.

Since this realization I have spent months teaching myself how to use Unity3D and program in C# in what little free time my schoolwork allows. I've applied to countless game programming internships but haven't heard back from any of them in months. It's pretty disheartening, but I don't have any solid game development programming yet so I can't say I'm surprised. To help gain such experience, I joined my college's Video Game Development club and have gotten my name on a few games that will be finished within a month. I've really enjoyed working on teams and the fact that the work I've done never really *felt* like work has confirmed for me that game programming is definitely my passion and not just a hobby like I'd previously assumed. I'm considering leading a project in the Fall, because that sounds amazingly fun.

Anyway, before this post gets much longer allow me to get to the point. My GPA is high enough for me to qualify for the BS/MS joint degree program for Electrical and Computer Engineering, meaning I could get my Masters in Computer Engineering in one additional year. I have been told that I can get a Minor in CS along with my Masters and that the CS department offers some graduate game programming classes that I could take (even some that teach Unity3D). This is all great, but I can't help but think that perhaps a Masters in Computer Science would be more appropriate. I worry that a Masters in ECE will not serve me well in finding Game Development jobs in the future. Tuition is expensive, though, so that is something I should definitely keep in mind.

Then again, maybe all that matters is that I make lots of games and expand my portfolio. I just don't know.

Can anyone provide any advice as to what I should do? It's the biggest decision facing me right now and my academic advisors have really been unable to help me with my specific situation. I can't really blame them as it is a bit out of the ordinary. I'd love to hear what someone with experience in the gaming industry has to say!

Thanks, everybody!

**TL;DR:** I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad who realized recently that he wants to program games for a living. I am graduating in December and have to decide between pursuing a 1-year ECE Masters with a minor in CS or a 2-year CS Masters. Which path should I choose and what actions should I take in order to improve my chances of being hired in the game industry?"

I am an intern working on the revision of the Prudential Center website's user experience (prucenter.com), and am having what I imagine is a novice issue, but I am stumped.  


The revised site (in progress) can be found at dev1.prucenter.com. I am using the CSS4K2 plugin to create a special CSS file for this subdomain (http://dev1.prucenter.com/premium-seating/suites/single-event-suites), and thus far have changed the default font and background.


However, as you can see using the Chrome inspector, all h3 text is super dark and unreadable. To fix this, my boss would like the center content column to have a white background, so you can still see the patterned background behind it.  I am unsure of where to find the corresponding code, and whether or not it is in the main site's CSS or the overrride (or both :x )


Anyone who is willing to point me in the right direction would have my eternal gratitude!"

These are people who've been through at least 3 core CS courses by the time they interview, which include procedural programming, object oriented programming, and a data structures class that goes over Linked Lists, Heaps, Binary Trees, various sorting algorithms, and a cursory introduction to complexity analysis. Most of them have had experience with another company usually doing some simple IT or QA stuff with the occasional dive into code with debugging.


I thought I'd choose easy questions to weed out the terrible people, but across the board I get mediocre answers from all of them.

Here's some of the stuff I ask:

* FizzBuzz
* Explain what polymorphism is
* Explain Recursion.  What's the base case?
* What's a linked list?  Why would I use it instead of an array?
* What's bubble sort?  
* Then for fun I give them a little program with different pointers and references and ask them to write the results of various cout statements.


There are a bunch of other topics I have on my list to cover, but they all do so badly with these basics that I don't even bother.

1bzeij,5,2013-04-09,I'm being screwed over and don't know what to do.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bzeij/im_being_screwed_over_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,"This will be a relatively long post, but I need to explain everything so you understand the situation I'm in and can give me appropriate advice:

In November I started interning for a company in Germany. The company is Korean, but has a location in Germany. I basically immediately got odd vibes from it because a lot of the staff that was there didn't have work permits, didn't speak English or German, and basically just stuck to themselves. My work contract is through a subsidiary of the company, which is run by my boss and based in Germany. My boss was a nice Korean man who lived in Germany for over 20 years and is pretty well known in the industry. As per German law I make an intern salary of 400 euro per month.

I was overwhelmed with starting at a new company, being given so many tasks, learning new things, and was preparing to go back to the US for the first time in over a year and a half to see my family for Christmas and had forgotten to check my bank accounts. When I got back to work in January my boss told me that he was sorry the pay took so long to get there, but he'd get it all there. I said it was no problem, and promptly forgot about it. (My parents help me out by paying for my rent so I can use the measly money I get for groceries and health insurance and other bills.)

In January one of my 2 coworkers left for Korea so it was just me, my boss, and a girl I really liked. My boss then tells me that he wants me to work on a different project with him, which is not a big deal. But then things start going down hill.

I like to think I have a very good work ethic; I come in 20-30 minutes early every day and don't just leave at 6 (I work 10-6), but after I finished what I have been working on for the day. But apparently this wasn't enough. I would be getting ready to go at 6:30 and my boss, who I share an office with, would suddenly have something to talk to me about for 45 minutes. This is fine, but I just don't make enough money to work over 9 hours a day.

Then my coworker that I liked told the company she was leaving. They were ABSOLUTELY horrid to her. She is from Korea, was told she was going on a short business trip to Spain, then was told to go to Germany for a meeting, and was basically told she was not leaving to go back to Korea. She had a few days worth of clothes, nowhere to live, and no time to prepare. They refused to let her take vacation time to go and get her stuff or visit her family in the next 8 months. After she tried to quit they basically guilted her and forced her into staying and promptly sent her to an office in California.

In the meantime my boss was having me work on things that I repeatedly told him I did not know how to do it, but he just ignored that and would berate me for not having it finished at a quick rate (I was hired to do writing, but he had me doing web design - which I never led him to believe I could do).

Then one day he tells me that we have to switch offices because the main company wasn't happy having us working in our main office. I think this is no big deal, the new office is in a better location for me. Then I find out it's just the livingroom of the apartment the company rents for him. I'm a 22 year old woman, he's a middle-aged man. We'd be working alone there. I think you can understand why I am not super comfortable with this idea.

Starting around January/February he begins to make a lot of business trips. When he's on his business trips I am told not to go into the office because I would be the only person there. I think it's a bit odd, but don't question it. Hey, free time off! Am I right? So this happens quite regularly. He's away for a week and a half, I work for a week and a half, and so on.

I took off a week in early March to spend it with my bf who came to visit for my birthday, but then my boss was away again. I've basically not really worked in March because I had requested time off and then my boss was gone, and then the long Easter holiday (Germany celebrates the Friday and Monday before and after Easter as well).

Then my rent payment was declined by my bank and I got a text alert. I think, ""Well, that's odd.."" and check it out. I had not received a payment from my job since February, and I only received 2 in total; one in January, and one in February. I was not payed for November, December, or March.

My work contract ends at the end of this month, and I had been told several times by my boss that he wanted to keep me on in a full time position in community management. I was super excited about this, but when I saw that I hadn't been getting paid I realized that this was an empty promise.

I sent my boss a text regarding the payment and asked what was going on. This was done over Whatsapp, he saw the message the day I sent it, but didn't respond to it ever. This was about 6 days ago. This morning I received a text asking me to come into his apartment tomorrow morning at 10. Nothing else. No response about my pay, my pay was never deposited.

I have no idea what to do. My parents and my bf think I should send him an e-mail explaining that I am not coming in until my pay is taken care of and that I am not comfortable coming to that location to meet with him, but that I will go into the main office if he wants to talk. I don't disagree with them, I just don't know what to do. I know I'm being taken advantage of here. But I've got no balls. I know I need to stand up for myself, and get my pay, and that I should really just quit. My contract ends in a few weeks anyway, and after that I am leaving Germany to live with my bf in the Netherlands.

So I just need some advice. Am I definitely being screwed over? Is it inappropriate for me to tell him I am not coming into work until I get my pay? And is it inappropriate that I tell him I'm not comfortable coming into his apartment?

Thanks!

TL;DR: My boss is screwing me over. Owes me over 1000 euro in back pay, ignored my messages about my pay, and asked me to come into his apartment tomorrow morning. I feel uncomfortable with it, and do not want to even go in until I get paid. What should I do? 

**Edit**: I just spoke with my boss. He told me to come into the office. The company was forced to close because of legal issues with the main company. My boss lost his job, he tried to get me to continue to work for him for free. I basically told him absolutely never. I'm out a lot of money, and now unemployed. AWESOME. There's a small chance I can get some of the money, but I highly doubt it."

Tips?",EdgeOfDreams,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1byu39/transitioning_from_developer_to_instructortrainer/,"I graduated a little over 2 years ago with a Bachelor's of CS from a major university. During college I had a bunch of internships, and I've had 2 jobs since college. I'm a competent programmer, but coding in the ""real world"" just hasn't worked out for me. I always seem to get bored with the simple programs assigned to me, or else overwhelmed by tasks that should have been given to a much more senior developer. That, and I don't exactly have the best work habits, so it's easy for me to get distracted and end up literally having whole days where I get nothing done and it's nobody's fault but me.

On the other hand, I've always enjoyed teaching things to other people. I love explaining my ideas, and finding ways to re-word something or use an analogy when someone doesn't understand. I'm a very social, outgoing guy, and people have often complimented my ability to speak loudly and clearly. Class and work presentations are something I look forward to rather than dread like many of my peers.

Just going based on that evaluation of myself, I'm strongly considering trying to make a career change into some kind of teaching, training, or instructional position that would leverage my technical skills and knowledge. Unfortunately, I don't really know much about that field and career path, so I'm look for some advice.

* How can I find jobs in that field and find out more about what they're like and what they require?
* I've seen some job listings asking for CompTIA or Microsoft Certification for trainers - is some sort of certification a must-have to even get started in the field?
* Any major caveats or warnings I should know about before I pursue this? I used to be all gung-ho on being a game developer before I found out about all the issues with 'crunch time' and other poor developer treatment in that industry.
* Any other advice or things I should consider?"

First, some background: I went to a top ~30 or so school for mechanical engineering and did very well academically as an undergrad there, and am currently going to the same school in grad school. I'm pursuing my MS, and will graduate in a about a year, hopefully. Additionally, I have two (soon to be three) summers of internship experience. 

The first summer internship I worked for a big Pharmaceutical Company doing Process Improvement/Lean Six Sigma stuff, and the second summer was for a large engineering company where I did mechanical design work.

In both cases, what I actually did at the company was pretty easy in comparison to basically everything that I did in school. That being said, I was only an intern, so I imagine I didn't get the most difficult of tasks. But more relevently: the corporate culture in both of those places seemed almost overwhelmingly stifling. 

In both summers, the people that I worked with were all nice and for the most part seemed competent, but they just seemed like they didn't really enjoy what they were doing. Just the amount of bureaucracy present in these well-established companies seemed to just suck the fun out of everything.

Then I hear from one of my friends (who is a computer science major) about her work experience at a larger tech company, and their workplace seems so much more relaxed. She was telling me about how she and her coworkers can work however long they want and come in whenever they want so long as they got their work done. Their dress is very casual, and all of that as well. 

This sounds much more appealing to me than what I experienced either of the past two summers. Are there any companies that hire mechanical engineers that have this sort of atmosphere?

1byk0t,2,2013-04-08,Looking for advice in starting up a local marketing firm.,[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1byk0t/looking_for_advice_in_starting_up_a_local/,"I'm looking at starting a small, local marketing firm in my area, and was hoping you could give me some feedback/share your experience/share some advice.

The services I would offer would be:

* Building websites (through Wordpress mainly and BlueHost if they needed hosting). This would include creating shopping carts if they needed that type of site
* Graphic design (all types of pieces -- have a very talented graphic design partner)
* Improving SEO (or setting them up with the tools that they need to be successful with the new site)
* Setting up their e-mail campaigns -- (customer sign up integrates with website)
* Creating e-newsletters (design and code)
* Video production/editing (have another friend that is pretty talented when it comes to this stuff)
* Training them on Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools
* Setting up their CRM system
* Setting up their social media accounts/developing a plan
* Setting them up to function better as a team through the use of various collaboration and communication apps
* Possible copy writing (not sure about this at this moment though)
* Helping with ad placement around the community
* General marketing advice/re-branding

I would then be available for 'consulting' after this initial set-up stage. At this point I am thinking about providing my clients a set time for free every month based on whatever they had me do, and then charge for any time over that. So for example if they wanted additional SEO help, I would give them an hour every month for free -- or if they wanted some changes made to their website I would provide 3 hours every month for free. However, any graphic design changes would cost money at an hourly rate or set price if we could negotiate one.

In the beginning I would have to ask for money up front, but as it hopefully grew I would provide terms for customers (30 day billing, etc. -- because they'll most likely be small businesses too). I have found a lot of great apps and SaaS sites to help my own business function properly. And at this point it seems like the biggest cost to start would be registering my business (not sure what I should register it as), and obviously my time (which I know it would be extremely time intensive). If I needed more help there is a large university in town, and I thought I could get some interns to help with the workload (Good idea? Bad idea?). I currently work with a decent sized printing company (Fortune 5000 company) that I would have do the printing for my clients, and they do a good job. And from a legal standpoint I have a friend that would work with us that is becoming a lawyer this Summer and would help out from that standpoint. (We're all a couple years removed from college.) 

I live in a fairly large community (within 30 minutes of another large town -- easy to travel to) and after doing some research there appears to only be 3 to 4 major players that at this time I would consider main competitors. Their specialty mostly lies in the web design/development field, but they also provide some basic graphic design/SEO improvements/Google Analytics training.

In the beginning I would meet with potential clients face-to-face after reviewing their web presence myself through basic Google searches. It seems that a lot health providers/doctor offices don't have the strongest web presence in my area, and I'm making the assumption that they would possibly have some money for an upgrade. So this might be my target market to start. Also I plan on doing local Google Ads, and getting as involved as possible within the community. Both from a personal (joining groups, volunteering, etc.) and a company standpoint (sponsorships -- especially with the university, booths at events, partnering with local clients, etc.). One thing I should add is that I don't plan on overextending the business and adding clients rapidly. I want to grow in to having a larger client base (if I'm lucky).

So like I said I was hoping for some feedback/advice/suggestions/or anything else you can think of that might help. 

* Do you think I'm looking to provide too much, and should specialize in an area? Or is it okay? (I think I can handle it if I'm smart with how large my customer base is) 
* Also, what importance level would you place on having a bookkeeper? 
* Is bookkeeping something that's needed, or can that be easily learned?
* Is the age of my team going to hurt our chances at getting clients, or do people tend to overlook that if they see you can provide quality?
* Should I charge an introductory rate to gain clients in the beginning?

I've got tons of questions, but I'll leave it at that. Answer all, some, or none. I appreciate it that you made it this far. Thanks r/entrepreneur!

1) Does anyone know of a reputable school for an undergrad degree in CS? Preferably as close to DC as possible, and an emphasis on hands-on learning rather than theory would also be preferable.

2) What kind of degree is necessary? Will a BS be sufficient or is a masters or PhD necessary?

3) Is a degree even necessary with enough on-the-job experience? 

4) Does anyone know of any DC based companies that give great entry-level internship experience?

1c1lk5,2,2013-04-10,How can I use my Life Science degree to go into Computer Science?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1c1lk5/how_can_i_use_my_life_science_degree_to_go_into/,"Hi.  I'm a 22 year old that graduated from a public university in May 2012 with a B.S. Life Science degree, which is essentially a Biology degree except I had more leeway in terms of which upper level science classes I took.  I still took high level biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology courses.  My plan was to take a year off (because I graduated in 3 years due to AP credits) and then enter dental school.  

Well, this upcoming fall is when I'd be beginning dental school, but I didn't get accepted into any of my 4 dental schools that I could afford to apply to (so sad that it costed over $700 just to apply to 4 dental schools).  Nevertheless, I'm still very much interested in attending dental school and I'm preparing to re-apply this upcoming June.  

The reason I'm writing this is that I've been trying to come up with a backup plan in case dental school just doesn't work out for me.  I know that I can use my Life Science degree to get a job in research, teaching, etc.  For the past year since I graduated university, I have private tutored, have done a research internship at a dental center, and am currently applying for a clinical research assistant position at a local hospital.  However, I've realized that it is not only quite difficult getting a stable job with my degree that will be able to support my future family, but these are also jobs that I can't imagine myself doing long-term.  Therefore, I've begun to think about the possibility of a career change, hopefully without wasting my Life Science degree.  I don't know how that would work, though, so I'm asking you guys!

One field that's always appealed to me, aside from dentistry, is computer science.  In high school, I took several computer science courses in C++ and Java, including AP Comp Sci, and really excelled in them.  As a very quick learner, I picked up the mindset of a computer programmer and found myself breezing through my classes without a hiccup.  I found programming to be quite fun as I was constantly challenging myself to think of new ways of writing code to achieve the goals set before me.  Unfortunately, I know all too well that even AP Comp Sci *is* a breeze compared to what I'd need to do in the real world or even undergrad.  Nonetheless, if I had chosen not to pursue dentistry back in undergrad, my next choice would have been to pursue a career in computer science.

Let's say we fast-forward to this time next year.  I have been rejected once again from all of the dental schools to which I applied.  What should I do?  Is it ill-advised to pursue a career in computer science at this point?  If not, how do I even begin my endeavor into the computer science industry?  Do I have to go back to undergrad and spend another 3-4 years to get a B.S. Comp Sci degree and waste my Life Science degree?  Or can I use my Life Science degree to go into some compsci masters program using my life science degree?  Is there some industry out there that is in demand of biology-compsci people?"

1c1atl,0,2013-04-09,What just happened to me? Can anything be done?,hurting_guy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1c1atl/what_just_happened_to_me_can_anything_be_done/,"Throwaway...

It started when they left because of the ""affair."" My awesome team, the three amigos, was down to just one. Me...
It was the most difficult loss the church faced. Two beloved youth workers gone in an instant. It was an extreme loss for me. It's amazing how close you get with people when you spend everyday with them. Doing everything together and becoming more like family than co-workers. They were my best friends. For the first time I could say with a mature understanding of the word that I had found friends that I truly loved. I loved them.

I almost quit right then and there, but the ministry needed me. We were right in the middle of our busiest season. Missions trips, camps and other events where looming ahead and someone needed to lead them. Since I was the only one left in the youth ministry department, It was going to have to be me. I didn't do it alone, though. The summer intern came on full time to help, but she was a wreck, she loved those two just as much, if not more, than I did. There were multiple times where she wanted to leave. That hurt a lot. But we were the ones the ministry needed. So we stepped up and lead it through its most difficult time ever. 

Summer Camp was where it started to get real bad. Me and the director, who is on staff at the church, butted heads all summer. He didn't like that I disagreed with him or handled things differently. It got to a point where he got so mad that in front of all our teens, he puffed his chest, jabbed his finger into my chest and tried to intimidate me. That was not cool, you don't put your hands on anyone. Especially if you are being aggressive and he was. That happened at the beginning of senior high summer. 

We got into more and more fights, mostly about the band, their conduct and their dress. I thought it was silly, so I disagreed with him, but I enforced it in the end. I went as far as sitting band members for a night or two. 

This had its ramifications, though. Most of my free time was trying to console the band. They were angry, hurt and upset. One day, after a not so encouraging speech from the director, a huge argument erupted. The band had hit their lowest point. It was a very emotional time, so who could blame them? I did all I could to try and pick up the pieces but I think that summer took its tole on all of us. 

People slowly started pulling away. I already knew the director didn't respect me. The intern was saying she didn't want to be there. The head band member was slowly pulling away, students were telling me how they did not like being at youth group anymore, the worship pastor and I had our differences and it just seemed like slowly but surely I was being left all alone to face the pressures of this job. I was nervous to talk to the head pastor at the time. 

It was the darkest time in my life, for sure. I was emotionally a mess, struggling with depression and questioning my position. I had taken on much more responsibility, but I had received no compensation financially. This was going to be an ""opportunity"" to see if I was the man for the job. So I stayed at the same rate, doing much more work and having much more responsibility. After a year, they would evaluate and consider officially giving me the job, but that was not guaranteed.  This took its tole on me physically as I ate away my feelings. I gained about 50 pounds. My marriage was also a wreck during this time. My wife an I had multiple conversations where we were both in tears feeling as if we were one sentence away from ending our marriage.

I finally told the pastor that I'm not the guy they wanted but that I would stay on to support someone. 

I felt relieved to get that off my chest, but 5 months later as I write this I'm still in the same position. 

I realized later that youth ministry was not for me and that my gifts and passions would be better suited for the media director position that had just opened up. I talked with the pastor and the worship pastor and they supported my decision. 

This also felt good. But I was still working as the head youth guy, where I felt I didn't belong and where I felt I was drained more and more each day.

I kept pushing for as long as I could. I wanted them to find a youth pastor to fill my role, but I got to the point where I was running on fumes. Since the summer, I had been pushing, giving and trying to do all I could for the ministry, but I was burnt out. 

I went into the Pastors office. I sat down and told him that, ""I knew he needed me to keep pushing but that I wasn't sure how much longer I could go on."" We told people that things wouldn't change until someone new came on, but it was getting to a breaking point in all areas of my life. I'm guessing he sensed my burn out and offered a proposition. I would start transitioning into the Media role while the associate pastor became interim youth pastor. That sounded good to me, so I complied. The Pastor talked with the associate pastor and with the worship pastor (who would be my new boss) and everyone seemed to be fine with it. Or so I thought....

I was called into the worship pastors office and sat down a few weeks later. The Pastor came in and they both explained to me that because of the decision made, people felt hurt and betrayed by me. They said they felt I wasn't being a team player and that my character was called into question. They said there were consequences to my actions and that I had 3 options. I could resign right away with 1 moth severance  I could work for 3 months and then resign or I could take the Media job and be on a probation period for 1 year where I would need to own up to what I had done and reach clearly defined benchmarks every 3 months. (And from what I understand, this third ""probation"" option wasn't even on the table for a while. Which means there was a period of time where the only options for me were to leave. EVENTUALLY, they came up with the third option, but the fact that it was last and only thought about later speaks volumes. It means they were ready to let me go for going to the Pastor, telling him how I feel and then accepting an offer he proposed which was also accepted by the worship pastor and the director. I didn't fight for it, nor would I have fought against it if the Pastor had told me to stay on longer. I simply agreed. Apparently, this is enough to almost get you immediately fired.)

At that point I had some cognitive dissonance. What do they mean what I had done? Wasn't this something they offered and supported? They didn't ask me to keep pushing through, they didn't ask me to stay on for a little bit longer and I didn't ask to switch my role immediately. I finally had the guts to talk to my Pastor about how I was feeling and he offered a solution. I simply agreed to that solution. Sure it was going to be a little crazy, but we went through this before and I would still be around to help in whatever capacity they needed. I wasn't just dropping everything and leaving the youth ministry to fend for it's own. For the two weeks after my initial discussion with the Pastor, I was in full support mode for the youth ministry. I would continue to support for as long as they needed.

They kept telling me that the reality was people were upset. But the other reality was that no one who was on my side before, went to bat for me when people got upset. The people who I thought supported this move, let everyone get mad at me, they didn't come to my defense. 

They stuck with the story that it was a character flaw on my part, that I was not a team player and that now my entire job was in jeopardy. 

I didn't know what to say, I was shocked, hurt, and appalled. I felt betrayed, confused and angry. It seemed like everything was going to work out and this bomb gets dropped on me from nowhere. 

One minute my boss and future boss are saying that everything is going to work out and they next they are telling me that my job is in jeopardy and that I only have 3 options 2 of which are to resign. 

I understand that I came to talk to the Pastor during a busy time and that he may have offered something he didn't mean to, but to allow such extreme consequences fall on me seems unreasonable. It seems extreme. It seems wrong. 

For nearly a year I had given of my self to this church, ministry and congregation as they where going through a deep loss. I did it because they needed it. I was not given a raise, my salary remained the same, but I kept pushing. 

And in the blink of an eye. From a simple sit down with the Pastor and an agreement to something he proposed, my character is flawed, trust is broken with multiple people, and I barely have a job. 

It doesn't seem fair

I don't believe I deserved this.

I have never felt more disrespected in my life.

TL;DR - Burnt out at old Job. Talked to boss. Offered new Job. Weeks later, job in jeopardy because people got mad. Either I take a probation period and prove myself or leave."

Not much hope left. -_-",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1c13ux/im_19_and_my_familys_being_evicted_for_the_third/,"To make a long story short, my family was a dysfunctional but financially-stable middle class family. In 2010, we had a major falling out with a relative who was kindly providing us with a place to stay, so since then, every single year we've had to move from a good house to a crap house, to a REALLY crappy house. Along the way, we've had our already-small family fall apart. My aunt died a terrible death from lung cancer, and my older brother is on the streets.

It's currently me, my aging, somewhat-ill mother, and my controlling, verbally-abusive other brother. I've been unemployed for a year, and my brother's been guilt-tripping me, saying that we wouldn't be in this situation if I got a job and paid the rent...something he doesn't do with a full-time job. So, now we're probably going to have to move to an even worse place...in an even worse neighborhood...and my depression will get even worse.

I've heard the ""new house, new beginning!"" line so many times, it's almost an insult. Things have got progressively worse, my family is nonexistent, my friends have all left me, and I'm psychologically, emotionally, and physically a mess. While everyone I once knew is enjoying college, getting internships and having fun, I'm getting poorer and poorer, isolating myself more and more, and crying myself to sleep each night knowing that the future is bleak.

How the hell can I make it through **this** one?

**TL;DR - My family has become impoverished and completely fallen-apart. My mother and I, after being evicted for the third time, are going to have to move into a crappy two-bedroom apartment, while I work a crappy full-time job in order to support the two of us, as she's starting to get old, and her health isn't looking too good.**"

I've been working near full time this year while I finish up my last few classes, but I'm only getting paid ""intern"" salary, despite the workload, because I don't have the degree. 


I've been given two offers for ~$60k a year with fairly minimal benefits from both the company I'm working at now, and another I interviewed with. They both seem pretty low to me, but perhaps I'm trying to sell myself for a lot more than I'm worth. Most of the salary surveys I've looked up have new grads around 70k. With 3 years of both developing and helping manage projects, I would think I've got a bit more experience than a typical undergrad (maybe not).


I know it shouldn't all be about the money, and I think both companies seem fairly interesting, but I don't want to sell myself short out of the gate.

I am currently taking a course known as the engineering academy. This class is basically a four year, all of high school, course that prepares you for the first two years of college. Freshman year we worked with Solid Edge, creating 3D models of many of the design projects we had. Sophomore year was probably the most intense, time consuming year because it was so fast. Each 9-weeks we learned about a new engineering field, and then put that knowledge to the test through an experiment, and then we presented about the experiment, and how we used the knowledge we had attained to help in the experiment. Junior year is all about computer programming. We learned Matlab during the 1st semester, and are currently learning LABview surfing the 2nd semester. Senior year is where everything we have learned is put to the test. We work with local engineering firms to design a project that would benefit our local community. During this project everything we have learned throughout the past four years is put to the test.

This is a story about Microsoft.

To preface this all, I am a huge Microsoft fanboy; I've always adopted their products early on and continue to use them as my primary devices. I own a Surface, a Lumia 920, and a W8 Desktop &amp; Laptop. During my undergrad, I was a Microsoft Student Partner on campus.

I'm currently in a Masters Program in Computer Science (my undergrad, however, wasn't CS-related). I applied for a summer internship position as a Program Manager. I got through the phone interview and was flown out to Seattle for a day of interviews. I had four interviews, with the last one being one with the hiring manager. They all went well.

Three days later, I was sent an email from my recruiter saying essentially ""we are going to offer you a position, when's the best time to talk?"" I respond and we are scheduled to talk. A week later, as I'm waiting for the offer call, I get a call from my recruiter. Apparently, something had ""changed"" in the system. When the recruiter checked, there was all ""Recommend for Hire"" ratings from the four people I interviewed with. But now, the last guy had changed his mind. Thus, I was not going to be offered the position. Heartbroken is an understatement for what I felt. The recruiter then said that they were going to fly me out to interview with a team that was ""a good fit for me."" That sounded great! Two weeks later, I hear nothing. Finally, I get a generic response form my university recruiter saying that all of their PM intern positions had filled up quicker than they had expected and that I was effectively out of luck until August. 

In a week period, I had gone from pure jubilation from landing my dream internship to rock bottom. This was back in January, and to this day I still don't have an internship locked up yet. It affected my psyche and confidence, as well as my motivation to apply for stuff.

I guess the point of all of this is, be careful when it comes to dealing with offers with companies. I was probably being naive when it came to these things, but just a bit of advice."

When determining how much experience one has, what counts? Just professional experience? Or do people believe that the work that went into school projects should be weighted the same as professional experience? Where does freelance jobs fit into it? Independent projects? Internships?

For example, a computer science major may have a good 2 years of experience working on C++ assignments, from nightly homework exercises to end-of-semester projects. But is that the same thing as using C++ in the professional world? What about someone fresh out of grad school applying to a research job, does their masters degree in make them qualified for a job requiring 2 years of research experience? When a hiring manager wants a Java developer with 3 years of experience, should count schoolwork as experience or are they justified in specifically wanting 3 years of working experience?"

I've been out of work for many months, living with my parents. I have applied to a ridiculous number of positions near my home, or on campus but have yet to receive any real offers.

My grades for CS are very good (around 3.8), but overall 2.9 GPA (I partied way too much during my gen eds). Have had many jobs in the past, but have never really left a good impression. Been fired from several jobs for non-serious, yet legit reasons (being late a few times, making a mistake on a credit card receipt). Basically, I have almost no acceptable work references, nearly nothing useful to put on a resume, and I can only really work within a 5 mile radius of my house, or on campus because of a lack of transportation. 

What I'm looking for: Literally anything that isn't fast food. I have been turned down by everyone from CS internships to gas stations. My parents are pretty poor, and they don't like me living with them because I stopped going to their church, and they have essentially given me an ultimatum to leave their house. Awesome.

Our company is pretty small (~150) so there is only two full time IT admins. Unfortunately they are not what I'd call ""fully qualified"" sysadmins. One was a software engineer thrown into his new role, and the other has good people and sales skills but lacks real technical skills. The reason I'm explaining all this is because I feel like I'm not being properly trained as a sysadmin as most of the time I ask them a question their answer is ""Google it"". 

So I come to you guys asking for any advice, tips, tricks, stuff you wish you knew starting as a sysadmin. Bare in mind that we're primarily a Windows shop (Mainly Win7 for PCs, and Win2008R2 for servers)

Anything from good books, stuff I should beef up on, best practices, daily routines, etc.

Hey everyone, I have a really good problem (too many choices) but I'm absolutely stuck and I'm not sure what would be best for me this year.  I have no professional experience, so setting myself up for next summer is the most important thing in my decision. Here's my current options :
 
 * Web Development job with a reputable company in SF with an established intern program.  I'm the only intern on a small team, but I'd be working on features and not on an internship project.  I like the team.   Pay is VERY good for my skill level; $30/hr (and I'll be living rent free)  They want to hear back from me TOMORROW, putting the squeeze on my other options.

 * Freshman program at Facebook.  Focused on mobile development.  Got an interview, which is 30 minutes and only semi-technical, so it's not a done deal yet.  I think it would be a really great way to meet some other kids my age who are really good hackers, and Facebook obviously has a great rep among HR people.  It's paid, but doubtful as much as the other company.  It's also only 8 weeks (as opposed to 12+ at the other company).  I do have other offers in hand so I can turn down the high-paying web dev position and have a fallback...but is it worth it.  It's also just a bootcamp, so it's probably going to be much more structured and I'm not sure how much I will get out of it.

In short, I feel like I would get more experience at the web dev company, and grow more as a software engineer, but Facebook has that name cachet that's hard to deny.  Is it worth taking the risk to go for Facebook?

Thanks so, so much."

What ways should I prepare for the interview (It will be in approx 2 weeks). There's also a call-in interview prep session where I can ask about the interview process and the internship 1 week before the interview). 

I'm just wondering in what ways I can prepare. I read that the books *Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job* and *Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions* are good for real interviews but I'm not sure if they apply to me since it's only a high school internship interview.

Right now, it's down to UCLA vs Berkeley for Computer Science and/or Economics. To give you some background, I'm an OOS student (FL) who's been accepted into Cal L&amp;S Undeclared and UCLA L&amp;S Pre-Economics. I think I'm more interested in CS though! And I'm receiving $10K more from UCLA than Cal, but my parents fully support my choice.

I've got a few questions:

1. How large of a difference will Computer Science @ UCLA and Computer Science @ Berkeley differ? Will I be at a significant disadvantage when looking for internships and, later, work in the Silicon Valley area or for big companies if I attend UCLA? (I realize Berkeley's rankings are high up there, but practically and in real life, do recruiters take much much more from Berkeley than UCLA?)

2. I've heard that pre-Haas is very competitive and nearly cutthroat. Just how bad is it?

3. For Berkeley, is it difficult to transfer into the COE for Computer Science? I've heard that in UCLA, I'll need to take some prereqs and have 3.5+ GPA, but what about Cal?

4. For Berkeley, how does a BA in CS in L&amp;S vs a BS in EECS in the College of Engineering compare (internships, opportunities, jobs)? I heard the classes are literally the exact same thing -- but I'll just receive more humanities courses + an A instead of an S on my degree.

5. Everyone over on the UCLA side says their campus life is damn awesome. Convince me that Berkeley's is better!

Thanks so much in advance!

It started when I started dating my ex in high school and I went over to his place after graduation, telling my dad I was with other friends as well. When my dad came to pick me up, he realized I was all alone with my ex and that's when the trouble began.

We flew back to Korea, he insisted that I was never going back to the US for college. All summer he banned me from the Internet, from keeping in contact with any of my high school friends. It was difficult but I pulled through, but things didn't get much better when I started college. He told me that I was not allowed to travel without his permission, and that I should record whatever money I spent, and he would call me on my dorm phone during weekends to make sure I was home. After a year of that, I got a job on campus for the summer, but my dad refused to let me take it. Being financially dependent, there was nothing I could do. I had to fly home (which was California at the time, my family moved there for a year), where I knew no one, was unemployed, and had nothing to do. I stayed in my room all day and had no social interaction with anyone other than my family for 3.5 months. By the end I was going crazy and throwing up everything I ate, had severe insomnia, contemplated suicide, etc. This experience fucked me up for the next year or so, despite the fact that I got a job on campus to pay for visits to my ex and I found a way to reroute my dorm phone to my cell.

At the end of sophomore year, I broke up with my ex and started dating a new guy. I kept the relationship a secret for almost a year and a half, telling my mother (who is considerably more reasonable) a month or two before I told my father. When I told him, he said that since I was an adult, he was not going to treat me the way he did before, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had hope that maybe he would change.

Winter break of senior year, I wanted to move off campus as I only had to work on a BA thesis, since I had completed my course requirements. I mentioned it to my mother but I guess it never came up with my dad, probably because we never speak (I hate his guts - can you blame me?). He calls me and accuses me of lying to his face and that he does not trust me or believe anything I say anymore. I calmly apologize and state that I never meant to hide anything, it just never came up, and that if I knew that it would make him so upset, I would never have done it. I even ask him why this upsets him so much, if he could please explain it? However, he fails to give me a straight answer and continues to scream at me and call me an untrustworthy ingrate of a daughter, and demands that I pack my  bags and come home right away. And I lost it.

I literally saw red. I screamed bloody murder that no, I will not do what he asks, and demanded to know how long he planned on telling me what to do. I told him that I hated him and that's why I never called, and that he made me wish I was never born, and I begged him to kill me because I would rather die than spend another moment dealing with his bullshit. He had never heard me act this way so he was taken aback. He said I should just live there on my own without his help, and I said fine. He hung up, and called back (in the meantime my mom called me to make sure I wasn't going to hurt myself - she's a sweetheart like that). He asked me what I wanted from him and I told him that I wanted him to stop telling me what to do, that I was going to live my own life and make my own choices. He was affronted by this, and literally asked me ""how could you say this to me?"" to which I replied, ""If you didn't want my honest opinion, why did you even ask?"" He was silent. He said he couldn't do that, and that if that was my condition, he could never see or talk to me again. I told him that's fine. I could tell he was horrified, I could hear his stunned silence over the phone. We hung up and I came home to see my grandpa one last time before he passed away and attend his funeral (he had cancer, this is totally unrelated).

Since then, we've had a bit of tension. He basically pretended the whole thing never happened, and I've informed him and my mom that I'm staying in the US after graduation, even if I don't have a job locked down (I don't yet, I'm still looking - I do have an internship to keep me busy until August), and they are obviously not okay with that. Which brings me to my present situation.

I'm thinking of declaring independence from my family. I'm thinking of writing my mom an e-mail (not my dad; he's beyond saving) about how emotionally crippled I've become because of my dad, how I've been taking antidepressants on and off throughout my college career, how I've contemplated overdosing on painkillers so my suffering could end. I plan on telling her that he has traumatized me so greatly that there is no way I could be happy while living under his roof, even for a moment. I plan on telling her that from now on, I will make my own decisions, and I fundamentally disagree with the notion that they seem to hold about my life, which is that it is a collective decision. It's my decision, and mine only.

My boyfriend and I have been together for two years (he's white, and my dad is opposed to this - he thinks mixed babies are doomed for a life of misery, don't ask why. my mom doesn't like him because he's not rich and therefore cannot take care of me, but she is more accepting of the fact that money is not important to me and I love who I love). We plan on moving in together. Some of my friends think I shouldn't tell my parents, but I'm tired of hiding my true self. I feel as though they should accept who I am, and if they can't, that's on them.

I should probably mention that I am not Asian-American. I'm Korean by ethnicity and citizenship. I've spent 13 years in the United States total though, and I'm basically white. My dad refuses to accept this, but I think it's time that I cut him out of my life if this is the case.

What do you guys think? Do you think the e-mail and honesty is a good idea? Do you think some things just can't be communicated, and that I should maintain the relationship I have with them now, telling them virtually nothing about my life and speaking to them only out of obligation? I'm extraordinarily unhappy, and have been so for years. I want more than anything to sort this out and begin the next chapter of my life as a happy person.

That was long, but I hope at least one person reads it and responds. I just feel so hopeless all the time.

**TL;DR Bout to graduate college, my dad's an asshat, I plan on declaring independence from my parents even though I may end up poor. Good idea or no?**"
1c9652,0,2013-04-13,Decisions Time: UCLA vs Berkeley,twwq,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1c9652/decisions_time_ucla_vs_berkeley/,"Hey everyone. I need some opinions and experiences from the UCLA side! Right now, it's down to UCLA vs Berkeley for Computer Science and/or Economics. To give you some background, I'm an OOS student (FL) who's been accepted into Cal L&amp;S Undeclared and UCLA L&amp;S Pre-Economics. I think I'm more interested in CS though!

I've got a few questions:

1. How large of a difference will Computer Science @ UCLA and Computer Science @ Berkeley differ? Will I be at a significant disadvantage when looking for internships and, later, work in the Silicon Valley area if I attend UCLA?

2. I've heard that pre-Haas is very competitive and nearly cutthroat. How is UCLA's bizecon program? How does it compare to Berkeley's?

3. For UCLA, is it difficult to transfer into SEAS for Computer Science? I've heard that I'll
need to take some prereqs and have 3.5+ GPA, but is achieving that difficult?

4. For Berkeley, how does a BA in CS in L&amp;S vs a BS in EECS in the College of Engineering compare (internships, opportunities, jobs)?

Thanks in advance"

1cbvlz,1,2013-04-14,Started a new job at an IT tech firm - fairly green in the field and need advice.,Megaperro,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cbvlz/started_a_new_job_at_an_it_tech_firm_fairly_green/,"So where to begin.  I decided to join the IT field about 6 months ago with minimal experience (graduated college 2010 with business degree).  Did a 6 month internship at a school system, learned a decent amount and got the A+ cert.  After that ended I got a job at a tech services company with the knowledge that they were hiring me for my potential, not my experience or expertise but would learn quick and on the fly.  

First week was absolute hell and harder than anything I imagined.  I thought I knew a decent amount about computers, networking, and software troubleshooting....WRONG.  There is so much info coming at me from all directions and programs to learn that I've never heard of - basically caused a panic attack on day on my third day.  I am lucky that I was told to ask questions, but there's a decent amount of apprehension that I may be asking too often and looking incompetent.  

My boss spoke to me and mentioned that he saw that I was getting overwhelmed and told me that is the worst thing that can happen in a job like this and the moment that anxiety hits, its game over.  He added that what we are selling at our company is the confidence to solve any issue that comes our way.  That stuck with me well and it really changed my view for the better, but I realize that I do not know where to look (i know, google), but I really want to have the confidence and game plan to know how to attack a problem I am completely unfamiliar with.  

I guess my big question to the big IT/computer tech experts out there is what do you recommend to a new guy like myself with minimal knowledge to learn how to troubleshoot and problem solve like a pro and instill confidence with the client on the other line?  I really want to succeed at this, but at this point I am unsure where to point my efforts.  Thanks in advance!"

The thing is, I think I might enjoy development work more. I've been looking diligently for an internship more suited to my goals, but to no avail.

I'm mostly worried that by continuing in my current position, I will have a hard time breaking into development jobs when all my experience isn't exactly relevant (despite my experience in a number of languages and technologies). However, I really don't have much of a choice since I see no other readily available opportunity. Am I making too big a deal out of it?

Do I just continue to look for opportunities and stay where I am? Should I consider moving to find more abundant and interesting work? (is there such a thing?)

Scared.,cs_21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1cb3y6/one_semester_left_scared/,"I'm 21 years old and next semester will be my last semester. I've held several jobs since high school and but last August I became employed. I was determined to just concentrate on school, however my savings wouldn't last me. So I looked for jobs under 3 requirements:

1. No fast food jobs
2. No retail jobs 
3. Not minimum wage

I couldn't find anything. After months of searching, I dropped my retail job requirement and I started replying to jobs listings that required bachelors degrees stating that I do not have my degree yet, but would like a paid internship. After searching everyday for the last few months I'm starting to lose it.

I live with my parents and I have no money. My parents offer my money, but I refuse. I can't afford to go out, I'm embarrassed to go out with my girlfriend because she pays for everything.

I feel like I'm one of the brightest students in my University's CS program. I understand the material. But when I look at job listings, I feel inferior and incompetent. My degree is completely useless to me and my whole university education was a sham. I wasn't prepared for a job. I just don't know what I'm going to do. If I can't even find a decent job now.

tl;dr been unemployed for 8 months. Can't find a decent job.

edit: I do work on projects, Android apps, websites, and graphics, and currently a C++ game. I'm also located in Hawaii so my options are limited, or programming jobs seem limited."

Should I try to renegotiate?,throwaway_se_13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1cf7gn/did_i_give_too_low_of_a_salary_requirement_to_a/,"Hi, I am a student who will graduate with a degree in Software Engineering in a few weeks.  I do not have a career lined up yet. The past few weeks, I have been applying like crazy to every entry-level position I can find in my preferred city.  

Yesterday, I submitted a resume to a contracting agency for a Java Developer position.  An employee from the team called me to today to discuss the position.  She asked for my salary requirements and I told her $40,000/year.  I'm not sure what I was thinking; I guess I thought if you gave a low number, you would seem more employable or something.

After another phone call with a manager, I received an email asking for my authorization for the agency to submit my application to clients. Lo and behold, it said my rate was $20/hour.  Because I currently make $22/hour at my internship, I would feel cheated if I made much less after graduation.  I should have done the math beforehand.

Would it be impolite to email the company back and ask to raise my salary to something around $25/hour?  This would be more desirable as an engineer.  The position is for a java developer, however, so I am not sure if $40k is standard for that position. 

I am also not sure whether to keep pursuing this position in general, either.  I wasn't given much time to research the agency beforehand, but afterwards, I discovered that the owner of the place was charged with tax evasion and that they are notorious for grossly underpaying contractors. 

The contract is up to 2 years; however, it is also possible that their client might hire me full time after 6 months, too.  I'm paranoid about not having any offers right now and would rather not have any huge gaps in work experience after my internship ends, so I'm too afraid to ditch this opportunity entirely.  At the same time, I don't want to get involved in something below my potential that would be difficult to quit. 

tl;dr: can I ask to raise my salary from $20/hour to $25 for a java developer position without coming across as rude?

Any help or general input on contracting, etc., would be greatly appreciated. :)

1chkm0,7,2013-04-16,"I want to live with my bf and write my phd thesis long distance this summer, but my supervisor thinks it's a terrible idea.",april162013,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1chkm0/i_want_to_live_with_my_bf_and_write_my_phd_thesis/,"I'm in my 5th year of a combined masters/phd program in psychology.  Starting in September I'll be doing a full-time internship in a hospital for a year.  I'll be moving to a new apartment in September to be closer to the hospital.  

I want to move to another city a couple hours to live with my bf and write my thesis from there for the summer.  We are serious about each other and plan on getting married soon after my internship ends.  However, the relationship has always been long distance (we've been together for a year) and we've mostly only seen each other on weekends up until now.  I would like to try living with him sooner rather than later.

My supervisor thinks that moving there for the summer is a terrible idea because my thesis has been advancing more slowly than it should be and I will no longer be guaranteed funding after my internship year.  We agree that it's crucial for me to get as much writing done on my thesis as possible this summer.  My supervisor thinks that I will lose too much time in the transition from here to my bf's place and from my bf's place back to here in September.  She said that she is concerned that I will take too long long to finish my thesis and run into issues with the administration (this would happen after 7 years), or even that I will decide to not complete my thesis in the end.  She even offered to pay me extra to stay here for the summer.

I will be leaving my furniture here in storage so I don't think it will take too much work to move there and back, but I've never attempted a move like this before.  Personally I think I will be more productive there because living with my bf will be motivating.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?  I'm so caught up in my PhD that I'm afraid I'm losing perspective.  I've been experiencing a considerable amount of guilt and anxiety over not progressing faster with my thesis that is preventing me from seeing the situation objectively.  My worst fear is not being able to complete my PhD.

Could use advice",justwondering122,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1chiik/college_is_nearing_to_an_end_i_wasnt_able_to_find/,"I spent my first 2 and a half years in community college knocking out my gen eds so that I could save some money for when I transferred to a university. When I transferred in I was practically a junior and jumped straight into my computer science courses and was taking up to 15 credits of computer science classes per semester. I noticed many of my fellow juniors were already working nice paying internships in development but I was unable to find one since I lacked the skills necessary having just started my computer science classes, and even though I was junior, the only classes I had taken up until then were gen eds. Senior year when I finally had developed programming skills through classes/self-studying I was unable to find an internship in development since many companies preferred sophomores or juniors since they would be around longer than seniors. So i ended up taking an unpaid internship through my college working help desk at the local city hall. I'm nearing graduation now but I'm having trouble landing interviews since my only experience is help desk and it involved no development whatsoever. What should I do to increase my chances to be considered? I feel a bit low knowing that I have coeds who have had high paying development internships while I was working at the grocery store to support myself. I keep hearing about doing projects on github but I have no idea how to get started, and those would have to wait till after I graduate since I'm currently working around 35 hours a week between my part-time job and my internship, as well as taking 18 credit hours worth of classes in order to graduate on time. 
I have uploaded my resume to googledocs in case someone has any pointers. I live in the chicago-land area and most of my web development skills I've learned through codecademy. I learned android development from a college course.

1ch9oe,1,2013-04-16,My first real job ruined my self esteem and maybe my chances at another position. How do I move on?,GardenSlugger,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ch9oe/my_first_real_job_ruined_my_self_esteem_and_maybe/,"**TL;DR - Bullied by my old supervisor, confidence shattered, trying to move on. Possible rumors/shit talking from old supervisor around my city. Afraid I'll never be able to find another position.**

This turned out really long. Sorry! Also I'm using a throwaway. This is not my main account.

I'm in my early 20s. I was ""laid off"" from my first job at an advertising agency early this year. I'm the type of person who has always taken school and career choices pretty seriously. My parents also always instilled a sense of humility in me so I've always been willing to bend over backwards. (I honestly think this has made me a little weak-willed and thrown off my sense of self respect when it comes to authority figures) I had to complete an internship for school so I chose my agency strategically in order to win a job after interning. I did this successfully.

The branch of the company I worked for had only 3-5 people ever working in that office with a high turn over rate. I was so confident and proud of myself. I think I was a model intern and a really good employee (again, at first). Because there were so few people in the office, I worked in close proximity with the head of my department. Often there would be no mid-level person between us so we'd have to work together, covering that position's duties. I was proud that I was able to step up and work on tasks that should've been far out of my reach.

At first, I was totally starry-eyed and looked up to my supervisor so much. She loved this. She did the job I had dreamed of while I was in school and she was incredible at it (still is). Once I was hired on full time, I started noticing small things she did that felt direct and targeted.  My mom was the first one who brought up the word ""bully"". My supervisor would often say really inappropriate things to/about me in front of clients and our coworkers. She told a new hire, ""GardenSlugger has to do what I say because I say it."" Sure I did. I was the junior. I understand that but to state it in such an overt way... Was this over the line? I was also expected to go to Starbucks every day to get her latte, no matter what - one lone latte since no one else in the office drank Starbucks. She wouldn't even tell me to go. She would passively-aggressively whine about *really* *needing* *caffeine*. She created an environment where I felt it was difficult to ask questions and therefore get the training I needed to get better at my job. Often questions were met with an eyeroll. She would also constantly spout off tons of garbage about other employees to me, so I knew she would definitely have no qualms about telling everyone how ""useless"" I was. There are a ton of other examples but I basically felt like I was trapped in high school again but it was much more serious this time - my apartment, job and future were at risk if I pissed this woman off.

My morale was so low and anxiety so high that I would often throw up on my way to work in the mornings. I was terrified of what she would say to/about me, feeling unable to fight back. I felt like this for months, questioning my own sanity. I was so afraid that I was coming off as an spoiled, too sensitive brat. Eventually I was only concentrated on my anxiety and was becoming absolutely terrible at my job. I would forget things, make mistakes with clients, miss deadlines and screw up small tasks. I knew I was becoming total shit. The confidence I got from being top of my class in school lay in shreds. She told me there was just not enough work to support my position and that I was laid off. I think she just couldn't stand having me around anymore.

Before you ask, yes, I did try to rectify the problem. Unfortunately the company was based in a country where HR doesn't exist so that was out. I spoke to the VP in our branch about my supervisor's behaviour. The VP promised he would talk to my supervisor about it, but the VP left the company shortly afterwards and my supervisor became the head of the branch. I couldn't confront her directly because I knew she would take personal offence (instead of listening) and my head would probably be on the chopping block. I guess it was anyway. I wrote my concerns about her when review time came along. This was supposed to be anonymous feedback, delivered by someone else in the company. I even wrote my own list of improvements *I* needed to make that I would've presented and discussed with her at the time of my review, which never happened. I tried resisting her behaviour and even standing my ground when she would make cruel comments. I'm sure I could've done more but I know how girl bullies work and they do not respond well to confrontation.

My industry's community in my city is small and she is well known. I'm interviewing tomorrow for a position that I really, really want to get. The recruiter that set me up with the gig informed me that the person I am interviewing with ""knows someone"" at my previous agency and was wary about meeting with me. So now I'm terrified that my reputation is ruined, even without being officially fired. 

How do I move on from this? (In terms of employment and my own confidence/mental well-being)"

1cgq85,2,2013-04-16,Can engineers ever decide between more than 1-2 job offers?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1cgq85/can_engineers_ever_decide_between_more_than_12/,"As an undergrad I always thought that I would work my way through college and then at the end I would apply to a dozen companies, interview with several of them, and then go through a handful of offers and select the best-fit job.  As I approach my final year in college (9 years later!) with a PhD, I wonder if this thinking was naive?  I think I expected it to be like college admissions, with firm deadlines and an expected schedule of when you would hear back.

* **As an engineer, do you really ever get to evaluate more than 1-2 job offers at a time?**

As I inch closer to graduate, it seems less and less likely that - even if I *can* interview with a *dozen* companies in the same week - **the chances that I can get them all to give me an offer letter at the same time seems impossible**!  My last internship took *8 months* from successful interview to matching me with a position and giving me a formal offer.  And, **the window in which to accept or reject an offer is ridiculously short**, even for start-dates a year away.  (E.g. If I successfully complete my next internship this summer they *will* give me an offer, but I only have *3 weeks* to accept - 2 weeks if I want the signing bonus.)

So what do engineers do?  How can you line up job offers to hit at the same time so you have the most options?  If it helps, I'm still in school for my PhD, and I know when to expect one job offer after my internship this summer.  Do I just wait for the first offer and then knock on the other companies' doors and say, ""Hey, last chance to make me an offer before I accept this in a week?""  It seems like HR departments tend to drag their feet until the last possible minute."

Firstly is not taking advantage of internships. Turns out experience matters. A lot. And getting your foot in the door helps immensely before graduation. 

Secondly is thinking college is ""easy"". It was, I had really good grades, graduated with honors, never really studied, just passed test. Almost 2 years since I have graduated I feel like I really missed a lot of opportunities to hone my craft, and instead just passed tests and assignments like I always did.

Thirdly, and lastly, not running with it the second I graduated. I took time off to help my sick family, and now being out of the loop I am finding it incredibly hard to be employed. As bad as it sounds I almost wish I would have let my aunt and dad fend for themselves while I secured my future. And that feels horrible to say. Because right now all I have is debt and time wasted to show for my studies.

Just curious on your opinions on what career fields actually have some well-paying jobs that don't require you to have been an unpaid intern for the past 5 years.

I went to college for Graphic Design for 4 years, had to transfer colleges half way through so I lost some credit transfers and so I don't have the official BFA yet. I'm taking a break from school due to financial reasons and some of these job descriptions are just ridiculous.

""Entry-Level"" to me means 1-2 years of experience plus whatever you learned in college. Most of the Entry Level jobs I see on LinkedIn require 3-5 years of experience and not just ""general"" experience they want you to have very *specific* experience in that one niche they are hiring for. I realize every company wants to hire the perfect fit with minimal need for training but seriously - are there any jobs out there that understand that for a new job, there will be some things you know, and some things you will need to be trained on.

I'm applying to various job types at this point, as I can't be super picky however everything above $35K per year, from what I can see, refuses to pay for any training and expects you to know 95% of the job before you start.

I'm 24, currently making in the mid 30s however my student loans are killing my ability to save money for my future and so ideally a job at 40k+ per year would be more ideal.

Does anyone have any experience/tips/information with this?

In September I landed an internship, but it was really through a government program aimed at helping people who they feel are 'at risk' (minorities, poor) gain a few months experience after graduation. After my 3 month internship (where I learned very little, I was essentially sent to a backroom and told to 'have fun' with the terrible access DB) the location I was working asked me to stay on for another 4 months - I did, but at this point it was strictly an administrative job. Throughout all this I applied to as many jobs as possible, with no luck.

Eventually last month (right before the end of my 4 month contract) I landed another internship for a strictly development job, but it was unpaid. Being my only other option, I took it. I have been working at this location for nearly a month, and while it is strictly a development position - this is not an internship by any stretch of the imagination. I am essentially free labour - there are no senior devs or juniors for that matter, only other interns. Many of those interns are still in school, and I am the only full time intern at this location - they essentially have thrown every IT related task my way, and while sometimes they have been challenging, I don't really feel like this location is in any way a professional environment nor do I have any opportunity to learn from other professionals (like I would expect in a real internship). I don't plan on being here much longer.

That being my current predicament, I am continuing my search but am finding more of the same - unpaid internships from places that I can't justifiably even call 'startups' where I would be free labour for 3 months, or junior positions that look for 3+ years experience with a whole host of technologies. The few jobs that seem to meet my bracket (recent grad, little experience) are most likely flooded by many applications, and I don't feel like my extremely ethnic name is doing me any favours.

I spend about 2-3 hours a day on average studying - usually watching videos and doing online tutorials. I also recently started up a github account where I added some old projects I've worked on, and am planning on starting as many new projects in my spare time as possible.

My current skillset of languages and technologies that I feel I have an intermediate level of skill in:
C#, Javascript/jQuery, HTML/CSS, SQL
A variety of DB platforms
A couple of CMS

Things I am learning or things that I should be an 'intermediate' in soon:
Ruby, PHP, Sass, Ajax (particularly with JSON)

Things I have experience with, on varying levels:
C++, Java, MVC frameworks, XML, android development, LAMP/WAMP solutions

I'm going to continue to study as much as I can, and really feeling comfortable with Ajax and PHP are my near-term goals, along with filling my github profile with a lot of small projects. Other than that though, I am not sure how to make myself more attractive to employers, and I feel like applying to 5 or so job postings a day isn't really getting me anywhere. What advice can anyone give me? If you need more information please ask, I'd be happy to provide some."

21 year old student, about to finish up my last year in college at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts with a degree in Environmental Science and concentration in Geology. I have been thinking a lot in the past few weeks about moving out of the country once I graduate. This week's bombings have flicked a switch in my brain- maybe I really do need to get out of here...

I have read that many of the countries I have listed are very particular about who they give visas to and that they only take workers with specialized skills.

My specialized skill: I have been working with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for the past year, both in school and as an intern for the city of Boston. I hope to continue to get better at this niche skillset and am wondering if I will have a better chance of finding work overseas if I pursue a Masters degree abroad.

I have tried looking for job postings and internship opportunities with no real success... I just don't know where to look! Germany and the Nordic Countries simply fascinate me and I am drawn to their culture, way of living, and outlooks. I am anxious to get over there and submerge myself completely.

Some more questions:

* If I were to apply to a job, would I have to secure it and THEN apply for a visa?

* Does securing a position with a company ease the visa process?

* What are some good resources that I can begin to study before I graduate in a year?

* Would pursuing a Master's degree in a different country help me getting a job / work visa in that country during / after I have finished?

* What are some good websites to find jobs / internships in Nordic countries?"

I recently (May 2012) graduated from a state school in Texas with a B.S. in computer science. Literally the day after graduation I was called up by a friend who desperately needed techs for a large EMR rollout at a local hospital. I took the job and worked from May to January on this project, quickly being given the responsibility of ""managing"" a small group of guys for hardware/software setup and deployment. My pay started at $12/hr then bumped up to $14 after 2 months. I stayed with this contracting company and in January the systems admin for a contract they hold at a doctors office quit. They desperately needed an admin to fill the spot, they sent me to interview with the Dr.s office and the next day I was onsite as the admin, thrown to the wolves. I've had to learn on the fly and taken on waaay more responsibility (obviously).

The Dr.s office has two locations, 14 doctors, ~100 users, 8 windows servers, one of which is their mission critical EMR SQL database. I'm in charge of being sure all things network, server, client related works. Server updates, db updates, backups, email, new users, blah blah, your typical admin. I also commute 1hr each way for this job now.

So the kicker: I was given a raise to $15/hr to take this job. This seems pretty low to me? I'm in East Texas, Tyler area. 

The doctors office LOVES me (they hated the old admin, he sat on projects and was ""lazy"") I work my ass off at this place and feel underpaid. Am I wrong to think this? I've been here 3+ months, too soon for raise discussions?

I've desperately looked for programming jobs closer to home (Tyler, TX), but they are few and far between, plus I made the mistake of gaining no practical programming experience (internship) while in college. I'm currently working on small personal programming projects to boost my resume...

Sorry for the long winded post, what do r/sysadmin?

EDIT: In my 3 months here I've tackled 3 major projects that the old admin neglected: 
1. Setup and installed a guest wireless network, isolated from work network using VLANs. Old admin couldn't figure this out I was told.
2. Removed old 3Com networking equipment and replaced with new HP equipment.
3. Installed completely new phone system (setup voice VLANs and QoS)"

They have acquired all of the hardware needed to do it, I believe theyre taking some old pentium machines and making them into the first dumb terminals and also did get some actual terminal devices ordered as well for a different lab. 

What I want to do is be involved with this project.  I want to be one of these interns helping with the transition.  I fully understand I wont be working right on the Cysco servers they bought for this, Ill be running cables half the time doing menial grunt work.  I dont care I want to be involved on an IT project.  Im 25, this is my second time being in school and this is the first real oppurtunity I have to do anything IT related thats not classwork.  I just really want to get some relevant experience.  I know Ive made good with half the teachers in this department and Ive already solicited their approval to use them for a reference.  Im going to be speaking to the Dept head later today who would ultimately be who says yes or no for me or at least considers me in the pool of people asking about this.


So with all of this being said can I be pointed in the right direction to maybe a blog, or essay on virtualization?  I havent taken any classes related to it yet, I do understand most of how is works due to casually learning about Citrix and lurking here long enough to listen to plenty of people here bitch about it and discuss it in general.  But I want to bone up on this, particularly for the Cysco part and just have enough info to talk the talk and convince them to give me chance and let me get some relevant experience being involved in a project like this.

I'm trying to scout out a subletter for my room from early/mid-May to mid-July.  Move-in date could probably be flexible (and pro-rated), but I have finals until the 9th so I need a few days to get my shit together.  Then I'm moving to Baltimore for the summer for an internship, so I'll definitely be out by the end of that weekend.

Two of my roommates will also be looking for subletters so if you want to come as a group, that'd be cool too.

A little about the house:

It's old and has tons of charm, at Diamond and Gratz! It's three stories and a full basement with a ton of storage. Full laundry room, free (not coin operated) use of washer, dryer, and utility sink and a little back yard with a grill. Other roommates that aren't subletting are 2 ladies, but we've lived with dudes before so it wouldn't particularly matter.

Room will be unfurnished, but has three awesome closets including one walk-in. I can leave a bookshelf or two if you need them. It is the biggest room in the house located on the 3rd floor and will fit even up to a King sized bed. You'd be sharing the abnormally spacious bathroom with one other (very considerate) person.  If you're a guy and prefer not to share a bathroom with a girl we can work that out- there are two bathrooms on the 2nd floor so we can switch it up.

Rent is $480/month plus utilities (maybe around $60-70). Rent (and utilities) would be prorated for May and July-- rent being roughly $240 each for May and July and utilities dependent on the bill. I would prefer a security deposit of $240 but wouldn't cash that check unless there was a problem.

I can get you some pictures if you want to see it, or feel free to come by for a visit and check it out.  And let me know if you have any questions at all or want to figure out move-in dates."

The employment history I have is full of your run-of-the-mill retail/sales positions. The only positive I can imagine is that I have been top sales a few different times between my jobs. I was fired from my first job when I was a 16 for refusing to complete a task. I know my resume will look terrible with all these holes in my schooling and employment. However, I am determined to climb out of this hole that I have dug myself into and strive to make it in Finance/Accounting. 
   Even though I have no true idea of the steps I am supposed to take from here, I have been diligently researching away. I have come up with options that I would love feedback on. I would also greatly appreciate to hear any additional ideas you may have. The time for sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself is over. As I read from a business article a Reddit posted last night, I must, ""Own my mistake and move on."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options that I have thought of: [For breaking into Finance and making myself, as a whole, more employable]**
   
   1) Join Linked-In and begin networking! I hear this is a great tool. I wish I had learned about this sooner. My girlfriend has a great finance job at a Fortune 500, so I assume that will be an invaluable contact.

   2) Sign up for FAFSA. If my grades at the end of my sophomore year are sufficient, my father has agreed to cover any additional cost after that.

   3) Start working toward a CB from AIPB.org to make myself more marketable in the finance world. Hopefully it will help me land a job in the finance industry to gain much needed experience. 

   4) Apply for paid/unpaid internships. This, I believe, will give me decent experience in the industry while also making my past mistakes seem less relevant. If I am not able to be given an internship while out of school, I am willing to pay for a college course right now so I could start interning sooner. Also, it would be an option to wait until my FAFSA application goes through and start interning when I am fully enrolled.

   5) Seek professional help to clean up my resume and find suggestions of more helpful things to add.

   6) Find suitable references and/or get in contact with old ones. I wish I realized sooner the importance of keeping work relationships even after employment has ended

   7) Grab all the certifications I can. I hear they are a joke, but at the same time look decent on a resume. It will not put me on par with the candidates with flawless records, however, I could use any help I can get at this point.
   
   8) Perfect my skills in Excel, and start learning similar applications that are used in the industry.

   9) Clean up my Facebook, as well as delete old social media profiles, to promote a better image of myself

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

I would be very grateful if you could contribute any ideas or expound on the ones I have already mentioned.

Have an awesome day everyone! Thanks!!!"

[Cost scaling isn’t linear, but making it nine times larger seems likely to make it cost at least five times as much and take at least twice as long, which looks harmful to getting to the goal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t61v?context=5)|The tube-capsule had some serious issues. First of all the parachutes had to be placed aft, divided in several chambers always being a huge risk for entanglement during deployment. Also, we really wanted to have the kind of safety system which is provided by the LES. There are other reasons as well, but those were the main causes for the change.  There is no doubt that we could reach our goal much faster if we kept the old design, but we felt it was the right way to go, even though it might end up costing us 10+ years. Keep in mind we love the R&amp;D in this as much (or even more) than the final flight. So, we dont mind adding year to this phase... Thanks for being an inspiration to us!
[When will you dock with ISS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qh99?context=5)|If we cant get the reentry systems to work we might just dock to ISS and claim our right to be saved by other nations by the UN Outer Space Treaty..
[That's... hopefully a joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s1ro?context=5)|Yes... but hey.. it might work.. still a joke..
[1\) What kind of grassroots support have you gotten from locals in Denmark and neighboring parts of Europe?  2\) I will likely be visiting friends in Berlin in a few months. If I can, I'd like to make a short visit to Copenhagen and write an article for my blog and repost it on some space non-profit sites here in the US. Would that be possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rnkq?context=5)|1) In Denmark we have a support group called Copenhagen Suborbitals Support. It has about 800 members all paying app 20 euros/month. This is fantastic. They also help out with a lot of technical stuff like live streaming. Besides that there a lot of private people donating in Denmark and around the world in general. I think app 4000 people have donated so far. 2)If you email me I am sure we can find a date for this!
[Aside from money money money, what can we (your fans and admirers\) do to help you achieve your goals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qln7?context=5)|Thanks for being a fan, I you are.. Biggest help is to spread the word. Next best thing is to donate if possible. But the mental support is the most important.. I also believe that if we have enough ""fans"" no one can stop this project, even if it becomes mixed up in future legal issue :)
[Do you have any kind of rough estimate as to how much it would cost me to go? Also, is the goal suborbital only, or further distances planned depending on interest/success? Edit. I've been up too long..forgot to say thanks for the thread. So thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85pyfl?context=5)|This is a non profit mission. Launching ourselves into space. Not paying tourist. This way we get around most legal issues. Suborbital missions is a good sound way to start. Its like crawling before you walk. When we succeed doing this we may go to orbital.. 
[It took the US ten years from launching a monkey to returning it alive. How do you motivate yourself (and others\) for what looks like an extremely long-term project? To be more specific: Most entrepreneurs achieve their goals through a healthy dose of reality distortion in the form of unrealistic optimism, which might not be optimal if you are trying to safely launch a human being into space. How do you manage your (and the public's\) expectations about the likelihood of success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r8z1?context=5)|We might spend 15 years for a 15 minutes ride. But the ride itself is not as important as the actual work on a daily basis. The development time is fantastic and I feel lucky that I am doing something which is learning me new stuff everyday. Its a very special feeling and the reward you get. Also, I believe you must give yourself a very very difficult task to solve. By doing so you are forced to learn and forced to go new places as a person, a group or a society. If you do something easy you dont learn anything and the result is not really interesting because you didnt learn anything new. Rememeber.. the more people who believes it cannot be done or it is crazy, the better. Because it tells you that you are working something new which might change the world a little bit...
[Thanks for doing this! In the future, would you like to see other people and groups try to emulate what you're doing? Could DIY spaceflight become a 'normal' thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qdyo?context=5)|I really hope so.. If there should be some kind of ""legacy"" from our work I would like it to be a change in perspective on how we see human spaceflight. Not only for big companies and governments..
[Open source manual: introduction to space travel for beginners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qmcs?context=5)|I hope.. We try to show as much info as possible.. My blog ""rocketshop"" on wired.. our webpage www.copenhagensuborbitals.com etc.. if you dig, you probably find the info you are looking for on how to do this..
[What drove you to want to do this?  Is this something that you've wanted to do for a long time?  Do you have a explicit interest in astrophysics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qizo?context=5)|I love space. I love going from idea to sketch to building machines and hardware. I met the right person (my co-founder) Peter Madsen who also wanted to do this project so it made sense to do this.  I love science in general. Math, physics etc. I demand to give myself difficult challenges everyday and this project is perfect that way..
[Peter Madsen is an amazing guy. So inspirational and passionate about what he does. Talking rockets with him in Amsterdam over beers was my highlight of last year. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rxbb?context=5)|I know. Yes, Peter is a fantastic co-partner in this project!!
[Besides solving the issue with the capsule door, are there any benefits to having the seat in the capsule upright? From my very limited knowledge of space capsules, I believe that most capsules have the passenger lying on their back to help prevent blood draining into the lower body. Even though this can be avoided using a pressure suit, do you have any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qou1?context=5)|You follow the project I can tell :) There are alot of things working better with an upright seat. Regarding acceleration (g-loads) you have to look at the numbers. We will max have 10g running the LES engine, during a failed launch, or during splashdown. Its not a problem in this kind of seat in these short time frames.. I refer to the NASA MSIS manual (google)
[Who do you think with be the first to Mars? A Government or Private company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qv7t?context=5)|I have no doubt that SpaceX will set foot on Mars. It is one of their plans and these guys rock! I am a big fan and they mean business. But you never know if the chinese suddenly go bananas and leave for mars soon..
[The Chinese will not be leaving for Mars anytime soon*, feel free to go for the gold.  ^* ^they've ^done ^the ^whole ^manned ^spaceflight ^thing ^which ^quite ^unsubtly ^screams ^""our ^ICBMs ^are ^the ^real ^deal"", ^no ^need ^for ^them ^to ^blow ^their ^budgets ^on ^a ^Mars ^Shot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c861gou?context=5)|We will leave that to spaceX then.. :)
[Sorry for being late to the party but I've still got a handful of questions if you've got the time to deal with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86bd28?context=5)|I dont think we would ever test orbital flights with animals. There is no point in doing so. When Iran launched a monkey it was a political statement saying that they can keep a complex being alive in space but it doesnt make sense related to science. The very early flights with animals such as dogs and monkey, in the 60ies, made sense because we had no understanding of survival in space. Now we know so much more.
[You've hinted before that you'd like to go orbital, one day.  This is what's kept me extremely interested in the future prospects of your group.  Clearly we are speaking of a far off time, but what would you say needs to happen first for this to be possible?  Would you consider X amount of suborbital flights to be a requirement before moving ahead?  Would you eventually test your orbital craft with live animals or would a live human suffice?  Would funding present an insurmountable obstacle for designing a booster large enough and for the SM/coms/nav?  Do you expect difficulties from governments beginning to take too much interest at this point?  Any ideas for a heatshield?  Cork?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86bd28?context=5)|As stated earlier you never know if CS decides to go from sub- to orbital once suborbital missions have been accomplished. That leap will make sense but I truly believe it will take another 5-10+ years.  I dont think there will be much change in government involvement if we go orbital. If we get into trouble on these matters it will happen already in the suborbital phase. Some people tell me that this project will be stopped when we show a real capability of going 100+ km. But I dont. Lets try and see what happens :)
[Hi there. I run a website (shameless plug for everyone else: www.astronomyaggregator.com \) and I've asked a couple of questions of you in the past when it comes to the whole CS project via twitter.  Theres a bunch of questions that I'd love to ask you about the TM65 engine and your plans for the next generation engine, since I run the site as a hobby while my day job is a mechanical engineering student.  Is there any chance I can publish those answers on my site as an article? Do you folks have an exclusivity agreement with Wired?  If so I'll just ask here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85scl0?context=5)|I know your site and we have spoken before..thanks for the support. As you can see on our website we write ""absolutely no rights reserved"". It is just me bloggin on wired. Everything else on our CS-site, here or if we talk can be used with not strings attached..
[I am a big fan of the program but one thing that I wonder about with ""open source rocketing"" is if you ever worry that your work could be misused by people/groups to build their own missiles?  Is there some risk that your work could indirectly contribute to weapons promolgation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85tee6?context=5)|Perhaps. But just as well as we find most of our information on the internet everyone else can do just that as well. The open source aspect of this project is much more about the actual process and how we think. 
[When this project is done and you have successfully launched and landed Peter... Then what? I heard you planned building a blimp, but isn't that a little lame compared to rocketry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85raj1?context=5)|I might fly go on a high-apogee suborbital mission. We might go orbital or we just go do something else.. its difficult to say. One thing is for sure... it will be hard to find another project topping this one..
[How do you go about launching one of the most powerful non milatary rockets? surely there are many laws against doing this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s4e1?context=5)|Well. Its all politics. We happen to live in a country (Denmark) which has no beef with anyone. If we did this in Irak or whatever, we might see sanctions like the ones for Iran or North Korea. Also, we are launching at sea because we discovered that the law of the any country stops 12 nautical mile from the coast. Then you enter advisory space and basically the wild west for rocket guys..
[Shouldn't you rather keep the *keys* private instead of the crypto code itself? As a computer science guy security by obscurity makes me shudder..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t3em?context=5)|Yes.. the key. You see why this part of the project is not in my hands. Luckily all of us..
[I don't know of any danish laws preventing you from publishing it. A car can be used to kill people, yet it is not illegal to publish instructions on how to build a car...just to make a stupid analogy :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r3wd?context=5)|If you give detailed info on both how to build a rocket and turn it into a missile with easy downloaded software you might end up with trouble if someone ""bad"" uses it.. Someone will always bend the politics this way.
[Have you and Peter Madsen already decided who will be the first to go up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qu8q?context=5)|Yes. we have found a perfect arrangement starting with Peter and then we see how its goes.. :)
[Every project needs spokespeople. The two main news channels I am aware of are your blog and Peter's. Do you have any arrangements within CS regarding who is allowed to speak on behalf of CS? How much ""I"" is there in the ""we""? Does everyone speak for him-/herself? If yes, are you afraid of confusing people by too much cross-talk? Keep up the good work! Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t825?context=5)|I guess Peter and I are the official spokes-guys for this project. We must always be in tune with aligned vectors. So, you will normally hear about the same approach or mission layout from the both of us. But then again, the two blogs are also personal blogs and it might present crazy ideas or thoughts which are not official CS ideas. Yes, very confusing.  But, you can always trust our website. Thats is the final word...
[Do you enjoy crossdressing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85sgja?context=5)|I guess you read my twitter post :)  hey, who doesnt. I was young and needed the money..
[What's the most desperate thing you'd do for money these days?  (not a private offer :D\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85st4a?context=5)|Personally I dont care about money. They are a tool just like anything else to achieve a goal. Since I have managed so far I never think about this. Id rather starve doing this project than being forced to do some kind of crappy job.. Do you have a non-private offer? :)
[Can we start to herald that the first(official\) crossdresser in space will be danish? :\)  Secondly, what size of donation for CS would be required for you to wear a dress for your first launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t416?context=5)|Im pretty sure I will be removed (officially) from the team.
[When I go to Copenhagen next year (spring 2014\) could I get a tour around the facilities?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r0b0?context=5)|Yes.. email me.. 
[In this case: would you offer tours of your facility to corporate clients (not in the space sector!\) in return for a small fee? Would that be a viable way to generate finances for the project, or would it interfere too much with your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rb89?context=5)|Thats actually something we do to finance the project and it is always fun to have people at the facility debating our technology. So, please let me know and we will find the time for you guys..
[I realise that engine related questions may be better asked to Peter Madsen but can you share more details about the fate of the TM65 new years test? From what I saw on the livestream the engine cooling failed (or you had a massive fuel leak in the chamber\) but besides that I have not found any solid detail about what happened, why it happened and what the future plans for the TM65 might be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r3kv?context=5)|The TM65 engine is a double hull structure running alcohol inside for cooling. This process went wrong and actually created a pressure inside the structure which made it collapse. This specific TM65 engine will not be fired again but a new one for the HEAT2X rocket is already being developed..
[How high to you have to be to call it suboribtal?  Seems to me that even skydiving is a suborbital flight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85vbr4?context=5)|The general definition for a suborbital space flight is a parabola jump above the karman line which is 100+ km. Not much skydiving going on there (I hope). If you dont have enough velocity to remain in orbit you call it suborbit.
[I am always intrigued by the concept of cost-effective spaceflight. Can I ask what enables you to achieve spaceflight so cheaply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rokm?context=5)|There are many factors. First, no one gets paid but that doesnt do it. We only use off the shelf product like normal water valves etc and we do not try to optimize the machines using titanium etc. Just plain iron or aluminum. As long as the engine is powerful enough why bother. Remember that the last 5% optimization will make the development cost explode. If you look at www.copenhagensuborbitals.com and check out the Vice video you may see how we do it. Also, if you follow my wired blog [Link to www.wired.com](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/rocketsho) or the work at [Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/KvonBengtso) you will soon see how :)
[By DIY, do you mean a product with assembly required that a consumer could launch themselves into space with? If so, it would seem as though there would be a lot of liability involved. What would be the price point for such a product. Would it be only available to big buyers like corporations and governments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rp8s?context=5)|No. its not like an IKEA furniture :) DIY just refers to the fact that we are building the rocket ourselves. No one can buy one for home assembly exactly for the reason you mention. We do not want to mix third parties into the mission because you will be stuck in legal issues just like Virgin Galactic and other commercial product.  If we build and fly our own space rocket there are no demands for requirements in any law books. Only making sure that no one else is harmed. We work in a legal vacuum.. 
[What are your goals in this space program? Are you planning on merely orbiting, or do you have more longterm goals such as reaching the moon or other large bodies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s1sr?context=5)|For now its just a suborbital mission to 100+ km. Above the karman line. What will happen next is unknown. We do believe that a suborbital mission on a shoe string is difficult enough :)
[I'm looking into doing something involving space (building rockets, working at NASA, etc.\) as a job because space is awesome and I want to go there. Your diy spacecraft is amazingly inspiring!  How did you get into doing this? What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Anyway, keep being awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c860j5m?context=5)|If you want a space job you must go the traditional way getting the traditional degrees. I did that as well and got two masters degrees ending up working for NASA. But its wasn't until I learned to weld I was able to actually do something about it. Be your own master is the way to go unless you just want that job?
 |Theory is useless until put into practice...
[Do you plan on taking a miniature computer (raspberry PI for example\) and having it float down from space with you? (So it can take live-footage\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rh2r?context=5)|We have actually talked about deploying some kind of small satellite doing this. But we do have a lot of internals and externals cameras on the capsule and rocket sending live feed to mission control and the rest of the world. We always broadcast our flights to the internet, live.
[I know you guys are working on this full time and unpaid. How do you make  ends meet at home?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qudc?context=5)|From doing lecture and speeches. You dont get rich doing this but thats not the point, so thats OK. But we have managed to get by with the speeches. I also receive art grants from various foundations once in a while...
[What major political red tape do you have to get through to get your propellants/launch waivers/etc?  What are your biggest technological gaps right now?  How much help do you get from people outside of your project compared to how much research/testing you do on your own? Do people gives you tips on how to do things differently after you live stream tests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c864ke4?context=5)|The propellant is primarily alcohol and LOX and doesnt require any legal treatment. We have fixed the launch issues by doing sea launch. I would say that active guidance for rockets are one of the major gaps right now. We will eventually master this technology but it will take a while:) But also issues like capsule hatch and certain radio technologies are tough areas. We dont really get any help from the outside except when we are asking for ideas/solutions and people are sending those to us. Almost all research and testing are done inside Copenhagen Suborbitals. If someone comes to us with a certain set of skills we add that person to the project. In-house R/D are the fastest and best way to do it..
[Will the potential pilot have a few moments to unbuckle and float around in the capsule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rarv?context=5)|Hello my friend :) Perhaps. There will be app 3-5 minutes of microgravity so why not?
[How will the suborbital food be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qeag?context=5)|If you can keep it in your stomach I guess... good? Its a 15 minutes ride. You dont really need any food.
[No blankets either?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qhig?context=5)|Maybe one.. to keep you warm when you are in shock after splashdown..
[Might you guys consider accepting unpaid interns at some point? I'm a U.S. college student (majoring in math\), but there's nothing i'd rather do than help you guys for part of a summer. Anyway, love the work you've done so far, and can't wait to see what you'll accomplish in the near future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85tsl1?context=5)|We did have interns. Danish, French and New Zealand. We get many mails about this but its not always the ""right stuff"". It is important to have production skills as well like milling, welding etc. You may have this.? 
[Bummer, Unfortunately I don't.

I always try to encourage people to learn the skills to go from idea to product. Great ideas and brilliant minds alone, doesn't get you into space :) I guess 90% of our time is spend bending and welding metal which apparently comes as a surprise to many people..  happy welding my friend.
[What's your estimate for the probability of launch failure (and death/serious injury\)? What's an acceptable probability to the team/astronauts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c8643ib?context=5)|I have assembled possible scenarios here [Link to www.wired.com](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/10/top-10-most-horrible-deaths-in-a-diy-space-project) We believe that we can reach the same probability as the shuttle program (app 1/60). But lets see. Its a grey zone and will be difficult to estimate.

I'm a straight male, but I have to admit...I got a little tingly when I saw your name.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s9gz?context=5)|Haha.. I am happily married so I dont use my name for reproduction but perhaps a beer or a donation..
[Hey, big fan from Canada here. Why did you decide to use liquid fuel, or hybrid fuel as opposed to straight solid? It seems like a solid fuel booster would be a simpler design. But what do I know, im not the rocket scientist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86dlli?context=5)|Solid propellant is one of the few components that will require special permission. Liquids are just liquids.  Working solid propellant are dangerous and very complex especially when you do large scale. Even the smallest cracks in the cast may make the booster explode. The casting process have to be done in vacuum and we dont have the capabilities to do such large scale casting at our facility.  Also remember, a solid booster cannot be turned OFF when started..
[Ah, I see. I had no idea they had to be cast in a vacuum! Thanks for responding, best of luck to you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86xwk6?context=5)|Vacuum casting does not have to be difficult. We do it all the time. But large scale!!... 
[Haha large scale is always the issue! Is this rocket going to be a single stage, or two stage design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c87nvx2?context=5)|For the suborbital flight we plan using a single stage...

I would love to have such volunteering work for this project... How to proceed?
[I think the biggest issue would be software licensing, unless you are on open source software like OpenFOAM.  what do you guys use for meshing and solving? Also for CAD?

[Isn't a large portion of the cost of getting into space the fuel? How are you planning on getting around that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86f8dd?context=5)|No. We are using LOX and alcohol. LOX is a sponsored product by AirLiquide but is actually fairly cheap if we had to buy it. Alcohol is not expensive either.  When we will be launching a 1.6 meter diameter booster it will be expensive (alcohol), but in general propellant is not the main expense in this project.

They also walked through the process of getting a PE License and again stressed how important it is to get.

Is getting a PE license in the electronics/hardware side of our field needed?"

I am currently completing 2nd year of a 3 year Bachelor of Information Technology course, majoring in Computer Science and Games Development.   
In the course we have focused on C++, and C# coding wise, Computer networking, maths and physics, and Operating systems.  
First year also touched on HTML5 with CSS, and SQL.  
I'm at the point where I really want to consider my work options. Because I was adult entry when I started (I am now 25), I don't want to waste time, and I want to go straight from completing the course to finding a job. When I say a job, I would look for any relevant programming role. I would also love to work on A.I. although that is something that might be way down the line.  
  
Outside of uni, I have no idea how the I.T industry works. What would be relevant job prospects for a recent graduate, who has no prior experience in the industry?  
What would be the best thing I could do at this point to strengthen my job prospects?  
I also am based in Australia, where I hear the I.T industry is not as strong.  
I've read a few other posts here, and seem to see alot of advice saying to network and look for internships. The thing is, I have kept to myself, I've gotten good grades, but I haven't really spoken to many other students/professors. So at this point I am half worried as well.  
Internship wise I'm not even sure where to look.  

I can see that if I continue down this path, even if I complete uni with good grades, I might be stuck because I didn't network.  

Any help is greatly appreciated.

1clphm,1,2013-04-18,"I am 23 years old, and I am lost. I could use some advice about breaking into Finance.",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1clphm/i_am_23_years_old_and_i_am_lost_i_could_use_some/,"**A bit about me**
   I am going to be honest right from the beginning. I have made some bad decisions earlier in my life and have pretty much pissed everything away. Currently, I am 23 years old with only one semester completed in college. I am not currently enrolled, but am striving on getting back in this summer or the upcoming year. I have some major gaps in my employment history from either working under the table at a different company for more pay, which was a mistake, and nursing my sick mother. The employment history I have is full of your run-of-the-mill retail/sales positions. The only positive I can imagine is that I have been top sales a few different times between my jobs. I was fired from my first job when I was a 16 for refusing to complete a task. I know my resume will look terrible with all these holes in my schooling and employment. However, I am determined to climb out of this hole that I have dug myself into and strive to make it in Finance/Accounting. 
   Even though I have no true idea of the steps I am supposed to take from here, I have been diligently researching away. I have come up with options that I would love feedback on. I would also greatly appreciate to hear any additional ideas you may have. The time for sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself is over. As I read from a business article a Reddit posted last night, I must, ""Own my mistake and move on."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options that I have thought of: [For breaking into Finance and making myself, as a whole, more employable]**
   
   1) Join Linked-In and begin networking! I hear this is a great tool. I wish I had learned about this sooner. My girlfriend has a great finance job at a Fortune 500, so I assume that will be an invaluable contact.

   2) Sign up for FAFSA. If my grades at the end of my sophomore year are sufficient, my father has agreed to cover any additional cost after that.

   3) Start working toward a CB from AIPB.org to make myself more marketable in the finance world. Hopefully it will help me land a job in the finance industry to gain much needed experience. 

   4) Apply for paid/unpaid internships. This, I believe, will give me decent experience in the industry while also making my past mistakes seem less relevant. If I am not able to be given an internship while out of school, I am willing to pay for a college course right now so I could start interning sooner. Also, it would be an option to wait until my FAFSA application goes through and start interning when I am fully enrolled.

   5) Seek professional help to clean up my resume and find suggestions of more helpful things to add.

   6) Find suitable references and/or get in contact with old ones. I wish I realized sooner the importance of keeping work relationships even after employment has ended

   7) Grab all the certifications I can. I hear they are a joke, but at the same time look decent on a resume. It will not put me on par with the candidates with flawless records, however, I could use any help I can get at this point.
   
   8) Perfect my skills in Excel, and start learning similar applications that are used in the industry.

   9) Clean up my Facebook, as well as delete old social media profiles, to promote a better image of myself

   I would be very grateful if you could contribute any ideas or expound on the ones I have already mentioned. I am very happy to have a source like Reddit to bounce ideas off of my peers. A handful of these came from advice given to other Redditors. I would like to thank everyone that is constantly participating on this Sub Reddit and supplying it with incredibly helpful feedback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Half-way through writing this post, I paused for a decent amount of time to create a Linked In profile. It hasn't been perfected yet, but I am happy with it for now. Since I have no finance experience I have listed myself as a Sales/Customer Service Rep. I am a bit hesitant to add my work history at the moment until I receive a little feedback. I would rather not shoot myself in the foot right off the bat!

If anyone is looking for more connections on LinkedIn, feel free to add me. I literally just started mine and could use more connections! 

Here is [My LinkedIn Profile!](http://linkedin.com/in/frankroemisch) 

Thanks Reddit! Have an awesome day!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Also if anyone knows any work in Finance, Accounting, or a similar field, please let me know! I will list my skills and such here. I have many more, however, I am only going to list the skills that could somehow relate to a finance position. Would prefer Chicago area, but will relocate or telecommute for the right fit!

**MY SKILLS:**

1)Customer Service

   *Great at diffusing hostile situations.

   *Actually listens to a customers wants and needs.

   *Smiles are contagious, that's why I always have a positive attitude.    

2)Sales

   *Can up sell and tack on accessories at an above average rate

   *Have always met or surpassed sales goals.

   *Knowledgeable about products offered.

   *Frequently looks to help coworkers so we can meet our departments goals.

3)Type at 50 WPM

4)Very familiar with telecommunications sales

5)Familiar with the entire Microsoft Office Suite

**Weakness:** 
   I am not as confident at outside sales jobs (Eg. cold calling) as I would like to be. It is something I am gradually working on. I am reading some public speaking articles in my spare time so that hopefully I can soon turn this into a strength.

**Strengths:**
   I have always had a knack for making others happy. It is something that has really defined me in every job I have had. Fortunately, that goes hand in hand with Sales, my other tremendous strength. With those two advantages, I am able to become an asset on any team.

(Resume is available upon request, pm me for serious opportunities.)

Who I am
According to my job title, I am an Integration Analyst for a $7B, Fortune 500 company.  I specialize in business rules analysis, implementation planning, task prioritization and delegation, collaboration and task resolution between cross-functional teams, and translation of technical details and specifications to non-technical audiences.

What I’ve done
I’ve been with my company for the last 8 years, but previous leadership roles include:
General Manager - Extended-stay-style hotel (part of a major chain)
Chairman - Student Activities Organization (university)

What I do currently
o	Discovery meetings and analysis to determine business customers’ needs and objectives
o	Configure a proprietary ecommerce application for business customers—according to their purchasing policies
	This includes:
	- Establishing customer’s account structure
	- Establishing customer’s user permissions and access levels
	- Implementing controls to eliminate rogue spending and drive program 	compliance
o	Pre-implementation demo and training end users on how to use our web application
o	Post-implementation application troubleshooting, configuration updating and account support

What I’d rather be doing
My experience has been limiting when compared to my abilities.  I’m far more creative than my technical background implies.
I’m looking for an opportunity to use this creativity and be challenged.  I would like to work with a collaborative team, sharing ideas and brainstorming, analyzing and devising best approaches/best practices, innovating existing practices to be more creative, effective, and agile.  I have an intrinsic artifice for incorporating mainstream ideas and modern interest to refresh and update a legacy product/service/system.



The rules
I will:
o	Work for free
o	Work evenings and/or weekends (if this is an unpaid opportunity)
o	Meet with you in person to ensure we are a good professional match for one another
o	Give my absolute best and excel at my assignment (My day job pays the bills, I’m not hinging this on compensation.  I want to learn something new and feel the gratification of achievement again.)

You will:
o	Not waste my time with silly, offensive, or illegal offers/tasks
o	Provide a clear directive and end goal
o	Share this posting with your good friend who is a recruiter/headhunter
o	Share this posting with your good friend who is a hiring manager that has a paid position available and suitable to someone with my skill set

Please describe
o	The nature of the role or responsibilities you need filled
o	Yourself, your experience, and your relation to the role/responsibilities (will you be a supervisor, team member, sponsor, customer, etc. to the role I may be filling)
o	Your company, your company’s product/service offering


Why am I doing this?
o	Because I work remotely (in LA) for my Illinois-based company and out of sight really does mean out of mind.  I have had no advancement or learning opportunities with my company and I don’t want to grow cobwebs on my brain.
o	Because when I searched for internships, the majority of them required candidates to be enrolled students (I have already completed my degree…many years ago).
o	Because when I searched for “adult internships in Los Angeles” the search results were dominated by adult industry…(we’ll call them “opportunities”)...results in LA.
o	Because HR recruiters and talent acquisition professionals simply don’t reply to my job applications.
o	Because what I lack in experience has been exclusively due to a lack of opportunity, not potential or ability.  I think that’s worth stating.
o	Because I cannot honestly say that I’ve tried everything to get a better job…maybe until now.

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses and operating, funded startups (yes, I will work for free, but only for established companies)
Large corporations with paid management positions available (yes, I will quit my day job, but only if you offer me a better one)

1cl1wj,4,2013-04-17,Ridiculously Honest Job Seeker Craigslist Ad,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1cl1wj/ridiculously_honest_job_seeker_craigslist_ad/,"Full ad here -- http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/bus/3750468911.html

Snippet below:

The rules
I will:
o	Work for free
o	Work evenings and/or weekends (if this is an unpaid opportunity)
o	Meet with you in person to ensure we are a good professional match for one another
o	Give my absolute best and excel at my assignment (My day job pays the bills, I’m not hinging this on compensation.  I want to learn something new and feel the gratification of achievement again.)

You will:
o	Not waste my time with silly, offensive, or illegal offers/tasks
o	Provide a clear directive and end goal
o	Share this posting with your good friend who is a recruiter/headhunter
o	Share this posting with your good friend who is a hiring manager that has a paid position available and suitable to someone with my skill set

Why am I doing this?
o	Because I work remotely (in LA) for my Illinois-based company and out of sight really does mean out of mind.  I have had no advancement or learning opportunities with my company and I don’t want to grow cobwebs on my brain.
o	Because when I searched for internships, the majority of them required candidates to be enrolled students (I have already completed my degree…many years ago).
o	Because when I searched for “adult internships in Los Angeles” the search results were dominated by adult industry…(we’ll call them “opportunities”)...results in LA.
o	Because HR recruiters and talent acquisition professionals simply don’t reply to my job applications.
o	Because what I lack in experience has been exclusively due to a lack of opportunity, not potential or ability.  I think that’s worth stating.
o	Because I cannot honestly say that I’ve tried everything to get a better job…maybe until now.

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses and operating, funded startups (yes, I will work for free, but only for established companies)
Large corporations with paid management positions available (yes, I will quit my day job, but only if you offer me a better one)

I will at least give you the courtesy and respect of a reply if you do respond to this ad (with a serious opportunity).  I guess because of that I wouldn’t make a very effective recruiter.

1ckzxj,3,2013-04-17,I'm unsure of what jobs to apply for - I consider myself an amateur programmer.,Zaemz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ckzxj/im_unsure_of_what_jobs_to_apply_for_i_consider/,"http://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanlutterman

Take a look at my Linkedin profile and let me know what you think.

I've completed 76 credits of the Computer Science degree at University of Wisconsin Green Bay.  I'm going to be moving to Hillsboro, Oregon, which is just outside of Portland.

I'd like to find a software-related job, but don't know if I'll have any good prospects.

There are personality traits that I have that will work well for me, I'm enthusiastic, I really like people, and I'm honest, but those aren't hard skills.

Though I've been doing web programming for the past few months, I'm interested in more as well.  For the two years I was at UW Green Bay, the major language studied was Java, so I would say that I could answer very basic questions about the language.

I've only worked in a very small team, so I don't have any good experience using Git, Mercurial, or SVN in a group.  (I know I need to learn those things well.)

I know the OOP paradigm, and am familiar with, but do not know very well, programming methods like Agile and Waterfall.

I'm not currently enrolled in a program, and I think that's going to hurt me when it comes to looking for internships and work-experience type jobs, but I'm optimistic and I'm looking forward to the search.

If anyone can give me advice based on what I've laid out here, I'd greatly appreciate it.  I'm going to constantly be working on my skills and improving myself, as that's what a person dedicated to software needs to do, but is there anything I can apply for *now*?"

[Because you have personal experience dealing with it, what is your take on Nuclear Power?  Also: Love the picture of you and your dad...eery and beautiful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkmkm?context=5)|Actually, I am not against NP. If used smart, it is the cheapest and cleanest energy source...
[What is the government's plan for the Chernobyl area? Keep it as a wildlife preserve? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkpgo?context=5)|Well, they have to preserve it just because it is polluted for another thousands of years... so it is not for the sake of the wildlife, but for the sake of the living people.
[I've been looking around on a map. Is this the correct building?  Do you think you could draw a rough map of the floor you lived on? I've been trying to find interior layouts for a recreation of Pripyat in minecraft.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkkkh?context=5)|Yes, this is my house. I wouldn't be able to recreate the floor, since i didn't go to other flats... What is that with guys and Minecraft? I don't dig that game=)))
[Have you suffered from any illnesses related to the radiation, given the very young age at which you were exposed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmfdn?context=5)|Me not, but my dad died from the ilness related to the radiation. nevertheless, I dont know how did it influence me on a longer run...
[Was your fathers cancer somehow related to Chernobyl?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmudn?context=5)|I wouldnt speculate on that. he was a scientist and worked in Chernobyl all his life, going inside the sarcophagus and exposing himself to radiation. So it might not only be 1986 but the rest of his life too.
[Do you ascribe your father's death to having worked at the plant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fktqz?context=5)|Not only to that. He dedicated his whole life as a scientist to work in Chernobyl..
[Would you recommend anyone interested in Pripyat to visit as tourist? Any tips/suggestions on visiting Pripyat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9flghd?context=5)|Well, the whole Prypyat is interesting. now they actually prohibit to enter the buildings, but I guess people's private apartments is actually the most interesting part.
[Did you enter the city/area alone, is that even (legally\) possible? or as part of a tourist group?  Link to www.kiddofspeed.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9gz86s?context=5)|I went to Pripyat as a journalist with my own car, but was assigned a guide. Usually journalists can go for free, tourists have to pay and people, who were evacuated can go on certain days (like anniversary)
[Can it really be considered your home town if you moved away at age 1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fowqv?context=5)|It can be, since it formed who I am and where I am right now. Without what happened to us back then, I wont be the person I am now.
[Do you have any superpowers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9focpj?context=5)|X-ray vision=)
[Does there remain a significant amount of radiation in Pripyat?  Were you given information about Chernobyl/Pripyat in your upbringing?  If so what were you told and did you believe this information to be accurate for what had happened?  Was your father called in to aid with repair, for lack of a better work, the catastrophe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkilq?context=5)|My dad worked at another bloc of the reactor the night of the accident. he was an engineer and later on he found a Chernobyl Center for radioecology and environment protection, which did research in Chernobyl. They also worked with a lot of scientists from Japan, now after Fukushima we know why... there are some really radioactive spots in chernobyl area, while other are relatively not dangerous. basically, if you want to get a significat dose of radiation, which will somehow influence your health, you have to stand in a single spot without moving for like 2 weeks...
[Will pripyat ever be inhabitable in our lifetime? would you move back to rebuild the community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkwz1?context=5)|Pripyat will never be inhibited. For most, the territory is polluted for another thousands of years and buildings are already in a very bad state.
[How realistic is the Pripyat mission in Modern Warfare? That ferris wheel is burned into the minds of millions...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fs52l?context=5)|The Ferris wheel is there. It never operated, cuz they were going to open it on the 1st of May...
[If Wikipedia is right, it actually did operate, for a few hours on the 27 of April so that they could turn some of the attention away from the explosion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fvff8?context=5)|Not that i know of. According to mom mom, noone knew what happened, telephones were not working etc. People were not in panic or anything... And the info about the wheel working is only on the English version of wiki, the Russian and Ukrainian one mention, that it never operated, so did the guides tell me.
[I have a few questions about traveling in the area: - are the guides trustworthy? - is it moderately safe? - would it be safe for an American?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fqaw8?context=5)|The guides are assigned to you by the authorities. All toures are well-orginized and as far as I know, it is safe to go there and there is no difference whether you are American or else=)
[If there are guides assigned to you, how did you manage to pull off a nude self-portrait?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9frz1j?context=5)|I was in my apartment and I asked for 10 minutes to be alone...
[The evacuation was done in a hurry and many personal belongings were left behind.  Did you have time on your return visit to collect any possessions.  I suppose your old clothes don't fit now, but maybe some books or family photos, heirlooms,  etc?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmncx?context=5)|Actually, people were able to collect some of their belongings afterwards. I have all the films from my Prypyat apartment, as well as books. inside of the houses was pretty safe.
[Is it true there are wolves running wild through there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fksm8?context=5)|I havent seen any, but it is true that flora and fauna is very vivid. There are wolves and bears and wild bores...
[That's really cool man, I'm happy you weren't there for the catastrophe. Do you think there are people still living there? With this, do you believe some are mutated to some degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fqufu?context=5)|Mutation was very rare. Many people's health was influenced, but noone can say for sure for what extent.
 |I was there for the catastrophe, my whole family was. My dad was even working on the plant on the night of the accident. We were evacuated the next day after. There are some people who returned, they are all now over 70 and pretty much okay. Noone mutated, def not to the horror movie degree, this would be just scientific bullshit.
[Has there been evidence of mutation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fremm?context=5)|If you go to the Chernobyl museum in Kiev, they have couple of example of mutant animals there...
[Did your parents give you most of the detail? What did they tell you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fma1k?context=5)|Well, my dad worked there afterwards as well, so I knew pretty much everything. You can watch this movie by National Geographic ( Seconds from Disaster), which my father was a consultant to. I was there while they were filming too.
[I'm glad I visited this sub today. I normally don't but I'm glad I got to see this. The pictures are beautiful by the way. How does it feel to know that you lived through the largest nuclear disaster in recorded history?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fking?context=5)|I never thought of it until recently... I grew up with it and never thought it was something special...
[Were you granted special permission to go into only your apartment?  If anyone else comes as a tourist, they can only walk around outside and look in the windows? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9frxuw?context=5)|Well, some touristic guides allows people to walk around as they wish, but it is considered dangerous and prohibited. In 2011 I didnt have a problem entering any buildings, but in 2012 they were rather strict. Also, I went as a journalist, so not with a group.
[After the accident did you suffer any type of radiation poisoning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fr7tx?context=5)|I didn't. But many friends of my father, who worked that night did.. they also died.
[1\) Have you been encouraged to regularly seek out medical observation?  2\) Are you compensated by any governmental body in order to receive this observation/treatment no matter where you relocate in the world?  3\) Seeing as you were a baby when the catastrophe occurred, how would you describe your connection(s\) to Pripyat, returning after so many years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fr0hg?context=5)|1) I was encourage to do the observations, yes. I do those know once in a year in Germany too, but just for myself 2)I am compensated, but it is really nothing. I receive approx. 25$ a month. my mom though get's a discount on her apartment bills back in Ukraine 3) I didnt think about my connection to Pripyat for a long time. I didnt think it was something special, because I grew up with it and it was just a part of my history. But after my father died and after I moved abroad, I actually realize that my life changed drastically and everything I do know is a result of what happened back then. You can read this article I wrote 2 years ago, where I dexcribe my feelings . [Link to www.kyivpost.com](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/prypyat-memories-102707.html)
[Id love to read it.. except i have to apparently pay for it... no thanks.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fs3g2?context=5)|Really? it was free before... Here is the uneditet text from my computer On April 27th, 1986 I, aged 1 year and 3 months, was evacuated together with my mother from the town of Prypyat, USSR, population 49,400, average age of the inhabitants – 26 years old. Now, 25 years later and being 26 years old myself, I revisited the town of my early childhood. I would lie if I say that being a baby at the time of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident, I remember anything of Prypyat. I don’t remember anything, but coming back after all those years to a place, which literally changed my life was not easy. I came back not for the pictures of broken dolls or abandoned schools. I didn’t take photos of Soviet relics, which are so popular with amateur photographers and tourists from all over the world. Nevertheless, when we drove into the jungle, which once was the main street – named after Lenin of course, I was hit by a way of nostalgia – nostalgia for the things, which never happened to me here. Lenin street 17, apartment 24 – number 24 would chase me throughout life. All apartments in Prypyat was burglarised and it is hard to imagine life in these empty walls. Not only valuables, but also waterpipes, powersockets and floorcloth were stolen by crooks, who would then sell radioactive goods on fleamarkets to people, who wouldnt even know what are they buying. My flat was not an exception – only peaces of broken furniture, old wallpaper (horrible flower design, by the way), 2 kopiykas (which my father left for me to pick up one day) and an old picture on the floor.  The photo is of me and my mom in this very room 25 years ago. It was a favourite of my father, who was an amateur photographer – he even mentioned it on a roll of the negative, which I found afterwards in Kiev. This was a reason for him to leave it 10 years ago, hanging on the wall of what was once our living room– as a memory of happy times, which these abandoned walls once saw. It might sound cheesy, but for me, this symbolic gesture is very meaningful, since my father, Constantin Rudya, died 5 years ago. He dedicated his life to Chernobyl, working as a scientific director at an International Chernobyl Center. He spent a lot of time in Chernobyl, collaborating with scientists from Germany, France, USA and Japan. He was exposed to the radiation frequently, revisiting the sarcophagus of the 4th block on a regular basis. He died of cancer in Fabruary 2006  at the age of 47 and before that I never thought about Chernobyl as the most influential thing, which happened to my family.  I don’t want to say that my life after his death was full of grief and sorrow – on the contrary, loosing him pushed me to do things, which I would never be brave enough to do if he stayed alive. Studying abroad, becoming a photographer, taking any chance to travel – all of that I did with one thought – would he be proud of me and did I do enough to become as great as he was? Sometimes I even regret of not being talented in physics, since I could never follow his steps.  My father had a lot of Japanese friends, and I can only imagine, how supportive he would be of them due to the current events in Fukushima. In 1986 he was barely 28 and worked as an operator on the 2d block of the Chernobyl power Plant. He worked there also on the night of the accident and 1,5 years after the catastrophe.  I found old films from Prypyat dated 1983-1986 in my fathers archive – he and his co-workers and friends – playing tennis, having fun on the beach of the Prypyat river, celebrating someone’s birthday in the dormitory. Some of these people, including my dad, are no more alive and all is left of them are memories and these old photographs. We also visited Chornobyl once together – my father was consulting the National Geographic channel team from London while they were filming one of the programs on the Chornobyl catastrophe. We visited our flat that time too – when we were leaving, he left a fresh newspaper in the mailbox of the apartment number 24, our apartment. He said, that once we would come here together with my mom. But we never did. I still hope that once my mother will come here with me though. If she does come, she will find an old photograph of me and her, 2 kopecks and a photo of my dad, smiling, pinned to the wall. I left is there as a memory. Exclusion zone is revisited by many tourists and journalists every year. It became a place of attraction, some kind of extreme adventure. I try to imagine how it would be if the accident never happened (even though, according to the construction imperfection of the station itself, the accident was destined to happen sooner or later. This is why many stations of a similar design were stopped for awhile to remove the problem before it caused more trouble, all over the Soviet Union at that times, according to Alexey Breus, who was an operator on the 4th block of the plant and my fathers good friend). So I try to visualize supermarkets and casinos on the streets of Prypyat. Light banners and nightclubs. Agitation posters of political candidates. The city existed no more than 16 years before the accident (it was built specifically for the workers of what supposed to be the biggest Nuclear Power Plant in Europe). Now, being stuck in the 1980s it remains its Soviet self, trapped in the nature, which, unlike people, was not afraid of radiation. We are used to see pictures of Chernobyl and Prypyat, which recall some sort of a horror dream, with the post-apocalyptic hollows of the broken windows and frightening remains of the human presence in a form of left toys, old books and broken beds. But it is not the impression of the exclusion zone, which I have got. Silent and mysterious beauty of the surrounding landscape is overwhelming. Wild forest, full of animals, beautiful sky and a calm river, which flows silently through the territory, which wont change much in the next hundreds of years. And it is not the broken windows and abandoned buildings, which scared me, but the feeling of a great change, which happened in the lives of so many people. At least 49 400 Prypyat inhabitants I am aware of. My life is no soap opera and everything, which happened to me in the past, might not be as spectacular and heartbreaking as a Hollywood film production scenario. It is also hard to speculate about things, which happened in the past and which I can no more influence.  But coming to Prypyat after all these years made me review my life again and analyze things from a different perspective. I lived in Kiev since I was 2, went to Germany for the first time at the age of 9 with the Kids of Chornobyl exchange programme and learned the language probably because of that. I graduated from two universities and finally ended up back in Germany, this time following my dream.  I wonder what would happen if in 1986 nothing had gone wrong? Would I have gone to a kindergarten and then local school? Would I have kayaked with my dad on the river Uzh and Prypyat? Would I have my graduation ball in the Energetic restaurant and meet the dawn with a view of the Chornobyl Nuclear power plant? Would I have grown up a small town girl, met my first love here, got married and had 2 kids by the age of 26 with their grandfather still alive? I guess, I would never know.

[Does having 3 eyes give you an advantage compared to other photographers?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmfta?context=5)|No, but it gives an advantage compared to dumb  commentators=)

Has anyone felt this, and does it go away?",Sohcahtoa82,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ckl6r/im_currently_a_college_senior_less_than_a_year/,"(EDIT: The title should read ""When coding, I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, even though *my program* works"")

Like the title says, I'm currently less than a year away from completing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but I'm also a software testing intern at a major tech company.

I tend to strongly doubt my own programming ability, but from what I'm seeing, I really shouldn't be.  In one of my CS classes, we had ungraded practice assignments, and the professor pointed out that I was the only person in the class that finished them all, and that I had clean code.

At my internship, it was originally not intended to be a coding position.  I'm working for a team developing a driver, and originally I was only supposed to be testing things, making debugging logs, and looking through the source code to potentially find fixes.  I ended up fixing a minor bug that's plagued us for months, and found the cause (though not a fix) of a major bug that's been bothering us since I discovered it a couple months ago.

I've written code that can read Minecraft worlds and exports them to a ray-tracer for high-quality renders.

My supervisor asked me to write some code to extract status data from the driver we are developing and display it in a UI.  My supervisor was impressed that I pulled it off in only a few hours, and is now asking me to expand on it and create an API that the other engineers can use for performing automated testing.

And yet...I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.  I doubt myself.

A friend of mine said its the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

Has anyone else dealt with this?  Does the feeling go away?"

I didn't really know where to post this as I just need some advice. To start, I'm a sophomore studying CS in one of the top5. The classes are going 'ok' and I just got an on-campus software development internship (some of you may say it's lame to intern at a uni - and it might be as there were no technical questions during the interview - but this is the only position I got for this summer). All other places either outright rejected me because of my GPA (2.95/4.0) or because of the lack of experience.       

The thing is that I like programming and I even thought (still think) that I like theoretical CS. I'm taking an algorithms class this semester and I just got my midterm exam grade back: I did so poorly compared to everyone else in class (my 32% vs mean 65%). Failures like this make me question my decision to study CS. Last semester, I got a C+ in data structures (I think this was purely because I underestimated the exams and did not study enough; I got all A/A+'s on the projects and I worked alone on those). I also seem to somewhat struggle to keep up with everyone else in my CS classes and can never score above the mean on any tests. I know I'm not the brightest kid out there but the amount of studying I do does not translate into good grades. It is also understood that the program is very competitive but because of that it's very hard for me to judge my performance as a CS student. I really hoped to get my GPA up this semester and everything was going relatively smoothly until I failed that algorithms exam. Granted that this exams is 15% of the final grade and there will be a final exam (30%), I can still save my grade but I will have to create a miracle.     

This summer, though, since I'm staying on campus and will have plenty of free time, my plan is to work on improving my programming skills, a side project, and learn something new as well. I would hate to give up like this and believe I still can do well in CS.

How does this whole situation seem to you, am I in the right field? ...or I am just beating a dead horse?      

**tl;dr bad grades, no experience, am I in the right field?**"

I think I have finally found one now but there's a problem. 

Here's a little background. He has been working on this startup for months already and I feel it may already be well established. He quit his job one year ago and has been working on this ever since (he's the only technical co-founder + one part-time co-founder who is on the user acquisition/marketing side). I'm still in school and I'm supposed to be a co-founder based on the talks I had with him. The problem I am facing is that I am unsure how this is going to play out. He clearly spent a lot of time and effort and risked a lot to build his mvp which was released 3 weeks ago. The other founder is about to pay for office space to motivate his unpaid interns (he has about 5 unpaid interns thus far).  Currently he has like 300 users and it's growing. 

The problem in the back of my head is that I'm not sure what the common steps a person needs to do to join an existing startup with a person they don't know very well (trust has not been established yet). Should there be an equity contract/agreement made? How much should I take (he has offered split 33/33/33 amongst all three of us)? How can I call myself a ""co-founder"" if I am coming this late to the startup? Is it normal for people to come in this late and be made equal partners?

I've been used to the idea of two-three people working together from the start. I've never thought I would be joining an existing startup so I'm not sure what to do. I really like the co-founder and I've clicked with him extensively on an intimate level. I'm just not sure how to go about joining this startup in a normalized manner.

I'd like to stress that I actually do like working with computers and that I'm not just going into this field for money or pressure from parents.

Anyways, there are so many options when it comes to computer science, but I just don't know how to get there. Obviously I have to work hard in school, but I'd like to get some advice from those who has gone through it all already.

I guess the questions are: What should I do while I'm at college/out of college? Should I double major in something? What should be my minor? Computer science + computer engineering?

1cqb3t,388,2013-04-20,"In which the student wants to work IT, but it isn't fair that she must field strip the computer",dennisthetiger,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1cqb3t/in_which_the_student_wants_to_work_it_but_it_isnt/,"So for some background on this, I had this come to me during my hoary days in college.  Which ended all of one month ago. 

OK, this story is actually from about a year ago.

One of my course requirements were an unpaid graded internship in our school's tech lab.  This is vastly different from the actual computer lab, because in this tech lab, you are doing everything as high up as learning to administrate AD, Linux, etc., all the way to the low levels of getting your hands dirty and attacking dust bunnies with canned air - or building ethernet cables, if you have time to hold up the wall.  Pretty much any lower-level Microsoft or basic CompTIA certification you can find at the lower levels were covered in this department.

So one fine day, we're coming up to the end of last year's spring session.  Students are coming in, going through, studying up for their finals for the class that covers the first level A+ stuff.  Then there's this one girl.  She comes in, and she's looking like she's going to work on Saturday, at her job at a retail department store cosmetics counter.  Not too gaudy, she looks OK.

She goes up to a very good friend of mine, sits down, and takes out the paper for her now overdue first assessment - for all intents, field strip a kit computer.  You build a computer from basic components, minus the case, and you are timed on reassembly.  You must then (in no particular order) boot into DOS from a floppy disk, make the CD drive recognizable, create and format a small partition, boot from said new partition, and have it ready to be interacted with in some fashion.

So my friend walks up to her, they sit down, and the student basically tells her, ""so, you're going to do this for me, right?""

Um, no.

Later in the day, I see her struggling.  It's about 12:30 PM at this time, so I go up, and see what's going on. 

We go through a few steps, and I give her a few pointers on what she needs to do.  She hunt-and-pecks at the keyboard as she types in the commands.  She starts playing with it, starts to get somewhere, and I'm recognizing something: she is not cut out for this industry.  She may have the smarts, but she's not demonstrating it, and she isn't showing any of the drive to learn the field.  I'm not liking this, so I ask, ""So, why do you want to go into IT?""

She explains to me that it fascinates her, and she wants to get away from her job at $department_store, where she works the cosmetics counter.  (Pinned it.)

We get to the point where It Is Time.  The moment of truth has arrived - she must now successfully do these things.  We cannot help her at this point.  I shift gears from being the nice intern to being the authoritarian. 

Now, the conditions are this: one must have all of the components, except for the CPU and fan assembly, removed from the board.  One can put them in strategic locations, but they must be removed from the board.  So I tell her as much.

She removed the floppy cable.

""No, all of it.""

It was 13:00 at this point, and she was starting to be concerned she would be late for her 14:30 shift at work.  $department_store is a fifteen minutes' drive from our location.

She unplugs one of the PATA cables.

""No, *all of it*"", I emphasize.  

""But I don't have time!""

""You have an hour before you need to depart for work, you have plenty of time.  It won't take you 45 minutes to do this if you follow my instructions.""

She looks at me, this odd, rather weak smile of desperation on her face, and announces to me, ""It's not fair!""

I looked at her.  It was all I could do.  I knew, at this point, that she was going to fail the course.

I so wanted to say to her the following: ""Look.  This is a required assignment for all of your class.  I had to do this, and succeeded.  Almost all of your class had to do this.  If you have any intention of passing this class, you have to do it as well.  This is, indeed, 100% fair and just.  If you do not do this, you *will* fail.""

But, I didn't have the heart.  I don't like making women cry on purpose - it's rather ungentlemanly.

I found out later that she did, indeed, fail, and passed on a poor report to the instructor on Rate My Professor.

I sometimes wonder what became of her - doubly so because, if I ever happen by $department_store, it's not for the cosmetics counter.  Ever.

TL;DR: Assessment?  I don't have to do an assessment!  I'm pretty!  It's NOT FAIR!"

1cq7wa,10,2013-04-20,Carrion breath,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cq7wa/carrion_breath/,"I'm a Canadian on a J-1 internship visa, living in Florida. I've been living the American life, whatever that means, since last September, and I should be back home two weeks from now.

For a little bit of background, having walked around a lot, I noticed that the streets of Florida, or at least around Orlando, are literally filled with dead animals. On a particularly bad day I was walking to the nearby grocery store, I could see a dead bird, a dead rat, and the occasional dead cat. I found this somewhat creepy because, as I remember them, the streets of the Montreal suburbs are considerably cleaner, as far as dead things are concerned. Still, I got used to it, and I don't really pay heed anymore.

One of the many things I need to get better at is punctuality. So last Tuesday morning, when I woke up 15 minutes before the time I should be at work, you'll understand that I didn't spend too much time tying my shoelaces; but as I was racing to my nice rental car, I stepped on something that really didn't feel right. I stopped for an instant, looking back, and I realized that it was a dead squirrel. The poor thing was lying on its belly and was missing a leg. Its head was lying in a small pool of black sticky stuff. Disgusted, I wiped my shoe in the grass, stepped into my car and mentally woke up to what I would have to do at work today. When I came back home, the rodent was gone, probably taken by a stray cat or something.

The next day, I did my best to wake up earlier. I got ready; shaved and took a shower; my toothbrush had a funny taste that I couldn't quite recognize. As I walked to my car, this time, I noticed a big dead bird on the sidewalk. I'm not too good with bird names, but I know this one is a black bird that seems to live around the small lakes. I approached it with morbid curiosity and realized that it had been considerably mutilated. In fact, all that remained was the wings, the shoulders where they connect, the neck and the head. A colony of ants was apparently salvaging the remains. Disgusted again, I went to work, had a bad day, and came back home without noticing what happened to it. Later this evening, my roommate told me to be careful with the windows, because it had rained that day and I forgot to close the bathroom window when I left for work that morning.

The next day, I wasn't feeling too well. The handle of my toothbrush was a little sticky, and my gum bled more than usual. The taste of blood was particularly bad, and it looked like I was doing a mouth ulcer. Good thing that I had an appointment with the dentist the next day.

And sure enough, when I got out, there was a dead racoon on the lawn, next to a tree. But this dead racoon was something else. In fact, it was more half a racoon. There was a thick black liquid coming out of its gaping abdomen and the lower part of its jaw was missing. And God, the stench. I was already not so well, but with that I thought I was going to throw up. Just like the other dead animals, I left it there and expected nature to do its work.

I didn't get any better during the day. It's like the stench followed me. My coworkers tried to avoid me, and the few of them who really had to interact with me offered me a gum. That mouth ulcer was getting discernibly worse during the day, such that at the end of it I was having trouble closing my mouth completely without it hurting.

I came home early because a bad headache struck. I went to the bathroom to get a Tylenol tab, but when I opened the door, I really didn't expect what I saw: there was a naked, hirsute, completely white man, brushing his teeth in front of the mirror. As I interrupted him, he turned his semi-bald head around. His eyes were wide open, and a black liquid was drooling out of his mouth with my toothbrush (MY toothbrush!) inside. He saw me, and his jaw dropped so wide I bet he could have fit my head in it; he had sharp and seemingly rotten shark-like teeth, two rows of them.

After two seconds returning my surprised look, his expression changed to a grotesque grin and he let out a little girl laugh. Always looking directly at me, he let the toothbrush on the side of the sink, crouched, and put his finger in front of his mouth, and said ""shhhhhh"". He then slowly scuttled towards the wall with the window, never dropping the stare, and, I fucking swear, climbed the wall like he was a spider, his head always facing me; at this point, the back of his head was touching his hairy back in the most inhuman contortion. He went through the open window, squeezing his monstrous body through like a mouse, always staring at me and grinning; he stopped there for about three seconds, taking a final look at me, and dropped down.

I fell on my knees, short-breathed, shaking in awe and dripping with cold sweat. I puked on the floor at the thought he had been using my toothbrush. My mouth hurt like shit and I think some blood came out too.

As I'm writing now, my lower lip is numb and my thoughts are a little cloudy. I think I'm drooling, but I hope not, because it's not the right color. My breath stinks like dead animals. Good thing I have this dentist appointment tomorrow."

I'm a Computer Science student at Tufts University, and because of a summer internship, I cannot participate in my school's study abroad program. The problem is that I really want to live in Chile! Luckily, I have plenty of credits to take a semester off and intern, but I have been having trouble getting in touch with the Chilean software scene.

Some background on me:

* Last summer I interned at Pegasystems in Cambridge, MA, and this summer, I will have interned at Microsoft in their research location.

* During my Junior year of high school, I lived in Zaragoza, Spain. For that reason, I have a decent working ability in Spanish.

* I'm experienced in C/C++, and after this summer I'll have a good grasp of the .NET framework. 

So, if anyone knows anyone in the software scene in Chile, I'd love to get in touch!

Thanks so much!"

* Get master degree in Business Information Systems, BA or similar

* Start working at a prestigious international company (chance to transfer to the US[?])

I'm just about to enter the job arena and am very fearful that I may not have any valuable skill to offer a company. My code quality isn't always great and there are so many areas I can improve. 

I predominantly program in Python and Javascript, but I've worked to some level with just about every commonly used web dev language in the book. I can pick up any language I need to, but I fear my lack of ""expert"" knowledge in PHP or Java might hurt me. 

To keep this short I'll just list some unique skills/traits I have and if you could give me some direction as to what type of web jobs I should be applying for (internships, entry-levels, etc) or just where you think I fall in general, I would really greatly appreciate it. 

* Bachelors in Business/IT and Associates in Web Development
* I've made a few open-source projects on my Github http://www.github.com/abeisgreat
* I've built a few tiny web applications like http://www.2Dizzle.com, http://www.query2json.com, http://www.tawx.tv
* I'm one of the youngest graduates of my university ever, finishing up my bachelors in May at age 18.
* I have little work experience, when I was 15 I interned at a school district helping with computer support and networking and when I was 16 I got a full time student-worker job at my university as a ""web developer assistant"" which was mostly writing HTML/JS for their existing pages.
* When I was 17 I created one of my largest web applications, a book exchange software for students at my university and a few months later I sold the exclusive rights to the software to a small start-up focused on education software.
* In my hobby projects I've worked a lot with different front-end tools like Sass, Less, Haml, and Coffeescript and I also know a lot of jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, and Knockout.

I've been living on my own for two years and I've been living off the savings from my previous work and sale of my book exchange, plus help from my parents as I finish school, I'm really fearful I won't be able to find work and I'm running out of time to learn new skills before I'll have to start bringing in money. 

Although more of a side-note, I currently live and attend school in Milwaukee, but I'm looking to move to Madison in the summer, so if anyone has specific advice about valuable skills to have for that job climate, I'd really appreciate it as well.

Thanks so much :)

I''ll just start with a bit of background. I'm 25. In college I did a few internships in Software testing. After college I worked in a startup as a Business Analyst for 2 years which did not really take off. The plan was to do an MBA after that, but i'm not entirely sure if I want to do that, and I'm not ready to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on something I'm not sure about. 

For the past few weeks I have been dabbling in Rails whenever I get the time. I have some programming experience and always had an interest in it and I really want to make a career out of it. But I'm unsure if this is the right move. I graduated almost 3 years ago so I feel I'm 3 years too late to the party, plus I wonder if this career option will get too congested with youngsters since there are all these free courses online and if there's any career growth in it a few years down the line? 

But for the meantime. I'm thinking of brushing up on my java skills, finishing this small web app that i'm making on rails and host it online, and maybe make an ios app also and start applying for jobs. Also, I'm moving to the US next months so i'll have 3 months of sitting around to do before I get an employment permit. I'll be based in the tri-state area.

Are Hong Kong employers looking for the same things as employers in the US? I'm thinking about having an internship on the CV, personal projects or participation in open source projects? or are they more focused on the degree? (or something else?).

Also, due to my situation, where I already hold one degree (my economics degree) and have work experience, would it be possible to begin applying for jobs (and getting one) before finishing my bachelor in computing?

Also, treat the sub-frequencies of the kick drum as a separate sound.
 |My kick drums typically peak at ~50Hz but also as far up as 1k.
 |Linear reverb is very useful.
 |Unfortunately, the only way to really do that is with top-of-the-line equipment and good microphone technique.
 |Stereo placement is really dependent on the situation; tends to be a more case-by-case situation.
 |I wish I had known how to use compression better back when I first started. Knowing how to compress properly and intuitively is key.

Jay-Z and 50 were not womanizers, drinking, taking drugs, etc. I feel like the stories you here are pretty exaggerated for the most part.
 |As to what they were like. 50 cent was one of the funniest people to work with; even more so than Will Smith. Jay-Z was more down to business but not harsher per-se.
 |While working for Nas there was this whole Nas v. Jay-Z thing going on. They would be going back at each other whether it be albums, concerts, or press releases. I really got to know Jay once Nas and Jay were patching things up while recording some songs together.

I don't even remember how it got started but at some point it became clear that the producer who was one of the members of Wu Tang Clan was upset at me for something, so the discussion started becoming more heated. I started to notice that one of them was blocking the door and another was blocking me from getting up out of my chair. Fortunately my assistant was outside and came inside and I managed to tell him to call the police. I ended up having to run through this guy to try and get away, and hid away in the office while we waited for the police. They were all gone by the time the police got there.
 |Tl;dr got into confrontation with Wu Tang Clan member, called the police, Wu Tang Clan got lost  And I would have most definitely wanted to work with the Foo Fighters.

Do you ever work unsigned artists to help them break through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jtoup?context=5)|Michael Jackson for sure. You know, on records you have so many chances on records to get things right, but I never truly appreciated his voice until I heard him in person. 
 |I would prefer not to disclose specific names of people I was disappointed with but you would be surprised. 
 |Yes.
[Do you approve Auto-Tune?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9ju3c1?context=5)|Auto-Tune is essentially a tool that separates the pros from the amateurs. If you know how to sing you don't use it, if you don't, you do. It's more of a branding tool than anything.

The audio either came to us transferred or came transferred we never really used the original tapes. It's a lot more straight-forward and seamless process to work on a past recording and makes for a much quieter day.

X.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9juuou?context=5)|I had a relationship with The Hit Factory and they booked him and called me for it. I worked with him in '99 on about 12 songs that I can't really remember which songs made it on the album and which ones did not. He was a very soft-spoken and kind person. I was surprised when he passed away, but I didn't really know him *that* well and it's not like I had a personal relationship with him so his passing didn't phase me too much.

I doubt anyone would have heard of him but he was incredibly talented; would have been nice if something happened to him. I also think David Banner is underrated.
[Who is your personal favorite artist to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jvjey?context=5)|Mob Deep. I used to like their stuff a lot.

When I first got started, I worked with the producer Mark James, who brought in several artists that I really enjoyed working with despite everything being broken because we were working out of a b-rate studio at the time. (Same place Queen Latifah got her start)
[Who are your favorite albums to listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jvpeq?context=5)|I like the latest Foo Fighters album, the latest Bush record, and I of course still like listening to a good Pink Floyd album.

The analogue have a rounder / warmer feel to them while digital has a harder edge to it. While I can't be certain, I think this is attributed to digital equipment only being designed to work within the confines of the human ear while analogue is more imperfect in that sense so the audio doesn't just cut off.

1cul9o,3,2013-04-22,Now I'm nothing but a failing financial burden.,positivespinonit,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cul9o/now_im_nothing_but_a_failing_financial_burden/,"Everyone I talk to about my future thinks it's bright. I've got clear goals, a lot of passion, a direction I'm heading in.

I recently got my first article published (as an undergad! I was so proud!). It was something I slaved away on for WEEKS. And no one seems to care that it happened. 

I have a 3.8 GPA, three majors, and I've basically given up my life this past year to focus on school. I have no job, no money, and have pretty much isolated myself. All I think about is art, my future in museums, and who in my class will surpass me. I've held several internships, attended conferences, and nothing I do ever seems to be enough in the museum/art world.

Then my computer broke. Then my car broke. I have credit card debt. I can barely pay my rent (parents still help me, I'm a loser, I know). I dumped my boyfriend, and still have feelings for an older ex-boyfriend, who just wants to fuck me. I had to turn down an overseas internship this summer because of money. I have nothing. 

My history of anxiety makes me stressed all the time. I take herbals, have pillow-sprays, relaxation techniques, but the stressors just won't leave.

I'm failing at everything I wanted to do, and costing my divorced parents a shit ton of money while I'm at it. I hate being this financial burden, making them pay for my car repairs, a new computer, my rent...because I just can't. 

I used to feel so above everyone in my intelligence, drive, confidence, looks. Now, I've stopped eating (5'4, 101 right now), dropped my cockiness down way low, and books have become my best friends. This is not how I want to live. 

What if I sold the car, sold the computer, all the nice clothing I've collected, wrote letters to those I love and just checked out? People would be sad, but at this point--not many. I've become so isolated I've lost most of the people I used to care about. I'm a failure, and I'm faking happy every day at school. This isn't how I want to live, and I think every day at night, ""I don't want to live like this, so what if I just didn't anymore?"""
1cuidq,0,2013-04-22,Software development options for those who hate college?,l3ktr0n1k,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1cuidq/software_development_options_for_those_who_hate/,"Second year college student here, majoring in CS and I'm beginning to realize I may not be cut out for university. The abundance of unrelated classes, or loosely related classes, I am forced to take are boring me to tears and I'm having trouble just doing the bare minimum to pass. Some of the more important CS classes I've done well in (such as Data Structures) but this semester I've been having more trouble due to the immense amount of work from other required classes. It's made even worse by the fact that these professors cannot even teach the class properly so I am forced to teach myself. On top of that I'm just loathing the entire college environment, from my living conditions to my classmates. It all seems like a gigantic waste of time and money to me.

So what I want to know is would other options like a trade school be right for me? Are there good job opportunities for graduates from these schools? Should I take a semester off and try to find an internship (even with a mediocre GPA)? I just don't know what to do, I really can't take being here anymore but I enjoy programming and want to get into the field."
1cuhc4,1,2013-04-22,The Black Lantern,Arkeic,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cuhc4/the_black_lantern/,"Before you read this, I have to say that I have been keeping this terrible event locked up in a part of my brain, afraid to reveal anything because I am worried that I will have to get even more involved than I already have been. I have been wanting to tell someone, anyone, of what happened that night, but my friends would only call me crazy or deem it a wild ghost story, and I certainly don't want this coming back to haunt me if I get a call from the Oklahoma authorities wanting to interrogate me, because I know they'll probably accuse me for the unexplainable crime.


There's a small town in Oklahoma that's quite secluded from the rest of the world. I was visiting my great aunt two summers ago, in boring old Oklahoma with its plains and clump of forests, just because she was a lonely old neurosurgeon and I really wanted to get into psychology. It was a peaceful little town in the middle of nowhere, with probably 300-400 inhabitants, maybe a little more now. My aunt's house is on the outskirts of the town, near a farmer's market and gas station. There's a couple of smaller houses half a mile away from my aunt's, and on the other side of her house is a large forest.


First day there I was bored out of my mind. As a California kid from Los Angeles I am around technology 24/7 and live in the suburbs. My aunt had an old Macintosh and there was very little to watch on TV. She hauled some textbooks of medical psychology and general anatomy onto my lap and expected me to be entertained for weeks. She was wrong; I needed to go out. At least she didn't make me talk to crazies like I had to for my internship in LA; I feel like I myself go insane sometimes just being in that institution.


Now, there's a curfew in that little town. I didn't know why people would even bother staying out; there's nothing to do there. The curfew is strictly upheld; nobody can be outside after 11 p.m. because there is the common belief that there are unseen monsters who attack oblivious wanderers and maim them until you can't tell who the person is anymore by their corpse. I thought it was some fucked up way of making sure kids wouldn't go out at night and cause trouble. I really thought so.


This kid, let's call him Mark--he believed none of the stories. He said he'd been out at night all the time and had never seen anything weird even once. Mark lived in one of the houses next to my aunt's, and a week after I had settled in, he visited because news spreads fast in such a small town, especially about city people. He wanted to know how it was like in Los Angeles, how school was there, if the girls were pretty, stuff like that. I liked him a lot; his face always lighted up when he talked about stuff. There was something off about him actually...he had these pale green eyes that just made him look so...dead. You know how when you're in class and you turn and look at your friend and he is obviously not paying attention at all and just staring off into the distance? Mark's eyes was like that even when he WAS smiling. There was just something unnerving about his stare. Anyways, one afternoon he came over and asked if I wanted to join him in the woods. I asked him, ""Why?"" and he said, come on ill show you that everyone in this town is just full of cowshit. ""Are there really monsters out there in the forest?"" I asked, and he said, if you come with me youll see that there isnt. I didn't want to look like a pussy, so I consented.


It was around 12:40 am when Mark popped up next to my window. He did it so silently and had his face there for a good few minutes until I turned to my right from my desk and was almost scared shitless. He told me to climb out from there, and so I did. We walked down the middle of the paved road for a good ten minutes in absolute silence. Mark held a rusty black lantern that shone brightly and lighted the way for us. I guess he was as scared as me. Or maybe not, I don't know. We reached the foot of the forest and walked down the road within it for a few minutes. It was so eerily quiet--I'm getting shivers right now just thinking about it--there were no crickets, no wind blowing, and definitely no cars or people at all. I could only hear my own footsteps clopping on the dry pavement as we walked on. 

Suddenly, Mark stopped and turned to me with a big smile on his face. lets go in there, he said, pointing into the dark trees at the side of the road. ""Are you serious?!"" I whispered fiercely. ""It's not safe! We'll get lost!"" He looked at me with those dead, dead green eyes and shook his head. fine ill go by myself and show you that theres nothing in there, he said. He turned and started walking into the woods slowly, the light of the lantern bobbing up and down in the absolute darkness. I could see the trees within with the light of the lantern. ""Come back!"" I remember yelling. ""Let's go back!"" Mark didn't respond. The light grew smaller and smaller as he walked farther and farther away. I stared at it for so long, the world became a tiny faded yellow light bobbing in the absolutely black void. Then the light stopped. It was so, so still, like something was holding it in place. I stared at it for probably a whole minute, and it didn't move the entire time. Then all of a sudden the light shook left and right, faster and faster, until it was whizzing left and right so quickly that it looked like it was bouncing between trees in a straight line at an incredibly fast rate. Then I heard the screaming. It was like someone had tried to kill a pig with a single swing of a cleaver, but the blade had only embedded itself in the neck of the pig, and it was screaming to be killed as blood filled its throat and the shrill screams became gargled cries. Mark's screams sounded so inhuman that I seriously pissed my pants a little. I was trembling so hard as I watched the light fly up impossibly forty or fifty feet into the air and slam back down onto the ground. Then all was silent. I stood there shivering for a couple minutes, so afraid to even move. I kept thinking I saw some dark outlines of shapes moving through the trees, but it was probably just my imagination. 

Then all of a sudden a figure silently walked past my right from behind. It was a sheriff. I have no idea how he got there; there was no car. I couldn't see his face; he was a head taller than me and wore a sheriff uniform. In his right hand he held a revolver. I didn't see his face, and never got to. He said nothing and walked silently into the woods. He never made a single sound. Believing in a false sense of security with the silent sheriff, I tentatively walked into the woods, a few steps behind him. He never looked back at me and just kept walking straight towards the light, his hands limp at his sides. We neared the light, and I saw what truly horrified me, seen something that I will never be able to erase from my memory. On the ground lay Mark--his limbs had been torn off of him and lay askew, scattered in different directions. Blood caked his clothes and formed a pool underneath him. The trunks were shiny with Mark's bright red blood. His eyes, his eyes were wide open as his dead pale green pupils bore into my soul. He breathed heavily and his bloodied mouth was agape with agony and fear. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the sheriff, who was still not facing me, slowly raise his revolver and point it at Mark. Mark didn't seem to see him, almost like the sheriff was never there; his dead eyes were locked onto mine. Then I watched as his face collapsed under the force of the bullet that was fired, crushing his thin nose and causing his entire face to cave in in a bloodied mess. Still his pale green eyes stared at mine, unmoving. I ran. I ran and ran and I kept looking back, thinking something was chasing me. There wasn't anything.

Sometimes I dream that I am in the dark forest, with Mark, and that I grab hold of him and I hack off his limbs with an axe and smile as he screams in agony and stares at me with those dead green eyes. Then I shoot him in between those eyes of his with a silver revolver and every time, I wake up shaking.


Turns out there was no sheriff who knew about anything at the town's police station. They never found Mark's body. They found his mangled arms and legs, and a bloodied, black lantern. "

The only problem is I have not been able to find a job at all.. I partly blame myself because I kind of slacked throughout college, didn't really have internships and only worked 2 summers in IT. To put a cherry on top the two supervisors I had are no longer where I worked so I don't really have any solid references.

Over the past year I've sent out hundreds of resumes and have done a total of eight interviews, none have landed me a position. I'm starting to panic now because companies will not hire if they see someone out of the work force for so long, especially now with all the new graduates I'm going to be absolutely FUCKED.

I was thinking about Grad school, but my undergrad GPA was only a 2.8, so I've screwed myself on that end as well.  Not only that, but the deadline for admissions to most decent ones for fall semester have already passed.

Everyday I wake up just feeling exhausted--exhausted from doing nothing. I see all my friends around me starting their careers, moving out of their houses, enjoying their youth in NYC... and I'm stuck, stuck at home with my parents without a job. Sending application after application and facing rejection after rejection. I've never been so miserable and jaded in my entire life.

 I just don't know what to do anymore. I've done revision after revision of resumes, experimented with different cover letters, exhausted all my networks, gone to career fairs, used my university's careerlink.. and nothing. Every day that passes by the chances of me landing a job decrease.. I need something to do, but no one gives me the chance.  The ones that want to give me a chance are all unpaid ""coffee boy"" internships with no valuable knowledge learned. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? because right now I'm absolutely lost. 

I should add that I have a strong interest in politics/helping others, if that's of any help. "
1cu2tc,22,2013-04-21,Internships are required!,Demosthenes3,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1cu2tc/internships_are_required/,"I see a lot of engineering students and recent graduates asking for career advice.  It usually goes something like this “I have a decent GPA, no internships/co-ops, and no contacts.  Why can’t I find a job?”  Well its simple…it’s because you and didn’t get any work experience in the four years you were at college!  Class vs. real work is very different.  


Engineering is a very competitive field and internships/co-ops are required.  Required!  Think of it as another credit you have to fulfill (which at some schools is actually the case).  When I graduated a few years ago, I had completed 5 internships and 1 co-op.  At every interview, I talked about my work experience and the different ways I applied my class work to my job.  Not only will you make around $20/hr and earn valuable beer money- maybe you will figure out what you want to do in life.  The internship I had after my sophomore year lead me to the job I am doing now.  I figured out what niche I wanted to follow and took applicable classes.  
Now I know it’s hard to get your foot in the door initially.  I’ve been there and been incredibly frustrated but you have to realize opportunity is everywhere and stick with it.  I got my first internship at a small but major player in the defense field from some random guy my dad met at the gym.  I worked out a few times with my dad, met this guy (who it turned out was the CEO) and asked him for an internship.  If you have already graduated and have no work experience, reframe your class projects and work like it was a job.  Stress working as part of a team to achieve a goal, how you got to that goal, and what the positive outcomes were.  One summer as a hobby, I rebuilt an arcade system from the ground up and donated it to charity.  When asked about troubleshooting skills, I talked about how I determined which components on the Ms. Pacman board had failed and how I got it working again.  


After you break in the club it becomes a lot easier.  I get contacted every week now, out of the blue, from big name companies wanting me to interview with them.   
 

TL/DR- Get an internship stupid!

I got my BS in CS from an midwest tech school. I'm also an international student in the States. Since my graduation, I have had no luck landing a job. Only two on-site visits that lead to nowhere, one for a QA position another for an IT position which I ran away. 

I've rushed through my college to finish it quick. I took shit load of classes every semester, even though it hurt my GPA pretty badly. I had no breaks during the summers to take 4 classes (technically not possible). And I've graduated early, with a degree. (with no internships experience, I didn't even apply to any) 

Don't get me wrong I love computer science, I can code within my skills. However, in college we learned Java and did a lot of things with Java. I'm quite good with Java, probably intermediate abilities. We learned SQL, Python, Haskell, Objective-C, Assembly but only to a certain extend. Not close to call myself  ""good"" at using them professionally. Lately I've been trying to tailor my skills to match most of these job requirements. I'm currently learning Javascript/HTML5 and C#, and I feel like my diploma and all the years of studying has been for no good reason. 

It's getting hard to find entry level jobs, especially in San Francisco area where I'm planning to live. Am I doing something wrong here? 
Should I move to the area first and then find a job through meetups and networking? 
Any advice is helpful, thanks!

1cytqf,1,2013-04-23,I must have some serious bad luck...,IndecisiveChick,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1cytqf/i_must_have_some_serious_bad_luck/,"This is part-rant, part-question. 

I applied to a company in FL, that I recently had an internship with, to 2 part time jobs. One works with research and the other is a vacation planner. I passed the web-based interview, the 2nd interview, and thought I was going to have a phone interview next with a real person, but turns out that I have to go in person. The dates they gave me are on this Thursday (two days from now) or in the last week of April. The problem you might ask? I live in the Northeast US. I can't fly down that quick, and I'm not sure if I can schedule the interviews for later dates in May. I've been searching forums with this company to see if rescheduling can happen. No luck yet.

So that's my current situation. I guess my question relies in the realm of if anyone else has applied or jobs out of state/across the country, how did the process go and has anyone been in a situation like this? At this point, it's hard to come across a job in my state and I'll literally take any part time/full time job that isn't a scam/prostitution. Maybe moving across country for a PT job is a bad idea, but it's for a really good company.

I've been on a job hunt since I graduated last May and landed the internship in August. I have future goals to go back to school next Fall if I do not find a reputable job in the next year. 

Any advice is helpful and appreciated!"

1cynv1,3,2013-04-23,When should I expect a raise?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cynv1/when_should_i_expect_a_raise/,"I started as an intern for an IT company with an Associate's degree at the end of May last year. They paid me $11.50/hour while I was an intern, and then offered me a full-time salaried position on September 1, 2012 for $24,000/year (about $12/hour).

I started off as a Tier 1 helpdesk technician, but now I'm Tier 2. I'm also doing 40% website programming work and 20% server stuff. They always say that I'm very good at my job, and I usually work about 45 hours per week. 

I'm an exempt salaried employee, so I also work some night and weekends for no extra pay.

I was pretty disappointed when they hired me on for only $24,000 per year, but I figured they would give me a raise a while down the road.

Do you think I should expect a raise sometime soon, and do you think $25,500/year would be out of the question?

I'm currently doing a programming internship.  I'm doing an 8 month internship with them and I just finished the first four months.  They liked my presence and work ethic from the get-go, and are willing to give me a full time job at the end of my internship, regardless if I choose to finish my degree.  They're proposing to me $80,000/year.

Would it be feasible to drop out of school to take this job?  I'm in my third year of university, and it was my first internship.  I loved every minute of it, but at the same time I know that there are stories about people not escalating in salary and that their lack of degree is to blame.  I feel like if I take it, I should drop out of school because it seems like it would be too much to have on my plate and one of the two would suffer from taking both at the same time.  If any of you guys did have a full time programming job and took school on the side, how was it?  Manageable?  Too much?

Thank you in advance for your guys' insight, I really appreciate it."

I'm a young web &amp; graphic designer looking for either part-time/ full-time employment, an internship, or even small web design gigs. I'm currently a Computer Tech student, with knowledge of HTML/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, WordPress, and light PHP. While pursuing my degree, I've done some freelance design contract work with small businesses, but I'm looking to expand my network and find more projects that I can be a part of, or alternatively, find full-time employment.



To get a better sense of my experience, I have mostly created web designs; including interfaces, landing pages, and informational websites. I design web interfaces using Adobe's Creative Suite and then implement using HTML/CSS, jQuery, and if wanted, a responsive grid system. I am very detail-oriented and organized. 

I admittedly don't have a lot of professional experience, but I do have a lot of energy, passion, and a desire to adapt quickly to new challenges.

I have taken all the Java classes at my school, and am currently taking an upper div C++ class. And on my resume, I put proficient in Java/C++ because I think they are similar and I can say I am proficient in Java.

If (and this is a big if!) I get past the phone interview, and go onto the on site interview, I know they will definitely ask some technical questions and probably ask me to solve stuffs (including some sample code or whatnot). Would I just tell them I prefer to code in Java or do I just spend whatever time I have to try and learn C++ fluently? (EDIT: I have learned C as well, does that help any?)

I suppose my question is.. what is the general attitude towards visible tattoos in the CS field? My interest was piqued when I saw a dude with a sick head tattoo over on /r/tattoos and people were saying that he could still get a developer/software engineering position with no problem.

I go to a small school in New York called St Thomas Aquinas College , or STAC.  I am enrolled in a dual-degree program here that then goes to Manhattan College.  I would be leaving here with a BS in Mathematics and BS Chemical Engineering.  I’d say right now I’m in good standings with my grades and should be fine getting into the program at Manhattan at the end of my years here.

Here are the classes i need to complete at St Thomas Aquinas College 

http://www.stac.edu/schools/as/pdf/Engineering Mechanical with Manhattan College 9-12.pdf
plus
Organic Chemistry ½
Quantitative Analysis 
Physical Chemistry

Once Completed there I have to take the actual Chem Engineering / general engineering courses at Manhattan College that are listed on this form. Seemingly mostly the junior/senior year of their colleges four-year program.

http://catalog.manhattan.edu/undergraduate/engineering/chemeng/#1

**- Would you object/add to the classes I have at STAC considering I’m kind of creating a makeshift major at STAC?**(has been done twice before by my advisor, because we technically don’t have a dual degree program for ChmE)

Im freaking out about internships and such because I feel I don’t have the actual  education to start into them now with just my regular physics/math/chem classes.  I don’t have the most competent of programming teachers here either sadly nor an actual variety of programs to get my hands on so I don’t have that either!  I have friends at larger schools with co-ops and actual engineering classes; I don’t feel qualified.  I’ve also given a look to some , the criteria to get in can get a bit extreme 
I’d say!

**-Would you say there are places that will bring in those without the greatest of education level ( any ideas where?) or should I wait for the time in Manhattan college where id have the Engineering classes under my belt?**

**-Would You say the BS in Mathematics will really have much of a difference in my chances to get a job?**

Few Other Questions
**-Classes most important to retain their teachings?

**-Do you learn most of your tasks and jobs on the job or are you required to know your job and do it day 1?**(obviously there pre-req but I’m saying job specifc)

**-Anyone know much about the reputation of Manhattan College’s Engineering program I only hear good things but who knows ?**

**-Just a general consensus of what I should be ready to face once I actually am in those ChmE classes**

1czdip,0,2013-04-23,Companies in Europe for electrical engineers,ECEontherun,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1czdip/companies_in_europe_for_electrical_engineers/,"I'm a 3rd year ECE student with grand plans to travel after graduation and eventually wish to move to Europe. I think this could be facilitated if I was able to get a job with a tech company that is based in or has offices in the country/city where I want to be. From what I understand, having a job will make it easier to gain a visa to that country (through a work permit or similar).

In particular, I'm looking for tech companies that would (obviously) hire ECE grads. I will have an internship with the NSA by graduation and have a decent GPA (3.6 at the moment, I expect a 3.7 in a year), so I think I have decent odds of employment. I would like to do something in semiconductors or communications, but I'm pretty flexible at this point, not having really settled into any niche yet.

As far geography, the countries I'm looking at are Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, or further south like Germany or France. Pretty huge range, I think, I just need ideas of specific companies to pursue. Also, any thoughts on whether or not this is a bad idea or not would be cool. Thanks!

P.S.: Only company I could think of is Nokia, but the outlook there doesn't seem too great!"

1d3y4g,3,2013-04-25,Urgently Need for Internship Decision,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d3y4g/urgently_need_for_internship_decision/,"First, a little background info: I'm currently a junior at an R1 university getting a double degree in Math and CS. I didn't decide to pursue the CS major until last school year; moreover I didn't decide I wanted to go into software dev until the end of last semester. Hence I'm 8 months late to the summer internship search. I have a good GPA and I'm a math TA; previously I was a research assistant which included a bit of programming experience. As it's currently slated I should graduate next year, but I haven't had industry experience.

Yesterday I was offered a software dev internship position for the summer at a large financial* company (*they do own several tech startups however). Here's the catch: not expecting to find a position so late, I planned to take classes over the summer. If I take the position there is no way I can also take classes. If I don't take them this summer my schedule for next year will be hell to the point that it might not even be possible. Furthermore, they're only offering $11/hr full time (the recruiter made it sound like they pay every intern the same amount). I've applied to a number of local intern positions that would allow me to take classes very recently but have yet to hear anything let alone interview.

Here are my options as I see them:
1. Take the internship. Struggle through my senior year and graduate on time with some experience.
2. Take the internship. Drop some classes, take them in Fall 2014 and graduate a semester late. This would mean paying rent in a college town for a few extra months and skipped income.
3. Decline the offer. Gamble on landing a local internship or otherwise work a normal job. Take classes this summer and graduate as planned. 

What is my best option? Theoretically, if I don't get another internship, how much more difficult would it be to land a good job out of college? Is interning after graduation a worthwhile possibility? "

1d3htj,66,2013-04-25,Pre-Summer College Student FAQ,Befriendswbob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d3htj/presummer_college_student_faq/,"A lot of the same questions have been coming up recently from college students (probably since summer is coming), here are some common answers!   
**1. I have an offer for employment at $X, should I drop out?**   
For 99% of you: **NO** absolutely not. Your degree will be more valuable in the long run, and if/when you decide to switch companies it will be invaluable. Exceptions to this would include if you have financial hardship staying in your program **and** the salary wouldn't allow you to live and pay for school. You **can** work a full-time job and go to school, tons of people do it.   
**2. I have an offer from company X and am still waiting to hear from company Y, what should I do?**   
If you like both companies, or you would prefer Y: Tell Y you have an offer on the table, that will speed them up. You probably don't want to give them details on the offer until you know what they are planning on giving you.   
**3. My offer is $X, but I want $Y, what should I do?**   
First do research on median salaries in your area, you can use sites like [glassdoor.com](http://www.glassdoor.com) or [payscale.com](http://www.payscale.com) to figure that out. If your offer is significantly less than what you're seeing, you can probably ask for more, *typically* it seems about 10% more is ok, more than that may be pushing it. Use your best judgement.   
**4. Tips for handling recruiters:**   
Try not to tell them what you are looking for in a salary or what your previous salary was, this will usually limit you (They will press on this! Be prepared.) Another option is to provide a salary floor, ex: I'm not taking any jobs that pay less than $X. They also shouldn't need any information besides your resume, and they may conduct a short interview with you, if they ask for more than that it is probably sketchy! Use common sense and go with your gut.    
**5. Should I do this unpaid internship?**   
Almost always: **NO**, if you are in the U.S. unpaid internships are illegal. On top of that it only shows that the company doesn't value you or your work at all. Exceptions would be: If you aren't providing the company any value and are solely getting experience (then it would be legal, but it is incredibly difficult to justify this type of work in the CS field), or perhaps if your school has some sort of arrangement with local industry and unpaid internships have been normalized in your area **and** you can't find a better way of getting experience and getting paid for it!   
**6. I didn't find a summer internship, what should I do?**   
Find other avenues to keep practicing and building your skills. Open source projects, personal projects, 'pro-bono' work for student groups on campus that need tech solutions. There are a number of ways to get programming experience and build your skills that don't involve getting a paycheck from an established company. Be proactive in finding them and working them to your full advantage. Internships are still important, so start early in contacting recruiters for semester internship opportunities instead. But your world is not over if you don't get a summer internship. You just have to work harder to get that great summer experience. (thanks /u/catiebug)   
Many colleges have something going on during the summer you can help with. For example, this summer (and last summer) I'm working with my university's scientific programmers to write some analytic programs for the business school. I have friends doing research opportunities as well. Just network in your department and you're sure to find someone looking for extra help that will look good on a resume. (thanks /u/SummerInJapan)   
**7. My offer expires soon and I haven't heard back about negotiations, what should I do?**   
This is a tough situation. I would email the Recruiter to make sure it is documented. You want to make it clear that you're planning on taking the job, but you feel you'd like to discuss the compensation. Present your evidence (hopefully you have examples of others with similar backgrounds and levels of experience that received more from a similar company). Choose your wording carefully so they know that you're still considering the offer, but want to discuss this point further before you sign. If the Recruiter is not responding to your inquiries, it would not be right for the company to hold you to their deadline. (thanks again /u/catiebug !)
   
Please add anything else or criticize my answers and I'll try to keep the main post updated with feedback/new stuff! Or if you are a college student and have questions, please ask them here and I'll keep it updated with feedback!

1d2yr2,0,2013-04-25,Recently realized my dream,IamMcSqueeb,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1d2yr2/recently_realized_my_dream/,"First of all i would like to say that i have read through the FAQs.

Anyways I recently graduated with an ECE that was heavily oriented in Computer Engineering and anything to do with computers. I chose this degree because when it came down to it I asked an advisor which they thought would be better for me given my likes and what I was good at. The advisor was a bit off (who would have thought) but what can you do. Since graduation I have gotten a full time job that pays nicely and I work with great people who are SUPER passionate about what they do. The only problem with that is that I realized that I'm not passionate about this stuff. It took through 4 years of college to finally realize that i should have went with a CS degree because its the only thing where i can sit for HOURS on end and not even realize the amount of time i spend. I have always had a passion for games and I love what they can do for people. I have started to code small games on my own to get some experience and i took some CS classes (electives) while in school. I have read books and I spend my free time learning about game development.

So to the real part of this post. I know that it doesn't quite matter about degrees but I was more wondering about Internships in the gamedev field. Do development companies consider already graduated kids for internships? I feel like that would be a perfect opportunity for me to develop and show that I am competent and willing to do what it takes in the industry. I have applied for some and haven't received any replies yet and some internships say specifically that they must but enrolled in a degree."

Could any current or former Googlers shine some light on this process. 

I want to apply to Google because, well, its Google. The things they do are significant and I want to make a difference in my career. 

I failed last time because I was not prepared. I doubt myself. I apply and then I tell myself theres no way that someone with my skills and grades would ever get through. And then comes the email scheduling a phone interview. I've been working on bettering my skills, going through everything I've learnt in my courses and doing my own programming projects and will continue to do this hoping to prepare myself if I get another interview with them. Its Google, they're a Big Data company so I really need to go over all the search and sorting algorithms, various data structures and Java. lots and lots of Java. 

Would it also be appropriate to contact my former recruiter? I didn't maintain contact between now and then so I think it may be a bit awkward. Or should I just apply online like everybody else? I'm erring on the side of it being awkward to establish such contact after all this time.

Currently, I work for ""AeroDyne Inc"".  I really like the place - the atmosphere is reasonably relaxed, the team I'm working with is fairly small and tightly knit, and the stuff I'm working on is stuff that I am extremely passionate about.  It's the kind of place where I could settle in for several years and start a career.

But a few weeks back, a buddy of mine called me up and said the company he works at - ""West Coast Technology"" - was looking to hire a guy with my skillset.  Now, not to name names, but it's a household name, the kind of place that ANY engineer of ANY discipline would jump to work at, were they starting a project that needed your kind of expertise.  So, fuck it, updated and polished my resume and sent it in to the recruiter at WCT.  A week later, phone interview, week after that, they flew me out, and now I have a job offer from them sitting in my lap.  It's a lot of $$$.  Sure, the cost of living is 2x as high there, but the offer more than makes up for it.

So, the dilemma is that I feel really bad about leaving my current job at AeroDyne.  I've only been here 8 months, and it's my first ""real"" job out of college - I'd been bouncing around part time jobs and glorified internships for two years after college, and they gave me my first real break.  In addition, my current project is at a critical juncture (it's going to be crunch time for a few months), and the project is also severely understaffed.  I don't want to screw over my team at AeroDyne entirely and burn the few professional bridges I have, but on the other hand, an offer to work in this particular division of WCT is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.

I'm graduating with a CS degree in May and have been aggressively job hunting. I have an internship in place over the summer (that I have been at since last summer) that I can leave at any time for a full-time job.

The dilemma:
I got a job offer today that isn't as quite a sweet deal as I think might come along soon (I'm interviewing with multiple places). I expect to have at least a couple offers, some more exciting than others. My rough start date for anything would be mid June(ish).


The two camps:
Some friends have suggested I accept the first offer while continuing my job hunt, bailing on the first company if a sweeter deal comes along.

This sounds unethical to me. I would rather just tell them ""I need a couple weeks to make up my mind about your offer"". However the other camp thinks that this might spur the employer to look elsewhere, and not trust me as much (stalling), making the chance of that offer less likely if I ask them to wait.


What is your advice?"

I'm a junior majoring in Information Technology and Management. 

The skill set for this position is: Strong fundamental knowledge of .NET, Java, Visual Studio, Oracle, SQL, SharePoint, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

Now, I am experienced with all of those besides Oracle maybe, but my confusion comes from the job description:
*****
PPL Services has multiple computer/information technology internships available. As an ISD Application Developer intern, you will work with a team of professionals to design, develop, maintain, and support various applications that are critical to the execution of business processes within PPL subsidiaries such as PPL Services, PPL Electric Utilities, PPL EnergyPlus, and PPL Generation. 

Your responsibilities will include contributing to the functionality, reliability, and availability of computer based applications; and helping to develop partnerships by working with internal customers, vendors, consultants, as well as other Information Services personnel. As an intern within ISD you will perform a wide range of project activities that are necessary to architect solutions to real-world business problems by assisting with software development and project management related activities including estimating work, progress reporting, and task scheduling.

*******

Sorry for the long bit of text, but does anyone have a clue as to what exact applications I will be working on in the business world? And what kind of projects and such? I've done a lot of standard applications through a few of my college courses designed for VB, but does anyone have any insight for what I'm in for pending I get this internship?"

1d6jai,7,2013-04-26,Advice for an engineering student,yahallo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1d6jai/advice_for_an_engineering_student/,"***tl;dr*** what to expect in electrical engineering? How to brush up on math and prepare for jr level EE classes?

I’m a second baccalaureate coming into engineering , I graduated about two years ago with my B.S. in biology and unfortunately did not graduate with a stellar gpa nor any work experience. I was adamant on pursuing medicine despite my low gpa, which is basically what I have spent my time with since graduating. At the beginning of this year, I applied to a handful of biology masters programs that would take my MCAT rather than the GRE. Once I saw that the M.S. programs stayed mum, although I did have a decent MCAT score, I figured my chance at med school wouldn’t be any better. I didn’t get in anywhere and decided that I need to move on and look elsewhere for my career goals. 

I’ve applied and gotten into a computer engineering program at a local college and also into an ABET electrical engineering program at another school, and I’m leaning toward electrical. I’ve always had my eye on engineering. I took calculus 1-3, diff eq, and calculus-based physics while I worked on my first degree. Only problem is that I took those classes well over three or four years ago, and I don’t feel as if I remember anything from diff eq. I’ll be taking basic programming and circuit classes this summer, and in the fall:
 
* Electromagnetic Fields
* Digital Systems
* Electronic Circuits
* Linear Circuits

How can I brush up on the fundamentals to prepare for upcoming classes? What can I expect from these upcoming classes? I know the best way to learn more in a field like engineering is to have your own projects. Are there any EE journals of some sort that have the most recent developments in the field, like Nature or Science? What's the story behind a software vs hardware direction an EE grad could take?Would it be wise to pursue an internship for a fall/spring semester? I’m not sure if the workload would be too heavy with a pt job.

I'm currently finishing my 2nd term of study Java at my uni and although I get enough to get by I still don't feel confortable programming. I read and done tutorial after tutorial, uni work, exams etc yet I'm 1 year away from internships and I honestly think I would crumble at that level. I know more than the basics at least but I don't know what level I really am.. 

So I am just wondering if any one can tell me what to do after books and tutorials? I don't know what to do as a project by myself as 1. I'm not that sure of what I can/can't achieve and 2. I don;t really know what to think of as a project! I'm just wondering what the next stages are after learning?

1d5lzn,3,2013-04-26,One week to decide on the next 4 years..,FerretWithASpork,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d5lzn/one_week_to_decide_on_the_next_4_years/,"Hey All,

Recently I got accepted to Rochester Institute of Technology's Computer Science program. When I started going to community college that was my goal, to get into RIT. But now that I have.. I don't know if I can really do it.. Money's a big part of the problem but also.. motivation. I've been at community college for 2 years now. I'm another semester or 2 away from my associates, but I already have a job as a software engineer and have made a great impression at the company.

My 2 years of community college will only transfer as about a semester at RIT. I'd still be a first year student. RIT is about 40k+/year. I've already got ~30k in debt.. and I wouldn't be getting any scholarships or anything, so I'd be doing most of that in loans.. That leaves me with 4 more years in school and coming out with ~150-200k in debt.

I learn best by doing. For a while now I've just wanted to get out of school and get into the working world.. and I've sort of done that. I started off at my job as an intern and... technically I still am but the 2 other interns that started with me have already been let go and they're basically treating me as an employee, training me in areas outside of the project I worked on for the internship, even making me a nameplate. I'm debating asking if I can get a full time salaried position (I'm hourly right now) but that would be kind of pointless/rude(?) if I'm just going to be leaving for RIT at the end of summer.

Another factor is that I've got a boyfriend (side note: I'm a guy.. to clarify). He works as a software engineer at the same place I do (that's where we met &lt;3) and he hates it and really wants to look for a better job. He's already got his bachelors and it probably wouldn't be too hard for him to find a decent job anywhere, and I mostly wouldn't mind moving away with him... but I don't know if *I* could find another job somewhere without even my associates. We'd discussed just moving somewhere else and I finish off my associates at another community college but I've finished all my core classes so I'd be either doing a full semester of shitty gen ed/liberal arts classes, or taking some extra CS courses wherever I end up and stretching it out another year or so before I get my associates.

**TL;DR:** I can't decide between 4 more years of college at a prestegious school coming out with ~200k in debt but an awesome degree and experience.. or continuing at the so-so software development job I have now and try to work my way into the industry and finish my associates on the side..

Thanks for anyone who offers any thoughts, and more so to those that braved that giant book above :P"

I'm in 9th grade (a little young, I know) and was just curious about some things. So lately I've taken in interest in programming and IT (I have an internship this summer). It is something that I have developed a passion for, even though I just started with some python and javascript. Just out of curiosity, I want to know: What were you expected to know when you started your major in computer science and computer engineering? Nothing? Advanced programming? What really is the difference between the two?
Thank you all!"

I feel lost and defeated, what must I do this summer to improve?",lakers222,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d8a5q/currently_doing_bad_in_university_i_feel_lost_and/,"Hello, I just finished my 2nd year in University. I am 95% positive that I have failed one or two courses last semester which would bring me to retake them this summer. I've been in this spot before where I was in probation for having a 1.9 GPA (in my University, it's in effect if you are in between 1.0 to 1.9 GPA). After retaking a failed course during summer, my GPA got back up to 2.2. However, I think this summer might be different. I think my GPA will be lower than 1.9 so I might have to retake 2 courses. I don't mind retaking them and I'm positive I can get A's on two courses that I've taken before.    

However I don't have any money to pay for those courses. My student loan only gives loans if I have 60% of the full course load in a semester so it won't be possible to get a loan from them. My sister currently has a job, and she is willing to pay for one course, asking her to pay for two would be incredibly selfish. My father is unemployed, and my mother has a salary of ~$20k a year so I can't ask them either. I don't even know if I would have to take 1 or 2 courses, but best case scenario is I don't fail anything or I only fail 1. Worst case is I failed more than one.    

I'll have to look for a part-time job this summer in McDonalds or something so I could pay for those courses. I've never had a job in my entire life, so it might take awhile for me to find one because of lack of experience.    

Obviously I've never had internships before as well. I have terrible GPA so I don't even know if I should try to look for one. The co-op program in my school has a requirement of 3.0 GPA, which is next to impossible at this point.    

I don't know what's going to happen to me after University even if I go through all this. I have many reasons and excuses as to why I am doing bad in school, but I know some of you guys have been through worse, so I am not even going to bother putting them up.    

Realisticly the highest GPA I can get is 2.5, and I probably won't even have any job experience. So what's left for me is to improve my skillset.    

I've coded in atleast 5 programming languages in my life and I made games using Dream Maker when I was in grade 8. But clearly I still have A LOT to learn as my GPA shows it.  

I'm asking for advice on what I should work on this summer aside from getting a part-time job at McDonalds. For one, I know I have to work on my Data Structures fundamentals. I've had a chance to work with an Arduino last semester, and I still have the Arduino materials so I probably will do another project this summer. What else must I do in order to be prepared from here on out?     




I have no intention of dropping or giving up on Computer Science.

Also I really know nothing about Boston. Any tips about the social scene would be greatly appreciated and I'd love to meet up with some of you lovely Bostonians!

1d6sxu,29,2013-04-26,Where would you expect a recent CS graduate to fall in the Programmer Competency Matrix?,temp007,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d6sxu/where_would_you_expect_a_recent_cs_graduate_to/,"I am talking about [this](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm) that was linked in a recent question on this subreddit.

**Background:**

I remember reading this chart in my first and second year of CS course and being happy about seeing progress from 2^n to n^2 and in some areas even n. But I feel that I haven't progressed much since I finished my second year of the course. I have focused on AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, and theoretical CS subjects in my third year. The focus was not on good programming practices and improving those, but getting the damn things to work as they should and as well as they could in short deadlines. I am currently doing a masters completely focused on NLP and very research heavy, so there is little programming at all. I have done internships every summer and continued working throughout the year in my second and third year of my undergraduate degree. The final internship in the third year of the course was at a research focused group at university, and focus again was not on good practices but prototyping stuff and getting it to work as well as it could.

I am currently deciding between doing a PhD or going into industry. I recently had a phone interview with a big-4 company for a software engineering position. Since it went okay I might be invited to an interview. However, upon rereading this chart after two years, my heart sank. I feel borderline incompetent, scoring lower in some areas than I used to because I forgot some things as well.

Overall, I got a split of:

* 3 level 2^n
* 15 level n^2
* 5 level n

ignoring the knowledge section as it's a bit specific for positions you are applying/interviewing for.

I am now contemplating rejecting the interview all together if I am invited to avoid embarrassing myself. While I could review some of the material beforehand, I do not have the time to brush up on most of the missing pieces."
1dasy9,0,2013-04-28,I might have a year off... What should I do with my time off?,[deleted],compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1dasy9/i_might_have_a_year_off_what_should_i_do_with_my/,"So I was planning on going to UVA for Fall Semester, but I got waitlisted. I thought it was pretty much guaranteed due to an agreement with my community college, but for some reason I didn't get it. I'm going to talk to an advisor on Monday and the assistant dean at UVA about this, but in the mean time I'm pondering about what I can do for the future. 

Say I do get waitlisted, and I don't get into UVA for fall. There is a two year grace period after I get my associates at my Community College, and I'm pretty sure I'm guaranteed during those two years. I will check to make sure, but I'm almost certain. 

There are some things I can do:

I can a) Wait a year, and go to UVA. This is what I'm leaning towards because I spent the last year doing it solely for this, but apparently I didn't get it. And I love the school of UVA, and it also has a good computer science program. If I do this option, what can I do during this time to increase my stock as a CS major? Should I get an internship or a job? I am planning on doing other things to help the other areas of my life(basketball and writing).

or I could go b ) and go back to George Mason. That's where I originally went to, but I really don't want to go there. I just did not enjoy my time there, and based on academic standings, UVA blows GMU out of the water. I've done a year and a half at GMU, so I'd have to do the same amount of credits at each school(UVA or GMU), but GMU would be done quicker.

And probably the best thing about Tec compared to schools at the US: 70,000 pesos per semester without a scholarship (roughly 7,000 dollars), compared to the enormous amount of money I have to pay per semester in schools at the US. I honestly would love to study at the US, and my parents can afford it, but 7,000 dollars per semester in one of the most prestigious schools in Latin America is very attractive.

The problem is, CS doesnt have a great salary here in Mexico, so Ill probably have to pursue my career at the US. My questions are: would companies at the US take me seriously with a degree from a school in Mexico? Is Tec de Monterrey a good choice? Are the certificates good?

I feel like I am not ready for the real world, which is sad because I am a senior with a semester left of schooling. I am able to handle the projects from my classes and I also program in my free time making apps. But I still feel like I google a ton of questions and need a lot of help still.

My work will be mainly SQL and C#, I was wondering if there was something like Codeacademy I can zip through as a refresher and such. 

I also have never really had a 9-5 job. It's kind of embarrassing but I have no clue what to bring or what to expect. Do I bring a sack lunch? Do they have somewhere to keep it cold or do I make sure its ok sitting out? When I first come to the building do I call the HR lady like i did for the interviews? Just a bunch of first day jitters. 

Also my cousin has a wedding 14 hours away on a Friday and my original plans (before I got the internship) was to leave Thursday night to drive there. Is it a big no-no for interns to ask for a Friday off for something like this? Or should I just suck it up and miss the wedding for work?"

  Background: I was kind of lost when I came to university. Money issues were a concern (as I'm paying for college myself) and I kind of realized that I will most likely never be communicating with my immediate family for reasons I will not disclose. My main goal was to make money, what else would you expect from a kid who has  financially burdened his entire life. So I decided to go the econ route, but I hated it. It wasn't my true passion. I needed to be mentally stimulated; I needed to produce something. I decided I need to go with something I'm more interested in and get a technical major.

  I need to decide on a major, and I just thought i could use other perspectives from the guys on this subreddit. I'm an undecided rising sophomore, but I'm pretty sure I want to be a software engineer when I graduate. I have an internship this summer as one, and hopefully this will reaffirm my beliefs. The only thing is, I am fascinated by the ability to create hardware slightly and build. Tony Stark is my hero (actually), and I remember reading in the comics he had dual degree in EE and CS 
  
I go to a top 5 university for engineering/cs. We are top 5 for ECE, CS, Software Engineering (Grad, not offered undergrad, but will be within 10 years), Robotics, and Human-Computer Interaction.

  My options are:
1) ECE degree
2) CS Degree
3) Self-Defined Major in Software Engineering (Mixture of high level CS, ECE, Information Systems, and grad school Software classes) with a double Major in Robotics or HCI (preferably in Robotics).

How would you rank these options fellow Engineering students? Any cautions or general advice."
1d9bbz,1,2013-04-28,School Advice,ppptwang,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d9bbz/school_advice/,"Hey Reddit,

I have a professor this semester who has been pretty awful. After working hard on a website for this class with two other groupmates, the professor really, *really* hated it. It came as a surprise, as we had been checking in regularly to make sure we were on track in class. She belittled it to the point where one of my groupmates broke into full-on tears, and blamed the other for being 'a terrible group leader' and that 'this must be a recurring problem, why do you break apart groups like this'. Ever since, I have dreaded going to class to the point where I feel ill. 

The event that was connected with the website happened and is over. The website, at this point, was meant to serve as an archival service for all of the students whose work was part of the event.

Since the event has happened, the badgering about the website has gotten yet worst. Several things have happened, all of which have been incredibly upsetting:

1.) The head of the department sent an email to the class saying that he thought that the way the show was handled was an embarrassment to the department. It felt like a way to embarrass the students who had worked on it, as he sent it to the entire class instead of the students who he knew had worked on it.

2.) The professor has brought it up two classes ago to the entire class to say that he/she had shown the site to some ""Mediocre startups"" in the area looking for interns who had then stopped talking to her after seeing it. She had prefaced this with, ""I don't mean to make anyone feel bad but..."" and then told us that the website was so horrible that mediocre startups didn't want us to be working for them because of it.

3.) The professor has since insisted that one of my other groupmates change the website from this year's version to last year's version, meaning that it no longer serves as a website to see the work from the students in this year's event. Any student who intended to link to it as a place where potential employers can see their work will no longer be able to.

4.) The professor has since been muttering under her breath after I talk to her in class. One classmate who happened to be near her when she was muttering said that she was saying something nasty but wouldn't elaborate.

I have never had a professor and department head be so rude and hurtful. What was most aggravating about the process was that professors leading up to the event were unhelpful and even acted in ways that were counterproductive to us getting the event set up and going (I can enumerate on these as well, but as they aren't directly related to the current problem of ""What do I do now that this is over"" I will add them if they're requested). I have absolutely no idea what do to in a situation like this, and I am incredibly stressed out about getting a good grade. What makes everything that much worse: I am forced to have her as a professor next semester, as she is the only one who teaches that section of the class. Any negative actions I could take against her right now while this is still a bitter taste in my mouth could potentially backfire very negatively next semester.

Please Reddit. I have no idea what to do in a situation like this."

I was hired to primarily work on Cisco gear as I have a CCNA certification.This is my first real IT job, though I did do a 3 month internship prior to this doing similar work. My background is definitely more focused on the networking side of IT.

With the companies IT manager leaving, I have been given a promotion of sorts (a raise too!). I am now responsible for administering our production servers. We have 6 Linux servers that we provide SIP service to some of our clients, both to IP PBXs and individual phones.

These serers were set up by a third party, and I feel out of my league. 

I already know I need to learn about doing backups (Should I back up the whole drive, or just the MySQL databases??). I need to learn how to properly manage hardware, such as how do I install a new disk and mount it? Some  servers are clustered, I know there is a virtual server in this setup, but how do I manage clustering?

Does anyone have any advice for me? what tasks should I try to learn? any good resourcesI could read?



**Edit**

Thanks for all the replies everyone!

I plan on ordering a copy of *The Practice of System and Network Administration* as I have seen this book recommended frequently

Having a dev VM is obviously a great idea, but building one form scratch may not be possible. There is proprietary software running on these servers, so the company that set them up probably won't let me have access to all the source files. I will see if I am allowed to image one of the servers during a maintenance window to get a dev copy for myself.

Thanks for all the suggestions regarding backup and monitoring software, I will research the suggestions to see which ones I will want to try."

So i was taking care of family memeber, i started a master program in Electrical engineering -control systems in France in a university ""among the best in france"", i graduated in sep 2012 , while there i wan't able to find a job in my career promptly, so i thought while looking for a job i'll learn additional skill ""numerical and programming skills"" that is related and complimentary, i started a second master in sep 2012 in applied mathematics....now in April 2013, i am about to finish ""the program in france is only one year if you have already another master""...

my concern now that i am returning to the states, i would like to know, how i should i answer this jump in my career, first being a job that didn't had engineering application, then going abroad and getting a second master degree in applied mathematics....i'm concerned that this would reflect as somebody who doesn't know what he's doing, when in truth it's just that job requires sometime and a bit of luck...., i'm keep thinking that all this detailes would likely to evoke a sense of instability from my side for an employer, i don't like too much explanation, and emotions in job interviews as we all know that is in fact viewed negatively.

Thanks a lot for your inputs"
1db5s3,1,2013-04-28,I Might Have A Year Off... What Should I Do With My Time Off?,paki123,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1db5s3/i_might_have_a_year_off_what_should_i_do_with_my/,"So I was planning on going to UVA for Fall Semester, but I got waitlisted. I thought it was pretty much guaranteed due to an agreement with my community college, but for some reason I didn't get it. I'm going to talk to an advisor on Monday and the assistant dean at UVA about this, but in the mean time I'm pondering about what I can do for the future. 

Say I do get waitlisted, and I don't get into UVA for fall. There is a two year grace period after I get my associates at my Community College, and I'm pretty sure I'm guaranteed during those two years. I will check to make sure, but I'm almost certain. 

There are some things I can do:

I can a) Wait a year, and go to UVA. This is what I'm leaning towards because I spent the last year doing it solely for this, but apparently I didn't get it. And I love the school of UVA, and it also has a good computer science program. If I do this option, what can I do during this time to increase my stock as a CS major? Should I get an internship or a job? I am planning on doing other things to help the other areas of my life(basketball and writing).

or I could go b ) and go back to George Mason. That's where I originally went to, but I really don't want to go there. I just did not enjoy my time there, and based on academic standings, UVA blows GMU out of the water. I've done a year and a half at GMU, so I'd have to do the same amount of credits at each school(UVA or GMU), but GMU would be done quicker. 

What would you recommend?"

I've got some good opportunities lined up (I've got a paid internship this summer), but last night I read an article about the 25 highest paying software dev jobs, which both inspired me and motivated me to push myself towards a greater expertise in my field.

I've thought of grad school or working for a while and then going back to school to get more degrees (like in physics and/or electrical engineering) to widen my usefulness and marketability.  How worth it would this be?  Also, what sort of extracurricular resources (preferably free) are there to grow my general knowledge?

TL;DR - How can I maximize my chances of landing prestigious, hi paying jobs in the software dev field?"

* (1) Apply to like 1000 programming positions (pretty easy to do when you see how many are on Dice, Indeed, Monster, etc.) and hope I can get scooped up by 1 that will take an entry-level candidate. 
* (2) Take some lame-ass job for now, but start doing project on StackOverlow and GitHub so that I can, in a year or so, point to some experience and hope that gets me a job. 
* (3) Try to get a position as an intern. Some companies will take new graduates as interns.

Also, what do you think of my plan?",fishmoth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1deh52/is_it_possible_to_get_an_internship_for_the/,"Hey Guys. A little background first. I graduated last June with a B.S. in Computer Science. My GPA was good but unfortunately I didn't do much in the way of internships or preparation for the job search, which is something I regret alot. Because of this, I haven't been able to find a job for almost a year now. I came close a couple times but nothing ever materialized. 

My backup plan has been to go to Grad school in the Fall if I don't find a job by then, which is seeming pretty likely now. I'm not only doing it to further my education, but also so that I can do a couple internships and improve my chances of finding a job after I'm done. The thing is, most internships seem to require enrollment in university, and I was wondering if it was possible/likely to  get an internship for the summer before my first year.

I would also like to hear your thoughts on my plan and whether there is a better alternative. I have just gotten so frustrated with the job search and the ever-expanding time gap on my resume that I feel like Grad school + internships could be the shot in the arm that my situation needs. I already applied and got accepted to one school, and am waiting for a response from another. I also don't have any college debt breathing down my neck, which makes grad school make a bit more sense for me I think. Well, any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading. "

1de6tv,5,2013-04-30,Am I spreading myself too thin in school?,duckieprez,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1de6tv/am_i_spreading_myself_too_thin_in_school/,"Woah, first post on Reddit. It’s pretty unreal after a couple years of lurking. Pretty long post, just a lot of thoughts going on… 

Anyway, so looking back, I’m pretty proud of myself after surviving a rough freshmen year that included depression brought on by homesickness and social/love life issues. Now I’m just finishing up my sophomore year, and life in general is looking better. I’m double-majoring in Film and Business. I’m a member of the marching band, the Filmmaking Club on campus, and I’m about to start working as a trip leader for my school’s Outdoor Club. Most of my weekend days are taken up by some sort of school event, whether it be a football game (particularly in the fall, though we have basketball games to attend in the spring) or student film shoots that occur sporadically throughout the year. I make pretty good grades too, with around a 3.75 GPA. As an introvert, I’m fairly pleased with my social life. I hang out with friends on weekends, occasionally going to parties (around once a month). There are days when I just enjoy time to myself, just watching Netflix and playing videogames for hours on end. These are probably my favorite days, the ones that really recharge me.

I don’t find my classes particularly difficult this semester (taking 15 hours), but next semester, I’m planning on bumping it up to 18 hours on top my involvements. Even though one of the classes I’m planning on taking isn’t required at all (Intro to Computer Science), it’s something that interests me and I figured it would be useful knowledge. Career-wise, what I really want to do is to become an Animator, either for film or videogames (hence why I thought a small bit of comp sci. knowledge would be helpful). The film program I’m in at my school, however, mostly focuses on live-action filmmaking, with only one animation class offered here so far (which I took). Thus, since my school doesn’t focus on animation much at all, I have to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to practicing it in order to train myself for my future career goals.

On top of all of that, I’m worried about about my summer plans—trying to figure out summer school combined with an internship and working at home during a month off. Deciding on my future is exciting, but it’s starting to just really stress me out. Tonight while I was in the library, I was beginning to think that I was spreading myself too thin, with my double-major in Film and Business, on top of extracurricular activities (band, Outdoor Club, Filmmaking Club, which could almost be considered schoolwork), on top of summer plans, on top of career goals in animation that I have to focus on working toward outside of class, in addition to a decent social life that keeps me satisfied. Plus, as a naturally lazy introvert, this sort of busy lifestyle is not what I naturally lean toward. So I can’t tell if this is just the college experience of exploring different aspects of life, or if I am starting to spread myself too thin, with too many areas of interest and not enough focus on what I REALLY want to do after school.

1de50f,0,2013-04-30,Is building and rebuilding a code toolbox a good idea for learning?,vulcant,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1de50f/is_building_and_rebuilding_a_code_toolbox_a_good/,"I taught myself the basics (loops, variable types and even some OOP) of programming during the last two years of high school. It wasn't until my freshman year of college that I actually took programming in a formal classroom environment. C and a bit of C++ was taught and I did quite well at it since they were covering the core concepts again. 

Recently, I got an internship at a company for application development. I felt confident doing the programming required of my first-year engineering course (we later built an autonomous robot) but I am very nervous about the internship. I was browsing around and found a [Competence Matrices](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm) link and that certainly didn't help my nervousness. 

To avoid the feeling of being swallowed, I have gone back to my C textbook and am currently working on the harder exercises in it. My question to you all is: 

**tl;dr:** Do you build your own classes, methods, programs that you later just use as tools from your coding toolbox? If so, would it be a good idea to start building up this toolbox by learning about each tool and then making it?

 I'm trying to make that knowledge jump from an ""advanced beginner"" to an ""intermediate"" that knows a decent amount about more complex subjects of programming--not just basic things like loops, variables, methods, etc."

UIUC and UoW both really support internships, but I'm not quite sure which would be better at landing me one.
