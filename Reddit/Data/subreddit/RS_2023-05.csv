I will be graduating in a couple weeks with a Bachelor’s in Electrical & Computer Engineering from a top 30 school. I’ve been trying to find an entry-level job for months now, but I only seem to hit dead-ends. I struggled to find internships too, so I still don’t have industry experience, unfortunately. Ideally, I would want a job in the Semiconductor industry, but honestly I’d take anything at this point (except for consulting). I have had recruiters ghost me, lead me on for weeks to no avail, or just outright reject me.

Alternatively, I have gotten into the Master’s program at my soon-to-be alma mater, and I already told them yes, but I would have to take out a hefty loan to pay for that, so I’m definitely still on the fence. I would be concentrating in nanoscale electronics & photonics. As an international student, I do not have the option to work and have my employer pay for me to do my Master’s part-time, so it’s either-or.

I seem to oscillate between which one is the best option. I’m naturally an indecisive person, so big life decisions like this freak me out haha (I’m a work in progress, I know!). I’ve thought about reaching out to my LinkedIn network for help to find a job, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea.

I have all the skills expected of an EE/CE graduate AND a physics background, and I have done a few cool things in my four years here. I know the job market is over-saturated right now, what with the mass layoffs in tech, and I’ve heard so many things like “keep your chin up!”, “The first one’s always the hardest!”, “What’s good for you will come to you!” And they make my blood boil lol.

Sorry if this is more of a rant, but I guess what I really want guidance with is, should I go for my Master’s? I’d have to be broke and living paycheck to paycheck for one more year, but is it worth it? I seem to be getting mixed answers depending on whom I ask (all my professors say yes, but a lot of people online say no). How fucked am I in the job industry right now? I just need ONE person to be real with me. I definitely feel like I’m spiraling."

I am applying for teaching positions after finally finishing my childhood dream of becoming a teacher. I have had a long journey to get where I currently am. I am a first generation University student who is also low income as well. 

Long story short, I have worked as a TA in another school system and also a daycare where I was traumatized and developed PTSD (I have been seeing a therapist ). I also didn’t have the best experiences at a handful of my internships as educators put their hands on students. 

Anywho, I am now currently trying to find a career and am anxious that I will experience more trauma. I am feeling overwhelmed and discouraged at the moment. 

I am wondering if anyone has advice on how to advocate for yourself/educators and find the right fit safe space? 

I also am curious about NEA/VEA (as I currently live in Virginia.) I would love to join, but need more information about it first.

I can use any/all advice, please!"

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in CS last week (April 2023) and I don't have a job offer yet. I'm very worried about the resume gap and it's starting to impact my self-esteem. 

I believe I checked all the boxes: research experience, two internships, on-campus involvement, 3.8+ gpa, and even co-founded a successful startup. I'm going crazy trying to find where I went wrong!

I have applied to 200-300 applications, got 10 interviews and 0 offers. What should I do from here on out? Please don't tell me to keep applying, at this point there are like a handful of new grad positions mostly from quant firms. I genuinely need actionable advice.

Here is my resume: [https://imgur.com/a/tfNdUJo](https://imgur.com/a/tfNdUJo)

These are the paths I have in mind:

* Masters in CS (have no idea where to start, prolly too late)
* Just keep applying (kinda hopeless tho)
* Work on my startup full-time (very risky)

What should I do? Please help!"

1. Research Intern at CU Anschutz Medical Campus - It was a lot of novel research relating in the biophysics department but there was a heavy engineering slant because electrical signals were essentially the research basis (all the equipment had to be custom made as well); got a rodent handling certification lmao
2. Sustainability Intern at an environmental consulting company - Helped plan this high-voltage power lane that scales across the US midwest, and I designed a remote water sampling device and accompanying protocol for market use
3. Youth Advisory Board Treasurer for a large nonprofit that serves children and their families across the state - $750,000 was raised for Marshall Fire families through my initiative and use of all board members, but besides that I did normal treasurer duties
4. Secretary-General for my school's Model United Nations - I arranged multiple state conferences and served as a presiding officer whenever I could, so I would say I had decent involvement on the state level.
5. National Honor Society - I see some people list this as an honor but we would have meetings every other week and volunteering requirements to fulfill so there was definitely a time commitment, I was ""school ambassador"" for my first year where I streamlined volunteer hour validation via spreadsheet; I did do a lot of tutoring for it specifically though
6. Senior Volunteer at the same nonprofit that I was Board Treasurer at. Volunteered here for 4+ years so I have accumulated a lot of hours, but a highlight of this was training other volunteers in checking clients out using our database
7. SNHS - not much to say here, I did tutor through this as well, but in Spanish
8. Team Leader at a Carwash - A lot of time spent training new employees as well as improving current ones, I also did sales and customer loyalty/memberships

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. MUN, Best Position Paper - I got this award at least once for 3 consecutive years
2. Seal of Biliteracy - Awarded by the state for attaining proficiency in another language
3. AP Scholar with Distinction lmfao
4. Academic Excellence - one award for all years of HS
5. AP Scholar - kind of ironic at this point given my complaint about my AP scores

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Spanish (10/10). I had her for Spanish IV the year prior and we got to know each very well to where we can crack mildly threatening jokes at each other. We also worked on NHS and SNHS, she is aware of my volunteering background. She showed me her letter and recognized me as a rarity within her 15+ years of teaching, among other things (idk about the whole weight of these statements though). 

Calc III (9/10). Had him for Calc II the prior year and I know him decently well. I felt that his significant background and relevance to my interests were important for me to include. He told me he thinks he wasn't the best at writing LORs but that he always sets aside a couple of hours for every student. I suspect that I might be one of his favorites, but he did not let me see his letter.

Counselor (8/10). Know her OK. I know that she had my back and we spoke about important things occasionally but that's about it. I could only think that she did a pretty good job

**Interviews**

I don't know what are green or red flags in these but I will discuss them anyways and see what you all think

Stanford: 45 min. We clicked pretty well on my sustainability internship because of his background but we also connected over finance (he explained its important in attaining high-level business roles) and ultimate frisbee. (9/10)

MIT: This was crazy it was like 90min. Occasionally awkward but she liked how I essentially explained myself as a calculus addict. She also liked my research background/future interests and how I wanted to extend it into a master's. She was familiar with my school's STEM program as well. She was a CPA and I know how to do taxes so we bonded over that lolz (8/10)

Princeton: 30-45min. Eccentric guy but I think it went OK because we talked about immortality, but I also felt like it was almost entirely him speaking. (6/10).

Duke: \~30min. Short and sweet. She was familiar with the nonprofit I mentioned but it felt a little difficult to connect with her because of her major compared to the previous interviews. I got to discuss more of my personal interests a lot more here but it was never awkward at any moment. (8/10).

**Essays**

I worked on my Stanford prompts like two weeks in advance, and their quality made me feel very hopeful. They felt like a 10/10 to me, so I will leave it at that. my personal essay was on the identity prompt. It was my second write, and although it was mechanically superior to my first write, I feel like it was lacking point, a unique one at that. I want say like 6/10 or something but I'm really not sure. It was about my parent's experience with the Bosnian Massacres of the 1990s and how they had to flee their dreams, aspirations, and reality, leading into how I felt obligated to pick it up but it became more of a blessing than a burden. The rest of my school-specific prompts were made 1-3 days prior to their due date. I would lowkey give all of them like a 7+/10 I feel like I became very adept at writing ""good"" essays at that point.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Not too much different from banking perhaps. 

So lately, especially in SEA, weather has been freaking hot and humid, and in order not to suffer from any heat injuries or dehydration, I have been drinking lots of water in order not to fall sick or suffer from heat exhaustion as I am still young and have a very long future ahead of me. 

I have seen how my friends have been falling sick even before exams or during their internship or work and I could well understand where they are coming from. 

So lately, it's been quite a good but shag experience for me, been able to travel around to learn the various aspects and responsibilities as an engineer, from engineer technologist, planning, supervising and researching and I am glad that I need not stay in office everyday but time is spent mostly on site. 

We need to work with people, as well as attending meetings at other people's territories as well, and it could last for 2.5 hours, which can pose quite a problem as dry throat would mean coarse voice and its not ideal during meetings and discussions. 

I have always not wanting to look like a weirdo bringing my water bottle around like a fool but as I got older, I know that times have changed and its not as before. 

So just last week, I was told to head on site to collect and analyse data as a research engineering technologist, I was told to be on site at 8.30am till 12.30pm where we will pause for lunch and then continue from 1.30pm till 4pm under full humidity. I was told to drink lots of water before heading to the site. I have heard from friends who have to hold their bladder for 3 hours and even ended up peeing or soiling their pants as it may not be as easy as it seems to head to the toilet so they choose not to drink up till like an hour before lunch, and they suffered from dehydration after 2 days of doing so. 

So what I did was that on the day before I headed to the site, I went to buy adult diapers from departmental store nearby and wore it on the day if reporting to the site, and true enough, toilet wasn't accessible as it seems and the weather was really hot and humid that just throughout that first 4 hour leg, I have been drinking lots of water that during lunch I have to buy another 2 bottles of water in order to keep myself hydrated. 

I was skeptical of wearing adult diapers at first as it was my first time and just imagine that you have to wear it in your jeans or office pants (with belt), and friends recommended me to wear my underwear over it to make it more secured so that there will be no crinkle sound when I pee in particular. 

Left home with a white polo tee, light blue jeans with white underwear worn over my diapers, reported to the site 15 minutes earlier and I was so thankful that I wore it. 

About an hour at the site coordinating and working, I suddenly had the urge to pee due to the fact that I drank up before and had tea before work, so I remained stunned for a few seconds and decides to just push my pee out (honestly I was worried about leakage as I am wearing light coloured), my mind went blank while peeing in the diapers for about 30 seconds with my colleague calling out to me to ask if I am alright. I said I am alright and he got me to drink more water as I looked pretty shag. So I drank. 

Then the next hour, I needed to pee again, this time round I was actually talking and working physically and couldn't afford to go mind blank, so literally I took it easy and peed as though nothing had happened. 

I was so glad that when it was lunch and I could see my colleagues rushing to toilet as though they were escaping from danger, by then I can sense that my diapers were quite wet and thankfully my underwear held it well. 

So we had a filling lunch of curry rice with coffee and went back to work, so this time round, we head back to work at 1.15pm after visiting the toilet and bought bottles of bottled water, did really have the time to change my diapers as I forgotten to bring another pair so just continued my work. So we were told that we have to finish by 4pm as all of us, including the third party wanted to end work off at 4pm to prepare for meeting the next day, so this was why we actually went back to work 15 mins earlier. 

Then it's like about an hour or so passed, I suddenly need to have a combo of number 1 and 2, it was my first time having to answer nature's call in the afternoon, I was lost for words as there I was doing my work and on the hand I have to get my poop out as peeing was way easier. It was kind of weird to push hard with the ""hmph, hmphhhhh"" sound loud in front of my colleagues and when they looked at me, I told them I was just stretching myself. 

Work ended, and I went to the nearest toilet to remove my diaper, I am thankful that my underwear was still pretty dry and threw away my heavily soiled and wet diaper after cleaning myself. Thankfully I didn't develop diaper rash after wearing it for 8 hours and could not imagine what would have happened if I didn't wear it, my white Calvin Klein underwear would have been the toilet. Yes, wearing diapers with jeans and maybe office pants may seem tight and a little uncomfortable, but it is alright as I need not feel puzzled over rushing to the toilet or what if I couldn't make it in time. The real discomfort and perhaps stress  is where you need to go to the toilet but can't do so thus holding it in and stressed over when can you go to the toilet."
134eczq,7,2023-05-01,A Junior Developer's Journey of Learning and Growth,Harland_Pherox,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/134eczq/a_junior_developers_journey_of_learning_and_growth/,"My programming journey began in May 2015 when I learned the basics of web development. I continuously worked on several small web projects to improve my skills until January 2016 when I stopped learning web development to start what really motivated me - game development. I started learning pygame to make 2D games and built several small 2D projects during this period. This was my first encounter with the game dev industry and it taught me the essence of community. During this time, I joined several developer communities and was introduced to Panda3D, a Python library for building 3D game applications. I built a few projects with Panda3D before abruptly ceasing to develop/code due to personal issues.


In late 2018, I started learning game development again. I had to restart learning after about 8 months of not coding. I picked up Python again for about 2 months and was brushing up on my skills when I came across a YouTube video titled ""Unreal or Unity for Game Dev Beginners"". I ignored the video at first, but those two words - ""Unreal"" and ""Unity"" - stuck in my head.


In February 2019, I was surfing the internet and remembered what I had seen a few months back. This led me down a rabbit hole of articles, podcasts, blogs, and videos on ""Unreal or Unity, which engine is best to learn as a game developer"". During this period, I installed Unreal on my PC and got started with C++ basics. After more than 3 months of deciding on what engine to learn, I finally uninstalled Unreal for Unity. Some of the convincing reasons were the Unity community being bigger, it being easier to get started with Unity and C#, a larger percentage of indie companies using the engine, some popular MWU game apps, the cross-platform portability of Unity projects, and several other usages of the engine apart from making game apps (which is also a feature of Unreal).


I started learning game development with Unity in mid-2019. I began with learning C# through tutorials, online courses, podcasts, YouTube videos, and several other resources. My learning continued till February 2021, during which I developed several personal projects based on functions, tools, and 3rd party libraries that I had learned. During this period, I learnt to read Unity documentation, leverage community forums and senior developers for consultation and solving bugs, and I also took a Udemy course on Blender for 3D modeling.


By August 2021, I started participating in game jams. A memorable one was the Care Jam organized by Code Coven, the theme of which was creating a game centered around care. It was my first time collaborating with a team of 3D artists, developers, producers, and music producers across different time zones. Several obstacles bubbled up, including choosing what time to meet up and discuss matters, a teammate quitting during the jam, and having to crunch to meet the deadline. Despite the issues, it was an exhilarating experience for me. I was the programmer in the team and was responsible for making sure the project came out as a whole piece. Our project got ranked among the top 10 submissions.


In September 2021, I landed my first internship working alongside a senior developer on-site. Working closely with the senior developer greatly improved my coding and debugging skills. I also learned how to utilize project management and version control tools on big projects. Although the internship ended in December 2021, I continued to seek out opportunities in the industry. I applied for several remote internships but received little response. However, I did receive an interview with a software company looking to create a game development team. After submitting an apk and a video showcasing my game development skills, I was informed that HR would get back to me once things were put in place. Unfortunately, I never received any further communication from them. As a result, I decided to organize my portfolio and add my previous work to it.


In April 2022, I secured a remote internship role with a game studio. The internship proved to be a rollercoaster ride as I stepped out of my comfort zone and took on new challenges. I began by analyzing previous game apps and suggesting ways to improve their mechanics and gameplay. Later, I was assigned the task of formulating innovative ideas for new game apps and then had to develop prototypes for these ideas. I also served as the developer for three other projects that were to be produced by the studio. During my eight months at the studio, I worked closely with senior designers, developers, and artists. The internship helped me to hone my skills in a professional setting and taught me how to use game design documents effectively, as well as how to collaborate and communicate remotely.


In January 2023, I received a message via LinkedIn asking if I was interested in a game development contract role. I was tasked with designing and developing a game app from an idea phase to a working vertical slice, which I submitted to the project manager. Shortly after, I was offered a short-term contract to sift through a vast codebase and fix bugs that had been discovered during internal and external testing. These roles helped me to further improve my ability to work in a professional setting, be self-starting, and work within deadlines.


Throughout this entire period of learning and improving myself as a game developer, I also developed skills in photography, graphic design, taekwondo, Spanish, and a degree in computer science. All these experiences and skills were geared towards making me a better developer. I know I still have a long way to go, but I am excited about what the future holds. I hope to develop impactful and exciting applications in the years to come and am eager to take the next steps. I am actively seeking game developer roles and would appreciate any referrals or job opportunities that come my way. I am always eager to connect and network."

**LORS/Essay (I'd say pretty solid):**

1. AP Psychology teacher who intruiged me through her lecture on linguistics and got me interested in the brain and speech. As a result, I took it upon myself to find a research internship at Northwestern University.
2. Honors Chinese teacher because I have always had an interest in Mandarin. From her, I've been pursuing my interests in Chinese culture outside of school (I.e. residential Chinese programs at University) and studying abroad in Taiwan."

Anyways, the dilemma i have is that I am currently junior starting next Fall in college and I work for a medical supply company near my university. I am moving back home on the summer and also landed a summer camp job that’s closer to home and pays well. Obviously it doesn’t help with my experience but it does help pay the bills. If I were to keep my internship, I would have to commute 50 miles at least 2 times a week and on top of that work the summer camp job hours. It would be nice for the extra cash to work both jobs but also the 50 mile commute seems exhausting and a huge chunk of my paycheck already. I spoke to my bosses about the summer and since it’s a regular office IT Internship, things look to be a bit stale rn but over the summer there are many projects planned and might be very helpful to my resume. I’ve been at this Internship since September 2022 and it’s been a great learning experience in terms of setting up systems for the employees and installing softwares for them while also having some downtime since things are slow. Anyways, I’ve been thinking if it would be better for me to leave now, work my summer job, come back for fall semester look for a new IT internship or CyberSec so i have more experiences. 

TLDR : In college, have my internship which is 50 miles away and new summer job which is close to home, should i work both or should i leave my internship to pursue more experience during the next school year?"

So sorry if it’s a bit confusing. 

I graduated college in December with a bachelors in cyber, I had one internship for about 6 months where we mostly conducted vulnerability tests on IoT devices. When I got out of college I didn’t really have the best experience trying to find a job mainly due to location. When I finally found a job (my current position). I was hesitant because the pay was only $40k gross. The job title is PC/Lan tech for a org that provides services to school districts. To be honest, I interviewed to be a software support specialist but they put me as a tech. 

When I first started my job it was fun and there was tons of things to do because I was going around to random schools training. Now, I’m stuck at a smaller school where I maybe get 3 tickets a day. It feels like I have zero things to do all day and was wondering if anyone has any suggestions of what I should do? 

I eventually wanna move into the networking team here so I’m studying for my net+ during work. I wanna ask how I can move to that side of things but I’m new so I feel as if it’s rude to even ask. 

My manager literally chills and watches baseball all day when he’s here. It feels like I’m getting paid for nothing some days, and to be honest, I don’t really like it. Any response will help thanks."

A few years ago, I got a master's degree in public policy in Washington, D.C. I worked hard, made good grades, got good internships and did all the things I needed to do. Three years after graduating and after hundreds of applications, I still don't have a job in my field. In 2020, I moved back to my home state where there aren't jobs in my field but needed to save money, and I got a job at a library because that's what I could find. I'm still there after over two years.

Through my applications, I got connected with someone who essentially said that it's a competitive field and that it helps to know the right person. I realized only in hindsight that I mostly applied to jobs online. I did attend networking events in school, but even that was stressful for me and felt like a lot. I'm realizing that I didn't talk to a lot of people in grad school and I just didn't have a lot of friends. I mostly kept to myself, so now I don't even have a lot of people that I can ask for a favor.

I've done everything I can think of to get help. I have reached out to the few people I do know, and I've used LinkedIn a lot.  It's so stressful for me, but I keep doing it. I did recently get a referral that got me a job interview, but I ended up not getting the job.

I feel like social anxiety has really held me back. I'm trying my best to fight it and meet people, but in a field where jobs depend on who you know, it feels like it's not enough. I just feel completely overlooked and ignored. Has anyone else has the same struggle with networking?"

Hello everyone, I'm writing this post to discuss the difficult that I found to search a job in Netherlands. I explain you my situation in details. I'm a 28 guy, I studied in Italy ( Ms.c in molecular biology ) until march 2022 with a thesis topic in Medical Microbiology and then I moved in Rotterdam. I applied for Research technician/ Research assistant position ( especially in Leiden or Amsterdam ) but all the companies, research institutes and hospitals refused my job application because I have no experience or often other candidates matches better with the job requirements, in their opinions. I compared the study program between Italy and Netherlands and I figured out that the Italian students make more exams and theory than the Dutch one. So, I tried to applied for a ""simple"" position to climb in a company's rank and make experience here in Netherlands but the recruiter said ""You're overrated for this position, you've got a Ms.c in biology"". I thought that a recruiter can help me better than the others and I contacted directly the HR or the laboratory manager of some company but the answer were always the same ""we do not have an open position and therefore will not be able to assist you further"" without an advice or tips. It's a terrible loop. They didn't call me even for an interview. I feel discouraged because the desire to start after 7 years of study is immense but nobody give a chance after 1 year from my degree. What a new graduate must do to draw attention? Which positions can I apply? I attached a Fac-simile of my resume and cover letter. I hope that someone could give me a tips to improve the CV / cover letter if is necessary or explain me what should I do for sorted out this problem

COVER LETTER 

Dear Miss/Mr, My name is x and I'm a recent graduate in Biology ( Ms.c ) at Federico II University. I chose this faculty because it perfectly matches my most important characteristics: the curiosity that has distinguished me since childhood, my passion for science, and the need to see a purpose in what I dedicate myself to. These same reasons and my fascination for microbiology led me to apply for this job. Thank you for taking the time to review my materials and consider me. I decided to focus my Master’s Degree studies ( Ms.c ) on Molecular and cellular biology which have allowed me to extend my knowledge of the function of biological macromolecules and the cellular processes in which they are involved and a solid theoretical preparation in the following sectors: molecular microbiology, biochemistry, and protein engineering; molecular genetics and advanced molecular biology; genomics and computational biology. My experience to test the antifungal/antibacterial activity of the corticosteroid PYED 11hydroxy16α,17αepoxy3,20dione-- 1 (pregnadiene1) against Candida spp. ( Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida k rusei ) and Staphilococcus aureus responsible for most drugresistant infections has given me a real understanding of the importance of the research. In addition, I studied how the natural monomeric stilbenoid resveratrol (RV) was able to modulate the susc eptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and benzalkonium chloride (BZK) biocides in Acinetobacter baumannii. This study analyzed a panel of reference strains and clinical isolates of Gramnegative bacteria, Grampositive bacteria, and yeasts tole rant to one or both biocides. Also, I took several laboratories and groups of researchers where I acquired practical experience in PCR, multiplex RTPCR, DNA extraction, SDS, MALDI TOF, and ELISA. Thanks to my project and my university careers path, I learned a lot about a wide range of topics such as working with bacteria/fungi and finding the right way to treat this terrible disease. I spent 2 years in Federico II hospital for my duties and now I am more determined to do something to contribute in the best way I can. At the Department of Medicine Microbiology, I worked as part of a closeknit team of researchers from different disciplines and nationalities. This increased my confidence in communicating my research to those outside my field and improved my int ercultural skills. Furthermore, I understand the difficult of research work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how repetitive my tasks are. Unfortunately from my background, many recruiters think that I have specific skills but my Ms.c has allowed me to deepen various aspects of biology.  Indeed, the practical experience isn't at the level of those who studied here in the Netherlands but with an important theoreti cal background, I'll be able to compensate for this gap. I have not interested in salary or position, what matters to me after 7 years of study is growing up in a company and improving my knowledge/handson under the supervision of other researchers. There fore, the chance to start a new path in Netherlands, where I can face new challenges by having the right tools is exactly what I am looking for. In conclusion, the desire to start is immense and I'm convinced that given the opportunity I would be a nice ad dition to a team and a great funny colleague to work with. I‟ll be more than happy to provide any further information if required. Kind regards"

I completed my interview and a teaching demo, which I felt went perfectly! The thing is, my demo lesson was over a month ago and when I reached out a week after the demo they let me know they have 2 more interviews and then I’ll hear back but it’s been 3 weeks since then  and I haven’t heard back. I am feeling discouraged because im sure they would prefer a veteran teacher over a brand new one who’s just doing an internship, but I’m still hoping there’s a chance. I know they don’t have much time to focus on the art department so it may be just that it’s not high enough on their to do list during this busy time of year… but do you think I still have a chance?

I did apply to non-profit consulting club in my university, and was interested in finance clubs (which I did not get in). I am worried that with a lack of extra curricular activities/leadership on my CV. Even besides the CV aspect, I would like more meaningful activities to pursue and dedicate time.

The thing is, it is the middle of the semester (with nearly 2 months until the end of the semester). Recruiting for any clubs have ended, and will start again next semester. To spend time wisely, I have been studying for the GRE which is a critical aspect of the process.

how can I improve my situation? thank you"

* RBC cc: $8,500 - 10500 limit
* Tangerine loc: $5,900 - 7k limit
* Motusbank loc: $6,900 - 10k limit
* Student loan: $40k (not in repayment until June 2024)

This debt accumulated due to a career change(back to university), having a child, and relocating to Nova Scotia for family support after a loss. 

I started an internship in May 2023 with a $55l/yr salary and I recently got a raise of $60k/yr, and my monthly expenses are:

* Phone: $100
* Internet: $35
* Rent: $1,050
* Power: $100-150 every 2 months
* Oil: $50-100
* Water: $75-150 every 3 months
* Daycare: $227
* Groceries: $200-600 (variable)

I've been making payments on my credit cards and lines of credit, but I don't feel like I'm making significant progress. Selling my car isn't a great option since I need a reliable vehicle for my family to take my daughter to daycare.  


My wife is still payment some of her debts due our relocation and I much prefer that she focus on that first before helping me with anything.

Working as an analyst in an MNC bank for 1 year.
In GRE diagnostic test, scoring over 320 consistently.

Concerned a bit, about doing an IT job, and going to ms in ME. The genuine reason is because analyst in bank pays much higher than ME job in India, also I guess I will be able to justify it in Sop showing my passion for data science and ml, all my research work is centred around that too and thinking about doing ms with thesis around robotics, computer vision etc only.

134x9r3,321,2023-05-01,Succeeding Socially in Your MBA Program: A First-Year's Guide to Navigating the Cliquey World of B-School,SucceedSociallyMBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/134x9r3/succeeding_socially_in_your_mba_program_a/,"As I wrap up my first year in a full-time T15 program, I've noticed a lot of posts on /r/mba about feeling socially left out, struggling to make friends, or not being invited to parties and trips. So, I've decided to share my insights on how to succeed socially in an MBA program, particularly for incoming first years in the fall for full-time programs. 

The hard truth is that the MBA experience can be cliquey and very high school-esque, with people reverting to their high school selves more than even work or undergrad. This is due to the class size being just a few hundred, where it's easier for ""everyone to know everyone."" If you break social norms or commit social faux pas, people will be harsh toward you. T15 MBAs are smart and polished enough to not be blatantly mean to your face, but they will show their disapproval through subtle and passive aggressive means such as ghosting you, ignoring you, stopping inviting you to social outings, muting you on social media, etc. 

It can be especially challenging to navigate for introverts, individuals with social anxiety, those on the autism spectrum, and international students unfamiliar with American culture. In general, MBAs are much more driven, extroverted, and type A than the general population. To thrive socially, it's crucial to accept these social norms and adapt to them. MBAs can be unforgiving to those who fail to follow both written and unwritten social norms. We can all complain about how unfair or arbitrary these rules are, but adapting and thriving is a more practical and beneficial approach than focusing solely on what is good and right.

Here are my top tips for navigating the social scene:

1. **Accept the cliquiness**: The MBA experience can be very cliquey, despite people glamorizing it as a unique opportunity to reset their relationships and make new friends as an adult. Cliques tend to form in the first few weeks, and it can be challenging to break into established social circles after that. Embrace this reality and focus on building genuine connections while forming or joining a clique with classmates you vibe with. Cliques are often based around shared ethnicity, country of origin, hobbies, pre-MBA background (not necessarily professionally but personally), family wealth levels, etc. Common cliques include the classic ""wealthy white people ski trip clique"" as well as the ""Asian ravers clique."" Participate in private group texts within your clique to stay informed about parties, trips, gossip, and events (for this not having an iPhone can be a negative, although some groups are okay with WhatsApp). The ""real"" MBA social experience is through private events, trips, and social gatherings with your friend group, not school-sponsored events. Exclusion and exclusivity are a reality of the MBA program. Repeated positive experiences with your clique is what will create lasting, close friendships. 
2.  **Balance being cliquey with being social.**  Once you've established a social home base, be mindful not to appear overly cliquey. While it's essential to have a solid group of friends (as I outlined above), you should also make an effort to connect with people outside your core crew. The MBA experience is about finding the right balance between maintaining your social base and expanding your professional network. Be cordial and friendly to all, and don't burn bridges. Living with roommates, even those ""outside of your clique,"" is a great way to be ""in the know"" on private social events (although that doesn't mean you can go to every event, especially if it's not open and you weren't invited). 
3. **Be social yet low-key**: Balance your social, outgoing nature with a cool, chill demeanor. This approach will make you more likable and approachable, enabling you to build connections without being overbearing or having too strong of a personality. Overly-gregarious people who barge into conversations, are overly loud, who constantly talk and love hearing their own voice, and cut everyone else off are viewed as really annoying and disliked. Active listening is an essential social skill, as is the natural give and take of conversations. At the same time, if you're extremely introverted, shy, have blatant social anxiety, or can't maintain a conversation with someone, you will lack social at-bats with classmates and won't get social invites. Aim to be confident and develop a strong sense of self-amusement, groundedness, and non-neediness to stand out without coming across as desperate or overly invested in the opinions of others. However, unless you are exceptionally attractive, being cold or standoffish will make others dislike you.
4. **Accept invitations:** Say yes to events, parties, and gatherings to become a familiar face and increase your chances of receiving invitations to more private events. Just remember not to overcommit, as burnout can hinder your ability to genuinely connect with others, or show up to private gatherings (like birthdays) uninvited unless they are genuinely open invite or +1s are allowed. Joining international and domestic trips, both larger and smaller group trips, is a great way to bond with classmates. Overnight trips is what produces a lot of close friends.
5.  **Be a social value giver:** Organize events with mainstream appeal, like hikes, trips, parties, board game nights, cultural celebrations, cooking nights, wine and cheese nights, cocktail-making classes, raves, sports events, tailgates, comedy shows, or music concerts, and invite classmates to join. By offering these experiences, you'll build social capital and increase your chances of being included in others' plans as they will want to reciprocate your efforts. Initiating in-demand events is key to MBA social success. Being nice to others is a bare minimum, and being kind alone won't endear you to others. It's important to develop a unique, appealing personality that draws people in. 
6. **Cultivate in-demand social interests:** Develop in-demand social interests, such as DJing, cooking, cocktail mixing, or playing an instrument. DJs get invited to all of the parties. Pursue hobbies and activities with social appeal, like hiking, biking, skiing, basketball, or joining clubs related to your interests like EDM music production. Pickleball has become the default social activity for our cohort, although some surf, golf, and play tennis. These talents will make you stand out and provide opportunities to bond with others. I'm not condoning nor condemning this, but some of the most popular people in our class were drug dealers who supplied MDMA, cocaine, and ketamine to parties (as well as shrooms and LSD). 
7. **Show genuine interest in others:** Be curious about people's lives and experiences, even if their backgrounds or interests differ from your own. This approach will help you forge deeper connections and avoid coming across as self-centered or superficial. Ask people open-ended questions about themselves and follow-up with thoughtful questions. People love talking about themselves. 
8.  **Balance vulnerability with boundaries:** Bond through vulnerability. The MBA social scene is heavily, heavily based around drinking and going to bars and clubs. People are vulnerable and truthful while buzzed or drunk, and drinking (as well as marijuana) provides a great bonding experience. But be very cautious not to overshare or delve into heavy topics too soon, or you will alienate others. Strive for a balance between openness and maintaining boundaries. Commiserating over rejected summer internship applications and poor grades in Finance class is okay, and can build camaraderie. Opening up about very serious topics like depression or eating disorders with people who are barely acquaintances is TMI and over sharing, which will hurt your social standing. Balance moments of (mild) vulnerability with positivity & lighter conversational topics. It's okay to occasionally ask for help - the main value of an MBA is the network that can help you with job referrals. However, make sure to be a giver and help others too. Never ask for help too much - be mostly self-sufficient. 
9.  **Focus on your appearance:** Like it or not, the most popular people are often conventionally attractive, well-dressed, and physically fit. So, invest in your appearance and hygiene. People DO judge based on physical appearance. 
10.  **Don't be an academic hardo:** Most MBA students prioritize networking and socializing over academics. Don't overemphasize your academic achievements or focus too much on school outside of class. If you do that, people will think you're not fun and there will be a stigma against you. Instead, find non-academic topics to discuss and connect with others. In class, volunteer to contribute effectively but know when to give others a chance, as overly dominating the conversation can be annoying. On the other hand, don't irritate teammates by slacking off on group assignments.
11. **Avoid being seen as ""weird:""**  It's okay to have unique interests or hobbies, but be mindful of how they are perceived. Keep unconventional interests in check, and present them in a way that aligns with your overall image as cool and chill, and focus on connecting with others through mainstream interests. People have forged more friends through beer pong, flip cup, rage cage, and king's cup (as well as some Asian drinking games) than anything else. Some people can pull off the quirky or ""weird in a good way"" vibe, but they are usually conventionally attractive and charming people in the first place, and can balance their unconventional interests with more conventional ones. Strive to be funny, but avoid completely off color jokes or crazy remarks (even while drunk) that will alienate you to others. MBAs gossip, and having a reputation as being weird or not chill will kill your social status and social invites. MBAs are generally the type get weirded out at people who carry a lot of anxiety or are somehow ""off.""
12. **Be mindful of your communication:**  Refrain from spamming classwide Slack channels or WhatsApp groups with excessive messages or irrelevant content. It's important to maintain a positive online presence and avoid being perceived as annoying, both in person and through digital communication, including your texting etiquette. This extends to your personal social media as well - Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, BeReal, etc. - it's okay and good to be social but don't be annoying with your digital presence, since this is the primary way a lot of your class will view you. Focus on contributing meaningfully to conversations and sharing valuable information that benefits the group. 
13.  **Be politically aware but not polarizing:** Align your publicly stated political views with the American center-left or moderate liberal perspective. The majority of people are Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or Joe Biden-style moderate liberals. Most people are not Bernie Sanders or AOC, nor are they Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Moderate liberalism is the default political position of the US elite these days, and it's the same with law and med school. Republicans and conservatives are often vilified and ostracized, while the far-left is a loud minority that people find annoying. If you have views outside of the milquetoast center-left, keep them to yourself or to a small group of close friends. Most people are socially liberal (without being excessively woke) while being moderately fiscally conservative. Be just political enough so that people think you care (mild center-left virtue signaling about news topics in vogue) without overly talking about politics - that'll make you seem annoying. However, you are expected to be up to date on the current politically correct terms and American racial norms - failure to do so, even on accident, can result in ostracization. And avoid third rail topics like Israel-Palestine (the hardos on both sides of this are disliked by our school).
14. **Be aware of the ""how,"" not just the ""what:""** The thing is, when it comes to social skills, it's not always about what you do, it's about when and how you do it. Even if you follow all of the rules above, if your delivery is wrong, you end up weirding people out because you can't sense when your behavior isn't ""landing"" and when and how to tweak it. This part is learning to pick up on social cues, so you can actually be yourself without coming on too strong and making people feel uncomfortable. Observe how people react when you act naturally. People get uncomfortable long before they actually voice their discomfort, and you can pick up on that discomfort early by noticing facial expressions, tone, and body language. If you learn to detect it early and notice what it is that made your conversational partner feel off (are you talking too much? are you talking too loud? are you stuttering? do you look nervous? have they lost interest in the topic but you keep pushing it? are they offended?), you can correct yourself and gain social acceptance without compromising your personality too much. There is nothing worse than an annoying drunk guy or girl barging into a group convo and hijacking it by going on and on something totally irrelevant. 
15. **Meet people where they are at:** This means keeping most conversational topics light in heaviness and vulnerability (occasionally medium but never high) and focusing on mainstream US topics of conversation. Some examples include sports (especially American football and basketball), mainstream movies, reality TV, mainstream TV shows, cooking, beer and wine, travel, fashion, clothes, top 40 music, mainstream EDM, indie music, restaurants, bars, clubs, podcasts, pop culture, health and fitness, tech innovations, music festivals, pets (cats/dogs), etc. In specific ""high culture"" places like NYC, it's in vogue to give lip service to liking Broadway musicals, art museums, classical and jazz music, high fashion etc. reading the New York Times and Economist, listening to ""intellectual"" podcasts, reading academic texts and literature, etc, but if you're too much into these things (except for maybe high fashion), you'll be branded a nerd. Having a dog that you bring with you is an excellent conversation piece. Only bring up niche interests with those you know who share that interest. If you join a group convo at a party or social event, observe what the existing topic is and contribute with good timing, rather than hijacking it and abruptly changing the subject. This approach demonstrates your ability to engage with others and be a good conversationalist.

This guide is meant to show the harsh reality of the social environment at top MBA programs. Again, while we can all complain about how unfair or arbitrary these social norms are, I strongly believe that accepting, adapting, and thriving is more practical and beneficial than focusing solely on what isn't right. On an individual basis, you don't have the ability to fundamentally reshape MBA culture ""for the better,"" but you can control how you react to it. 

By following these tips, you can navigate the social landscape and build lasting connections with your peers."

So I applied to UCSD for CS as my primary major and Math-CS as my secondary and ended up getting in for Math-CS. I also got into software engineering at UCI and am conflicted between the two. Any advice on which would be a better decision and if Math-CS is a good major at all? My main concern is internship and job opportunities as a math-cs major so if anyone has some personal experience with this I'd love to hear from you.

I’m 24m who’s decided he wants to break into a career in IT with no prior experience in the field. I’m currently working on my A+ cert with a long term goal of getting Net+ and Sec+ to hopefully break into something related to cybersecurity. 

I understand it’s nearly impossible to jump straight into a security position with no experience, which is why I plan on getting my A+ and working my way up.

However, I’ve begun to have second thoughts if getting certificates and climbing the ladder is a viable strategy or if I would be better off pursuing a degree. It would put a strain on myself financially to do so but not impossible. 

Do I stay the course or is a bachelors worth it? Is there anyway to get a foot in the door without a degree or college sponsored internship program? Will a cert with no experience get me a job where I can gain experience? Any advice would be appreciated greatly

I applied to some work study positions, But knowing how competitive it is, I’m scared that I would be faced with tens and hundreds of rejections, or potentially being rejected by all, leaving me achieving nothing in the summer. I have some competition, Part time job experiences and projects , but I have no idea whether what I have is enough. Even when I search for 4 month internships, most of them require some years of experience which is even more discouraging considering I’m searching for my first job experience outside of part time jobs. Ultimately , I fear the feeling of achieving nothing and feeling like a total failure compared to my friends, and becoming the kid that’s fresh out of college and unemployed . 

On top of that, I feel extremely overwhelmed with all the resources online on ‘how to guarantee an internship’, ‘must haves on resume’ which somehow increases my anxiety as I would always feel like my applications are never good enough (My gpa is okay, not extraordinarily high or low) . Seeing people I know getting opportunities makes me even more anxious and feeling like I have achieved nothing .

I find myself overthinking so much and being so anxious I’d scroll mindlessly through Instagram just to distract myself, wasting my time. Somehow, being in school is less stressful than the summer at least during the school year, I have a clearer goal and purpose, which is to get good grades. 

Am I overthinking too much or is this normal (econ student focus on data analytics ) . Thanks :))"

*2 TB Samsung 2080 Pro M.2 PCIe 4.0x4 SSD

The GPU is used and comes with a water block, so I am liquid cooling the GPU and CPU. Shouldn't really impact the performance though. I can also upgrade the GPU relatively easy when the prices of the newer cards actually drop."
1354ms5,3,2023-05-01,"I Failed a Course in College, what do I do now?",Popular_Ride2490,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1354ms5/i_failed_a_course_in_college_what_do_i_do_now/,"I am a 2nd Year Undergraduate in IIT Bombay (an elite STEM college in my country). ~~Three digit JEE Advanced open category rank (not specific, to not give away my identity).~~

The fourth semester has ended, and I have received a fail grade in one of my courses. The grade given wasn't unfair, I wasn't sufficiently prepared in the course to deserve a good grade, but the fail is still a shock.

I haven't ever really worked hard, I would just sincerely listen to class and get by, during school. This continued to higher secondary, I put zero effort, but listened to the classes, and I would write the weekly prep tests in my school properly and would do well. In the course of the two years (11-12th) my performances slowly got worse, and I ended up underperfoming in JEE Mains (a preliminary entrance test), but somehow did okay in JEE Advanced (the final entrance test) and got the seat of my choice (luckily, I didn't want Computer Science) in IITB, the college of my choice.  
The same continued in college, the first 3 semesters went the same way, but this time I wouldn't attend some classes (the ones without mandatory attendance) but somehow pass (with a mid grade) by pulling all nighters before the midsem and endsem.

I felt miserable all the semesters. The course contents were nice, but I would not put any effort into those courses, and feel really bad while doing the all-nighters, seeing how much better it would have been if i had done this course normally. 

Now, I have high standards for myself because of what people have told me, and what they expect from me, and my previous JEE (and school) performances give me a sort of arrogance with which I can justify the standards (i.e. if i did well without prepping as much as my classmates, I must be good, etc).   
But I haven't done anything to actually justify the high standards, or anything to hold myself to those standards. 

Now I am ashamed of how I don't take my life or career seriously. I am now feeling really confused, disoriented, sad and aimless.  


1. I don't know what to do to fix myself. I know what I need to do, and have for a very long time, but I am unable to focus on my academics (or even my hobbies tbh) and I don't know what to do about that 
2. I feel sad knowing that I am not taking something I am genuinely passionate about seriously, if I can't take this seriously, what can I expect of myself?
3. I have now failed a course in my fourth semester, and this course can only be repeated again in the sixth semester. So, my chances of getting an internship or univ project in the winter of 23 (b/w 5th and 6th sem) is practically gone.
4. I don't know what to do in the immediate future, the next couple of weeks/months. I have failed a course, and I don't know how to process/handle this feeling. 

I understand this post may seem arrogant to many, but that isn't my intention. I understand that I am in a college many people aim for. But the issue isn't that I won't be getting an insanely high package, or that I won't be considered a very smart kid anymore; It's the depression that comes with feeling disappointed with yourself, and that you don't deserve what you have. It's also the absolutely daunting feeling of not knowing how you're going go about fixing things.

If there is anything that could help me at this time, be it a resource, a tip, a strategy, an example of how someone else fixed stuff, anything really, it would be greatly appreciated.

I've submitted thousands of job applications, and out of those, I've only managed to land interviews with two companies: Google and Amazon. I suspect that being a foreigner might be a factor, as smaller companies don't even seem to consider my resume.

Last year, I interviewed with Google for an internship role; they said they would get back to me within a week after the interview, but they ended up rejecting me after 3 months of ghosting. No feedback.

In early April, I interviewed with Amazon for a full-time SDE role; their policy is to provide feedback within 5 business days, but it took them three weeks to reject me, again without any feedback.

I've completed several online assessments for some other companies. And often scored full marks. But none have resulted in interviews.

I'm fluent in three languages (English is my weakest) and have multiple startup experiences under my belt, where I single-handedly built entire systems as a full-stack developer. I feel confident in my skills and have numerous competitive programming achievements, so I'm comfortable with both online assessments and interviews.

Despite, I'm at my wit's end trying to find a job. If anyone has any advice or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.

I passed with a 756 (a pass is a pass!) I finished with about 1 hour and 50 minutes left. I’m 18 and a senior in high school. I was required to take a CySA+ course for a dual-enrollment college class I’m taking and a free exam voucher was provided to me for taking the course. I had zero expectations to pass and just took the course for college credit. I’m already A+ certified and have some IT experience through summer internships but have been taking a break from studying to enjoy high school while I can. I decided to study for the CySA+ for 3-4 weeks in preparation for this exam. Security+ is next after a week break, then network+. 

I used the Jason Dion course to get a general understanding of the objectives, and watched all the videos in 1.5x speed because he talks so slooooow. There is probably better courses because I felt like he said “This isn’t in your exam objectives” 500 times when going over various topics.

I also bought Dion’s 6 practice exams. I took each exam twice, once to test my initial knowledge, and once after reviewing what I had missed. I was scoring 69-84% on his practice exams first attempt, then 100% on second. 

I looked over the Sybex book and only took the first 20 knowledge check questions.

I was also provided free access to the CompTIA cert-master stuff and used that to study some, but to be honest it’s not much help.

If I can pass the CySA+, anyone can! I read so many posts about how hard this exam was and it can be really demotivating for people as they could feel scared to even try it. If you study and put the time in, anything is possible. I’ll try to answer questions if anyone has any. :)

I am a HS senior graduating next month, with plans to attend college in the fall with a major in Computer Science. I dual-enrolled this past year in CC for Information Technology, and recently became an intern at my local small MSP.

At my internship, I am assisting a very small team (5 people) in various tasks such as basic remote support (onboarding via Microsoft365, password resets, troubleshooting), onsite installation (workstations, phone systems, APs, etc.), as well as pulling cable. It is a hybrid of a lot of hands-on work and in-shop or desk work. Is this considered L2 Tech? The official title is ""IT Technician"", but I've heard that titles aren't exactly consistent in the IT world.

Additionally, I just passed my TestOut Routing and Switching Pro exam today. TestOut certs themselves don't have much worth, but I'd like to think that it helped me to be well on my way to be prepared for the CCNA. I plan on doing a full review with Jeremy's IT Lab on YouTube. I am wondering if acquiring the CCNA would allow me to potentially be an assistant to the Network Engineer here and hopefully become a Network Engineer myself once I finish college? I'm not exactly sure what my options would be once I graduate college.

One last question: would it be reasonable for me, an intern, to request a raise after I acquire the CCNA? My current pay rate is $15 with the possibility of a raise after I graduate from HS in 2 weeks.

All answers are appreciated, thank you!"

I am considering applying to be an Intern because it seems like the position would get me to where I would want to be a bit faster, although I may lose out on possible connections and a longer lasting position. What would be better to reaching my ultimate end goal of becoming a CTO? Becoming a  ERP Business Analyst or a Help Desk that works with the CTO every so often? I apologize if this seems a bit all over the place, I can clarify anything if you have questions."

I started my first job as a data engineer in May 22. There I used aws, cloud formation, Scala, golang without any prior knowledge of it. Then got laid off after 9 months, with multiple other people. 

After a month of search, I started a new role as a platform engineer (it’s mostly Gcp, terraform, everything new for me) about 2 months ago.
And kinda feel like I’m constantly stuck. Some days are ok, but most of the time I spend hours on a single line/function. 

I am trying to work in the morning, late at night as well, but do very little progress. Constantly worry that I’m gonna be fired. I still have 4 months worth of probation, but I need to get certified in gcp certification in one month and it’s literally wake me up at night. Feels like I barely can study for it during time off work. 

In my last job, I only started to feel like I know what I’m doing after 7.5 months.
And it was a very different company where they treated me basically like a graduate.
Since I’m working with different technologies now, it’s feels like I’m a grad again, but I feel like they expected from me the work like from  someone who is way more experienced.
Today, I just reached 11 months of working experience.
It’s very stressful especially being abroad alone, just trying to calculate all the time how many months I can last if I get fired tomorrow, realising that I will need to find a new role under 3 months or I have nowhere to live."

I know I can't at all expect to have a chance at that (though high schoolers frequently do get in), given that I know barely anything and have no experience. But coming into college I've gotten the impression that the only way to succeed in engineering careers is to get internships, projects, research, do all these things and sell yourself via an amazing resume (It's not idiots who are telling me all this). I have none of those, and trying to do one requires having done the other.  I can't understand how anyone can say with a straight face that internships are a good way to get other internships. Everything needs an application to submit and every time I've given it a shot it gets rejected and is a massive hit on my confidence and makes it feel impossible. It's like you have to start doing this shit since 4 years old and only then will you show your potential.

The smallest steps I can take towards my goals are still huge, due to the nature of my interest(robotics). What I am doing– club projects, early coursework, anything– isn't enough apparently. I feel insanely stuck in a rigged situation where the steps you have to take have steps themselves that are equally sized, theres no leading up to it. It's like a train that already in motion and you're told to simply hop on. The hell do I do?

EDIT: I did some more thinking and basically I'm comparing where I am right now to where I want to be, and not sure how to get around that thought process."

Backstory/Essay?- Well obviously you see that blot of a GPA. Well freshman year I moved, got COVID (twice), didn't adjust well to the new online learning thingy, and had some serious family based issues (needless to say all of this was ""distracting"") = total collapse of ability to study first 1.5 years of HS. Although once that got sorted I got back on my feet. Junior and Senior year are looking to be in the 3.9-4.3 range (expected). My GPA looks like a checkmark right now, with first semester sophomore year being my absolute LOW. It's just all so confusing, and I don't know how much my other stats can make up for my abysmal GPA. Will they look at my junior and senior year individually? Can I push the idea that my gpa isn't representative of me? Do they care about progress? What level of colleges should I really be looking at? I just wish I had the opportunity to fix my GPA.

Comments/miscellaneous: I expect to have good interviews and I have great relations with my teachers if that means anything but squat. Thanks!"

So I’m considering doing a cs online masters program and am struggling to find the right fit for me and hoped someone can point me in the right direction. 



Background info: I’m a career changer with an unrelated bachelor’s degree. I’m self taught, started in 2020 and have focused mainly on mobile app development and have managed to get a bit of traction with an internship and a position with a startup but no secure career type job yet. I’ve read that for many people a master in CS is unnecessary and not worth it but honestly I want to get a masters degree for its own sake because I love being in academics and I think it’d have more career value for me than most as someone without a CS undergrad. 



I’ve heard good things about programs like those at Georgia Tech and UIUC but the courses look not super well aligned with my area. That’s not a deal breaker but I would like an option that’s a bit more relevant for me. I’m looking into Boston University’s MS in software development and think it might fit the bill but couldn’t find a ton of info on the program quality and wondered if there are other programs I should be looking at as well.

On his last night he was gonna spend the night at my place and then he said he’s gonna have a goodbye drink with his coworkers and he’ll come at 3am (he finishes work at 12:30am)

At 3am he wasn’t writing me and he kept saying i’m leaving now i’m leaving now but then would stay another 30 mins and repeat the same thing so i told him if he wanted to stay then just stay and he said okay. I called him because i was shocked (he had said he was waiting for the uber to my place) and he said don’t call please i’m in a problem. I couldn’t sleep and i called him a couple hours later (7am or so) and he was on the phone with someone. He then said “i’m in the hospital i’ll explain later, let’s meet at 12” 

12 came around and he’s still out, says he’s gonna go to his place really quick and then come (keep declining calls and postponing the time that he’s gonna come because he had to pack and these things) he finally called me and i asked him what happened last night and he just says a bunch of things that don’t add up. “Oh no i wasn’t in the hospital a girl got drugged so we just stopped there really quick” then 2 minutes later it changed to “oh no some people just got really drunk and stuff” then at some point he says “i just said that because i had a drink at like 10am” when before he said he was out so long because he was taking care of his friends who got too drunk. then it changed to “after i told him to stay he went back to the club and after they went to someone in their groups house and kept drinking and talking and stuff” 

until 1pm??

Please tell me what to do. Tell me i’m not crazy and just anxious and a crazy girlfriend who overanalyzes everything."

I believe this is the best sub to post this question but if not please direct me to it.

So basically I’m an incoming freshman cs major and I wanted to test the waters and apply to some internships for the summer before freshman year. I wasn’t expecting much and just thought I was going to be chilling and still working at McDonalds until I received an email. It said I advanced to the next stage and I was going to be interviewing with conpanies to determine if I match with them. I was ecstatic because I would at least get interview experience if I don’t go well.( mind you these are paid internships btw). I was expecting the interview in about 10 days as they said. Until today they emailed me about a gurranted unpaid internship at the mayors office. It has different roles that somewhat apply to computer science aswell. So it got me wondering. Do I take the gurranted unpaid internship, or do I risk it and continue on and see if I pass the interview to intern at companies that would be paid. (Also I would be competing around 4 others interviewing for the same spot)

EDIT.) I’m applying through an org in which sent me these emails. If I were to pick the unpaid internship which deadline is tomorrow at noon, I will forgo my chances at the paid internship chances."

i took bio honors 1 and 2 (semester courses) during my freshman and sophomore years and i became ENTHRALLED by the mechanical aspect of biology. (bio 2 was centered around the molecular mechanisms of cancer, so we pretty much read scientific cancer papers, did labs, and had weekly problem sets. needless to say it was a very rigorous class).  im planning on taking AP bio next year and another experimental bio course that my school offers senior year. my school also has independent research teams in which students that have similar interests can pursue a year-long project that is then presented to the school in april. i’m planning on doing a bio-centered one during the next two years.  

to be completely honest, i wouldn’t say im the best at bio, as i know some students in my grade who are so much better at it. and although i didn’t “struggle” during the courses per se, i was definitely not breezing through the class. however, i REALLY enjoyed it. and i, unlike some others, loved studying papers and seeing what discoveries were made to advance the world of medicine. 

so i guess my question is pretty much… where do i go from here? as someone who has passion (but not the brains to compete at the “high levels”), how can i get more involved? 

i was thinking of doing a summer internship where i shadow scientists in their labs (or something similar), but again, i have no idea what i’m doing. 

sorry for the long post but any and all advice is greatly appreciated. thanks!"

As soon as the year began firstly I celebrated it alone where i got the sense that this year is gonna be sus.After some time I got 3 KT's from which one was a golden KT which by grace i passed after giving my paper for revaluation.But suddenly my friend who was with me since a year started acting very wierd without giving any reason to me and he's getting worse day by day.Another too followed his footsteps and did the same to me.And now both are behaving as if I've gave them a serious damage.The worst part is they aren't even telling the cause so that we can sort it out.

Now even other people who don't have any connection with these two guys have also started behaving the same with me.I feel lonliness among people who once were good to me who know me and it hurts the most.I wish to tell this to my parents especially dad but i can't tell him while I'm sober.My grandmother is also not keeping well and she has fainted many times and she remains alone so it's more scary what if she fail to contact us if some bad incident happen to her specially at night 

I'm not doing good in my academics and couldn't focus on it.I didn't get selected for any of internships for which i applied.Becauss of KT I took a long break from something in which i wish to make my career.Also I quit my gym which brought me in bad shape.I sometimes don't feel like eating and sometimes I eat alot beyond limit.

I feel I've become weak physically, socially, academically, mentally.I don't feel like attending my college,I every problem is demotivating me and I'm loosing interest in them.I'm getting poor sleep and frequent nightmares.I can't explain how I'm feeling because I can't understand how to explain it."

some info abt me: 
- i hope to do things related to product development in the future! 
- aiming to pursue masters as well but not so sure msc or mba
- i really value holistic education and would want to be active in areas out of academics as well (ie leadership/ccas/community projs in uni)
- hope to secure overseas experience + internships (at least 2!) in uni

nus: engineering (mse) w 2nd major management, nus college, merit scholarship, cde masters award 

pros: 
- more vibrant uni life! + 3 yr guaranteed stay in nusc w interdisciplinary learning 
- cde masters award to cover tuition fees for cde masters only + unbonded so no obligation to take the masters even aft accepting 
- guaranteed offer for exchange 
- nus ‘prestige’? (nvr really my concern but i’ve been seeing a lot of posts abt it)

cons: 
- 6 yrs until masters (4 undergrad, 2 masters)
- not targeted at prod development but can still pursue 
- arguably higher academic rigor (2nd major + nusc mods but i’m still up for the challenge)
- need to pay higher for living and overseas fees

sutd: step (4.5 yrs masters of tech entrepreneurship prog) + step scholarship 

pros:
- 4.5 yrs prog all tuition fees covered
- 1 yr overseas + subsidized fees 
- higher emphasis on interdisciplinary learning 
- specialize in product development (epd pillar)

cons:
- less vibrant student life + hostel need to constantly re-apply 
- diff teaching pedagogy (which will be newer to me but i think can try to adapt)
- stuck with a master in tech entrepreneurship only

I'm currently approaching the end of my first year of a CS degree. I'm not doing a placement year as I'm already a mature student (mid 20s) and want to get into work sooner if I can (if I was a few years younger I'd absolutely do one).

I know it's only first year but at the moment I'm on track for a strong first of ~90%, so I think that's a good starting point. I need to dust off my CV and bring it up to date, but I can do that. The problem is: I really have no information about internships. 

It may seem like I'm jumping the gun but - unlikely imo as it is I'd get one (not at a high end uni - decent, but not amazing, not got a brilliant portfolio or background, not the 'best of the best' type) - I'd like to at least try for some of the 'Big N' companies (i.e. your Google, Apple, MS, etc.) and I would think I need to start preparing for that now.

Problem is all of their details on internships have switched back to ""Keep an eye on this page"" type content. I can't see what types of roles are/may be available, what they're looking for in candidates, or even timescales on when to start looking for/applying to roles.

So: has anyone gone through this process, especially for these 'top end' companies? What was the process like? Any advice?

Sophomore Level Transfer

Cognitive Science Major

Chinese descent, did not apply for financial aid.

GPA: 3.88, 3.72 after Spring, perhaps 3.82 after Spring if I score a 100 on my Calc 2 final. No Ws

Units: 45 after spring, only GE left is foreign language but I'm fluent in Chinese.

HS GPA: 1.8 :) Graduated via CHSPE 

Note: GPA is what worries me mostly, I did not do well in HS and its most likely that I'll end with a 3.7 this semester. People on College Confidential are calling their 3.8 ""low"", it scares me.

Essays: Wrote about how a mission trip changed my perspective on school and why I decided to take the CHSPE and improve my academic record in Community College. Name dropped a USC professor who I quoted sources from during my debating days. Several advisors said they are great essays and I'm not too worried about these.

**Note:** the first four acceptances are safeties, with UofT being the only non-safety acceptances

&#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

Due to my elder sister being a CMU Alum, my father had high expectations for me getting admitted into CMU ED. But that didn't happen. So I applied to 31 Universities in return. (So many essayyssssssssss).

So, most of the decisions came in March, and till then, I had one acceptance, one defer, and one reject. 

So, between March and 1st half of April, I was heartbroken (Not even kidding rn).

After 1st half of April(15th April), I gave up. I mentally started preparing myself to strengthen my profile and apply next year cause the only decisions that were pending after April 15th were Waterloo, Edinburgh, KCL, and the University of Toronto, and seeing rejections from safeties as well. I thought I had no chance. 

So in my mind, I decided to repeat A-level chem and physics. Then improve SAT score. Do an internship, research, and give some additional exams.

My father had such a scale down in expectation from thinking about getting easily into CMU ED to almost making up his mind that I am going into Drexel(safety).

Cometh April 16th morning post 3 a.m., I literally wrote 'loser' and 'donkey' on my forehead with a pen and then went to sleep. (decision came around 6 a.m.) On the same day, I woke up (around 10:30) to find in my Gmail that there's been a status change for the University of Toronto portal, so after being used to rejections, I was under the assumption that another rejection was on the cards. On seeing the acceptance,  I was shocked to the core and had happy tears. I hadn't even brushed at that time.

So, now I plan to do somewhere between \[Specialisation in CS, maths and Minor in Stats\] to \[Major in CS and Maths\]"

I started as an intern there in which the intern interview was relatively simple; after the internship I'm offered a graduate role.

However, this organisation is known to hire only top students from top universities and I feel inadequate as I studied in a crappy university which didn't reallt build up my CS foundations. I still struggle in a lot of operating system and cyber security concepts.

Call me negative, but I'm worried of not being able to pass the probation due to my technical skills being way below others (which was obvious during my internship).

On the other hand, i have secured a master degree spot in one of the top universities.

Would really appreciate any input/advices. Should i pursue masters? Or should i proceed with the job offer? :(

Edit:
Thanks for all the replies. Didn't expect the thread to blow up this much and hence I didn't include as much details. 

I forgot to mention that I am based in Australia, where the job climate within the tech industry is not as bad as in the US. Industry-sponsored degrees are also uncommon.

Having finished my degree in the so-called 'crappy' uni, especially through all the online classes thanks to Melbourne's longest lockdown in the world, I have been having massive FOMO for not experiencing uni life. Not only that, I think what makes uni worth going is the exposure to smart and motivated people; which my uni lacks. 

So yes, I am wanting to pursue further studies again to sort of tick of the box to feel how it is like to actually be a uni student, while at the same time solidifying my CS foundations.

I am wondering if there is any differing opinions from here on?"

I’m about to enter my freshman year in a UK undergraduate programme, which consists only three years so I think time is really not on my side and i should prepare for future career asap.

So i’m what you would call an absolute noob in CS. I don’t have a clear vision about what career i want to pursue or what should i learn&do to pursue those careers.
And after reading lots of posts these days, it certainly seems that CS is a unbelievably competitive field to be in, though i’m ready for the challenge.
So my question really is what can i do to be competitive in both classroom and job market, hope you guys can give me some advice.

In terms of the curriculum, my uni has Java programming, some intro classes in first year; and only in second year will they teach SWE, Database, Algorithms and stuffs like Formal language theory, Haskell&Prolog.
I don’t know what any of these jargons mean  or which will be most helpful to my career right now, so i’m quite anxious and are learning the textbooks.

My point is, am i lagging behind if i want to apply for internship in the summer after first year? What can&should i do to get there and do i need to learning the basics like discrete math before starting to build my programming skills ?"

So I just finished my second-to-last semester, I'll graduate in December with a BA in ICT, along with a minor in Digital Media & Design, but I'm having some real big mental walls on what to focus on to ensure I'll be coming out of school in a good position.

I haven't had any tech related jobs yet unfortunately, mostly just food service related. So it's a bit lacking in the experience/resume department, though I'm looking for an internship currently since I need one to graduate.

In terms of classes I've taken, a lot of them have been management related because I took a management track. Might not have been the smartest idea but I've enjoyed it. I've learned a decent amount about team structure, taken one or two classes on web development (HTML mostly), some classes on databases and information architecture (I've used things like MySQL, though haven't truly grasped it). As well as classes for website accessibility/work environments. Most of these classes were recommended to me by my advisor, so no idea how applicable they are to getting into the field of IT.

Next semester I'm mostly just adding a Linux systems administration class to that, alongside doing an internship when I find a good one. There is a cybersecurity assistant analyst position for $11/hr on campus, thoughts on that one?

So in general, just looking for responses on what you guys would do in my position. I have a roughly 3.7 GPA (final grades still going out) so academically it looks good. Are there any other types of classes you would focus on taking? Any tricks/tips for finding an internship that isn't a scam? (I get lots of messages from ESPN/Disney/other huge companies on Handshake, are those legit?) I'm not too interested in cybersecurity currently, so should I look for an internship focused in other IT fields?

Open to any kind of questions, advice, etc.! Thank you!"

This question may be less than professional, but I am really tired and annoyed with how I don't seem to be improving as a programmer through my courses, I don't have trouble passing any course related to programming( Some of the courses I took so far are: ,Intro to Programming,OOP, Data Structures & Algo. And this semester I am taking: Data Bases and Graphical User Interfaces). Whenever I apply I don't hear back or get rejected, for those rare occurances where I am told to take a hackerrank assignment(2 times so far) I fail, even though I am practicing leetcode quite often. I learned [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/), Python, C# and Java on my own time to have something to show on my CV. I attempted at small scale projects (because anything more complicated seems impossible with my current skill level). I have no idea how to get good enough to be considered for any positions even though I can handle whatever university throws at me, all of this messed up my mental state. So what am I missing? How do I actually get good enough to intern?

Note: First time posting, if I am missing something that is important to the context if I am told I will edit the post accordingly. I am open to giving more details if somebody asks me on the comments. And for any other oversight I apologize."

The only thing that seems to work are benzos but I don't know if I should be taking them. 

&#x200B;

This past week I went back to my hometown. It's hard for me to visit because my mom took her own life on Christmas eve 2019 while I was on the way to see her. And my dad who lives there was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. 

&#x200B;

I fucked up too and saw my ex who I'm (I guess) in love with. We lost our virginities at 15 (I'm 29 now) to each other and spent many years apart after high school. He joined the military and we would write each other letters back and forth. I really loved him. But, he got kicked out of the military, and he ended up dating this other girl for like 7 years. 

&#x200B;

I rarely thought about him for a while, but when my mom died, the feelings came back. He initiated contact 2 years ago by messaging me on Instagram. At first, I was so guarded (I had gone through so much grief that worrying about an ex seemed dumb) but was curious how he was doing. I saw him last year; we got drunk and had crazy good sex. We talked regularly after that, with him saying I'm cute and wanting to meet up again and even come visit me where I live now. I built up an (apparent) fantasy in my head that we were destined to be together, and have kids and be a cute happy family. 

&#x200B;

Then, I saw him again this past weekend, we had sex again after some drinks. Honestly the sex was good but not as good as the previous year. Two days later, I ended up telling him that I still have feelings for him. He told me he likes me but can't guarantee that he won't get lonely and see other people when I go back home. He said he doesn't remember our old feelings for each other but likes talking to me and doesn't want to lose our friendship so he can ""confide in me"". He also said that he finally ""got attractive"" after high school and wants to date around to figure out what he wants. 

&#x200B;

I don't even know if objectively he's that attractive? He's tall, but I don't think he reads books or is very smart (I'm not trying to be mean but I'm just trying to think of reasons why he's not that great).

&#x200B;

I'm thinking he basically is going through a man whore phase? He really hurt me. And I'm ashamed that I let him back in and let him do this to me. I feel shame and guilt for letting someone use me sexually. But it's my fault because I told him about my feelings after the sex. 

&#x200B;

Anywho, I have been depressed since 14. There's been so many times when I've contemplated suicide. I had this whole plan to become a doctor. I have done all the classes, MCAT, have an internship in medicine, and am applying in a few weeks maybe. If I can convince myself to stay. There's a lot of fentanyl in town, I see people overdose on it while working in the emergency department and psych units. I think it would be easy to score but I might get robbed or something downtown. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday i was driving around with my dad and was crying but holding back the tears streaming down my face. When I cry in public I'm so good at hiding it that no one notices. While I was with him, I was thinking about who I would write my suicide letters to and what I would put in them. I was planning on getting some razor blades too. 

&#x200B;

I honestly just don't want to live anymore. I feel a really bad feeling in my heart, it hurts. I don't want to hear anymore bad news. If I died, my savings would go to my dad, and he really needs the money more than me for his Alzheimer's care. Sometimes I see beauty in the world, but I'm just tired. I'm tired of people telling me I'm strong. I don't want to be strong anymore."
135tyqw,3,2023-05-02,Should I switch from CS to a more traditional engineering major (EE or ME)?,stratdaddy3000,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/135tyqw/should_i_switch_from_cs_to_a_more_traditional/," I am wrapping up my first year as a computer science major (within the college of engineering) and I have only taken classes that every engineering major has to take so far.

I enjoyed programming in AP Computer Science in High School, so I decided to apply as a CS major. I also did an internship in web development for highschoolers this past summer, and while I didn't like web development itself too much, I really loved the work environment and felt if I had a programming role I was more interested in I could really thrive. However, I seem to not be interested in it as much as some of my classmates are outside of class. This makes me wonder if I would enjoy doing nothing but programming all day.

In addition, I am just finishing up physics 1: mechanics and I think it may be my favorite class this semester, although I also like my python and matlab class. I also took physics in high school, but for some reason I wasn't really interested then, but now I love applying the different concepts I learned to try to solve problems. This combined with the fact that I love math, I have already taken Calc 1-3 and a class that combines linear algebra with an introduction to DIFFEQ, has led me to believe that I might also thrive in a more traditional engineering major, such as mechanical or electrical engineering.

I already have firsthand experience with a CS related job, and the combination of WFH possibilities, higher salary, and generally less stressful work seems very appealing. I am not saying I am just doing these things, but the fact that I also enjoy programming so far makes this a great combination of factors. However, I have never learned about data structures or algorithms or anything like that, so I am not sure if I will continue to be interested.

On the other hand, I have always been interested in becoming an ""engineer"", especially before I took my first programming class. I love technology, which led me to looking at EE or CpE. I also love watching videos from channels like real engineering or veritasium about how things were designs and how they solve different problems. I have also heard that in either EE or ME if you can program you become very valuable to companies. Both of these majors have less of the benefits of CS though, such as slightly lower (but still great!) pay, less chance to WFH, and potentially more stress and overtime when project deadlines approach (from what I've heard).

Does anyone have any thoughts on my situation? Anyone in ME or EE who combines their job with programming?"

Electrical Engineer student here, in my senior year (kind of, junior year finals.) Feel lost and feel like a deer in headlights. I haven't been able to secure any internships, haven't had the chance to work on any project or be able to publish a paper in a journal.

I wouldn't consider myself a bad student (3.2/4) but my resume is looking incredibly empty and unable to get any electrical engineering-based internships. College professors are kinda bad here and don't offer any proper solutions or are lost themselves. How the other guys come up with project ideas and paper titles is beyond me and I could really use some help. I have about 10 months to change things around. Better late than never, I guess.

I wanna work with computers, and manufacturing processors, working on them, mostly in the tech industry (like displays, batteries, etc.) and unfortunately, my college hasn't really offered any courses like that so I am a smidge lost. Is there any course I can take to work on these skills that have great value to employers? I am rereading my basics, again and again, to be extremely solid (electric devices like MOSFET, IGBTs, etc.) to put myself in a position to crack interviews.

Is it possible by any chance for someone fresh out of college to get a job abroad? (I am from India) I am prepared to move though if needed, I am open to pursuing a Master's degree (mostly focusing on renewable energy, EVs etc.) though I am a little lost.

Thanks for all the help folks. Have a great day!

P.S.; If someone is willing to mentor me, I promise you nothing but my best."

My current job does not have any career growth and I want to pursue a career in IT. I have actually already started doing Associates in Computer Science. I currently have Associates in Electrical Engineering Technology. My end career goal is either programming or software development. I would like to acquire a job in some type of IT field making close to what I make now (18-20/hr) by next year. I am planning on taking getting some certifications, before December, such as CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+ and/or CompTIA Security+. I am also planning/willing to do coding courses; i.e FreeCodeCamp, but my focus is acquiring the job by the end-of-year so when I graduate in 2 years, do my coding courses, projects, ect, I will have had an IT job already that may lend credibility to my resume. I know people say to do internships but Ive had bad luck with them in the past with my previous degree. I'm 23 and have a house and family to support so I can't spend time working and taking less or no pay for any period. I need to know what are some viable certificates to aquire by December, that will help me find the job im looking for. I'm not too particular about what kind, though customer service isn't my strong suit, I'm not going be picky. Of course if that is possible. If it cant be done in that amount of time then what is a feasible timeframe?  
Also, I any info on what websites to start learning to code that aren't like Codeacedmy, meaning they get you ready for the job market and don't cost too much. Also, a plus is if I could put it on my resume..  
I only ask because I started making a list and I kept deleting stufF and adding it back and now it's all over the place. A  
LIST: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJTZCWWmLziUZhVRtTTrGNUE-M-D48Q1QMIiIH-H0So/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJTZCWWmLziUZhVRtTTrGNUE-M-D48Q1QMIiIH-H0So/edit?usp=sharing)  


Also, I don't have a particular career picked between programing and developing because I want to leave as many options as open if possible, even if that means wasting my time learning certs I won't use after I acquire my job. I only say this because my fear is that if I bring the bare minimum to the table and I don't get the jobs I try for, then I don't really have a backup plan.    
Anyway any tips or info would help. Thank you!"
135wf17,1,2023-05-02,Starting Again,Placename07,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/135wf17/starting_again/,"Hello friends,

So, I’m in kind of an awkward spot and would just like some input.

Basically, I transferred into university the year before quarantine sent everyone home. Over the next two years I finished my degree, but between the isolation and identifying some personal issues, I didn’t manage professional relationships as well as I should’ve — I didn’t even secure an internship within my field or make any plan for what direction I should take afterwards. I graduated, got a comfortable low-paying job back home, and since then have been “recovering”. 

I’ll give myself credit there, as my physical and mental health have improved drastically and I’ve been taking classes open up some side opportunities, but that’s where my successes begin and end.

I kind of wish I was attending school now rather than earlier; After some time for myself, I not only feel more motivated, but I have a clearer vision of what it is I want to be. The problem is, the only opportunities I’m seeing are for undergraduates. I’m approaching the two year mark from my own graduation, and I’m kind of concerned that it’s only proof of wasted potential. I don’t think my own university would even waste their time with me unless I was going for further education. 

Has anyone had success reaching out from a similar position? Would it be a bad idea to work for another degree at a local school to keep opportunities open?

Thanks for your time,"

135z1ju,1,2023-05-02,I (20F) have a crush on a classmate (21M) but it's summer break. What should I do?,ThrowRA_Rutabaga,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/135z1ju/i_20f_have_a_crush_on_a_classmate_21m_but_its/,"So, I currently have a crush on a guy at my University but he has already left for his home country and I won't see him for another 4 months. Background story is that I first met him fall of last year and instantly developed a crush, but because I knew I didn't have much opportunities to see him again, I moved on but he was always in the back of my mind. We talked occasionally this semester but up until March, it was only about class related things. However, in March I developed a crush on another guy and decided to ask 21M for advice. Turns out, 21M pieced together who I was talking about and that guy has a girlfriend so I moved on. I started talking to 21M more and my crush on him quickly came back.

At this point, I've only seen him in person twice. He said some things through messages that might show that he was interested in me? However I doubt it because I was just talking about his friend less than 2 weeks ago so he was most likely just being nice. Anyways, after that I met him a few more times and we were studying together for finals and I learned a bit more about him. I was able to confirm that he is currently still single and is not too interested in dating because of the time commitment but that he has been in a relationship in college with someone not at our school.

I was highly debating whether or not I should confess to him but ultimately decided not to, because if he rejected me, that would be too awkward for me to even be friends with him in the future. He is a pretty attractive guy so I know that it won't be too hard for him to meet girls that will end up being interested in him over the summer at his internship or even friends of friends (he has admitted himself that it's usually girls that confess to him and that he has rejected girls in the past).

So what I would like to know is, is there anything I can do to continue talking to him over the summer? Currently, we are not close to the point of sharing things that occur in our lives. Anything unrelated to classes, it's usually me reaching out to him about. Is there anything I can do to keep up communications with him over the next 4 months and get closer to him?"

&#x200B;

1. The average DS job only requires basic SQL and Python and a basic understanding of probability and statistics.
2. We are seeing a flood of applicants vying for data science jobs who possess only basic coding skills and a basic understanding of statistics, and this is going to kill the industry. 

&#x200B;

I honestly can't figure out what to believe. There seem to be examples of people becoming data scientists with a few certifications. (Perhaps they go on later to get an advanced degree after working for a while). Some suggest that this is extremely common. But I have also seen comments on here suggesting people shouldn't even think of trying to land an entry level DS job without advanced degrees and several internships and that even then they are probably not qualified.

I am sure there is some real sense in which people with advanced degrees in Stats or CS are better at what they do than people without the same qualifications, but it can't be true that everyone else has really just gamed the system in some way, can it?"

So currently I am an intern at a tech company as software engineer. I will be graduating hopefully in a few months, but I am actually quiet not satisfied with the place I am working.

I get the feeling most of my colleagues dislike me and I don't feel appreciated. I have never been rude or impolite towards my colleagues, although in the past, I had let people know that I got the feeling they disliked me. I was not rude. I did not insult anyone. Just expressing my feelings in a professional manner. We talked it out and everything was fine.

There was another incident though where the find my too pushy and I had a panic attack, we talked it out everything was fine. This I get is my fault.

Sometimes I feel like being ignored by my colleagues and can get pushy, where I send them multiple messages to get a response from them. Again, I am here to blame for my impatience.

Now for a while, things felt off. I asked in the past before if something was wrong or if there are annoyances towards me. The answer was no. Nothing going on.

Today I decided to write a message to my mentor at work. I asked if there was something wrong. Are they dissatisfied with my performance (aside from the social skills thingy). Was the trust still there in me completing my project. I was not rude, I was polite as possible. Just trying to win information.

I shared my observations, said that what I observe doesn't mean that reflect the reality. One thing that bothers me, is that they planned their holidays in my assessment period. I don't know about customs in the US, but where I live, the intern they mentored, it's customary to attend their graduate assessments and many companies do this.

My mentor told me it was their only possibility of going on holidays and that I was meddling with their private life, which they seemed they have taken as offense. Litterally said before in the post that is none of my business, but that I find it a weird gesture though and they knew well, for months actually when I am going to graduate.

Now apparently, some other manager and my mentor want a meeting next week to discuss how we can improve the communication and mentioned the past stuff I mentioned above, that we already long finished. And also probably additional things they have never mentioned.

I don't get why they bring up past stuff, we already talked out. This just seems like looing for a reason to shit on me. The manager is well known for that.

I am now like, when I asked if something was wrong, they should have told me and now suddenly when I politely express my observations, they dig up past stuff. Like what?

I am crazy and I have my faults, but this looks like a toxic mess. Is my assessment right or wrong?

Please don't try to roast me too much, I don't like to be overcooked. I have experienced this in some of the past subs."

These worked well for me and my friends, and hopefully some people find it useful. Should be applicable to those in incoming second years too for summer analyst season, but best to start as a Fresher. Maybe also be applicable outside of the UK, but this is UK focused. A combination of things I learned from real life and online. Also, just my opinion. Sorry for typos.**

&#x200B;

***Step 1: Understand the Career Paths Available***

When we say banking or finance there are a lot of potential careers available, and it can be quite hard to know what they all are, how difficult they are to get into, and which one best suits you. I think there are valuable careers in all aspects of finance, but start by doing your research.

Potential industries to research include private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, front office banking (investment banking, private banking, corporate banking, Sales and Trading, etc), asset management, Big 4 (tax, accounting, management), and back or middle office roles at any of the above (human resources, technology, operations). The competitiveness, compensation, and work-life balance at all of these vary. Research as much as you can about the industries that interest you here: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/)  You can also reach out to people in your life and on LinkedIn who work in the respective fields to gain as much information as possible.

&#x200B;

***Step 2: Understand the Recruitment Process***

If we see a full-time graduate role as the end goal, the best and easiest way to get there is through Spring Weeks and a Summer Analyst position.

Spring weeks (also called Insight Weeks or Insight Days) are mini-internships during the easter holiday that can last from 1 to 5 days. You are not limited to taking just one, do as many as possible. Don't necessarily be limited to just one industry, apply to everything under the sun and see what the best you can get is. Generally, you do these during your first year of uni. Start applying in September!! Apply to 5 every day until you get something. (This applies also to Summer Analyst, and Graduate Positions. In general, If you haven't actually tried until you apply to 100+ positions. Its definitely a numbers game.)

If you do well in your spring week internship, you will be invited back for a summer analyst internship. These are generally around 10-weeks. They are paid!! (and sometimes generously for a student). You generally do this in the summer before your final year of university. Again, start applying early and don't stop until you're in!!! If you do well in this, you will be offered a full-time graduate position. Boom, you did it.

To get a Spring Week, Summer Analyst, or Graduate Role you will have to pass multiple stages of interviews. While each firm varies, there are a common set of stages that you will definitely run into. (I won't go into technical questions for IB or case studies for PE here because I never did them). First is the Screening Round. This is where bad candidates are automatically rejected and often not even looked at by a real human. To pass this screening round, you need a great Resume (See Section 3) and often a great letter of Interest / cover letter (See Section 4).

Next, you might have to pass an online test. These are 15-30 minute tests which can check your reasoning, communication, and basic maths skills. Some people find them very hard, and I generally think you need at least 75% correct to move through. The point is, study for them. You will normally have a few days to complete this stage. Take 1 or two days to study, the firm normally will provide study resources from the testing company that they use. Then, take the tests quickly to show initiative.

Then comes a robot interview. This is where you sit in your dorm room and tell your computer why you want to work at XYZ. Put on your professional clothes (Ex: Suit). There are about 10 questions you may be asked. They include: Why this company? Why this role? Why You? Tell us about a time of leadership/teamwork/conflict/success/failure/inspiration etc. Custom you're answers for each company. Write them down before hand, and practise. Practise in the mirror, record yourself, and do it with a friend if possible. Its all more fun if you can find other people going through the recruitment process with you.

Then you might have to pass a quick phone interview. These are short, and are generally just a test that you are a normal, interesting person who can A) show up on time for a phone interview B) be polite, charming, and interesting and C) have put in a few hours of research to have both good answers to questions and a few interesting questions yourself.

Then, you might have 1 or 2 interviews. These will be normally on Zoom and will be more of the same, but you should prepare longer. Do detailed research about the team you are applying for, their deals, policies, achievements, problems etc. Go in with some great questions, and (I think most importantly) be someone that these real people would be happy to work with 8 hours a day for 10 weeks. AKA just be charming and interesting and smart – not annoying, timid/quiet, or over-confident/arrogant.

Finally, comes the Assessment Centre (Super Day in the US). These are quite weird if you have never done one before. You will be in a group of 3 to 15 other students, and are essentially competing for a few jobs over the course of a few hours. There will be multiple activities and interviews throughout the day. Just making it this far at a great firm is a massive achievement. Common mistake people make here are A) being quiet in group activities and B) being self-interested or dominating in group activities. Obviously you should ace all your interviews, but the assessors will be watching you during the group activities. Be the person who asks the quite people what their opinions are. Do not be the person who cares if their specific idea wins the debate (sometimes you will be assigned a position to argue for). I'm not saying you shouldn't make great arguments, but these activities are designed to highlight people who are great communicators and thoughtful team members. I found that it is helpful to summarize what people have already said and suggest a group vote when the conversation is getting repetitive. You want to be the person who is paying attention to time, being kind inclusive and respectful, and is moving the group forwards towards your goal. There will be one or two other candidates who know these GOAT strategies, and if you suggest a vote or do summarization you can see their annoyed faces as they were hoping they could do it. Even if you do everything right you can still fail. There are so many reasons (macro, budgetary, too many candidates, not a culture fit, etc.) that are not your fault. In general, I believe that, if you are getting to Assessment Centers, you are a qualified candidate. Remember, it is a numbers game. Keep grinding and you will be OK.

&#x200B;

***Step 3: Resume***

A lot of posts here are about resumes, and a lot of them show truly terrible resumes. In reality it is quite simple. Start with a mainstream format like WSO, available easily online. The resume is not a place for you to get creative with formatting. This needs to be clean. It must be exactly 1 page. Furthermore, it must fill up the entire page exactly. It must be full, organised, and pretty to look at. Start each line for your experiences with great action verbs. Google resume action verbs to find out more. If you think you don’t have enough experience, you’re probably wrong (See Section 5). Coming in as a fresher, no one expects you to have any real finance experience – so it is totally OK to put your swim team, Duke of Edinburgh award, Debate club, volunteering etc. I suggest that you do not use any playful colours or pictures of your-self. Furthermore, if you want to include hobbies do basic things like ‘rock-climbing’ and ‘Investing,’ don’t promote the fact that you live and breathe World of Warcraft, for example.  This is a formal document that should be slick, smooth, detailed, and easy to read. In your bullet points, try and use quantitative measures of your work whenever possible. This can be done for almost anything – (Ex: Increased sales at local off-licence store by 25% through new marketing campaign, Ex: Lead football team to 8/10 winning matches through leadership as Team Captain, Etc.). I am happy to look at your CV if you message me. This is an iterative document that you will update all the time. Throughout uni, expect to have 10 versions of your CV as you improve your experience and improve your writing style. It can be fun to keep these just to see how much progress you have made!

&#x200B;

***Step 4: Letters of Interest***

These can be an entirely new thing for many young people. You want to write it like a formal letter. They should start with something like “Dear XYZ Recruit Team,”. Then you want to have one to three paragraphs (500 words total as a goal) which hit on these three key points: Why you love the company, why you love the role, and why they should love you. Try not to repeat information that you put on your CV, the point of these are to contextualise your application after reading your CV. If you’ve had any abnormalities in your education they can also be explained here. Its also a good place to showcase your commitment to things like DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) and ESG (environmental, social, and governance), which are qualitative measures which are becoming increasingly important in the recruitment process.

It is very tempting to create a format, change only a few details, and send the same letter to multiple companies. Unfortunately, this is extremely obvious and could result in your application not being properly looked at. It may be tedious, but spend an hour research the firm and industry for every single letter you write. You want to make specific references to firm events that you have been to (online or in person), news articles that talk about the firm, the firm’s key philosophy and values (which they keep on their website), and research reports. Here is my hack to find reports. Lets say you are Appling to Management Consulting Spring Week or Summer Internship at EY. Google the following and keep the quotations as they change how the search words: “EY” “Management Consulting” “pdf”. This will return all their public reports which you can use for your research.

&#x200B;

***Step 5: Experience***

If you are struggling to think of experience, check to see if you have done any of the following: Summer courses, Volunteering for charities, Sports, Clubs and societies at school, Academic awards, Local jobs, and Shadow days. Even if you don’t have enough there are two great pieces of news. Firstly, as soon as you start university you can and 100% must join at least 2 finance related societies. Practically every uni has a investment club, an economics society, a consulting society and a few more. Furthermore, you should try and get an official role in these organisation and start climbing the power structure. These are excellent ways to show your interest. The other great piece of news is that it is currently May and uni starts in October. You have plenty of time to get experience this summer. It can be as simple as a job at a grocery store etc, to leveraging a connection using your school’s alumni network or your own personal network. Furthermore, the university will have an internship hub and probably an office you can talk to which should be able to help you get a term-time ‘off-cycle’ internship during studies if you really want more. Lastly, if you send out lots and lots of LinkedIn messages to small firms offering to work for free or cheap in exchange for work experience you might be able to get seriously great work for boutique firms in the actual industry you are focussed on.

&#x200B;

***Step 6: LinkedIn***

I recommend getting a polished LinkedIn account. This makes your application more professional when recruiters research you. You want a couple hundred connections, a pretty background photo, and a professional headshot (ex: wearing a suit etc). Make sure to be professional when commenting on LinkedIn as everything is traceable back to you.

&#x200B;

***Step 7: Track Everything***

This is a really important step. On Excel, create an application tracker. You are going to be applying to over 100 jobs and it is crucial to be organised. The columns you need are as follows (though feel free to add more): Firm Name, Firm Industry, Job Title, Link to website for Job Opening, Date Application Opens, Date Application Closes, and Status. Status is the most important. Everything will start with ‘Not Applied’ and will progress through ‘Submitted’ to ‘video interview on Monday’ to either ‘Denied’ or ‘waiting to hear back’ and hopefully ‘Accepted.’ The benefits of this system are as follows. Firstly, you wont apply for the same job twice and you will know exactly where you have and have not applied. Secondly, it can be difficult to manage the status of 10 live applications at once, and this is really helpful for making the deadlines for different interviews and assessments. Lastly, it helps you track your recruitment process. At the end, you will have a lot of data about your strengths and weaknesses. It may be that you are failing all the time at the online test stage, but that if you make it through you normally go far. In this case, you will know to study more for the tests before summer analyst season the next year. It is great to know your weaknesses in the recruitment process because you will be doing the whole process over again for summer analysts and graduate roles!"

I recently got off of Duke's waitlist and it's making me reconsider my decision. I'm interested in studying econ or polisci or possibly double majoring in the two. I'm not exactly certain tho and I plan on doing some exploring in university. Here are a few pros and cons of each school. I recieved similar financial offers so that isn't a concern. I have 5 days to make a decision so any feedback and guidance would be so so appreciated 🙏🏽 

Bowdoin

pros:

- campus environment is VERY friendly. I visited campus and everyone I interacted with was extremly welcoming and kind. Students seem to be very down to earth and smart. Seems like a wonderful community to be in.

- class sizes are very small so it is easy to form close connections with professors. You get more individualized attention.

-I prefer the location. Brunswick is a small charming town and it's very accessible to Portland and Boston. 


cons:

- I'm afraid that the school might start to feel a little too small after a while. It has 1800 students and yes you get to form very close relationships with everyone but a larger school will allow you to form connections with more people. However, I could always go to a bigger school for grad and I can only have the small LAC experience for undergrad.

- Class offerings and cocurricular opportunities may be a little limited. Because it is a small school there isn't as much variety in the classes and there is no Washington DC semester program.



Duke

pros:

- alumni network and brand name is very strong. Duke is very well known and well regarded across the board. It is nicknamed the Harvard of the South and it is slightly more prestigious compared to Bowdoin. This might be helpfull in internship and job searching.

- My financial aid offer includes two funded summer study abroad programs or six-week summer classes on Duke's campus. While I will get the opportunity to study abroad at Bowdoin my financial aid offer will only allow me to utilize semester programs. Study abroad is something that I really want to do so this opportunity is a huge plus for me.

- Co-curricular activities and more academic variety. Duke has its own Public Policy major which I am very interested in. There is a Duke Washington DC program that I would love to take part in. In general there is a lot more variety of classes to pick because it is a bigger school.


cons

- There seems to be a stereotype that Duke is a very white rich elitist institution, and greek life is quite a big part of campus culture which does not interest me in the slightest. There are all kinds of people though so I'm not sure how much it would affect my experience.

- I'm kind of scared to be a small fish in a big pond. Duke is more of a competitive enviornment that can be cutthroat at times where as Bowdoin is more of an uplifting and welcoming community. As someone who is international I might benifit more from Bowdoin's small environment and more personalized attention. But if I do make the most out of my Duke experience I do think there are more opportunities to be explored if that makes sence."

Demographic: Hispanic/White Male - High Income - Live in VA School in DC (reputable school with decent Ivy placements and lots of t20s)

Maior: Finance/Economics (maybe PPE?)

Academics: 3.7 UW GPA ACT 34 - note, my school does not post WGPA or class rank stats
- also note I have had all As (1 A-) except for honors math track, which has hurt my GPA a lot but allowed me to take calc I and calc II next year 


Notable coursework: AP lit, AP CALC AB, AP self study micro-macro, AP calc bc (next year), AP stats (next year)- (note, my school does not have “AP” classes, you have to do more studying outside of class and take the exam in your own time).

ECS:
1) 110+ hours community service, split between a cultural center, serving the homeless, and raising money for cancer research.

2) 2-3 Week internship at boutique hedge fund in NYC. Was able to get it by meeting the CEO at the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway investor convention and following up a bunch. Probably won’t do much, but I am still v excited. Haven’t done it yet but yeah.

3) Finance website sole creator/owner - built a website from scratch and posted my stock/bond in-depth analysis for several companies using industry-standard techniques such as DCF.

4) Participant and 1yr head of school investment club - managed 60k pool of school investments, and pitched thousands of dollars worth of stock pitches. Gained a few thousand for the portfolio.

5) 4x Varsity Athlete on boys tennis team - team was top 10-15 in the nation for all 4 years (best #4, worst #30). On team, i was consistently in the top 6 (so I actually played), and travelled across the east coast for matches during the season.

6) Individual tennis competitions- played a lot In MS + freshman / sophomore year and reached a decent 8 UTR, but stopped playing a ton due to stress and school/depression (had trouble with new-school plus online school)

7) 2year head of Political Philosophy club- organized weekly club meeting and discussed many ethical, moral, and philosophical questions. Grew membership (w/ help) from 8 -> 30

8) Individually invested lots (got money through babysitting a ton, selling old items, etc) performed much of the same analysis I did on my websites, and was able to eventually double the money I had earned through investing, which I am very proud of

9) Love hiking, and reading philosophy (sometimes while hiking). I hike alone or with friends usually in some national park a few hours from my house. I guess this isn’t that unique or hard but I do it very often and love it.

10) Was an active member in clubs such as Mental health awareness, latin American society, and environmental protection and awareness club. 

10) V2 (can’t decide) - 1yr sidwell business manager for the horizon newspaper.

Awards:
No clue, unless varsity tennis 4x division champion (for our team) is something.

LOR: Stellar history recommendation (teacher loves me, has phd/writes books), ok physics recommendation.

Essays:
Not too sure but will probably be decent, will probably talk about something small then extrapolate the idea to things that are important to me. (Personal + community growth)

Schools:

CMC (Claremont McKenna) -(love)

Dartmouth (love also)

Brown (haven’t visited but maybe love)

Cornell 

Swarthmore 

Williams

Pomona

NYU

UVA (in state + legacy)

UCs (UCLA, SB, SD, I, SC)

1362ulv,0,2023-05-02,Applying for internships pre-college,Bullton69,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1362ulv/applying_for_internships_precollege/,"Hey guys, I’m currently a high school senior and am going to be attending college in the fall for CS. 

From what I’ve been reading, internships are really important, such that applying the year before is key. I know that the norm is usually trying to get them during your 3rd year from what I’m understanding but I wanted to know what I could do to apply for next year’s summer internships now, without being in college.

My question is since it seems that internship applications open up this summer, would it be better to apply with my highschool resume this summer, or wait til I’ve finished my fall semester of college and have a side project or two down and an actual college GPA. 

Though a better question would be if I’m even able to apply this summer thinking about it now lol. Since I won’t have actually attended college and I’ve seen most internships require you to be enrolled in a program.

My resume is mostly just extracurriculars and projects I did in high school, not anything totally crazy. President of computer science club, programming tutoring/volunteering, competitive programming competitions like USACO, and I have a published app in SwiftUI that utilizes Firebase, OCR, and some cloud functions with Typescript. I just wasn’t sure if these things on a resume would be enough to compete with other college applicants that also have an actual GPA and classes under their belt.

Also if y’all have recommendations for internships that freshman can apply to, that would be awesome as well.

Any help/advice would really be appreciated, thanks a bunch in advance."

So some background on me. I graduated last summer in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. It has been about 9 months since I graduated and so far no luck finding a job or internship. I did not do an internship during my time in college but I was looking for one since my Sophomore year. My dream job is Web Development as my first job.

Now during these 9 months, I decided to train my CS skills as I realized I was lacking in some areas. So I mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Learned TypeScript, MySQL, and React. Also learned various libraries for React. I also have some example work posted on my GitHub page and have a portfolio website that I created from scratch showcasing my work.

I'm now about to reapply for jobs/internships and am writing this post to get some advice. Maybe even see if anyone else is in the same boat as me. 

Thanks for reading and ✌️.

Edit: First of all thank you to everyone that took the time to read my post and also respond with some helpful tips and stories. I realized I left out one important detail which is I only applied for the first three months. Then I decided to study as I felt like the reason I was getting rejected after interviews were that I didn't have the skills needed for the job. At the time that was React (I do know React is a library and not a framework) / other frameworks. I did though apply every once in a while after the three months just to see what was out there. 

Tldr: Been 9 months since I graduated and I still have no job. During that time I buffed my resume and am now looking for some advice on how I can land that first job."

I'm fresh out of a conversion masters at a prestigious university in my home country but have no internship experience as my course was pretty intensive. I know very little about the job market in Canada but hear it's very competitive at the moment. My background before my conversion course was law so not really applicable to the work I want to do now. I'm an okay programmer but really suck at and hate front-end work. I'm okay at leetcode and have time to improve while I wait for my work permit.

I'd be looking to live in either Vancouver or Toronto.

Should I anticipate a very tough time finding a job upon arrival and should I take any sort of technical job I can get or do I have a chance to get a role in software or machine learning?

Would really appreciate some insight 🙏"

I didn’t sync so the team wouldn’t know I’m still looking into the working papers when I should be focusing on my new role, so they’re still the way I documented them before I left. 

That's when I spotted idiotic errors (albeit minor - I referenced the tickmarks incorrectly) that would probably give my senior more work and I'm worried they're probably pissed at me right now or something.

However, at the end of my internship, my coach got feedback from my seniors/managers and they all gave positive reviews with some comments on areas to improve on, and are still willing to staff me again should I return. But I dunno, I feel like I could have done better.

1368t71,0,2023-05-02,Uni considerations (SUTD CSD vs NTU CS vs NUS CEG),reddit123_880,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1368t71/uni_considerations_sutd_csd_vs_ntu_cs_vs_nus_ceg/,"Hi all. I am considering my uni options (NUS CEG vs NTU CS vs SUTD CSD) and I am leaning towards NTU CS. The following is my decision making process. Please help to validate it and point about any new considerations and flaws that I have missed. I will split my considerations into various segments. This will be a long post and I really hope you will give me some advice.


- Background about myself


I took Computing in A-Levels and got a B. I have always loved computing especially the practical because its exciting. Hence, I know I like software a lot but regarding hardware, I am open to it and know its important, but I don't want tk study it at a large expense of software (This point will be explained later). I also aim to work in USA.


- Option 1: SUTD CSD with Global Merit Scholarship

 
- I like SUTDs curriculum when it comes to its hands on and design thinking approach.


- Moreover, given tht thr selection of CS employees, is a very portfolio based job, it would be easier to build it up in SUTD, given the many opportunities to do projects. However, I know that uni projects are not very grand and may add little value to one's resume?


- However, I don't rlly like the common curriculum, not cos I don't like learning thr subjects (Physics etc.) but because it deprives one from learning more breadth and depth of CS itself as compared to other unis.


- A good point is that the GES data shows that the salaries for NTU and SUTD CS are comparable which is somewhat surprising given NTUs prestige. However, NUS CEG earns more than the other 2 (Ik I should take GES with a big pinch of salt but this is just one data).


- Due to the scholarship, I will stand out, being a bigger fish in a small pond, hence being able to get opportunities more easily. However, I have heard that for exchanges, (since my scholarship guarantees me an exchange in 1 out of the 4 partner universities) everyone can attend one. Hence in that way, its not as prestigious.


- Since I aim to work overseas, I'm not sure how easy it is for me to do so after graduating from SUTD due to the lack of prestige. However, it had ties to MIT and the uni mentioned that it's grads have pursued further studies/worked overseas (mentioned during an SUTD talk). Hence to be safe I would prefer NUS/NTU. 


- I do know that one can work in a MNC office in SG and ask for a transfer out, but I feel its not a guaranteed solution to work overseas.


- Another point is the inherent bias employers have to NUS and NTU grads. Ik tht for CS yr portfolio matters more but some employers are just intrinsically biased to prestige due to the history of better quality employees coming (assuming all things equal). Another point is the fact that UK gives work visas to only NUS and NTU grads, shows that even other countries prefer grads from prestigious unis.


- Option 2: NUS CEG


- Firstly, NUS has the most prestige out of all, and hence helps in employment due to the inherent bias employers have.


- However, I got CEG from NUS and due to the 50-50 software to hardware ratio, I don't feel its worth especially if I aim to do a software job in the future. Although, I have heard that employers don't descriminate bween CS and CEG but a CS gard would definitely have more software knowledge. Hence, what I was thinking was if somehow I decide on NUS CEG,  I would overload and take CS modules (smthing like CEG with 2nd major jn CS, but it would probably be extremely difficult to manage).


- I also do understand that NUS has slightly better prestige than NTU and some ppl have mentioned that overseas uni and firms ONLY recognise NUS, which defeats the purpose of accepting NTU for prestige over SUTD.


- Another concern that I have is that NUS is very competitive (academics, opportunities and even for hall) which may be too stressful. However, in the workforce, everyone will be competing against each other so competition is unavoidable.


- One more concern is that I have heard that NUS is too theorercial in its teaching, with less particial applications, NTU is the middle ground and SUTD has the most hands on opportunities. Not sure how true this is but if so, then wouldn't one get less practical exposure from NUS and have to build it up during internships?


- Option 3: NTU CS (leaning towards this)


- I got CS here which is what I want and NTU also has the prestige part checked. Hence I can focus on building my portfolio, without having to worry abt a situation where the employer cares abt ones uni. 


- Moreover, it would be easier to work overseas due to the prestige of NTU.


- However, I have heard that many NTU students themselves dislike the curriculum and feel its outdated, despite the recent revamp. I'm not sure how bad this is (NTU students pls share more).


- I also feel that NTU is a much less competitive version of NUS hence making it easier to get opportunities as compared  NUS, despite not having a scholarship.


- Also, due to NTU having more hands on opportunities than NUS, it makes one develop more practical skills.


However, one issue is that the GES data shows that NTU grads are comparable to SUTD which makes me question NTU's whole prestige even more.



I appreciate you for reading, and could I know whether my considerations are valid and if I should stick with NTU CS?"

I really like Biology and want to study medicine, but also considering CS or History. I really like Georgetown, CWRU, and Cornell (prob ED?). I also just want to see what my chances are for other T20s. Since I'm a sophomore, I just want to see if I'm on track for my goals.

Demographics: Asian Indian, Male, Christian (Maybe it helps with Georgetown?), parents make 400k+

SAT: Not taken yet, but based on practice exams, should be >1500

GPA: 95.07, High School is specialized in Biotechnology, and all courses are predetermined for us. There are 80 students in the grade, and rankings are not given out. I generally have 94+ in all my classes, except for Spanish, which is my worst subject. I got 92 last year, and am prob not getting an A this year in it :(.

Coursework: IB school, will be taking Chem HL, Bio HL, Lang & Lit HL, History SL, Spanish SL, Math SL, AP Calc AB & BC, and AP Physics C between Junior and Senior years. HL are two-year course, while SL is one year. My school doesn't offer any APs in my Freshman and Sophomore years, except AP Macroeconomics, which I am taking rn (Expecting to get a 5 on it)

&#x200B;

Extracurriculars:

EMT Cadet, 30 hours a month, been doing for 4 months now, plan to continue throughout HS, can prob get leadership position on Cadet Squad for 2024. Prob my favorite EC, or at least a close second with BSA, I like interacting with different people and like there's some sort of thrill when you're helping someone in an emergency (i swear it's not weird).

* Later this year I can start taking the EMT course, and then get certified as an EMT if I pass the test. The EMT Cert course is said to be the equivalent of the workload of two college-level classes and is typically 190 hours of work.

Part of Boy Scouts for 7 years by the time of College Application

* Eagle Scout at 15 y/o
   * The project was tearing down an old unsafe swingset, installing a new swingset, benches, and a sign in a park
   * Right now have a Gold Palm
* ASPL (Second-in-Command in troop), guaranteed SPL next year
* Working as NYLT staff this summer. NYLT is a one-week leadership program, and pretty intense. Participants are camping the entire time, and are divided into groups called patrols. Each patrol must cook for themselves outside with a fire they make for each meal, and feed two staff members. As staff, I give presentations and meet with staff around once a month for staff campouts to prep for staffing the course. Will be doing this after junior year and prob after senior year too.
* Member of the Order of the Arrow
* Maybe I'll be working at a BSA camp this summer, depending if I can get an internship or not

Secretary of Church Youth League:  plan bake sales, do Mother's day and Father's day gifts, plan an annual six flags trip, etc.

Altar Server (Hoping Georgetown like this) - Assists priests with communion and other church service-related things

Track & Field, Cross Country JV- prob won't get varsity, varsity ppl from my town are acc cracked, they all go to nationals and 2 of our runners are nationally ranked. Our town for some reason is cracked when it comes to Long Distance runners, and we have sent someone to the Olympics before.

Maybe I'll have an internship this summer, was rejected from 2 already, and currently waiting to hear from AEOP and Democracy Summer Program.

Running for School President right now, I don't know if I'll win but I'll just leave this info here for now. It's a two-year term so I'll be doing it throughout Junior and Senior year

I can code in Python and Java but have no ECs relating to it right now.

In the last month of senior year, my high school sets us up for an internship and we do it instead of going to school.

&#x200B;

Awards:

Eagle Scout and Gold Palm? I don't really have awards 💀.

Going to be getting IB Diploma, but IB Diplomma results don't come until the summer before college so I was told to put IB Diplomma Prospective. Colleges should guess from my grades that I will be getting it.

&#x200B;

Important Stuff:

Through freshman year, my mom was suffering from Cancer, and it was a lot of stress. I didn't do much except Boy Scouts during Freshman year because of this. It also affected me a lot and I felt more emotional during this time than at any point I ever have. I remember three days before ninth grade playing Genshin when my mom got the phone call saying she had it, and ever since then, I've never been able to play Genshin again. This is part of the reason why I want to become a doctor, and why I volunteer as an EMT Cadet. At the end of the day, I just want to be able to say that I helped people whether it be from EMT or being a Doctor.

I suffer from Allergies that are probably some of the worst you're going to see. I'm allergic to Milk and Eggs, so I can't really eat any food that isn't cooked by my parents. I also carry my epi-pen and stuff, and it can be kind of hard to deal with. Was bullied in middle school and cheese was dumped in my lunch (possible essay???)

My brother also graduated from CWRU, but I don't know if that counts as legacy.

Schools:

ED1: Cornell

ED2: JHU

EA: CWRU, UNC-Chapel Hill, GTech, Northeastern, UVA, UMich, UMD, Rutgers, Villanova, Umass Amherst

7/8 Year Programs: Rutgers/RWJMS, TCNJ/NJMS, Temple, Drew University/NJMS, Penn State

RD: Georgetown (Dream School, applying restrictive EA apparently doesn't help more than RD, so I'm not going to give up ED opportunity), William & Mary, Drexel, NYU, Wake Forest, Tufts, BU, Boston College, Emory, University of Rochester, Lehigh, Upenn, Dartmouth, Yale 

Prob going to apply as an undecided or biology/biochem major, then maybe switch to CS if I don't want to go to med school."

I'm currently a junior in college majoring in CS and I'm set to graduate in the Fall of 2024.  Before I went to college pre-covid, I went to flight school and got my pilots license (I'm a CFI).

A family friend got me an internship this summer which I am super grateful for and was excited to start.

However I was on Indeed just looking at job openings and I find a full-time software job listing that had ""Pilots License Required"" written in it and applied for fun. According to glassdoor, the salary average is about 100k.

Well one thing led to another and now I have an interview scheduled and I don't even know if I want the job. If I get an offer, should I just not do my internship, put school on pause and work full time?  Is there an amount of money that is worth dropping everything for?

Realistically I could probably do some school part time while working, however it would definitely delay my graduation and I am also worried to let my family friend down by pulling out of this internship less than a month from when it starts.

With the current job market (assuming I get an offer) should I just accept and be grateful anyone even wanted to hire me?

I generally dislike school but tolerate it and work hard enough for decent grades, but I often dream about a normal 9-5 with no homework or exams, making enough money to live comfortably.  I've been working since I was 16 and enjoy working more than school.

This opportunity seems so rare and it seems I stumbled into a very unique skill set (Pilot + CS schooling) almost like this job is too fitting for me not to take it.  Isn't the point of graduating to enable opportunities like this?  Isn't the work experience more valuable than my classes?  I know I'm jumping the gun without an offer but I can't help but wonder what I should do if I was staring face to face with an offer letter.

Let me know what you think, thanks for reading."

Everyone should watch this, especially those from  the middle class for any school AND lower class that unfortunately can not attend a need blind school.

Community college is OK! Even if it's for one year to rehab your grades, sat, ect to get into a need blind school.

Need aware private schools or OOS are simply not worth it for most.

Most importantly, be realistic about your ability to repay.

Thinking CS, Finance, ect?

There is a strong likelihood that class of 27/28 will enter a depressed job market. Internships will also be more challenging to obtain. So as the economy rebounds, those after you will be better positioned to take those lucrative entry level jobs.

Pivoting to healthcare or law may also be tough, with more and more DO schools opening, hurting the match rate AND T14 law schools will be extremely difficult to get into in a down economy.

Headed to non-profit? Make sure you have 1000s of hours volunteering, to be sure you will be OK with working in that sector for 10+ years.

Don't believe the advertised cost of attendance. It's more.

For those that put a deposit, it's not too late to walk away and change your mind."

The courses are going great and I’m taking them with my good friends who also have similar passions. As a collective of people we create lots of music at my house and we plan on releasing projects overtime to the public. We have an amazing local music scene and plan on doing live shows along with collaborating on projects with other musicians in our area. 

Along with this I’m also currently apart of a internship program through my college where I will soon have the opportunity to work at a local music studio.

On the other side of things I started working a local deli job 2 days a week and getting payed roughly $130 every two weeks. The owner typically asks me to organize the walk in freezer and the store as whole. 

The job isn’t bad and the owner seems like they need my help around the store but I feel like I could quit and fully be pursuing music with the opportunities I’ve been given.

Side note: the owner has been interested in letting our band play at the deli so that is also an opportunity to consider.

Please help cause this has been a decision in my mind for a long time."

So far I think I’ve been doing well! I’ve gone through one phone and one video interview with a recruiter, then one phone interview with the executive assistant, and will be having a FaceTime interview with the Director of Operations this Thursday… so I’m going into my forth stage. 

Has anyone gone through the process before with Aldi? If so, how many stages was it for you? 

Also, any tips to secure the internship in the bag?

Thank you!"

136iryi,17,2023-05-03,Any Advice...?,Glittering_Muscle_62,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/136iryi/any_advice/,"Not sure if this is the most ideal thing to do but I just need to talk things out to empty my brain.

Long story short, I've been struggling a lot mentally since the end of hs due to some personal issues that arose. This impacted me a lot in my first year of uni, which only made things worst when I got a WAM of 50 and three failed courses. I thought I needed some break and so I took the third term off and ended up changing my degree. I came back to uni this year because I genuinely thought I was a lot better - in which I was. I started the year off great, being on top of lectures, weekly quizzes and homework. But things kinda went downhill ever since personal things happened again and I fell into the loop of being depressed, anxious and ashamed of myself. Consequently, it looks like I'm about to fail another course... Took an exam the other day and had a minor panic attack and ended up flunking the entire thing more than I had expected. To make things worse, this will be my third time failing this course and it has always been the final exam where I managed to turn the tables. Though I did change my degree, this course is shared and is also a core so I can't ditch it. Though I did enjoy other parts of this degree, now I'm starting to doubt my entire passion and decision because of my stupid anxiety that kicks in in tense situations. I'm honestly so scared now to enrol for the course next term - because I might fail again and get kicked out of my degree. Though my mentality wasn't in the greatest place this term, I really did enjoy what I learnt.

I can imagine that a lot of people would recommend me to take a break but that also scares me too. The fact that I'm already behind in my degree for failing courses and changing degrees, I don't want to fall behind even more. As positively I try to take in my current stance, I can't help but think about how much of a loser I am. I feel so ashamed and small whenever I see people work through their studies and towards their passion. I do have a passion too but I can't work towards it and now I'm starting to doubt it. At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if I was in uni for ten years, or even got kicked out considering my academic standing. One of the main reasons I'm writing this here is because I'm stressed and anxious about how I'll be behind everyone, no work done in uni or any work experience gained - and I just need to empty out my thoughts.

You might be wondering why I'm here instead of a counselling session but I've had the most painful experiences with psychologists and multiple mental health organisations that I've completely lost all my trust in them to ever help me out. Things can get really, really dark so I'll leave that there. On top of that, I was addicted to meds at one point and coming clean was another painful experience itself. As much as the thought of seeking help from a psychologist haunts me, after the anxiety attack I had in my exams I'm thinking about giving it one last chance. Though past experiences only made things worse for me, my mental health hasn't gone any better ever since I've stopped seeking help either. More so, considering how much worse things would be for me mentally and my life in general if I kept things the way it is now. That being said, I was wondering if the uni counselling system was good? Being a part of a large organisation, I'm assuming it'll be a lot better than the places I was previously sent to. Also, does the uni keep things confidential and personal? I don't want anyone to know that I'm struggling. To begin with, I feel embarrassed and ashamed for the person that I have come to be today and most people don't know I'm struggling - even my family and close friends think I'm doing a lot better now. I don't want to burden them with their concerns for me and I don't want to drain other people with the depressed facets of myself.

I honestly don't know what to do from here. I'm doubting my passions, my decisions, and am lost in what direction I should take all this disaster to. I'm so scared I'll get kicked out because of the repeated fails of the same course, I'm so scared I'll get a warning email about my academic stance, I'm so scared that I might need to meet up with higher ups because of how stupid I am, I'm so scared I'll fail again. I don't even know whether if it's even possible to bring my WAM up - which literally makes me so hopeless about internships and my life after uni. Considering I'm taking first year courses and have roughly a year and a half left until internships and four years until graduation, is it...?

Any words of advice or comments are welcome - positive or negative. Kinda need objective and honest perceptions about my situation to help me crack out of my depression and into reality. Thank you for reading this long long long post, and have a good night."

Everything I've learnt in uni to become an engineer feels like I've only gained it through sheer luck. I feel as if all of these things I've learnt and achieved up to this moment won't live up to my expectations when it comes to actually doing a job. For context, I need to do an internship to graduate which I haven't done because I've been working on a lot of personal things to the point that I completely forgot about it. Recently got a text from one of my last friends from my group to graduate and I suddenly feel like its all over for me. Thats it... I've been left behind. I feel hopeless seeing everyone succeed in what they are doing and I'm stuck worrying about whether or not I can perform a role or job correctly with the amount of skill I've obtained throughout my undergrad. I don't know what else to do and I'm scared for my future or where my life is headed towards. Worse, my parents have supported me throughout even though I've made a lot of decisions that would disappoint them. If they find out that I can't graduate after all the support they have given me, I don't think I'll be able to face them anymore. At this point I don't even know if anything I do will make a difference and it is inevitable that I will fail... I just don't know what to do anymore..."

Browsing through job offers here, i’ve noticed most of the companies ask for a minimum of 2 years of experience on a junior position and sometimes even a masters degree. 

I thought i might start with another internship but it seems most of them are looking for student, not fresh graduates and i don’t know if there is any chance they’ll offer a job offer after the internship or if i have any chance of landing one at all.

If anyone has any advice on what would be the best approach or if they know how these companies work in france i would be very grateful. 

ps: also my french level isn’t that high, something like A2-B1 maybe,

I still live at home, but my parents are selling and moving to Maine so I either had to find a place or go with them. I can't afford rent on Long Island so I'm leaving my job and going with them while I apply to other places. My current job has remote work for people but not for IT.  


I recently found out that someone the same age as me whose been here about a year makes 20k more than me and is in graphics. That kind of killed any motivation to want to work here, like that pisses me off the amount of work I do for this company and the time I have been here should've netted me equal pay. Also, I am a male and she's a female so where's this wage gap I hear so much about?   


I'm 24, have a computer science degree and make around $46,000 a year and am hourly. Is it reasonable for me to want more than that? Considering I live on Long Island where the average rent is over $2,000 a month which 1.5 paychecks, I don't think me wanting around $60,000 is unreasonable.

136pwl9,54,2023-05-03,"I got rejected from my dream school, after they interviewed me, and I am still not over it.",BrownBelt3471,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/136pwl9/i_got_rejected_from_my_dream_school_after_they/,"Long story short, I was flown out to my dream school for a PhD interview, and while I wasn't leaving the campus delusional about my admissions, I was confident that the interviews went well and that I am the closest I have ever been to achieving my career goals. The faculty was great, the campus was gorgeous, and the location was supreme -- I really saw myself being a part of this community and finally being en route to acheiving my dreams. Then came the rejeciton notice. It was sent to me at 12:14am on a Friday (Saturday morning technically) by someone who barely exists online, and signed by a committee that I never spoke to (the graduate committee).

I was out with friends that night, so I didn't let it ruin my night, plus I was interning at a cool firm and I knew that I was going to be given a permanent position. So, while I am not in grad school, at least I can support myself and also make more than a grad student. Wrong. Two weeks later my boss dropped the ball on me that I will not be offered a permanent position and this internship is permanent. So, things went from bad to worse. In two months time I will be out of a job and on the current job market with an arts degree.

I lost my countenance, and spiralled into a major nihilistic episode. In the span of two weeks I learned that I will have another year-long delay in my 6-year school plans, realized I will be unemployed in two months, and to make things worse, I had no one to support me; my therapist didn't get the significance of the rejeciton, my friends all moved away from the University in which we all studied together, my parents didn't know what to say, and I do not have a significant other to lean on, I was truly alone (and still am). I didn't plan for it, so all I could do was react emotionally, and the emotions were telling me that I am worthless and my life has lost its meaning. 

Never in my life have I felt so low and so undervalued as a person. If I wanted to kill myself this would be the most opportune time, because right now is the time where the least amount of people are paying attention to me and depending on me -- my absence would harm the least amount of people. I feel so much shame, it is incredible. For the entirety of my undergradaute degree I have forged this identity that I am a scholar, and I will be an up and coming one, all for it to be crushed by a graduate committee that said I lacked ""relevant research experience"" when I already carried two publications. I was told that what mattered the most was research experience and publications in undergrad, and that is exactly what I carried. No one told me that I needed research experience that was relevant to what I was applying to, so I was working in labs that were fun to be in, all the while trying to figure out what I wanted in my degree -- I only realized what I wanted to continue my studes in, in my senior year, so all my efforts feel punished and unrewarded... kind of like it doesn't matter. 

As of right now, I have no interest in my future and in my self. I am a very visual person, but when I think of my future all I see is emptyness; there is nothing for me. All my talents seem wasted on, all my efforts unrecognized, and I feel nothing but dread when thinking about reaching out to professors to work in ""relevant"" labs or even future graduate school PI's; my existence seems nothing short of shameful. 

I wanna get out of this, but I don't seem to care. I feel right in my convictions that I got cheated by the grad committee and that they truly ruined my life. But there is no way to appeal their decisions or to really fight back against them. Academia is a cesspool of nepotism, there is no way they will ever receive an angry letter from me, that would be a career killer. 

So how am I to overcome this, because I really don't want to. Being where I am at, all I feel is intense judgment because I have very few people I can reach out to consistently. I have a lot of friends, and a lot of close ones -- I am seriously grateful for them -- but I cannot rely on them for consisten help. Many of them have full time careers, significant others, and are out of the country, they have different priorities besides catering to me. 

None of this inspires confidence to act. Even though the PI that I applied to expressed his condolences and even gave me some advice on how to overcome this, I ignored it. I feel too hurt by this, and my destroyed identity cannot handle admitting to other scholars that I am a rejected graduate student looking to volunteer in their labs (yes, where I am at, paid positions are non-existant), it's not fair. 

I hate being in this state of inertia, I want to get out. 

Signed, me."

This post is directed to those rejected from Medicine, and still wish to pursue Medicine regardless and looking for some advice on your next few steps. 

(*disclaimer: this post is created with the main purpose of helping someone who might be in the same position, in no means are my advice totally correct nor the best! )*

Just wanted to let y'all know firstly that I know how it feels. Trust me. I thoroughly went through each stage of the 5-stages of grief before I came to terms with my rejection into Medicine last year. It is totally okay and fine to wallow in your depressive stage now but once that has passed, the next question would then be: what next?

If you are considering a gap year as one of your options, then this post is for you.

Just last year, when I felt so lost and was grappling with the reality of the rejection, I felt like there was a lack of advice going around about taking a gap year and reapplying into Medicine.

So here's some advice/ things I did to plan out my gap year that hopefully find its way to someone who would find this helpful!

**Planning your gap year**

Firstly, note that you have about 9 months or so leading up to your reapplication.

While you are using these 9 months to boost your portfolio for the reapplication (reality check) , I honestly really disagree with the fact that you should be planning these 9 months on the sole basis of getting into Medicine again in the following year. Instead, you could look at this gap year as a year of growth and self-improvement. That way, even if you leave the gap year (touch wood) not getting into Medicine, this precious once-in-a-life-time space and time you have given yourself to grow in maturity and experiences would be so so worth it.

A pertinent question to ask yourself while planning your gap year is:

\- What are my weaknesses?/ What are some gaps in my personality that may stop me from becoming a good Doctor?

\- Why Medicine? (I would presume that your reason to study Medicine is strong enough for you to take a gap year)

\- if I don't get into Medicine again next year, what will I do?

(tip: you could jot these down on a notebook or on your computer somewhere to reflect : draw out a mindmap/ use google jamboard)

After you answer these questions, you can start thinking of internships/jobs/activities, medical or non-medical related, that can help to improve on the weaknesses you identified.

( *For me, I identified my weakness to be impatience. I then interned at a special ed school where I found so much growth in myself and my love for the special needs community)*

For your back up plan, (just a suggestion) you could always intern at a healthcare-related organisation so you not only gain healthcare knowledge but you also gain other industry-grade skills that can be applied to any other fields you may decide to go into eventually. 

Alternatively, you could just allocate a few months into exploring your second career option! 

It will be good to diversify your experiences. So for example, try not to do an (e.g.) internship that takes up more than 6 months so you can allocate your time into improving yourself or learning new things in other areas!

*( just an advice from me to you: try not to do something you dislike but will ""boost your portfolio"" nor something that you can't gain much out of (e.g. a repetitive skill, deskjob (throwing some random examples) )because it would be a waste of time and it would be pretty apparent to the interviewers if you have not gained much out of that activity... )*

**Application Routes & Advice**

If you did not attend NTU Interview this year, I would say that it is a blessing in disguise! Study hard for UCAT and make sure you secure an interview spot and a chance for the interviewers to find out more about your personality and passion for Medicine!

If you have attended NUS Medicine interview already, you have to apply through the ABAS route.

I have heard stories of ABAS reapplicants who have done much to boost their portfolios but were not even given a shot at the interviews so it is important to note of this possibility. To be straightforward with you, chances of getting an interview through ABAS is higher if you have a WOW factor in your portfolio (e.g. being in the national team, winning a national level award, doing an outstanding research etc... you get it..). Interning in a clinic and volunteering throughout your gap year may not get you through to the interview. (while I KNOWW that these activities reflect your desire to study medicine, unfortunately, the admissions team is looking for something MORE.. reality check.. ;// )

For me, I attended NTU interviews for the first time this year and reapplied to NUS Medicine via ABAS!

**Last Words**

I am very blessed and fortunate to have left this gap year, gaining more than I could ever ask for :)

I have gained so many experiences, had new and current friends who rooted for me along this journey and have grown in maturity and a renewed purpose and passion towards Medicine.

(and to my christianfronz here's a verse to encourage you:

*""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."" - Romans 8:28)*

Regardless, I wish you all the best in your gap year or the road you choose to take eventually. Remember to give yourself time to ponder over your choice. I know it is not easy to be stuck at such an important crossroad of life at 18/19?!?! but trust me, all things work out for good. and hey, you only grow stronger from the challenges you face! screw societal expectations and norms, if Medicine is really a career you want to do, then use this year wisely, live it to the fullest and you will find growth.

and to those who chose to pursue another career other than medicine, you can laugh at ur med frens who are slaving away in the hospitals on an income much lower than yours and tell yourself, wah heng they didn't accept me then!

ahah ok jokes aside,

I hope this post finds you well, and helped you in one way or another... If you need anyone to talk to /rant to / vent or have any questions, feel free to DM me, I will try my best to help you out as best as I can!"

Hey everyone I would appreciate your opinion on my next step towards becoming a software engineer. 

I have been self teaching for about 8 months now and have enjoyed it very much. I have excellent previous work experience in engineering and project management, but I left all of that behind to become a software engineer. 

I have been accepted and preparing to attend a bootcamp that starts soon. It's FREE for me using my GI bill and I get some cash as well. The school has good Cirr reports on job placements. I moved to a new city for this school because it seemed like the best bet out of all the schools I could attend. 

However, I have also been offered an opportunity to work at a startup as an intern. It's a legit startup but only has a small 1st round of funding. They have a principle engineer and a couple of jr software engineers right now on the coding side of things. They want to get a couple more interns this summer. 

Also, I randomly met the CEO and cofounder which is how I got this opportunity. It sounds like they might be interested in seeing if I could also attend some of the executive type meetings with them due to my résumé. They have a decent product idea involving a sports betting game for in person events and have rolled out a beta version to some real world clients, but aren't self sustaining yet. It sounds like if they get more funding then obviously that's when compensation other than vesting would come into play. 

So should I consider the internship over the bootcamp? The bootcamp has excellent job placements (for a bootcamp) it seems, but I can also just defer my start date to a later class. 

Anyways, I've already made this post pretty long. If you made it this far I thank you for your time!"

I can learn any technology if required so too because I am used to reading documentation and figuring out stuff. I would appreciate any referrals and guidance from you guys. Thank you."

(Data science internship or energy trader?)",sinfulducking,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/136sa40/i_have_two_appealing_paths_in_front_of_me_but/,"Hi there everyone. I am writing this post because I am truly stumped in what to do next with my career. I have a BS in Mathematics and am halfway through an MS in Statistics & Data Science. 

This Summer, I have a position secured as a Data Science & Cybersecurity Intern with a company in my city. However, I had a recruiter reach out in the last few weeks to work in Seattle with PSE (utilities company) as an energy trader. 

The energy trader position has a TC of ~$125k, with room for upward mobility and perhaps a shift in the future to other departments. 

My question is the following: If I give up the DS internship here in town, is it feasible that I could return to DS in the future? Should I even return to DS if the energy job is good? Energy/utilities is certainly not my passion, and I love Data Science. This internship would be great, and probably a stepping stone to something larger in the future. However, the internship is $25/hr, and I wouldn’t get a full time job until at least May 2024. 

I am just so conflicted on whether the energy role is a good idea or not. Its a real leap of faith, and quite scary. It’s way more money than I’ve ever made, but am I missing out on more money in the future by ditching the data science role? TIA for any perspective and thoughts."

136t1kx,3,2023-05-03,My life has been such a pain in the arse so far,Lillyaja,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/136t1kx/my_life_has_been_such_a_pain_in_the_arse_so_far/,"This is a LONG rant, complaining about all the shit that went wrong in my life, please beware ;;

For context, Im 21 now and I live in a 1st world country. English isn't my native language but I tried my best with this text. ><

My mom was a young drug junkie that got pregnant by accident and didn't want to get an abortion. She dipped shortly after I was born and I was stuck with my dad (who was like 10 years older than her, what a red flag already). That guy didn't even want children to begin with, and especially not a girl apparently. At first he was a decent dad, he spent a lot of time with me and fought hard for sole custody. That changed slowly after I got into school. It started with little things. He refused to do girly activities with me, because ""I'm a guy, women can just do that kind of stuff better"", throwing away lots of chances to bond and rejecting me because he's too proud of his masculinity or some shit. I hugged him a lot and was a pretty clingy kid, always sticking to him to the point where he got annoyed/concerned and told me to find friends my age. Except the hugs which I initiated 95% of the time, I got zero affection though. In 21 years, I've never even once heard him say ""I love you"", ""I'm proud of you"", ""I'm here for you"" or anything that insinuated that I'm wanted and loved. Not a single. damn. time. He also sent me to one of my grandparents repeatedly, despite me begging him not to since I got emotionally abused and potentially even SA'd there. I don't have any active memories of the latter happening, but thinking back there were some REALLY concerning signs. 

Next thing on the list is finances. We kinda had a ""rough"" time financially since he was a single parent, but he never even tried to give me a nice life whatsoever. I had to pay for *everything* myself except the absolute basic necessities with the measly allowance that he gave me. Try buying yourself something nice with 2 Euros a month. Or even 0, since he told me to save up for a toy myself when I was 4, when I didn't even get an allowance yet. And no, we weren't THAT poor, he's just a stingy fuck and wanted to teach me to ""value money"", resulting in me being unable to spend money on myself nowadays without feeling insanely guilty. (And I'm talking about sums below 10 Euros, it makes me so anxious to spend money in general) 

One of my other favorite things is, how he neglected my health. Especially my mental health but I'll talk about that later, right now I mean my physical health. One example would be when my dentist clearly told him that my teeth will break over the years if we don't fix them. I was 7. Guess who can pay for her own braces now that I'm an adult (since insurance only covers braces for minors), finally with some decently serious tooth damage, because he did NOT get me my free braces when I was younger <3 Or the time where I stayed up the entire night because I had the most intense pain I ever felt in my life, and my dad preferred to go back to sleep because he was tired instead of driving me to a hospital. I also cooked my own meals like 95% of the time after I turned 10, and spend most of my days alone after 13-14 since he'd rather hang with his girlfriend or brother, or go party.

I didn't even get a break at school. I'm neurodivergent and used to be a gifted child, pretty good at everything except socializing. I got bullied mercilessly by around 10 different people for the first 5 years, and ostracized for the following 9 years. (I switched schools twice so I spent 14 years going to an in-person school since it's illegal to be homeschooled in my country and my dad would've never allowed me to drop out of the official system anyway) The bullying didn't happen because they were jealous or whatever, it was because I had really intense tantrums/meltdowns when they provoked me. They enjoyed the fuck out of triggering me to the point where I had meltdowns very frequently. My dad and literally everyone else always blamed me for the bullying. They blamed an ELEMENTARY SCHOOLER. ""It's your fault anon, just don't have tantrums and meltdowns, that makes them wanna bully you even more. Your emotional reactions feed them, just ignore them."" I was BARELY older than a toddler when it started for FUCKS sake. Just intervene you dipshits. It didn't help that I did not have a single friend at school for those whole 14 years. No one ever had my back, I'd sometimes spend days without saying a single word. And then, after my 8-9 hour long school days I came home to a father who blamed me for all of it. (My first school was almost like a daycare to make it easier for the parents, so the days were LONG) I have to admit that I definitely had issues, but god jesus christ I was basically a baby. When I got older my social anxiety just got so terribly bad, that my body language was so horrible that people automatically left me out and kept their distance. I'm aware of that, but my phobia became so crippling that I just couldn't help it. People refused to interact with me when I got put into groups with them, for school projects and the like. That traumatized me even further and ruined my grades since I had to do group projects that were meant for 4-5 people all by myself. I had to force myself REALLY hard through my last three years of schooling. I wanted to say ""fuck it"" and give up so badly, every single day. The thing that kept me semi sane and helped me push through was that I had a verbal ""contract"" with my dad. He would allow me to take a year off after I graduate, as a ""reward"", so I could focus on my mental health. My mental health was a catastrophe after over a decade of this continuous heavy trauma while having no real support system whatsoever. My dad made sure to invalidate me and my mental health regularly, refusing to do research on it or at least to give me emotional support. I SOMEHOW managed to graduate, and even got a minimum wage internship for 4 months, paying my dad rent during that time. Not even a week after the internship was over, he told me to get a job again so I can keep paying him rent. ""You're an adult now, you have to contribute to this household"", completely forgetting about his promise. I just can't make this shit up.

I'm finally in the process of getting help now, without my dad's support or knowledge. I can only hope that it will help me. I really do feel unfixable.

A small but important detail: My dad *did* put me in therapy a couple times, but that isn't worth much if you're stuck in such a toxic environment (and neither my home nor school were a safe place). Plus, they never found the true cause of my problems/misery. They just always assumed it was because my mom left me early on. That definitely breaks my heart, but it's ridiculous to call that the main reason. I only started discovering the true reasons recently, which is why I'm writing this post. It took me over a decade because of the intense brainwashing that my dad did to me. It's incredibly fresh and the pain and anger is really strong, but it's progress and I think that's a pretty good thing.

Writing all of this helped me process everything actually, at least a little bit. Thanks for reading."

I recently graduated from a 3 year diploma focused on Network Engineering and enjoyed it. I also was able to accumulate around 1 year of internship with 3 companies (Municipality, Software Company and an ISP). The roles ranged from PC/Desktop Support, NOC Server administration and Product support (mostly SQL related). As for certs, I have my AWS CCP/SAA and CCNA, and currently studying to get the Sec+. I just do not feel strong about my experience when it comes to relevancy with the roles. I have some projects to make up for it, but do not feel confident. 

I am thinking about going for a degree in Cyber security and trying to land desired internships to make up for the lack of relevant experience. That route will take around 2.5 years. Is that the way to go or should I just jump into the industry with what I have? Also doesn't help looking at the current state of the market."

This is my third week, and so far, I haven't been assigned any tasks. On my first day, I met my boss in person, but since then, we have only communicated through Teams and occasional phone calls. Unfortunately, I am still waiting for permission to access the developer environment and for my licenses to be activated. My boss doesn't seem to be interested in expediting this process.

Yesterday, my boss finally asked me to complete a task by brainstorming some ideas. This was the first time he had given me an assignment since I joined. Today, I sent him a message, and he asked to see the work I had done yesterday. I shared my ideas with him, but he has yet to reply. He often doesn't respond to my questions throughout the day and hasn't made any effort to grant me access to the necessary licenses.

I am eager to work and showcase my skills, rather than just sitting at home all day. My hope is to make a good impression during this internship and potentially secure a position at this company, as it is a great place to work.

I message him on teams now and then and he says he will catchup with me and that he is busy today

Maybe some of yall would have an easier time if you can get a FT return offer from your internship (if you have one), but if you don't then you better start job hunting early before you start your senior year. I did not a FT offer from my internship due to a hiring freeze and I kid you not when people say entry-level jobs are hard to get. I thought people were exaggerating when they say entry-level jobs are hard to get (in general) and they are 100% right. You will not have a problem getting ""a job"" with a cs degree but getting a high-paying or decent paying CS related job like SWE for example is extremely, extremely difficult at entry-level.  I applied literally to swe and non-swe roles and I didn't get a callback despite having 2 swe internships. Out of like  500 apps I applied to, I only got 4 interviews and the rest just ghosted me.  This entire process took me 7-8 months. Now, don't let discouraging posts of people who say getting an entry-level job is impossible. If you believe that sht, then you will never get a job period. You need to have a positive mindset because getting a well-paying entry level job is POSSIBLE because I did it. You just need a lot of persistence, motivation and hours of interview preparation you need to put in so whenever that 1 opportunity comes your way, you do well and get that job offer."

I’ve spent way more time in college than I should have. I spent 3 years on an associate’s in animation because it was very challenging and I had to retake a course that was only offered in the spring. I enjoyed the program but during my last year of it I began to question whether I would be able to find work since there aren’t really a lot of animation jobs where I live and my portfolio wasn’t very good. I also found that I didn’t really enjoy 3D animation and things like texturing and rigging as much as I just enjoyed drawing and 2D animation which is even harder to find jobs in. After I graduated from community college, I almost wanted to take a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do next but instead I immediately jumped into doing a graphic design bachelor program at a local private school just so I wouldn’t fall behind and so I could commute from my parents’ house. I thought graphic design would be a good career option for me since again I love to draw and I figured I could go into motion graphics to incorporate my love of animation. 
My first year at university was rough. My grandma died, I couldn’t make any friends like I did at community college, I didn’t like my graphic design courses or professors; the pandemic started and all my courses were moved online and I just kept comparing myself to my more talented classmates. I also started to do more research into the graphic design field which I really should have done before the program) and realized that a degree isn’t even necessary for a career. So did I drop out? No, but I really should have. Instead I stayed because I didn’t want to disappoint my family and myself by being a “drop out” even though there really isn’t anything wrong with that if college just doesn’t work. 
I stayed and changed my major about 3 times before settling on a bachelor’s in business administration and digital marketing. Now I don’t hate my major as I get to incorporate my interests in tech and writing and I’ve even started to become more interested in finances. But I can’t let go of my love for animation either. I’ve still been trying to improve my animation skills outside of school and build my portfolio but I don’t really have a lot of time to do so. I feel like I’ve become too unfocused and I don’t even know what I want to do as a career anymore. I hate myself for being so dumb and wasting time and money during my education journey. I could have finished my bachelor’s program in 2 years but now with how many times I’ve changed majors I’m finishing in 3.5 years.  
With how much time I spend on school I still haven’t had the time to build a decent enough portfolio to even get freelance work. My career experience mostly in retail and childcare work though I have been volunteering as a social media assistant for a local nonprofit for quite awhile which has helped me to land a couple of social media internship interviews (that plus sharing my resume on r/resumes and making lots of adjustments) but when it came to deciding whether I was a good fit for the job; both interviewers wanted someone with less knowledge of content creation and more knowledge in analytics which my program hasn’t really covered much on digital marketing tools yet. Idk what I should be focusing on; social media marketing or motion graphics. I thought maybe I could combine them but it seems like I really have to pick a focus if I want to find work after graduation. I'm so scared of not finding a job.
All of this has caused me to become very depressed and angry at myself for being so stupid. I know I should see some sort of therapist but I really don’t have the time or money to do so. Idk what to do so any advice would help. Thank you for reading."

I don't even like programming much and I work for the government because I couldn't bring myself to study leetcode because I dislike it so much. My talents lie in the liberal arts, but I chose a CS major 1. because I used to be extremely socially anxious and wanted a job away from people, which has gotten better and 2. to get out of poverty, which paid off tremendously.

What options are there for people like me? I'm not totally talentless, I went to a very prestigious university and am pretty intelligent. I'm a lot better socially than I used to be but I still feel like highly social, extraverted jobs would leave me stressed out at the end of the day.

I probably have some time because I work for local government, so it will probably be several years before it actually happens to me, but I'd rather just get ahead of it and pivot to a different field, or something in tech that wouldn't get automated by AI, but I'm so unsure of timeline, etc.

I love psychology and have thought about becoming a therapist, but I would have to go to school for 4 years while working part-time, and then probably quit my job to do some internship. It doesn't seem realistic. Other jobs I would do well in are ones that will also victim to AI, and I can't really become a doctor or lawyer overnight to get high pay.

Where do you think all the reluctant programmers like me will go once there is no more room for us?"

I have been searching for apartments for the past 2 months as I’ll have an internship in Ingolstadt. I was wondering if anyone had any tips to help with this process as it has been a struggle. I speak German, have citizenship as a German and have been able to provide proper documentation but have been unable to find a place to rent(looking to rent for about 6-7 months). I will continue to apply to Studentenwohnungen and on sites such as WG-Gesucht but as I get closer and closer to moving to Germany it is getting extremely stressful trying to find a place to live. If anyone has any tips please let me know!! Any help is greatly appreciated thank you. 😊"

&#x200B;

I am sharing my concerns here. I am a third year student who is looking for internships in QA, SD or even UI/UX. However, I am not getting any, its either cuz I don't have enough experience or lack in ""out of box"" projects or I do a coding test and get ghosted.. I am getting really really demotivated and want to cry.

I've been reading research papers, working on a couple side projects, and practicing LC as well as applying to internships.

However, it looks like most companies want people who are still in undergrad, and the job market is poor to boot. I've sent out \~150 applications and got 1 online assessment the results of which are still pending. It's already May, so I'm not optimistic about getting opportunities in the summer.

Does anyone have recommendations as to what to do until the fall? I've thought about just doing a part-time retail job and grind research/projects on the side, but I'm struggling to write a resume since I don't have any retail experience."
137114d,10,2023-05-03,People who switched in from software engineering - why?,baconoodles,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/137114d/people_who_switched_in_from_software_engineering/,"I’m a 3rd year CS major in undergrad right now, and I’ve been planning to go into software engineering after graduation for the entire time I’ve been in college. 

However, I had an extended stay in the hospital 2 years ago (I had a brain injury), I’m actively researching the latest innovations in neuro rehabilitation, I’m still doing rehab several times a week, and I’m constantly in awe at how medicine changed my life. has forced me to reconsider my career choices slightly, as the healthcare field has supported me and raised me up in one of the darkest times of my life and allowed me to return to school and have a future, and I’ve been able to learn so much about the healthcare field, anatomy, pharmacology, and so much more. 

I became drawn to bioinformatics a few months ago because it seems like the easiest way to combine my strong programming skills with a hard science and really have a fulfilling job that impacts the healthcare field. I’m excited by the prospect of contributing to new technologies and improving the quality of life of patients with certain diseases or other medical conditions by giving back to the medical field in return for all the help and love it has shown me. (I really thought long and hard about a software engineering career, and after going through what I went through, somehow writing code for a company like Amazon or Uber no longer seems particularly fulfilling anymore.)

A bit more information: I had a software engineering internship at a well-known tech firm last summer, and it was there that I was able to experience how work gets done in the tech industry: sprints, tasks, the Scrum model, code reviews, etc.

I don’t have a formal background in biology, but I plan on taking my school’s introductory bio course this fall (fall of my 4th year), as it covers a bit of genetics and is part of the bioinformatics minor here anyway. I’m hoping this will be a good way to test the waters and see if my interest is genuine.

Now, here’s the issue: I’m greatly intrigued by the science and the fulfillment that bioinformatics can provide me over a “code monkey” job in tech, but I’m also turned off by how unorganized and different the software development processes and range of tools seem to be, which I’ve gathered from lurking in this subreddit for a bit (things seem to lack the order and organization that teams at large tech companies have — sprints, code reviews, and good code writing practices), and additionally the tools that bioinformaticians use to sequence genes seem to vary from company to company, there’s never a consensus on how to do a specific thing, and the internal tools are either dysfunctional, unmaintained, non-standard, or messy and completely different from things I’m familiar with like Javascript, AWS, etc.

A switch like the one I’m considering will also require at minimum a masters, whereas in SWE a bachelors is sufficient. So I’ve have more schooling and probably need more experience in a wet lab of some sort, which I’ve never done before.

To summarize, I’m accustomed to and like the structure and order of traditional SWE teams, and I feel that in bioinformatics I’ll get more fulfillment but also more messiness and chaos. Am I viewing this the wrong way? Can anyone who’s gone from SWE -> bioinformatics share their experience? So you regret it?"

White female, from New England. Attending a HADES boarding school (Hotchkiss, Andover, Deerfield, Exeter, St. Pauls). Currently going in as recruited athlete, but it might not work out because I do have pretty detrimental mental health conditions that require really shitty medication. Both parents went to Harvard college and Harvard grad school. Uncle and aunt went to Princeton and Yale respectively. All are donors, but not on the level of donating buildings.

Prefer not to state household income but... yeah it's probably pretty high. I don't actually know what it is.

**Intended Major(s):**

Classics, African American Studies

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

36 ACT, 1550 SAT (PROJECTED; have not taken a real one, but I took a couple old ones for fun. I think if I study I can get higher but IDK.)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

School has neither but I predict I'm in the top 35% of my class. Weighted GPA of 4.2, UW 3.75.

**Coursework:** School does not have AP classes, but I am taking AP Latin, AP Lang, AP Lit, AP Calc AB and APUSH.

College-level classes as a JR: English III, Latin, U.S. History, Calculus AB. Taking honors physics and an independent study in Greek.

Next year:

**College level: Stats, English Creative Writing, Satire, Stories of war; Research seminar; Critical race theory; Modern African American History; Latin IV; Roman satire; early Roman poetry; Cicero**

**Non College-level: Ancient philosophy, ethics, philosophy of nonviolence, photography III, music history.**

**Awards:**

Junior nationals gold medal

Junior regionals gold medal (x2)

New England boarding school rowing conference gold medal x3

Interscholastic rowing gold medal 1x, silver medal x2

Summer internship in biomechanical engineering at a top 3 hospital

Regular contributor to a journal for classics (Paideia institute)

President of an academic club with 800+ members across the U.S.

Head tour guide

Won the school stock market game twice by myself. Beat out the investment club somehow lol. Not sure if this counts.

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Likely very strong essays and LORs. I'm really good at writing essays and I know two of my teachers quite personally. They know that I am a very curious student and decent at school.

**Schools:**

Thinking of EDing to Brown.

RD Order of interest: NYU, Williams, Harvard, Stanford, Syracuse, Tufts, Cornell, BU, UMich.

\---

Lowkey more interested in african american studies but I'm barely taking any courses for that. My relationship with my latin teacher is also far weaker than my history teacher. I'm mostly just worried about my GPA. And I don't feel like my ECs are very concentrated. I also don't have many big name awards, but I have been writing a paper for the Concord review for a couple months. IDK."
13748eo,61,2023-05-03,Probably have landed an internship!,NukemN1ck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13748eo/probably_have_landed_an_internship/,"After a few months of applying to companies and not getting responses, I decided to take a more eager approach. Starting last week, I looked up small companies around my area (1-10 sized teams) on Google, found their LinkedIn company profile, and requested to connect to the Director, CEO, or Hiring Manager (whoever's info I was able to find on the profile). It was a simple request - I said hello, introduced myself, and said I was interested in discussing summer internship opportunities at their company. 

One CEO replied, and now I most likely have an internship at their company for full stack web development! While it's not set in stone, they have been extremely receptive, asking me if I'm interested in x project, and now I have a call lined up soon to discuss in more detail. 

The point of this post is, please don't give up searching for internships. Sometimes a direct personal approach will give you opportunities other people weren't find, and remember that the perks of CS is that almost all companies need a developer, so even if they're not actively searching, they still may be interested!"

But the general competition and the constant studying required has totally sucked the life out of me. I don't remember the last time when I felt genuinely relaxed and happy and the pressure is so much that even now during my internship after completing the day's work, I feel the need to go do Leetcode. I haven't had a proper interaction with anyone in a long time and sometimes don't feel like I deserve to be loved.

Tldr: CS may be nice but it has changed me as a person and not in a positive way"
137576q,41,2023-05-03,Got a JO from the company I was interning with. Uncomfortable with the offer.,Stycroft,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/137576q/got_a_jo_from_the_company_i_was_interning_with/,"So I interned for this company as a UI/UX designer for 4 months and did pretty well. I did 3 projects and was offered to be absorbed. I've grown friendly with my colleagues and would love to stay for job security as a graduating student but I am uncomfortable with their offer.

Basically I asked for 30k kasi alam ko na bababaan nila yan. I worked at BPO before which pays 22K package so I was hoping a higher salary than that so sinet ko sakin na minimum ko is 25k, base narin sa average entry level UI/UX designer salary research ko dito sa pinas.

I was disappointed na initial offer nila is 18k which napataas ko na 20k since sabi ko may internship experience naman na ko. Sabi nila 20k sagad na daw yun kasi entry level palang daw naman. No benefits, allowances thats it. I said yes even though nababaan ako pero di ko pa pinirmahan. I have until May 05 to decide.

Talked to friends and gf about this and they said mababa nga daw, taxes at gastos ko pa daw sa office since 2 days per week onsite. Talked to my manager who I'm friendly with about this and said mababa nga daw talaga sa company nila sa mga entry-level so he adviced either to not accept or to accept it while actively looking for a job.

Now I'm leaning na hindi nalang iaccept, though kaya ko rin gusto tanggapin na kasi mahirap mahire sa field na to with no experience. Would like for anyone to give an advice, would also appreciate someone who's a UI/UX designer to give their input. UI/UX designer is my first career choice pero baka maiba landas ko sa IT pag mababa talaga bigayan sa pinas.

Edit: thank you for all the advices and insights. Binasa ko sila at inintindi alaga, thank you for different perspectives. I have decided to decline the offer since sa loob ko alam ko yung qualifications at skills ko. I guess medyo naging attached ako sa work culture sa team na napuntahan ko and comfortable ako sa tasks ko currently kaya parang ayaw ko umalis pero at the end of the day, money talks and I know I could be somewhere where they value my worth. Lowball vibes talaga eh.

Once again thanks everyone!"
1375yuw,1,2023-05-03,Pay at Private Practice vs Agency as a Resident in Counseling Rant/Need Advice,deadgirl5683,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1375yuw/pay_at_private_practice_vs_agency_as_a_resident/,"Hi everyone. So I'm looking for any type of input here. I currently work as a counseling intern at a very small private practice in northern VA it's really just me and my supervisor until the fall. I graduate this month and start residency shortly thereafter. She has agreed to hire me as Resident in Counseling and that was sort of decided early on when I went to be an intern at her PP. The part I am really struggling with is the pay so I had hoped for 40/hr or more when we got into that discussion finally after waiting months through internship to discuss it so I could decide whether to be looking for other work at the beginning of April and she offered 30/hr. I was understandably disappointed especially followed by the words direct client contact, no health insurance, no 401k, no PTO etc. Which since I made the choice to do PP wasn't too unexpected but still, I should at least make more money in PP than in an agency especially with so much autonomy and complicated cases (we do PTSD, trauma, EMDR, IFS etc) so we take a lot of complex cases. That's also why I wanted to work with her so I could get that experience because I want to specialize in this area as an LPC so lots of incentive to stay.

Like 8 years of school in total counting my undergrad and associated work experience, training, sweat blood and tears working my serving job taking so much crap and abuse from my managers there and guests and other servers telling myself to just to get through to this otherside while doing school and just trying to keep myself alive by you know attending to my basic needs.. then that little pay? I'm also an excellent worker btw, very flexible, friendly, approachable, always on time or early, very reliable, I do my notes same day, great with clients, good at scheduling, never complain when things go wrong or she needs to cancel last minute, etc. I know these are sort of already expectations but I just say them because that is also a considerable value in a worker. I know we don't make a lot starting out but wow am I disappointed. Anyway, I initially agreed to the 30/hr but then later negotiated up to 35/hr. I had asked to negotiate and she was pretty closed off to it and wasn't willing to do what I asked for (40/hr) but did meet me halfway at 35 so there’s no room to try and go up more with her clearly. It's 35/hr direct client contact for 30 clients a week so all other time aka scheduling, note taking, reaching out to clients, marketing etc is all my own time. I realize most of us do notes the last 10 minutes of the hour but as we all know, that's not always possible. I'm building up my caseload, marketing to get clients (she has been sending me most of the referrals), doing notes, and as we all know scheduling by itself is hardly JUST scheduling. The only thing that helps is she does billing. But i have to put and gather all the information so that is also considerably time consuming. So in essence, I am very busy. Most days I'm doing my notes or putting together my schedule or other things until 7-8-9pm because I have clients back to back like 9-6 or 12-7, I am an hour drive away from the office as well so I have to add an hour to everything. The perk of this is that I make my own hours, I can do ""telehealth days"" and mix it up. I didn't necessarily want to work in an agency because it's a lot of overheard and I personally loathe medicaid. I have also worked in an agency as a community based worker (IIH, MHS, PM, etc) doing direct client contact and I hated it. The paperwork was endless, the money sucked, granted I was a bachelors level back then but still. I resented clients when they cancelled or didn't show up. And while I will still get paid for ""no shows"" at the PP, I have to basically hope they don't cancel responsibly (more than 24 hours in advance) so I get paid? That feels so wrong. 

I've already accepted her offer because I felt backed into a corner financially and like license wise to start my hours. I have been building a caseload but after a day like today where I'm just so tired and still have to work my serving job on the weekends because pay won't start until after I graduate, and even may have to keep it after that. I feel hopeless. Like I should have chosen another field.

I'm just feeling so frustrated by our field right now guys like, I feel like I worked so hard to get here, got a 4.0, struggled cried, never saw family, missed birthdays, holidays, missed so many friends I could have made, never saw the friends I do have, important events, and for what? To barely survive off this pay and never see anyone for another 2-3 years because I'm just drowning in bills and financial problems trying to get my hours done for licensure? My credit card is almost maxed out! Just applied to increase the limit thinking of activating another one. I also have PCOS so the stress is making it sooo much worse. My skin is breaking out my hairs falling out more I’m not sleeping well. And my loans will kick in when I graduate. My car is like on its last legs idk how I’ll afford a different one when it finally poops out which will probably be soon. Idk what I'm looking for here, maybe just any sort of encouragement or even just being blunt and telling me what I should do would be nice."

It’ll be in a language (C++) I have no experience with, and by the time my internship starts I’ll only have had cs 1 and 2 completed. I’m really nervous for this internship because I don’t want to feel absolutely useless while I’m there. What should I do to take advantage of this opportunity and learn as much as I can while not being a complete dead weight?"

I've seen people winning multiple hackathons, developing apps, getting paid internships, and making coding courses all in the same application but end up getting rejected from a good majority of schools.

as of right now, none of this stuff is on my application nor will it me. I am trying to learn how to code and I plan on developing a website to make high quality free education more accessible/findable, but this will probably end up being my only CS related extracurricular.

Even though my academics are the best in my school, do I have a chance at any of the decently high ranked schools? I do live in a rural town and no one in my class has anywhere near as much initiative as me (class of 200), but with CS I feel like no matter where I live, I need to have an insane application just to be considered by admissions.

What do I do, and will I even go to a decent college, I don't want to put in all of this work just to end up at a safety school with a 90% acceptance rate"

I've always thought of finance and specifically IB as a career path I would want, and decided I may want to pursue it. I reached out to someone I know well personally who is a senior-MD at an elite boutique and offered to help me out. I didn't want to press him too much but from what I gathered on here, chances are I'll get some sort of interview. 

My questions mostly revolve around this aspect. Behavioral interviews aside, I'm wondering what to expect from the technical side and what people recommend to review. Are there any books I can go through that will assure I'm prepared given practice? I am very good at CS LeetCode style interviews as well as math/stats style interviews from quant firms. Can I even be sure I'd get an interview?

I'm also wondering what people think of this? How often do you see people who studied STEM in Finance? Is it possible these skills will be useful?"

This coming from a guy who has very happening life and multiple friend groups. I am everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Have some wonderful friends doing wonderful things.

Time’s moving way too fast and It feels like I have achieved nothing yet. A feeling of failure glooms me. Stuck in a loop since after highschool. 

Everything’s mess, Chaos everywhere. My mind, my body, my habits all in shambles. Occasional burst of energy to do or start something be something just fades quicker n quicker as time passes.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. Things have been way too hard and clueless for too long now and I’ve lost my way in & out. 

My life feels like falling dominoes only waiting for the final piece to fall to end this cursed cycle of hopelessness.

I am currently a 2nd year CS student in West Europe.

I am thinking of applying to several junior software engineer roles at startups so I can work full time for the next academic year but I don't know what startups expect from a junior swe.

I have been using Python for around 5 years now (around 2 years from working for the government and doing internships) and have used frameworks/libraries like Flask, FastAPI, NumPy, Pandas and PostgreSQL. I have also used git quite extensively and currently learning NestJS and TS. Some experience using Heroku and very minimal experience using AWS.

Is this enough to work as a junior swe full time for startups paying that much?"

I was going into a STEM major I didn't enjoy, thinking that it was the responsible thing to do. I had made a group of friends that weren't always there for me and I just felt like I had to buckle down these 4 years and just get out. 

But as the months moved on, relationships drifted apart and I started branching out, I was able to learn not only what my passions are, but who I want to become. I have met and made even stronger friendships than I thought was possible. I am now double majoring in something that I am truly head-over-heels in love with. 

And I will be living away this summer for an internship that I never would have thought was possible for me to do 2 years ago. 

So, if anyone is feeling lost after their first, second, third, or even final years of college, just know that it is never too late to branch out and try something new. I didn't learn about myself just overnight, I took a class about investigating what career brings you joy and energy. I've taken NUMEROUS ""what major is right for you,"" online quizzes. I have guessed and second-guessed, but that's what I think college is all about. 

Just trying to ""Figure it Out."" 

I think I am going to continue to question who I am and what I am, ""going to do with my life,"" I am going to have to continue to face questioning friends and relatives, as I have changed and grown into someone that has both always been inside of me, but just now debuting into the world. 

I wish you all luck out there in college and in the world, for we are all just trying to ""Figure it Out."""

I'd also like to keep my current job if possible as a safety net and steady income, but that agreement they made me sign as a college student haunts me. I've already asked my HR department for copies of everything I signed when I started and plan to review them closely. 

My question to LA is this: in your experience, how enforceable are such broad IP agreements, and is there any chance I can revoke my signature without suing my company? I'd prefer not to overly antagonize them. Just the right amount of antagonizing."

however an application i had made before giving up ended up being successful and i got invited to the online assessment center, which i also did well in.

They then called me and offered me the role and everything,then asked about my right to work in the country. I had already told them twice about me needing a work visa, once over email (which they had received and acknowledged earlier), and once during the assessment. I made sure they knew. 

After me telling them for the third or fourth time about the visa they realised that they didn’t want to sponsor me for it. they then sent a rejection email that explained how I wasn’t qualified and how there was “tough competition”, after literally telling me i got the job. An intern got the job instead.

i’m just a bit bitter and tired"

&#x200B;

The colleges I'm applying to are way beyond my league, I wanted to know what I can do to stand out to be accepted at one of these colleges, my list is:

MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Caltech, University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, UC San Diego, UC Los Angeles, Cornell University

My major is Data Science/Computer Science and I'm hoping to become a cybersecurity analyst or engineer

In terms of g.p.a well, I'm an international student but also I'm not? My syllabus is A-Levels but I have a US passport as I was born there, My predicted grades are A\*A\*A\*A\*A\* for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Further Maths (which my school doesn't offer as a subject but I'm learning it on my own and writing as a private candidate), in AS I took English(mandatory in the first year), math, physics, chem, and cs. All of which I get my grades for on the 24th, for which ill make another update. I'm taking 5 A levels because the normal amount is 3-4 so i wanted to seem better relatively plus taking a harder subject that the school doesnt offer also looks good

Taking the SAT on the 6th but on my psat i'm consistently getting 1520 with 800 in math and 720 in English consistently, this is my first sat so hopefully by the second one I can super score above 1550

In terms of extracurriculars, this is where im most worried, I placed as a finalist with a team of 6 in a national robotics competition (3rd place), and uh, that's it really for now, Im decent at chess and badminton, chess there are state-level tournaments every month that I'm hoping to participate in, badminton, the school said they would arrange something for me. I'm planning to start a Community service club in our school, I wouldn't be the first to start a club but the other one failed miserably (which is sad because it was an astrophysics club and that sounds sick) that checks off both community service and leadership for me, all my classmates (class of 16 people) are willing to join it, and I can easily get people from other classes. I'm working as an intern for my dad's startup (the startup itself is confidential but I'm working as a programmer there) which my career counselor says counts as shadowing a professional.

I think the biggest aspect of my application is the research project I'm going to be working on, I signed up with Polygence and got accepted into the program (although they have yet to find a mentor) the paper is about present and future cybersecurity measures against malicious AI use (deepfaking, voice modules, illegal image generation)

And ill be receiving recommendations from most of my teachers, the career counselor and even the head of school

So what's the issue here, Im not really the best of the best but maybe i can get into a safer college on the list right? NAH, I'm Indian (even though i was born and raised in California) so I'm technically part of the asian crowd moreover im applying for financial aid, this makes my application worth nothing compared to my competition, So what can I still do? I graduate next year June, thanks in advance"

I'm in search of career advice and your own perspectives on a dilemma I've been having lately. I've already posted this question in another reddit community, so I apologize if you see this for the second time.

Currently, I'm halfway through my internship for qualifications as a chemistry teacher in Bosnia and Herzegovina (6 months left, but with a really, really low pay). But, lately, I have a lot of doubts about the future of my career as a teacher. Besides Bosnia and Herzegovina being a highly corrupt and financially not-so-ideal country (where it would be hard to even find a job right after finishing my internship), I feel that I would hardly even find a teaching job abroad (I have long-term plans to move to a Western Europe), especially with me not being a native speaker in those countries and having no money in the first place for extra language and teaching certifications that meet the requirements of teaching in other counties. Also, before moving abroad, I have plans to move in with my partner in my native country.

Even though I really do like my job as a teacher, and I enjoy spending time with my students, I feel as if a better move would be to find a good job (I literally got an offer today) and make enough money so my partner and I could financially afford to move in together, and then move abroad and get a job in one of the countries in Western Europe. I had some significant experience working as a graphic designer, though I would be willing to work anything just so I could move to a better place.

If you were in my place, would you try other career options so you could make money for a place of my own + for moving abroad? Is my diploma as a chemistry educator still useful abroad even though I haven't finished an internship for qualifications? Could I finish my qualifications in the new countries? Is it generally good advice to first make money and then afford to professionally move towards doing what you love? Time is passing and my anxiety is building up over time, I feel like I should have figured things out by now, but I'm not sure if I'm making a mistake out of pressure.

Thanks in advance!"

I’m just having an difficulty deciding what I want to do with my life and hope I can find some clarity in this group

To explain a bit about my background, I moved to Canada to study on a college and get a “formal degree” because in my home country I studied by myself and learned stuff for Front End Development.

Before coming here I was able to get a good job in my country as a Front end developer and I worked in the code base of good brands such as Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, etc. but the sad thing is that I worked there just 1 year because I got accepted to this canadian college so I decided to quit and move here. Therefore I’m far for been a senior dev.

Since a know a bit and I believe I’m a “decent-average FE Dev” I thought on applying here for a job but seriously I have applied to tons of jobs and I don’t hear anything back from them or the jobs requieres like 3000 years of experience and for what I understand the industry is going through a weird phase where a lot of layoffs and stuff is happening.

Today, the college is opening a position for an IT Support intern and I’ll definitely apply.

Let say that the interviews go well and I get the position, using this opportunity, would you go all in and start studying seriously to become a cybersecurity engineer? Giving the fact that most cybersecurity engineers starts on this position and also it appears that dev jobs are oversaturated (at least the junior positions) or would you still try to get a dev job?

If you ask me “choose what you prefer the most” Then I can’t decide based on that because I haven’t work in Cybersecurity so I don’t how it’s like to work in there. I have slightly preference towards development but I don’t mind going after cybersecurity either

I am currently a 3rd year university student (Business) working at my first internship. One of the tasks my boss gave me was to create an excel formula that can replace a macro. Both VBA and Office Scripts are blocked by the IT department and won't be approved for use anytime soon. So, I am limited to basic excel functions. I am unable to share the spreadsheet on reddit.

Basically, I have a data set of 3000 rows that contains around 150 tables. Each table represents a fitting made of a certain material, to a certain schedule, and the size. and will have unit costs associated with the specifications.   


Then there is another table, where you can change the type of fitting, material, schedule, and size to whatever is needed and then a formula will sort through all the tables mentioned above to find the specific unit cost for those specifications. I cannot build a formula through excel that can sift through all the data and have no idea where to go from here. I hope I gave enough info; it would be much easier if I could share the spreadsheet but unfortunately, I cannot. If anyone has any ideas where to go from here that would be much appreciated.

   2. Hybrid, 2 days in office and 3 days remote permantently. I would not have to move for this location.
   3. Relatively modern tech stack, React and C#.
2. Senior Programmer Analyst at one of the Big 5.

   2. Hybrid, 1 day a month in office but I live 4 hours away from this office. Hypothetically, I could stay where I am and just drive to the office every month but I was told that this hybrid model could change to be more in office - so I may eventually have to move to the GTA.

   4. I actually applied for the Programmer Analyst but they bumped me up to a senior role for higher pay?

I don't know what to do here. So many different things that I can do. I'm thinking:

1. Bring the Big 5 offer to the local company to raise my TC. I will do this for sure. But at what TC is it worth accepting their counter offer?
2. Reneg on the local company and take the Big 5 offer.
3. If the Big 5 company goes hybrid every week, then factoring rent and expenses will bring it line with my 1st offer.
4. Just to be clear, ignoring TC, I'd rather work for the local company as I think their work is more interesting and uses more modern tech.

I have an interview with another internship that’s literally in my college town and is in manufacturing engineering tomorrow, so I told the first job that I would be weighing my options until next week, unless I shit the bed in tomorrow’s interview in which case I will be signing the document as soon as I’m done.

I just don’t wanna wait too long and have my offer rescinded and possibly lose out on both and get stuck doing retail again. I’m also coming to terms with either being a great opportunity but also that I won’t get to be a kid this summer and be around my parents and grandparents as much, like every summer before it. My 20th birthday is in August and I will be a junior next year for reference.

I recently put in my notice at at an unrelated job by the same boss and I am considered getting a new job. I had the full intention of staying till I was fully licensed. However, I'm worried about the work culture, my voice continuing not to be heard, and feeling that I am not getting the support I need. I found an almost perfect job with reduced work, in house free supervision, and a potentially better work culture. I would have to move and refer my clients to other clinicians. I feel bad because I started rebuilding my caseload the past two months. I dont want them to feel hurt or abandoned which is why i will do this as ethicallly as possible if things switch, but things changed suddenly. I ended my relationship, i am not growing in my other job, and i fear lack of support with my current job. It feels like God is asking me to move and trust him in the season if change, but I'm so anxious and so worried. I applied for a new job, and the recruiter got back to me and they are offering me an interview and i accepted. Thoughts or advice are welcome. ."
1381v5b,0,2023-05-04,Irresponsible and awful roommate trying to manipulate us. What are my rights as an equal (on the lease) occupant?,LeaderCapital3390,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1381v5b/irresponsible_and_awful_roommate_trying_to/,"I’ll make this as short as I can. 

I’m 25F and my boyfriend is 25M. We are currently renting a house with my boyfriend’s friend from high school. Initially, things were fine. Empty promises of keeping the house clean and being respectful were made.

Fast forward to a few weeks into our year-long lease. He is a completely different person than I expected and what my boyfriend described. Here is a list of grievances I’ve compiled:

1. Smokes weed in the garage and sometimes in his room even though it’s against our lease and we’ve asked him not to several times.
2. Leaving the dirty oven on overnight (luckily  empty but full of cooking grease from his previous uses) at least twice a week sometimes more. He also told me he’s an engineer and there’s no danger when I confronted him about it. Openly hostile when confronted with everything. 
3. This is a big one. He got blackout (not unusual for him) at our Christmas party and did something (I can’t say exactly what as I’ll get my post removed) to my boyfriend’s trans sister. He doesn’t remember and adamantly denied it, but I saw it happen and ran to get my boyfriend who was sleeping at the time. We both confirmed and then our roommate started crying and playing the victim. My future sister-in-law is now afraid to step foot into our home. 
4. He’s loud and doesn’t clean because he plays World of Warcraft on his mega computer for roughly 6 hours per day after work and 10 plus hours on weekends. This is part of the reason he forgets to turn the oven off. 
5. He’s currently babysitting two cats that aren’t on the lease for his future roommate and he keeps the disgusting litter in our dining room which is open-concept with the kitchen. We allowed him to keep them for a max of two weeks as his friend was in a tight spot. The agreement was that he would clean up after the cats and make sure our space was clean of them as well. We’ve asked him to move the litter box and he refuses. He then said “a mess and litter box smell is expected when allowing cats into our home which is what we signed up for” even though we did him a favor. I no longer use our kitchen. 
6. My boyfriend and I have been paying two rents for the past couple of months because we’re moving into an apartment and the place is perfect. We found our place a few months ago and budgeted to afford it. We have two months left on our original lease agreement and we’re ready to be done. My roommate now wants us to extend our lease a month past our original agreement even though we’ll all still be on the lease (and legally responsible for damages while we’re not in the house).  Our roommates just bought a house and says he’ll be homeless without a month extension but he can afford to buy a new house and pay a month’s rent by himself, so I want to tell him to fuck off and get a hotel/storage unit for all of his shit. 
7. The final straw— My roommate wants to move his brother in before our lease is up (who won’t pay rent or utilities) because his brother has an Internship with the same company my roommate works for. My boyfriend and I stated that we don’t feel comfortable with this because he wants to move his brother into our room since we’ll be at our new apartment. Again, the brother won’t be paying for anything.  I understand we won’t be there, but we’re still paying rent for our house and utilities (which his brother won’t contribute to and our roommate won’t cover). My roommate said he’s within his legal right to have his brother there, but it states in our lease “guests of tenants won’t be admitted in the residence after two weeks of overnight stay within a given calendar month and are subject to a fine of $500 per quest and $35 for everyday they remain in the residence. I don’t know how to inform the landlord because I’m afraid of getting my boyfriend and I fined because the landlord with penalize all of us since we’re also on the lease. 


I’m wondering what my legal rights are as a tenant. Can I contact our landlord and have him fined for his brother staying with us and having cats against the lease?"

1382leq,0,2023-05-04,Will the top schools consider me with my work experience?,skylinepk,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1382leq/will_the_top_schools_consider_me_with_my_work/,"GPA: 3.95

Gmat:  730

I am applying this fall for the following fall with 20 months of work experience at the time of applying. By the time of matriculating, I will have 32 Months of full time work experience. I also have a 5 month internship where I worked full time and was compensated as a full time employee in the summer when I graduated. I then joined this company and continued in the same position with the same team. I have heard the top schools don't consider any internships for work experience. My situation was a bit different as I was expected to graduate in August as I just had 2 minor classes to take over the summer. I had a job at this company lined up for when I graduated, but due to covid, I had the opportunity to work full time and take my last classes at night over the summer. Therefore, they hired me as an ""intern"" while they waited for me to graduate over the last semester, but I worked as a full time employee for these 5 months and was compensated as such, and then they changed my title when I graduated. Will these 5 months be included?

I have some other factors that will be included, but I understand the top schools have an average number of like 5 years work experience. I feel as though I am ready, and I have progressed faster than most. Therefore, I feel like staying in my current position for another 2 years would be better served getting my mba.

Will the top schools consider me with 32 months of full time work experience?"

I do plan on going to graduate school, Master’s or PhD, likely a PhD.

I just want some advice as to how I should organize my time in college, when it comes to work experience. What internships should I look out for? Should I try to go for quant related positions because of my math background? I’m not sure what I should do. Also, should I pick up a computer science double major, economics double major, and/or a mathematical finance minor?

1386yxf,1,2023-05-04,Advice for Helping a Student in Abusive Situation,tylersmiler,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1386yxf/advice_for_helping_a_student_in_abusive_situation/,"Before I start I want to say that yes, I've already reported this to my local authorities and they told me today they've assigned an investigator. But I want to make sure to support this kid as much as I can. 

I've had this student in my class for 4 years. They graduate high school at the end of May. I also taught all their older siblings. They and their siblings were raised by their grandparents. I've never heard them mention their mom, and everything they've said about their dad is negative. They were super close with grandpa, but he died over a year ago. They have some non-immediate family in the area that they sometimes spend time with. 

This 17 year old has an intellectual disability. And I mean that, not ""learning disability"". They used to be in special education classes almost 100% of the time in middle and elementary school, and got mainstreamed in high school because they are on the cusp between needing that intensive level of services or not, and grandpa wanted the kid in the general education setting more. So, they put the kid in my homeroom and everything has worked out fine, partly because the student is really well behaved and tries their best.

But things aren't going well with grandma since grandpa died. If I believe everything the student says, then grandma frequently screams at them for normal teenage mistakes and behavior. When we started working on FAFSA and college applications this year, she tried to withhold their SSN and I had to figure out how to help get it from the local Social Security Office before she gave in. She wouldn't let them get a job because she gets disability benefits from being their guardian. The school set up a paid position through a community internship partner and they are doing so well they were offered a full time job with great benefits starting right out of high school. She only accepted it because the school set it up. She will tell them ""You're just like your father"" during arguments when she KNOWS the kids hate their deadbeat asshole father. She took their phone away completely for a month when one teacher reported they occasionally used it in class, despite them having a B in that class. Which, I know, I like that she responded to what the teacher was saying, but it felt a little bit extreme for a whole month on a ""first offense"", and combined with everything else had me worried she was trying to isolate them. 

Then, this week the student told me during one of their verbal altercations the night before, she hit them. I was livid. I can tell you I keep my cool pretty well at work most of the time, but man I've never filled out a DCF report so fast in my LIFE. 

I think I understand what's happening with grandma. She has a physical disability. In 4 years of IEP meetings, parent-teacher conferences, and even her older grandchildren's graduations, I've never met her in person. Have no idea what she looks like. We have to do it all on the phone. So I'm guessing she's feeling vulnerable about her youngest grandkid being so close to ready to ""leave the nest"", and her husband is gone now, too, so I'm sure she's not in a great place mentally. But I firmly feel like, even before she hit the kid, she was bordering on financial abuse and being manipulative. 

So how do I help this young person prepare for what's happening next after high school? I'm worried she is going to try to trap them at home and not let them go out into the world. The eldest grandchild recently moved out because of how grandma was treating her, but they are in a tiny apartment. And they aren't labeled as intellectually disabled by the state, like this youngest one is. What if she tries to get the court to grant her legal guardianship over her adult grandchild? Is there anything the kid can do to fight that? Their reading levels are super low so I know if anything goes to court that will look bad. Just any advice or experiences you have would be appreciated. Thanks. Sorry this was so long."

If I do my masters here the process will be really short and time efficient, with my advisor even estimating 4.5 years if I don’t take a semester off to do an internship during the school year. However, assuming I get into a very high caliber engineering school for Master’s(MIT, Stanford), should I consider going there? It will be extremely more expensive and take 2 years after my undergraduate likely, because none of the graduate courses I plan on taking during my undergrad will transfer. For what schools would you personally do your masters in a prestigious university compared to my state school. Furthermore, if I get into a school that’s prestigious, but not necessarily known to be really good at engineering(lot of the Ivy Leagues), should I still consider paying them exorbitant fees instead of going to my state school?
The state school in question is Texas A&M University."

I’m a freshman just finishing up Data Structures this spring semester. I’ve applied to 100 places this app szn and I’ve gotten 0 interviews, but I was just able to interview and get the job as a SWE intern at a lab at my uni. 

This job is remote, 10 hours a week, and unpaid. We will be working on machine learning/AI and other things. Is it worth it for me to take a position as an unpaid intern or should I do my own projects and contribute to some open source code this summer?

Thanks"

I've been applying since last semester and have gotten some interviews but they never lead to anything. The summer I was supposed to do an internship got lost since I found out I can finish a semester early if I took some extra classes. I keep hearing that going into grad school is recommended if you don't have a job by the time you graduate but my GPA is really low and many colleges want a 3.0 and up (My GPA is about 2.5). I know there's a bit of a hiring freeze right now too and don't know when that will end. I'm not sure what to do at this point and would like to hear what people who might have experienced something like this recommend. Another option I have is going back to get a B.S. in Computer Science which will take about 2 years if I'm correct. Thank you."

I'm trying to gain experience wherever I can. I recently graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science & CyberSecurity but have been having a hard time getting a job. The main thing I lack is experience. I tried going to YearUp but couldn't really get anywhere due to policies. Tried applying to rotational programs but never really got anywhere. Entry level is so competitive so I have a hard time standing out. 

Honestly It's me. I lack experience and only really have school projects to show. Currently, I'm working on getting my security+ but besides that I've been prepping my resume and have been looking for work.

I apologize as I'm being very scattered in my post but are there any opportunities that you guys may have to share? I'm interested in any entry level, internship, rotational, apprenticeship, anything that can get me in and getting me forward.

Thank you for your help!"

The osu is ranked 24 in the US news, Cs ranking while UCD is ranked 41. Both have a small cohort size for cs ( 100-150) and both have very high opportunities for ra/ta.
I calculated the approximate estimated cost for both of them and it was almost same.
Now, the cost of living in Ohio is substantially low compared to UCD. But, the overall cost for 2 years( tuition + stay) turns out to be same.
Now, the question is should I choose location over rank or is it not worth it.
With location, I mean the opportunity for internship/ job. I've heard that people do jobs outside the state, so I don't think the location does matter for the job, but I'm not sure about the internship. 
I already live in a very cold place, so I'm already used to weather in Ohio, so that doesn't matter to me.
Finally, I've seen that people have been a bit biased towards Uc's, but please give me your unbiased opinion."

Overall experience is great, I've actually learned a lot of new things, but i also have a feeling that because of the legacy systems that i work on, i don't actually learn anything new, and i mean everything's kinds stuck at 2010. What is actually kinda ok is that they recently migrated to a cloud platform which gave a little more freshness and in terms of ci/cd it's also ok.

My concerns are that i sacrifice my time for the job where i dont actually improve - the pay is ok so i won't complain, but you know how it is.

Also i always imagines my future to be around c/c++, i think that by staying i won't have time to develop other skills necessary to become a c/c++ dev what do you think should i do? My plan is to learn as much as possible and quit as soon as my next semester starts. Also what do you think a c/c++ dev should know, some bullet points would be appreciated."

I’ve worked there for two years throughout my standard bachelor’s degree (no honours) in comp sci. I have interest from professors who want me to go into a PHD after doing an honours year, but my company is also offering a full time position after I graduate this year (without honours).

I’ve done a few other small internships, and have a few small relevant personal projects. 

I have done some basic maths units - linear algebra, numerical optimisation, and multi variable calculus, as well as a couple of machine learning units. (with impeccable grades across my degree)

How will my earning potential be impacted if I choose to go straight into industry and skip the PhD? I don’t have a great desire to do full-time research after uni, as I prefer working on practical applications. I am in Australia, where the job market is significantly smaller. I’m being offered $85000 Aud + super annuation (10% the employer pays into a retirement fund).

For a while now, I've been thinking about what I want to do after graduation. I don't have any work experience or side projects other than the ones I did for university (two in Java, one on Data Structures, and one on Design Patterns, one in C - the most complex but also the most enjoyable, and one in Matlab) and I don't intend to continue my studies because I want to get involved and learn directly in the field.

My idea is to leave Italy as soon as possible after graduation because I want a change of scenery and don't want to live here anymore (which is why I'm a commuter even though I had the option to stay close to home), both for job opportunities and salary differences. The big problem is that I have no idea what I might be interested in - frontend, backend, etc. - as a specific job because I have never worked before, and that worries me. That's why I plan to start studying on my own and doing some projects to fill my CV/Github, since unfortunately I haven't learned much about programming from university so far, not through any fault of my own.
So I would like to ask someone who may have been in a similar situation, without work experience, without great skills but with the desire to leave his country (Italy in my case) , how they managed to get out or even better what they would recommend me to start with from a practical point of view. 

I had the Netherlands and Germany in mind as destinations, and I don't hide my desire to maybe get to the USA after reaching a valid working position. 

Should I try to land an internship before starting to apply?
What would you focus on if you don’t have a clear view of what you would want to do later? 
Would you try to build some side projects to fill your CV/Github?If yes, what?

Thanks to anyone who will give me some of their time."
138pc2g,234,2023-05-05,Thinking about quitting my PhD program after 7 years,[deleted],uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/138pc2g/thinking_about_quitting_my_phd_program_after_7/,"I am very new to Reddit but I wanted some thoughts from you all. I want to remain anonymous about my identity and my department because I feel very embarassed about my circumstances.

I had high hopes for finishing my PhD at the University of Michigan next year. I was going to form a committee and finish writing my chapters. I am a little behind but I thought if I could work full time this summer, I could do it. My advisor was supportive of my plan and timeline. I was told by my department that I would get the new Rackham funding of $12000 over the summer even though I was a 7th year. As a result, I did not apply for internships or look for work this summer. Then, this week, the department said that Rackham pulled my funding because I did not qualify under their guidelines and there was nothing they could do for me.

When I went on strike, I was planning on missing my April paycheck. Although I now have half of my missing paycheck covered by GEO (thank you very much!), I have to figure out how to pay the rest of my rent this month, how to pay rent next month, and pay my credit card bills soon because my groceries and other bills are not covered. I also don't know what to do in order to live the rest of the summer, but I am applying for hourly jobs now and getting no research done. I am also selling my dining table and bike because I need the cash and can live without those things.

I also applied for emergency funds from my department and was told I would likely get it. Then I was told Academic HR interrupted my emergency funds and said I needed to apply separately at Rackham because they were worried I was on strike. I don't know what to do because Rackham guidelines say clearly I cannot get help for strike-related hardship, and I do not want to lie to get money.

I feel very embarassed because I gave my friends and family the impression that I would be a ""Dr"" one day, the first PhD in my family. I am 7 years into this mess with nothing to show for. I don't think I want to do this anymore but I don't think I can easily get out either. I am also privileged in different ways (no student debt, not a minority, etc.), but I am simply out of financial options right now. I also feel bad that I am complaining all the time to people.

This might be my last post on any U-M affiliated social media if I choose to drop out this summer.

Am I catastrophizing, or is there something I can do to make it?

&#x200B;

*edit and update: I apologize for this post. On Friday, my dad called me and said how proud he was of me. I couldn't bear to tell him that I was thinking of quitting, so I broke down and wrote this impulsive post. I also wrote an email to my advisor. My advisor actually called me this weekend. My advisor did even not know I was a 7th year but said we would work something out. Thank you all for your messages of support. You are all correct, I'm not screwed, I have many options to think about. I will need to take a break from Reddit now but I think I am going to survive this summer and fight to graduate.*"

I’m currently looking for an internship for this summer. About two-three weeks ago I received an offer from a big telecommunications company to join as a business development analyst and since I hadn’t received any other offers I accepted it. 
Fast forward a few weeks later and I received an offer from a big bank to join their treasury department. I have also been to two interviews with a vc fond which I really like.

First of should I stick to the offer that I have already accepted or consider the bank position? If I should prefer the bank internship then how do i proceed?
Secondly if I get an offer from the vc fond (which is my nr1 choice) I will definitely want to go there. But it will take them another 2weeks to give me an answer so that also plays a role with the above question. 

I guess my main question is: is it okay to back off from an internship that I already received and signed? If yes, then how do I do it so that I don’t burn any bridges for future?

Final note: I live in a rather small country so everyone sort of knows everyone and that’s why I’m scared about “burning bridges”.

   \+ rank #15 - ppl say the brand name works   
   \+ Hackathons and Datathons - networking here

I am currently enrolled in a school that has not been maximizing my VA benefits and am looking to change to WGU or ASU. 

For the BS in Computer Science, both schools require calculus. WGU will be much faster-paced, while ASU will make opportunities like internships easier to get.

For the BS in Cybersecurity, WGU offers 14 certifications in their program, while ASU does not.

From what I have read, a BS in computer science is more well-rounded and the ""business standard."" 

A BS in cybersecurity would limit possible jobs, but the certifications offered within the program make me lean this way.

I am not looking at taking summers off and am currently not working while being a full-time student. I would need to since my housing allowance would be cut in half. This would help me start with experience, as I would try to get a helpdesk job while working towards this degree.

I wanted to know till what extent will UNSW help me get a job in tech. Do they provide you with on-campus placements (even for international students)? If yes, what companies have visited in past? Do they also invite big tech companies (FAANG, etc.)? Do you have to meet certain academic requirements (like have a GPA of 9/10, etc.) to take part in them?

If not, then, will they help me get an internship at least? I have seen some posts where it is mentioned that internships are not possible for international students (basically you can't work full-time due to student visa restrictions)? If I want to get at least one internship during my degree, will UNSW help me in that?

Apart from that, as a member of Go8 and being ranked very high for CS (some even call it the best in Aus.), what are some privileges that UNSW CS students enjoy (like job opportunities, connections to companies, etc.) that other CS students in Australia do not enjoy?

I am an international student who got admitted into BS(CS). I have heard that it is very hard to get a CS job in Australia for international students even if you have a Go8 degree.

What should I do?,coffeequeen1135,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1392ssp/feeling_losthopeless_in_undergrad_what_should_i_do/,"Hey, basically as the title says, I'm feeling really hopeless in my second year of undergrad. I'm a  mech e major but I came in as a biomed e and switched this past semester.  Since coming here I have not gone a single semester passing all my classes and my current gpa is a 2.4 which is really demoralizing coming from a 4.3 in high school with no issues. This is for a number of reasons that I cannot control such as ongoing mental health issues I can't seem to find a way to cope with and family struggles as well as taking on a lot with work and extracurriculars and living situation issues. I know I should probably cut back on other commitments but the only reason I have an internship this summer is because of my participation in these activities and I was not asked about my gpa at all. I'm currently set to graduate in 5 years because of the major change and failing classes. Pretty sure I'm going to fail one this semester as well. I don't think the issue is that I'm not interested in the major, I think things just keep happening and I don't know what to do. I'm going to be working on getting my mental health issues in line this summer and I know that if I can do that I'll be okay and probably have more of an idea on what I want to do with my life but I've been getting hit with a lot of negativity when talking about my journey so far with classmates and other adults. I just don't know what to do. Do I still have time to turn this around or am i eternally fucked?"

They said its fine If I stay in school for an extra semester while waiting for my security clearance.They also said its fine if I find other employment for the time and they will give me some time to for me to put in my resignation (What do you guys think of this).

This past couple of months I have been applying for internships but haven't had any luck. cant even get an interview. I have had better luck getting job interviews. I have probably interviewed 8 different times for full time SWE jobs. Waiting to hear back from 2, but I don't think I will be getting them.

An extra semester would give me more time to grind leetcode, and improve my resume, in hopes of landing a better role or should I just graduate and try to find a better role in the mean time.

I am thinking of worst case scenario and it takes me 1 year to start. Looking for advice on what to do next.

I spoke to lots of employers for internships at some career fairs at my school and none of them were interested in people who were not CS majors. I cannot change my major because I transferred to my school and they do not allow transfer students into their CS or any other engineering majors, so that is not an option. 

I feel kind of lost because I’m not confident I can get a job after I graduate so I’m looking into MS programs. I do understand that that’s not the best reason to do a masters but I do believe that it would be better for me to get a more specialized masters degree. I can code and by the time I graduate I will have taken many of the same classes as a CS major, including Data Structures and Algorithms. My GPA is far above the common cutoff and I’ll be taking the GRE over the summer so I’m not super worried about my stats for grad programs.

I came into uni wanting to get into cybersecurity, but recently decided that software engineering is what I'm truly passionate about (also helps that it pays better).

So far I've had two great internships in cybersecurity / linux sys admin with reputable firms. Those internships were rather easy for me to acquire, probably because I had a pretty good portfolio. I spent  summers cracking VMs on VulnHub and passed the RedHat Systems Administrator certification.

&#x200B;

I've been applying for software engineering internships but I'm not even getting interviews. To be fair, I'm not nearly as proficient in coding/SWE compared to my skills in cybersec / linux. I've never built my own programs or contributed to open source projects, and all my coding experience is limited to course assignments. Still, I'm feeling a little down as I see friends getting into FAANG, banks, etc.. I really hope I'll be good enough by the time I graduate to land a good SWE job right after graduation.

I know an MBA is much more valuable with a few years of work experience (postgrad), but I want to share my circumstance (because I feel it is somewhat unique). Additionally, the post might be a bit long because I'm incredibly lost on how to go about this decision, and want to give you a full background of myself so you can better gauge my situation. So please, if you have the time, read through it and give me and a bit of advice or feedback you have on my profile and what I should do. **I appreciate you taking the time and effort on this!**

**Quick intro:**
Hello, I’m an incoming student at one of Uchicago’s grad programs (hint: related to policy). I want to apply to Booth but am skeptical and worried as I am going into my respective grad program fresh out of undergrad. 

**Facts about education**
Graduating from a well-known (not Stanford) West Coast university with majors in econ and polisci. I have decent grades >3.75 GPA and was accepted to UChicago with a generous scholarship. I'm deeply passionate about Urban policy, economics, and public policy, and I want to gain a deeper understanding of data analytics, finance, and management.

**Facts about my work background:**
I’ve worked from the time I was in my mid-teens in real estate development and finance. Before college, I worked my way up from an intern to a real estate analyst for a shopping center investment and management company with over $2 billion in assets, and, in my capacity, ran feasibility analysis on over $100 million (helping make the decision for over $50 mill in acquisitions) along with being responsible for integrating prop-tech into marketing events and leasing decisions for some properties across our portfolio. 
After that experience, I worked for a smaller multi-family developer (only two people, which means I wore many hats) and developed over 300 units of apartments throughout my respective city. 
Since I started college, I have had much less business experience. I worked through all of college, but they were primarily internships in national and state government. However, for the past year, I have been a fellow at a major non-profit, combining my gained experience in politics and real estate to help manage an initiative (centered on innovative ways to finance affordable housing) that will finance over $200+ mill in affordable housing development throughout my state and help implement a new gov't agency in my city. At my office, I am a real estate expert, and so I have gained a lot of experience being an ad-hoc leader (making decisions related to how we can sustainably raise capital, crafting our initiative's strategic goals, and figuring out ways to fund our operation). Even with all these responsibilities, I don't know how much public recognition I will get for my work as my title is just a fellow. 

**Other ECs:**
Volunteered for a charity creating survival bags for the homeless throughout college, created and was the leader of a body (120+ people) of political professionals and students who worked with members of Congress to introduce bipartisan bills. Involved in my school's political union, political careers organization, and political democrats group.   

**Why I want an MBA with my Grad-degree and why now**
I applied to my initial grad program at UChicago to help create a policy that will alleviate the affordability crisis in California and across the nation. Furthermore, I chose Chicago because I am passionate about quantitative methods and want to be at the cutting edge of integrating data into decisions (even though I think I'm relatively weak in quants).
 I want to add an MBA because I don't just want to attack the affordability crisis from a public angle. Since working at this non-profit, I have begun to dream of creating a tech-forward affordable housing development firm while simultaneously working with governments to streamline their development process. Yet, I do not have any structured education in business outside of my work experience. Because of this, I often feel like a fraud, missing a huge chunk of knowledge. If I went to Booth, I feel I would obtain not just the principles in necessary skills like finance, strategic management, and entrepreneurship but also develop more advanced skills in business analytics, econometrics, and accounting. Additionally, I feel I would gain a degree that would allow me to land a role in a top real estate development firm fresh out of grad) that is mission-aligned (which narrows it down a lot) and, after some years, hopefully, start my own practice. 
I want to do Booth now for two reasons. First, I feel getting a position at a top real estate firm right now would be difficult coming out of my current grad program (which is ok), but with an MBA, I would improve my odds and be better prepared for the work I'll be expected to do. Secondly, adding an MBA now would allow me to finish both degrees in three years instead of four and finish both my desired grad degrees in one fell swoop!

**Additional info** 
I don't need to take any exams to apply to Booth

**Questions**
What do you think of my profile and motivators? Do you have any advice? Do you have any questions for me?"
13948d0,0,2023-05-05,is it normal to not have a single friend?,frdd72,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13948d0/is_it_normal_to_not_have_a_single_friend/,"Hey reddit,

this is my first time posting here. Thanks for reading. Here we go.

Lately I have beenn wondering Is there's something wrong with me. The thing is that I'm 21 and I have zero (0) real friends. I really don't know the answer. I think it has its root when I emigrated at the age of 5, obviously I didn't speak the language so during the school year (from december to june) I couldn't speak a word. At that age I didn't have social skills. I used to live with my aunt so my only contact were family members and not random kids. During my years in primary school I had some friends but they were kinda weird sometimes and some of them changed schools so we lost contact. The one ""friend"" I had was a really fake girl who always used me and abandoned me whenever she felt like, but being the inocent kid I was, I didn't want to be alone so I put up with it. Eventually, she left me. She was the kind of girl who wanted to be the center of attention and her friends used to come and go. 

In highschool everyone went different paths and I ended up, again, with said girl. Once again, WHAT A SUPRISE, she sent me a text saying that she didn't want me to come along with her and her group of friends... I spent the rest of the schoolyear alone.

Maybe your are thinking that I must be the problem but I don't think so. I was, and still am ,a good girl, smart, talks whenever has something to say and keeps quiet when I have nothing to add, I'm kind and always try to help people (eventough I'm not always helped in return) I never get in trouble and my family would say that I'm funny. I don't enjoy partying and drinking, I love reading, sports, cooking, going out etc

In 9th grade I made a friend and I sticked with her until 12th grade. Eventually, she introduced me to her friends (with whom I shared some classes as well) and we all were close until they started hanging out without my friend and me. My friend and I graduated but three of those friends had to retake the year and we lost contact. Honestly, we would hang all out in school but outside of it only at birthdays.

College is here!! A fresh start and all that. During orientation, I got along with a group of girls and during some weeks  I sat next to them and tried to participate in conversation, we made projects together etc but for the 204th time in my life, I got excluded (and I swear to god I didn't do nothing wrong) they had a group chat, went out etc I decided to get away from them willingly. During first year covid hit and the classes were online.

Back to normality, I was kind alone at uni. Then, I found some girls with whom I did almost every group project, and besides, I had that smart, organised, good grades air about me. I currently am still friends with those 2 girls and I get along with a few other classmates but it is the kind of relationship that you only have in class, outside uni everyone has previous friends and we don't hang out.

Back to that one friend of highschool (lets call her Laura), we were friends during the first three years of college. She is studying a different type of degree (not college) so we don't see each other that much. Whenever we could match our schedules we would see each other, during summer as well... but she usually had a job and a boyfriend so it was a little harder for her to find a free moment (however she would see her bf almost every week) 

Back in october I had a moment of clarity when I noticed that Laura only contacted me when she needed a moder for her pictures. In 2022 we saw each other in February (when she needed someone to pose)  and when summer vacation started I suggested to meet but she couldn't find a moment. In October (8 months after the one time we saw each other that year) she contacted me to ask If I was free for a photoshoot (barely asking me how was I, how was my final year of college etc) I wasn't available but I asked her If she was free the following Friday to hang out. Laura said yes. And the day before I asked If we were still up for our plan the next day. To what she replied that she thought I was talking about the next friday (who the hell makes plans two weeks in advance) I played it off and I said that maybe,just maybe, I hadn't expressed myself right but what I meant was THAT friday. She didn't reply and went to the cinema with her boyfriend. The friday when, according to her, we made the plan she didn't say anything so that was the straw that broke the camell's back for me and I decided to not text her again. I had the impression that when she would break up with her boyfriend she would come back to me. 

Said and done. A month later she broke up with her boyfriend and texted me at 2 a.m. saying that she broke up with her boyfriend, that she missed be and that she had behaved terribly with me. I told her that I was sorry for her break up but it didn't surprise me that she was texting me right after breaking up with him. She denied that fact and said that she wanted to mend our relationship but she would insist up to a point. 

I really thought about forgiving her but I had already had people in my life who only used me when it was convinient and left me ad they pleased. I valued myself and my time more than that and I knew for a fact the the story would repeat once she got a boyfriend again. I told her that and that was it. We haven't spoken (just to wish her a happy birthday and new year) she asked If we could meet in person but it was exam season so it was impossible for me.

Basically I cut off my only friendship and now I'm alone. 

Right now I am doing an internship and I don't go to college anymore (I'm working on my thesis) so I don't have people to hang out with. Yes, I have college mates, work colleages (who are much older than me) but I don't have real friends. I don't have anyone to make plans with, friday nights all look the same at home, usually during the weekends we make familly plans. My weeks look like work-home-tutoring-french class-gym nothing else. Im afraid I'm going to be alone forever. I don't know I can't connect with people. Sometimes it makes me so sad I want to cry (like I'm doing right now), for my present self and 10 year old me who would sob in bed thinking that she would never have friends. I let her down. I enjoy spending time by myself but sometimes loneliness hits hard. I barely can talk about this with my parents cause it pains me so much. They see me as a great kid and say that everything has its moment. Talking about it with my sister is not an option either for the same reason, she is also great and she doesn't even try to make friends, she just has them. She has great friends from childhood, highschool and now college. I don't have anyone. She is just as great as me but I don't know WHY I can't do that. I fear the moment my work colleages ask me about friends, I am embarrassed to say I don't have any. They have already asked me about my romantic status but it is not that weird to not have a significant other as it is to not have a single friend. The will think that there must be something wrong. I sometimes wonder the same thing.

Has anyone gone though the same issue? Do you have any thoughts? Any advice? Thanks so much for having read it. Take care. :)"
1395mne,3,2023-05-05,Should I get a Masters in Computer Science to make up for a low-quality online degree?,FluxImpact,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1395mne/should_i_get_a_masters_in_computer_science_to/,"I am currently 22 years old and getting a Bachelors degree in computer science through Wilmington University (online). I am set to graduate next summer or fall. I am afraid I am not learning enough as my peers are at traditional in-person schools. It is not awful, but I cannot imagine me knowing nearly as much as my peers that are going to school in-person would. This, combined with the influx of comp sci majors and tech layoffs make me concerned about landing a job when I graduate. 

The University of Reno (which I live near) offers an in-person Computer Science and Engineering Masters degree. It would not be of any cost to me (not going to bother explaining why) and it would take 2 years. 

I currently work in a warehouse, so I am not getting any valuable work experience. I do make $47/hour though, and I would be able to continue working there while I get my degree in-person because I only work Sat,Sun,Mon. 

My logic is that getting a masters at UNR would greatly improve my knowledge that I might have missed out on by going to an in-person, higher quality school. It would also (hopefully) help with getting a decent first job in tech. Meeting people in the field and networking would be a plus too. 

I could do this while making $47 an hour at my warehouse job, which is hard to walk away from because its good money and only 3 days a week, so I feel like I should be taking advantage of the opportunity while I can and get my masters. 

My questions are do you think I would be better off just sticking with the bachelors degree and doing a few internships to help me land a job? Or should I go and get my masters? This is assuming I get accepted (I am unsure how competitive UNR is). Would having a masters degree make it easy to land a job, even with tech jobs becoming way more competitive?

As I am writing this, I think I might have answered my own question.  I am not seeing many downsides to getting my masters, other than me having 2 less years of work experience from me starting my career 2 years later. I would still greatly appreciate anyones thoughts though, as I am new and somewhat naive in the industry."

Let’s back up first. I started teaching in 2021 after graduating college with an English degree in 2019 and I went through ACP to get my certificate. According to my program, you can be certified via student teaching or a paid internship. I chose the internship.I started this internship in the fall of 2021 at ISD 1. After 3 months, my principal pressured me to resign because my classroom management was not under control. So I resigned and  chose to do student teaching in the spring of ‘22. I did student teaching, got certified, and started working at school number one in ISD 2. After three months, the principal threatened to fire me because my students were whipping out their genitalia and peeing on one another while in hallway, and I was informed that this was my fault because my classroom management was out of control (again after three months) so then HR told me that I could transfer to a different campus midyear, and that’s where I’ve been since. However, just today, my principal informed me that I do not have a contract for next year and I will unlikely get hired by this district because the former principal of my old campus is likely not giving me good recommendations and that is why I have not been offered a job yet. So no, I am conflicted on what to do. I am thinking that maybe this district is just not for me and I will go back to ISD 1 and try to get a job there. Or should I just give up teaching all together. The stress is really so much. I try my hardest truly and give all to my students but I can only do so much.

What do I do?"

It's pretty internship focused so I'm not too sure if it's possible for me to do 90+ hour work weeks especially since I haven't worked in industry so far.

Im planning on doing BWSI (virtual 9-5) for like a month and a research internship (in person 40 min away, 9-5) when not doing BWSI. Both of these are like 40+ hour a week commitments but don't overlap so its alright.

In addition to these two I'd be working on a few things that'll go on for the whole summer:

Paid intern at tech company (30 hrs/week - hybrid will go like once a week)

Stipend paid - independent research project with faculty (5 hrs - mostly on commutes)

Finance internship (\~10 hrs a week virtual)

Online course (10 hrs a week)

College essays (5 hrs a week)

1396jqo,28,2023-05-05,NUS BZA vs SMU law,seasonedgrass,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1396jqo/nus_bza_vs_smu_law/,"So here's a copium post after I got rejected from nus law... I've posted this on nus sub as well

I have always been aiming for law since jc2 so my goal for uni applications has naturally been law, and I have done a few internships at law firms as well. In comparison, idk anything about coding or bza, but it's my 2nd single deg option as I heard it can provide me with decent pay and career progression.

However, at my latest internship, I also became kind of disillusioned bc all the practice trainees and lawyers have pretty terrible work life balance and it very visibly affects their mood and energy. I understand that law sch is tough and a career in practice can be just as tough, and I'm not 100% sure about it anymore. 

Moreover, though nus and smu law are more or less on par these days, there's still a difference in the prestige of an nus and an smu degree. I browsed on linkedin to discover that most younger folks (cos smu law is so new) in really zai positions (eg junior partner, justices law clerk, magic circle firms associate) graduated from nus law. So honestly I'm not very certain about how far I can go with SMU law...

So after getting rejected by nus law, I was given bza (2nd single deg option) instead of cs+ bizad (4th ddp option with first 3 options law related). I put these as the next choices after law as I've basically eliminated every other course except for bba and soc courses for various reasons. I believe bza should give me a decent starting salary, but I'm not sure about how fast and what senior positions career progression entails. I also dk if it's a good idea to suddenly give up on law and switch targets, esp since idk much about bza.

So now my options/reasons are:

1. Smu law -- my only local option at studying law, which I think I can do reasonably well 

2. Nus bza -- better work life balance with similar starting salary as law

3. Appeal for nus law -- low chance but not zero

My exams got over today, and given I have the social life of, well, an ECE major, I thought I could help some people out at Grainger.

Anyway my idea was this: I've taken many ECE / CS / first year engineering courses and done reasonably well in them, and I want to give back to the grainger eningeering community. I feel like i could be like 40-75% as useful as a dedicated CA for the classes I've taken (depending on the class), but I could make myself available much later than CAs (we're talking all-nighter times). So I was thinking I could pull one last grainger all-nighter (or more) and function as an unofficial CARE tutor to tackle those late night questions. I've stolen a few students sitting in for CARE this sem and I really enjoyed myself and felt like I was able to be helpful.

I've also had two internships, some paper submissions and have applied to grad schools, so can give my thoughts on research/career advice from my experiences.

Would y'all find that useful? Just upvote this post if you think so - let's say 70 upvotes and I'll actually do it. Can figure out more deets (what classes I can help with, how this will work etc.) if that's the case. Or is there a better way to help during finals week?"

I often see posts here with people having 2-3 internships or impressive projects still struggling to get employment, which really makes me concerned for my ability to get a job after college. 

Through my degree so far I’ve only learned C++ and Python, so honestly I don’t find it surprising that nobody hired me for the summer. Most of my classes have been engineering focused this far, and only now do I finally have the opportunity to take programming courses. I now realize that a CS degree probably would have been better suited for me, but it’s too late to change majors and I can’t afford more school. 

I’m considering doing the Odin Project over the summer in an attempt to broaden my skill set and gain some kind of background in full stack, but I don’t know if this is the right more. People say to work on projects but I feel my knowledge of C++ and Python is so basic that I wouldn’t be able to do much beyond the scope of what we did for class projects, hence why I hope doing the Odin project will at least give me something to put on my resume aside from a 3.8 GPA.

Realistically, do I still have a shot at getting a software development job after graduating? Or would it be so challenging at this point I should just drop the idea altogether? Is there anything I can do to change that? Without an internship, I know that I just appear as a useless new grad with no experience not worth hiring, and with the recent trends in the job market I feel that just means I won’t find a job, and that I put myself $200k in the hole for nothing."

Columbia's DS is too theoretically rigorous, and needlessly mathy and statsy. Not much ML, DL in core. 3 electives only. 

NU has impressive curriculum, covering breadth of modern Deep learning etc. 
No exams, only projects & coding assignments. Grade inflation - less pressure. 
Only sufficient maths. Lots of recent paper reading. 6 electives, quarter system (hectic). 


But Columbia has great long-term brand value. The DS program is more widely recognized - I'll probably have an easier time landing a high paying job. But there are 200+ perseverant kids in cohort, so may be competitive to graduate or land internships. 


NU has a more selective, experienced cohort (30 now, 14-20 earlier), so should be more prestigious and exclusive (barely any uni offers ""AI"" degrees). But doesn't seem like a popular feeder degree to industry, the program is also newer. 


Not much can be said fairly about Alumni outcome as very few data points exist for NU. From what is available, jobs out of NU AI don't seem as great as Columbia DS (not all, but a small chunk land great roles).

I've visited UCSB in person and did really like the campus, and have a few friends going there, but from what I've heard UCI is better for industry connections and internships compared to UCSB which is more research oriented.

So I’ll start off by saying that this problem isn’t really a big problem. Rather, it’s more of a me bitching about pointless stuff kinda situation, but I don’t have anyone to discuss it with. It was making me feel down and frustrated so I thought I’d try venting this crap on reddit, ‘cuz why not.. 

I am fairly new to working in a corporate job environment and haven’t really worked much in my life before this point. Just a few internships here and there. This is the first job I have been continuously working for a little around 2 years now and it has had its ups and downs, however for the most part it is pretty chill. I have flexible hours and as long as I get my work in on time, my manager doesn’t care about me leaving early or wfh. Because of a project I had to start coming to the office (whereas before I was just wfh) and be at my dest for around 8hrs straight, which usually never happened when I wfh. But sure, Its my first project, I’m excited, working hard, and getting shit done. Everything is going well till today, my boss’s boss walks past my desk, and goes off on me for being on my phone every time he passes by. I mean I can’t remember if thats very accurate but I do know that I check my phone every 15 mins or 20 mins and spend like 2-3 mins on it. To be fair thats quite a lot but I got used to doing it at home and it sorta carried over when I started work in the office I suppose. However this does not affect the work I do, and people that work with me take a 5 min break every hour and go for a short walk or a smoke…so why is it wrong if I just use my phone in the little breaks I take? Anyways, a bunch of people were listening and I feel very humiliated. If my reputation took a downfall at a previous work place i didn’t care as much since it was only an internship and I’d be in a different company in a couple months. But with this job I really can’t afford a tarnished reputation. I know I use my phone a-lot and it is a problem, and I am going to try and fix it, but I feel the damage is kinda done and idk now all I can think of is quitting and getting another job to start fresh ( i know this is me being very dramatic). Honestly tho, I don’t even report to this guy directly and he only recently got promoted to being my boss’s boss. And now all of a sudden I need to walk on ice in-front of him and it is just so frustrating.. Don’t really know where to go from here or how to solve this. I know this is a very minor problem compared to what people face in their workplace but I am really lost and would love any help from people who have more experience than me in holding down a job.

Is it dumb to do a masters in AI if I have a computer science bachelors ?

Finishing up my bachelors degree in computer science this year. I’m 21 years old. Thinking of going straight into a masters in AI/ Machine Learning. It’s only for an extra year. I have some experience with machine learning as I did a machine learning final year project (credit card fraud detector)

I also already have 2 paid Software engineering internships under my belt with big companies that I’ve done already while in undergrad 

Someone told me not to do it because it’s chasing trends. Is it worthless?"

Up to this point I learned topics like SQL Server, Git, Azure and .NET by myself and through internship experiences. The university taught me Java, C#, Assembly Language and Software Engineering. Other than those the most things I have learned was theoretical such as state machines, computer organization, k-maps and circuits. Courses such as Calculus 2 and Biology sucked a lot of my time. I even remember one semester they didn’t allow me to take a single Computer Science course due to pre-requisites. This semester I will be taking mostly industrial classes so I am hoping that I will be able to practice some of my skills (particularly Unity, Git and SQL). But I do believe that science courses, calculus and Gen-Ed courses really prevented me from improving my skills and made me hate choosing the degree but I am fine now. Additionally, my school is ABET accredited. 

What are your thoughts about this? Do you think that’s what they should do?"

My major is in accounting but I'm more interested towards tech field and around 2022 March, I started to learn web development, I started with Html then learnt CSS and JS and then built vanilla JS projects for 2 months. Then 3 months later I started learning ReactJS as learning a framework is really important to build a website. Then built some projects using ReactJS which includes a Newsletter (I will provide the GitHub link for the project below).

Then I tried looking for an internship in August 2022 and luckily got selected in a startup named Eduminatti where I worked for 3 months. But the stipend I received was around 6000INR. Most of the big companies like FAANG provide high stipend and I too wanted a high paying Job/Internship too.

Then I research about the skills required to get internship in FAANG companies. That's when I understood DSA was the main factor of selection so I started learning DSA from around September and almost completed around 160 questions until now (I will provide My Leetcode account link below). And around the end of January I was convinced that my DSA skills are good to go for an interview. And that's when recession hit so instead of wasting time I started learning Backend and built a FullStack E-commerce website where frontend uses ReactJS and backend uses node, express and MongoDB. Now I am ready to go but I cannot find a way to get an interview in these big companies.

I tried to contact HR's and Managers through LinkedIn, tried messaging them but no one replied back. Tried cold E-mailing but I just can't find a way to get an interview. For people reading this, Do you know how can I get an interview in the FAANG companies. And also I need tips on making connections, And I would love to connect with anyone on LinkedIn. Please help me out on this, I spent a lot of time on learning programming, I missed many college fests and events so that I can learn programming. And now that I have come so far I don't want to give up. Also this is my first time posting something on reddit, I'm sorry if I did something wrong.

Hey everyone,

I will start my career in a big pharma company as a marketing & sales MT. The program and the company is pretty selective in my country. Only hires top people from top universities. Everything seems good but I have some questions;

1-Can I advance in this role without any knowledge regarding life sciences? I've studied management&tech, and nearly all of the people who interviewed me in different phases for this role, were also business/econ majors. But I want to expand my career globally, and not sure if this is the case for other places as well.

2-How easy would it be for me to change the industry in the future if I want it? I've had an internship at faang, bizdev role, and liked it too. But I also wanted something different and enjoyed the pharma company's program very much. Let's say I wanted to switch to tech marketing, saas. How hard would it be for me? A lot of people do that in cpg, but not sure for pharma.

3-I want something international. Maybe work for a few years here, then a few years in Asia, Europe, the US etc. I think it would be easiest in tech, but what are the possibilities for me? When I checked for the profiles on LinkedIn, I saw people working at different locations around the world for this company, but they might be outliers.

4-This is something I wonder about. A lot of people in this company have started their careers and continued working there. Is it because it is harder to find experienced professionals in pharma and your value increases as you get more senior?"

I thought I could cope because I've done internships before and I manage well. But not at this job, I'm constantly swamped by work, there are last-minute deadlines from other departments and I have like 10 big tasks on my to-do list every day.   


Eventually, I had to tell my supervisor I had ADHD because it was really impacting my work and I thought they'd help to provide accommodations like (remote work or task restructuring) but they didn't... they just said oh this is part of the job and offered to transfer me to another department. It sucks because I can't change, it has to be related to my degree. But I'm more frustrated that my coworkers who were so buddy-buddy with me before, absolutely gave no shits about me. 

I'm just really upset about the situation and angry at myself for not performing well. I'm trying to be better and have a positive mindset but it's also a really stifling appointment it's affecting my daily life too. I can't bear to eat at work because food tastes like cardboard when I eat with them (psychological  stress I guess) I haven't eaten lunch at work for about 2 weeks now... 

The only thing keeping me going is spite and how Im going to wow them with my progress. But idk, I wonder if I'm just incompetent or is this something that I have to go through because of my condition and if other's can relate?"

They said we could either ask her to order it directly, or buy it ourselves and ask her to sign a reimbursement form. Since I'll be at my computer for most of the day, I figured I could use an upgrade to the crappy mouse and keyboard they provided. 

I've asked my friends who have done internships at software companies and they told me that their companies have been willing to spend $500+ on peripherals (which they are even allow to keep afterwards) and also provide laptops. I feel like that would be way too much to ask for, especially since I just joined recently. 

My question is, what price range should I am for?

The whole process was disappointing to say the least. 

I made a post a while back about how my thesis advisor submitted all of my letters of recommendation \~1 month late, which according to the comments on that post and conversations with other professors at my university severely hurt odds of getting a fair shake from any admissions committee. 

Right now, I feel very lost on what I should do next and how to strengthen my application and avoid any issues in the future. Below is (roughly) my stats/background without giving away any personal information--

* BS in Computer Science (Cum laude)
* \~1 year as Data Scientist while finishing BS
* MS in Computer Science, GPA: 3.9
* Data engineering internship. 
* Research in two labs while a MS student. 
* Machine learning engineering internship.
* Teaching assistant for two graduate level CS classes. 
* Teaching fellow (I lectured and ran the labs, tenured faculty mentored me) for two undergraduate CS classes.

None of the universities I applied to accepted/required GRE scores so I did not take it. My research interests are in AI & robotics and after my PhD I would like to pursue a post-doc then a tenure-track position. I would appreciate any piece of advice on what type of role I should pursue in the meantime, how to stay involved in research for future application cycles, and any other general advice for PhD applications for fall 2024 admission. 

I will not let this application cycle get me down and I will achieve my dream eventually. 

TLDR: Denied from effectively all CS PhD programs, need advice on what to do now and how to best prepare for the next application cycle."

139zxj0,3,2023-05-06,my friend went after a guy who I hate with a burning passion,Spare_Association_52,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/139zxj0/my_friend_went_after_a_guy_who_i_hate_with_a/,"my sophomore year I met this international student, and he and I became good friends quickly. We were the same major so we would work on assignments and study for exams together. Outside of academics we would hangout at the student centers or go for lunch. He was living in an apartment and I had a car so I would take him grocery shopping and help with errands now and then. We were good friends.

After about a year, he started changing. He would make comments about my body. I'm not the most physically fit person. I was on a swim team but that was about it for my physical exercise. I was happy with the way I looked until he started to say things. One he said it doesn't look like I do much exercise. I brushed it off, mainly because sometimes people say things and it comes out the wrong way but then when we would hangout instead of doing the stuff we usually do, he started suggesting we walk around campus. Once I looked at my Apple Watch and said ""wow I haven't taken this many steps in a while"" without thinking and he said ""you're welcome"". I started distancing myself a bit after that.

He was academically gifted, 4.0 gpa, any pick of internships, etc. So in our friend group if we had a question, we would go to him and once he said ""if it wasn't for me none of you would be passing"". I just left after that and stopped asking for help. I was perfectly capable of getting good grades on my own. I had a 3.6 gpa before he started helping me so I was fine.

I told my friends about this who weren't part of that friend group and they told me to just avoid him, be the bigger person and just move on. They were right, I didn't want to tear an entire friend group apart because my ego was bruised. I still had friends in that group so he was still in my life.

He told one of my ""friends"" that he was into me and he was going to ask me out. This was around valentines day too so everything was just awkward. I was already talking to another guy who I really liked but I didn't want to tell anyone because it was just none of their business. But my ""friend"" she told me about my international friend wanting to ask me out. She knew I didn't like him so I had hoped that she would've talked him out of it but she had given him the green light for some reason.

The next couple days I tried to make it clear that I wasn't into him like that by doing small things like posting a pic of my private story of me hanging out with the guy I was talking to. But he didn't seem to get the message. My university was handing out flowers because it was valentines day and he just pointed to them when I was there and he said get one if you want. Idk why I said this but I told him I dont like flowers. I'm not sure why I said that but it just came out of my mouth and I just kept walking.

He didn't seem to get the message but the day he said he was going to ask me out, I had lunch with the guy who I was talking to and my international friend saw us and got mad at me. Im not sure what base he had to get pissed off in the first place because we weren't really friends anymore. I wasn't going out of my way to text him or to make plans. I would see him in lecture and that was about it. After that he avoided me like the plague. I had gone to high school with one of his friends so he would talk to me a quite a bit. After everything he told me that my ""friend"" was hanging out with him a lot and for next semester she got the apartment unit next to him.

I was confused because before this she never had an interest in him. She would hangout with us but that was about it. She knows the stuff that he said to me and how much it bothered me but she was talking to him this entire time. The semester goes on and she's all over him. She told me once that she wouldn't mind trying stuff out with him and it just made me uncomfortable.

I'm not saying she shouldn't go out with him if she really does like him, but he's repeatedly made comments about women and their appearances. He met my little sister once, she loves to do her makeup, and after she left he told me that she should stop wearing makeup. If she wants to do it, just let her do it. It's none of his concern how she dresses or what she puts on her face. I got a haircut a while back and he told me he liked my old hair cut better. Then he commented about how my hair smelled different and I got creeped out after that.

just and over all strange person but if she wants to go after him she can."

During this time, I want to earn and learn and spend time with myself instead of running around to prepare for my masters and license. Through out my whole life, I have been running around for my studies. It was always home and school. School and home. I completed my high school and the very next day, my dad got me registered to tuition for entrance exam. And I never got a chance to travel and be with myself. 

I have a job offer right now(not in legal firm). It has great salary. I will be able to afford rent, other expense and saving. I'm thinking of getting my own place and moving closer to my new job as my home is very far from it. What should I do? Should I take the break or not? Also if I take this job, I will not have time to give exams for my license as to get my license, it requires 3 months internship and this job requires me to work at least 1 year and they overlap with each other. 

Also I'm worried that I might stray away from my studies with work and money after working constantly for 1 year and not studying as I will be  busy. 

Also I fight with my mom everyday. I'm tired of this. I just want some peace. The only reason I don't fight with my dad is that he is not at home due to his job. They are super toxic and they don't care about me no matter how they pretend they do. I found out when I got dengue and covid. The way I was treated when I was sick by my both parents, what is wrong with me? Why do I still tolerate such treatment and still live with them? I want to leave. I need to leave but I'm scared. 

Also I want to take other training and classes for my career but I can't afford them and my parents won't bother to support me financially as they only bother about things they want me to do. 

(Also anyone thinking I'm 24 and I should leave the home at 18. Listen, I would have left sooner but my parents...I know them. In Asian culture,, its very different. They will tell everyone about how I 'eloped with some guy' (even if I havent) and maybe file a missing person report. Also I wasn't financially able to support myself to leave home sooner at 18.)"

I have been offered a 6 month contract role in Capital Markets Operations at a large bank here in Canada and it is the only job offer I have received so far. The problem is that I don't want to pursue a career in Operations as the work is fairly mundane and my interest lies more in the tech field, as that is what my program was centered around. I somehow wound up in Operations due to landing a summer internship last year but was working more on process improvement initiatives doing things like scripting and data analytics using Python and Tableau rather than typical Operations tasks like paying invoices and reconciling trades.

Taking the contract role is the less risky option as it secures employment immediately and gives me more time to figure out what I want to do post-grad, but I'm worried that the experience won't be as relevant to the roles I'm interested in such as Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Product Management, etc. which have little to do with finance. I could decline the offer and simply making searching for a full-time job a full-time job, but that is obviously riskier since I may be unemployed for an extended period of time, especially with a possible recession right around the corner.

I did accumulate 20 months of internship experience throughout my undergrad so I'm not totally green when it comes to work experience, but nevertheless it is still a challenging position I find myself in. Wondering what Reddit's opinions are."

I am a 3rd year computer engineering student doing the internship program through my school and I have aspirations of pursuing artificial intelligence as a career. There was a lot of pressure for me to get an internship job from friends and family so I sent out a ton of applications. After sending out about 150 applications and a couple failed interviews later, I got an offer a day after the interview.. (red flag?)

The title is Processes & Applications (SCM) Intern. The SCM standing for supply chain management. Working in this job for the first week I realized I will mostly be doing admin work like PowerBI, Excel, Power Automate etc. to summarize data on suppliers in dashboards for commodity managers to make decisions.

My fear is that this job is not technical enough and it would not be considered by employers in the future. **So should I stick with it or just go back to school?**"

My manager told me the salary will be in the mid-$70k range and honestly I feel super blessed because this market has been rough and this might be the only offer I can get before graduation. It’s also a big jump from my intern salary which is $22/hour. However I’m just wondering if you guys think I can negotiate it any further without making them mad and rescind the offer (lol).

For context, my company is like a manufacturing site and for my internship I’ve working on mainly full stack web dev and some python, C++, etc. The only SWEs on site are a Principal SWE and I. Other SWEs are in a different location. I really enjoy the work environment and I think I’m gonna accept it no matter what. Just wondering what u guys think.

Thank you and good luck to whoever is still looking for jobs out there!"

I’m thinking of doing 2 years in NUS which is practically $0 (PSEA covers fully) and transferring to UIUC later instead. The acceptance rate for Int’l male applicants to UIUC CompE first year is 30% (got the number after emailing UIUC). For int’l transfer applicants, is it likely higher?

Fortunately can afford the full cost of 4 years at UIUC without needing loans…but still…I hate that I have to pay so much per year. It’s absurd!

I’d save over 100k USD using this approach. Also, the first 2 years are core/foundational courses that are similar at most Unis anyway. For advanced courses in 3rd and 4th year, UIUC or other top US Unis would be better. Plus I’d still get the 3-year STEM OPT work authorization and **I wish to work in the US and become PR because the fields I'm most interested in are waayy larger & advanced in US than SG. Also, my most exciting ambition requires green card for anyone in that industry.**

1. What are the disadvantages of this transfer approach?
2. Is the transfer application process a lot more tedious and complicated than first-year application?
3. Is the acceptance rate higher even for international transfer applicants?
4. Would I have to try to get leadership roles in clubs in my 1st year or 2nd year at NUS
5. Does UIUC / US unis generally keep as many places for int'l transfer students as first-year students?
6. If I choose to remain in NUS for 4 years, how much of an advantage is the special H1B1 work visa VS the 3-yr STEM OPT for landing a US job upon graduation?

Of course, there's a risk that I won’t get accepted to UIUC as a transfer applicant but I think it’s not a big risk and well worth it. NUS is a world-renowned top Uni in Asia and is extremely rigorous. Most courses could transfer. I don't mind going to other US unis ranked a bit lower than UIUC also. Just want that 3yr STEM OPT because it greatly improves odds of getting a job in US right?

Also, I'm concerned about the next 2 years in the US because of the economy, election, AI, etc. It's already very hard for international students to get internships in US.

I have emailed UIUC about the Int'l transfer acceptance rate and how NUS courses transfer.

Oh, and I'm not interested in Masters and it's actually a net loss in most cases if you consider the opportunity cost of not gaining work experience and income instead."

&#x200B;

However, when doing LeetCode or Hackerrank I enjoy using Python because the syntax and relatively close behavior to natural language lets me focus on solving the problem instead of looking up the syntax every step of the way. I like coding in C++ specifically because of the manual memory management and seeing more of the ""under the hood"" behaviors.

&#x200B;

The largest problem is that I am willing to learn any language for any project, but of course companies prefer you to be well versed in whatever language first. It seems paradoxical to become proficient in a language as a student because it starts closing doors to other internships because ""you use that and we use this"".  Am I hamstringing myself? Should I honestly just pick a single language and git gud at it?"

It started as an internship right out of college then turned into a job, and in the 5.5 years I've been there I've been promoted up to a VP (everybody gets a fancy job title being a small company). 

However, we've always struggled to make it by and I'm pretty underpaid for the work I do because we're always broke. Since the way the company gets paid is in larger, spread out chunks rather than steady but smaller cash flow, right now only me and two other guys are on salary. The rest are commission-only. 

My boss has promised me multiple times that as soon as we have more money he'll give me a raise, make me a junior partner, etc. and to be fair I don't doubt his intent. He really is a nice guy; he's just not very good at running a business. 

Meanwhile, a very large and well-funded company with whom I work with directly on the weekly basis and have a good relationship with one of their higher-ups is hiring for a position that's right up my alley and that I qualify for. They have great benefits, I'd get to work remote, and even the low end of the posted salary range is 50% more than what I'm making now. 

Logically, it makes all the sense in the world to make the move. 

On the other hand, I'm currently in a position with my company where I'm in charge of all the day-to-day stuff and there are many critical functions that only I'm trained to do and manage. If I left there's a good chance the company would collapse and everyone else there would lose their jobs.

long story short, i was miserable throughout my senior year, constantly stressing out and looking for ways and opportunities i could leverage to get into a t10. didnt end up getting into a t10, but still got into good schools. but i wasnt neither particularly happy nor satisfied considering i wanted to go into vc/finance, which is an industry with a lot of emphasis on the prestige of your college.

cut to 4 weeks ago, i got an offer for an internship from a well known startup and connected with quite a few folks in vc/startups. i've realised that college is only a tool to make the path to vc/pe (for that matter any profession) easier. but, getting into a t10 doesnt define whether or not you'll ever make it to vc/pe. i've also realised that trying to become the president of clubs, getting into selective research programs, trying to win all competitions, are all zero sum games and short term incentives. i can confidently say that at the startup im at, they dont care at the stuff i did in school. all they care about is my potential to learn and contribute to the org. the purpose of this post is not to dunk on people who care about such incentives, because they do have some value in their own sense and people who secure such opportunities are indeed talented. rather, the purpose of this post is to say that these opportunities are not an end all or be all. if you're truly passionate about something, you'll figure out a way to get to where you want. also, in the end, it just comes down to working on interesting things with people you like and having fun while doing it, so dont stress out too much about ""building your profile"". hope this post helps with some of the anxiety and all the best :)  


edit: also adding a quick email exchange bw me and a very senior exec at YC:  


me: do you think it might be worth moving from \[country\] to the US for a university like \[good school but not a target for vc/pe\]? and do you think i should consider a gap year to apply to better universities again? (ie how much does prestige matter when trying to break into VC?)   


YC exec:  the best way to prepare yourself for a career in VC is to start (or work at) a successful startup, and the fastest way to do that is to get yourself to  \[good school but not a target for vc/pe\] now rather than burning a year hoping to get into a more prestigious university."

**Letters of Recommendation**
Bio teacher 6.5/10: she scared me and I don’t think she liked me either lmao, only did this because I thought it would align with my major

English: 9.5/10 she would always compliment my writing and encourage me, sweetest ever and heard she gives good reccs

Counselor: 5.5/10 did not vibe with her, didn’t really communicate with her past the necessities and also I wasn’t clear with her on what to emphasize (I made the tutoring thing and how much I loved teaching kids because of my own past too large a narrative I think. Diversity would have been better choice to empahasize, but after REA (when I last talked to her abt this) I was stressed af and didn’t go to update my counselor on what I felt would be a stronger focus and cohesiveness with my theme. My biggest regret

**Interviews**
Stanford (REA): loved, we were both Asian and did bioinformatics research, smooth conversation 9/10

Rice: 8/10 stumbled on one question and was queasy the whole time (I ended up throwing up 4 times that day) but was nice

Princeton: 2/10 he was a big shot CEO and we kept on rescheduling and when it came time I was so nervous and FOLDED, rambled and stumbled massively on why Princeton 

Northwestern: 7.5/10 was going great until I messed up their mascot right at the end 😀 a great lasting impression

Duke: 6/10 it was nice but I couldn’t really relate to my interviewer (it was a NPC convo), also had wifi issues

Harvard: 100/10. Everything I could have wanted. Same intellectual interests, humor, etc. sad it had to end after an hour (she had another scheduled interview)

**Essays**
7.5/10 supplemental were generic and imo boring and safe (I regret not taking a bigger risk and showing my personality in there too or writing about something more memorable and ‘quirky’)

Common app was about how I learned to find my voice and heal from what I had been told as a child (girls are to be quiet, not make a fuss) through research. 8.5/10

**Decisions** 
**Acceptances (2)**
* State school with 66k scholarship 
* ???? (Keep on reading 😝)

**Waitlists (13)**
*American (only applied bcuz I thought they would give me money but damn)
* JHU
* UCLA
* Tufts
* BU
* Rice
* Vanderbilt 
* Barnard
* Emory
* Harvard
* UPenn
* Cornell
* Berkeley


**Rejections (7)**
* Stanford (REA). Rip
* Northwestern (sad, the campus was so pretty)
* NYU (damn I really wanted to be a NYC girly)
* Columbia: dream school after 🌲 rejection :((
* Brown
* Yale
* Princeton (expected)



So. Before revealing what other school I was accepted to (+ committed), let me just set the stage. The ONLY school I was accepted to was my state safety and for those two weeks of waiting for all decisions to be released I was losing my mind. It seemed like everything I had worked for and sacrificed during high school was all in vain. My social life. My personality. My morals even.

All of these losses felt like they meant nothing now, and as Ivy day ticked closer and closer, and as my waitlist/reject list grew larger and larger, I felt the humanity draining out of me. I tried to stay optimistic, but everyday I just felt numb and in a perceptual state of self doubt. Was there something wrong in my application? Some red flag that had gone unnoticed, slipping through the cracks like a treacherous seed that grew into a man killing Venus trap? My nights were sleepless as I gazed up at my ceiling, endlessly pondering the what ifs and buts of the world. I was consumed by my thoughts. 

Ivy day arrived, and I still had a grand total of one acceptance. I had low belief. Outwardly, I was laughing, saying phrases like “why am I being delusional today, I am definitely getting into Harvard” or “Columbia wants me so bad.” The humor and the laughs I got were coping mechanisms for the growing dread I felt. At this point, I had no faith in myself. The best I realistically expected were more waitlists (I already had 9 of them). Still, I allowed myself to get my hopes up. Of course, assuming you’ve read in order of the post, you already know the results. 

I didn’t cry after I opened all the decision notifications. Once again, I joked and laughed with my family, saying that my LOCI to Harvard would definitely tip me in and that even if it didn’t, my state school was fine too. I resolved myself. This was it. This was my fate. 

With the shrill shriek of my alarm clock, another day began. I dragged myself out of bed, forcing myself to school. I could barely focus. As the school day ended, I typed out a pessimistic email to my counselor notifying her of my college results before heading to go shopping with my friends. We were out until evening, and at 6:30, we started going home in the car together.

I went to my email, opening my portal, typing in my username and password (a few times bcuz I forgot 😀), not expecting anything.

And then.

Confetti. 

I blinked.

My lips parted.

“OH MY GOD I GOT INTO DUKE!!!!”

All my friends started screaming with me. The car may have swerved a few times as well. I called my mom (she made me confirm many times that I saw it right ☠️) and then I screamed some more. I couldn’t believe it. The fate that I thought was so set in stone was suddenly cracked. With this one acceptance, it seemed like all my efforts were validated. A warm and fuzzy feeling lingered in my chest.

This must have been some play. With my only acceptances being the first and last decisions that I opened, it seemed like God was toying with me. I suffered emotional battering for weeks. But, just as if in a fairy tale, at the time when the heroine seems to have lost all hope, faced with an insurmountable obstacle, a miracle happens. 

Never. Lose. Hope.

It just takes one.

Thank you for reading my dramatic story (it is now 2:40 am and my fingers are cramping), and I hope this provided some perspective to lurking juniors soon to be hs seniors on this sub that might also be doubting themselves and their abilities when it comes time to college application/acceptance season. 

Chin up, you got this.

Signed with love,

13asu6k,2,2023-05-07,What’s the expectations from online assessments? (Equity Research),LostinConeyisland_,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/13asu6k/whats_the_expectations_from_online_assessments/,"I recently had a rejection from MS after completing their online assessment. This was for ER off cycle internship. I did the tests after applying immediately, but still got rejected fairly quickly. Obviously, it could be my profile sucks compared to others. Im just curious if suboptimal performance on those tests is enough to warrant a rejection on its own. Here are my scores:

> SJT: Your responses to this assessment suggest, that compared to others, your behavioural strengths are somewhat aligned to this business unit. You are as likely as others to respond to situations in a way that leads to success in this role.

> Inductive: Your performance score suggests that you performed well above the requirements for the specific role you applied to. Inductive reasoning is one of your key strengths.

> Numerical: Your performance score suggests that you performed well above the requirements for the specific role you applied to. Numerical reasoning is one of your key strengths.

> Verbal: Your performance score suggests that you performed well above the requirements for the specific role you applied to. Verbal reasoning is one of your key strengths.

Looks like I bombed situational judgement. I remember speaking to a director in ECM who told me that for ER the most important thing is verbal followed by numerical, so I’m not sure. Is it enough to get a rejection or is it my profile?"

13azg52,114,2023-05-07,[IWantOut] 27M Sudan -> Anywhere,lookintotutor,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/13azg52/iwantout_27m_sudan_anywhere/,"I'm Sudanese, and in case you haven't heard, Sudan descended into civil war a few weeks ago. ""Luckily"", I was in Egypt when it happened - a family medical emergency brought me here a few months ago.

I managed to get my degree out of the country (I recently graduated as a dentist), and, due to being worried about my legal status here (mid 20s males need visas to be here, which becomes difficult when your country of origin is in war, and my current visa has a few months left on it), was hoping I could start my dental internship (dentists and doctors here need to finish an internship period after graduation to work) here and maybe work till I figure out my next move. However, due to the damage caused by the war, government services and buildings were either shut down or flat out destroyed, and although my degree has the basic official stamps on it, it lacks a certain stamp needed for me to apply for an internship here. The helping person at the Sudanese consulate, although sympathetic, flat out told me I just have to wait until things end and restart in Sudan, then take my papers there to get that stamp.

I tried contacting the UNHCR to establish refugee status, and after trying for weeks, received an invitation for an initial registration interview 5 months from now. Although annoying/confusing, it's understandable; Egypt is already hosting a huge amount of refugees from nearby countries, and currently going through one of the worst economic crises in its history.

I want to go anywhere moderately stable where I won't have to worry about being deported and can have some sort of legal residency status that I can apply for from abroad (since most countries have some sort of asylum procedure, but require you to be physically present in the country to claim asylum). I looked around, particularly for countries that speak English since it's my first language (due to my upbringing and schooling), and here's what I found;

Arab Gulf countries - my Arabic is not as good as my English but I'm fluent in it, however, although I was born and raised there, there's no track for citizenship or permanent residency there, and they don't accept asylum seekers, so that's not an option.

Nearby African countries - Rwanda and a singular few came to mind since they seem stable, and I plan on doing some reading on them, but the vast majority seem to have their own problems, and the countries in an immediate vicinity to Egypt all have some sort of war or conflict going on.

North America - Canada seems to have a few programs to help sponsor refugees, and I've reached out to a few; most were sympathetic but couldn't help, and the rest (including the embassy, since I found out that it may be possible to ask for asylum at a Canadian embassy) didn't reply. The United States is quite literally impossible to get into. They started a recent refugee program called ""The Welcome Corps"", but it requires referral from the UNHCR I mentioned earlier, and the process can take years, which is understandable, since there's a gazillion refugees in the world right now. Mexico, again, like almost every other country requires you to be there to claim asylum.

Oceania - Australia seems to have a program for refugees from overseas, but the main referral is, again, via the UNHCR, and I don't seem to qualify for the other programs.

I tried to apply for jobs as a dental assistant (since I can't work as a dentist) in Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand since I have friends who were successful through this route, and since in most of these countries a work visa takes much, much less time to process than a refugee one, but have received either no replies or rejections. With the current labor shortages in Russia I thought I could find something there since, war aside, it seems relatively stable concerning basic necessities, but was severely discouraged by people living there. With other countries in Europe, there seems to be a language requirement, so I'm doing a bit more research on that.

So, for asylum it seems I have to get to a country and claim asylum there, but I highly doubt any country will give me a visitor's visa with what's going on in Sudan since it's clear I won't be going back. Funnily enough, several years ago I visited the US on a tourist visa for a few weeks, and after being pressured a bit by friends and family to overstay and apply for asylum (since Sudan was always a bit unstable and difficult to live in, and a lot of people do that), I completely turned down the idea since I thought it would be dishonest of me to claim asylum and waste taxpayer money and resources while not needing it. The irony is not lost on me.

So, any ideas? I am not in immediate danger - I am an atheist which is dangerous here, but I've kept that to myself over the years since it's not a good idea to advertise your atheism in a Muslim country, and I don't want to try and use that and take an opportunity for asylum from someone more deserving or in more immediate danger to their person."
13azhy2,2,2023-05-07,What should I do during summer? Volunteer or learn professional skills by myself?,Special_Advance1338,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13azhy2/what_should_i_do_during_summer_volunteer_or_learn/,"Dear Redditors,

I need advice on what to do this summer (between Bachelor's and Master's degrees)

I am 23yo, about to graduate from my bachelor in Business Administration in the beginning of June, and will start a 2-year-long Master of Research in the begining of August. In total I will have about 50 days of vacation from the day I finish my Bachelor's to the beginning of my master's.

My initial plan was to find an internship during this period, but I couldn't find any company in Europe accepting me for such a short time - usually they require a minimum of 3 months.

Since, the internship is not possible I have two other options:

* Volunteer in Asia for at least 3 weeks in a Forest Protection NGO.
* Follow Summer School for 3 weeks and spend the rest of my weeks, following online courses and do things that I usually don't have time to do during the year.

I am very career oriented and am looking forward to achieve something in life. Throughout my Bachelor I worked pretty hard, meaning that I built a reasonable CV so far. In addition to that that I still have 2 more years to go until I finish my studies.

My biggest concern in doing the volunteer work is the fact I might ""lose"" time that I could spend acquiring relevant skills for my future profession, such as learning some coding, or improving one of the languages I speak. I would hate to look back this summer and think ""Damn, it was a waste of time"".

On the other hand, I feel like my young years are passing by, and they should be enjoyed as well, and not only spent working tirelessly. Additionally, volunteering could also shape myself for the better.

I would like to know from you. What would you do in my shoes? Do you believe I should focus in learning professional skills, or could it be time to enjoy a little?"

I had a few questions regarding how UC schools, and mainly UCSD, do their master's programs. I want to do a master's in Computer science with a focus on ML.

1. I am currently a Junior @ UTD, and I have around 2 semesters left before I finish my undergraduate degree in CS. What are some of the additional activities that would make my application stand out?
   1. I have around a 3.5 GPA(Defo would go higher, kinda messed up in my first year)
   2. I am currently doing research at my university in ML/AI mainly in the robotics field
   3. I am doing my first internship this semester, as a full-stack engineer intern, and could get into one more before graduating
2. Looking at my current stats, would a good score on the GRE help? If so, what is a benchmark good score for UC schools?

thank you!"

I would love some advice on which one people feel may be better suited for me. Here are some of the things I've been considering -

Offer 1:

\- higher pay, by about $12 an hour

\- would help with relocation

\- uses company's own tools and software

\- very well-known company

\- program feels thought-out but flexible (based off of interviews)

\- less corporate, a company with a 'young' culture

Offer 2:

\- lower pay

\- would not help with relocation

\- uses tools and software that would be much more applicable to other companies

\- also very well-known, but not as much

\- aligns a little more with my interests

\- program feels a little more unorganized (based off of interviews)

\- more corporate

Both companies are in roughly the same area.

My general thoughts are that company 2 would be more appealing to me and useful in terms of using widely used software and working in a really interesting area to me. But, having to find housing on my own means I probably wouldn't be walking away with very much money from it. With that said, I'm not too worried about income, and wouldn't want money to be a deciding factor for a temporary position. But, if they were to extend full-time offers that I took a year from now, money would certainly become a larger consideration. It also seems, based on the structure of the interviews I've had, that company 2 is a little less put together with their program than company 1, which could potentially mean more creative freedom, but could also mean a less thought-out experience and some more stress.

Is there something anyone thinks I'm missing or not giving enough weight/too much weight? Would love any input."

I went to SNHU and graduated with my bachelors back in July to try to get out of FedEx, but the Information Technology program at SNHU I feel, didn’t prepare me for the IT industry. We spent very little time on legitimate skills like Python, AWS, and SQL. Like one class for each topic, and 90% of the entire curriculum was just theoretical systems analysis scenarios. I’ve applied to 10 internships with no luck, and one even told me to get professional experience because I didn’t learn Active Directory or Salesforce.

Now, before you click away…

Specifically, I’m asking because I’m currently a senior in HIGH SCHOOL, so I haven’t actually started going to university yet. I know there’s a big culture around applying to summer internships a year in advance, but I’m not sure if I’d even offer much value to companies looking for interns, so should I even bother applying or what? I’m really only well-versed in Python and C++ and I have some basic knowledge of Java because I took AP CSA."

Please give me some advice and tips on how I can improve my resume. As of right now, I am trying to get my foot in the door within the IT field as an undergraduate student and am trying to land an IT internship.

I have applied to over 100 companies and have been interviewed about 6 times. Is there something wrong with my resume or am I just getting unlucky? I’m also wondering if my current internship as a Cyber Security Intern is hindering my ability to get other internships since the recruiters already see that I am doing an internship already. Also, I do not have any certifications or degrees.

I am fully aware that applying is a numbers game. Thank you guys!

13b92yv,1,2023-05-07,Dating apps exposed insecurities I didn't know I had,StayGoldenPonyboy101,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/13b92yv/dating_apps_exposed_insecurities_i_didnt_know_i/,"I created an account for a dating app this morning. Felt I was finally ready and had myself put together enough to let someone into my life. Yeah that was quite the lie I conjured up.

I guess for context you need to know I'm a college student, turning 21 next month, never dated anyone in my entire life. 

I'm swiping through the app, and keep swiping left on all these dudes with great profiles. The reason? They're too close, I even checked the preferences on the app to see if I could get matches farther away (I couldn't). Why would I do this? I'm a 20 year old with no car, no driver's license, and staying with my parents and siblings until my summer internship starts. I'm a coward that can't tell my parents I'm  trying to date anyone because I still feel like a child, especially under their roof.

Another reason I swipe left? All these guys are so...normal. Like, you hang out with friends? I'm alone  90% of the time, and have a fear that I won't have enough close friends to invite to the wedding. Half these dudes have 6-pack abs? That takes discipline that I'm still in the process of acquiring. I'm so insecure that even if these guys swiped right on me, I think I'm not what they're actually looking for. My brain instantly goes to ""I'm sure you'll find a nice, normal girl on here, I'm not one of those"".

What the heck is wrong with me? I literally downloaded this app, see all these great guys, but now it's been 12 hours since creating my profile, and I feel like I should delete it and work on myself more. I feel like I showed up to a work presentation in pajamas while everyone else is wearing suits and dresses.

Will I ever get out of this ""kid"" phase? New goal this summer is do whatever it takes to feel like a grown woman, so I don't feel intimidated by these dudes."

13bb3v8,1,2023-05-07,To MBA or not to MBA,bfishinc,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/13bb3v8/to_mba_or_not_to_mba/,"TLDR; Should I do a one year accelerated MBA program after my BBA due to its speed and efficiency even though a few different people have noted that MBAs don’t necessarily guarantee higher pay or a career boost right out of the gate?

————————————————————————

For background, I (20M) just wrapped up my second year pursuing my BBA with a double major in Finance and Business Analytics at Ohio University, not Ivy League or anything huge but fairly reputable imo nonetheless. Because of some high school credits, some summer classes, and some convincing to waive certain general education requirements, I’m on track to graduate a full year early in May 2024 instead of May 2025 like most of the class I came in with.

Since I’m graduating in 3 years, I’ve been excited for a little bit now to jumpstart my career a year earlier than originally anticipated. I’ve completed one internship already in the mortgage industry, and decided that path wasn’t for me. I have another internship I’m starting in 3 weeks working in commercial real estate finance. I’m excited for this one and believe it will be a better fit for me.

With the background out of the way, recently I’ve considered the possibility of staying one extra year to get my MBA. The program would cost about $21k and it’s accelerated so it would start in August 2024 and finish in July 2025. The program is designed for recent graduates and young professionals, and the last month of the program involves a study abroad/international consulting group trip with almost all expenses paid for by the school. I’ve talked to my undergraduate advisor, an advisor in the graduate college, a career mentor (a professional who has worked in the finance industry for about 10 years, albeit he works in debt structuring, not in commercial real estate as I am leaning towards currently), as well as some family members, and have very mixed feelings about whether or not I should pursue the advanced degree.

On one hand, I’ve been told that graduates from this program often get quicker promotions (the number I was told is 50% get promoted within the first 9 months out of the program, the program is also only a few years old with only about 35 students admitted per year so this data could be skewed due to low sample size). I also figure this could be a great opportunity to do it now before I fully dive into life, as I can do it in a year and still be out of school at the same time as I was originally expecting a few years back. I wouldn’t have to do a thesis or anything like that with this program either which could be considered a plus that I may not get if I were to go back for my masters later instead of doing it now. Finally, on a social note, I would love to spend another year with my really good friends at school.

On the other side of things, I’ve heard both from statistics of the program as well as from my career mentor who has a friend that got his MBA from the same school a number of years back that the starting pay is often the same. My career mentor only has his BBA and has done well for himself and his friend with the MBA noted that he didn’t really see any huge immediate benefits after getting it, and that having the degree was moreso a “nice to have” item rather than something that advanced his career a ton. My career mentor and I tend to think similarly in that hard work can go further than advanced education. However, he did mention that it’s important to take everything that everybody says with a grain of salt based on their views towards advanced education, which I already had been and continue to be doing. In addition, for me the completion in July is somewhat of a con because I wouldn’t be graduating/leaving campus for the last time at the same time as all my friends. I know this seems minor, but it’s still something I’m considering as I’m trying to cherish the short amount of time I have left with all of us living near each other. Finally I also don’t think I will exactly enjoy the curriculum. I always swore to myself that I would never get my masters because I don’t see any of the school work aspect of it being particularly relevant to real world work, and a lot of it I see as being things I can teach myself via YouTube, books, etc. I’ve never been a big formal education guy, and although I’m in one of the honors programs at my school and I get good grades, I often find myself being bored with school and annoyed at the amount of busy work, which makes me wonder if I could even reasonably get through an MBA program. I also have no interest in doing the required international consulting piece of the program. Although I’m sure that’s a big draw for some people, I don’t have too much of an interest in doing it with random people from a class.

I know I’m nitpicking on some of these pros and cons, and I still have plans to talk to more people about this, including people at my internship coming up soon who will have a better idea of it’s importance in this industry as opposed to other industries in finance. With all this being said though, I want to hear if any of the people of Reddit have any insight they could share on the worth of an MBA in finance.

I know it’s a long read so TIA!"

Since the semester is over and I'm heading into my Junior/Senior year, I wanted to make a post because I felt bored.

I'm only making this post because as an Economics student, I felt like there was little to none information on Reddit about things like Professors, difficulty, jobs, etc... I'll be the blue print >:)

This is a rough draft at 12AM. I'll make it better and edit it with more information as time progresses. With that being said, any upvotes are appreciated and will signify the post being useful :D

&#x200B;

So here are my main takeaways:

1. Econ degree = Liberal Arts = Does not mean its bad

Econ + some minor like in business (I would recommend the BEOP program) will land you a pretty good job. There are some internships like at Citi bank that pays $45/hr.

\+You should know that Econ is one of the more established degrees in other top colleges

&#x200B;

2) Tips for what classes to take (w/ Professor's names)

Intro to Micro / Intro to Macro

\-> If you do not plan on switching to a different major, you can simply avoid taking Intro to Macro/Micro at UT. These classes can be unnecessarily hard here which can tank your GPA pretty early on, so you can look to transfer the credit when you take them at a community college. I would recommend this not because it'd be easier (somewhat the reason), but maintaining a good GPA for your first year will only motivate you more to keep at it. Once you get that C or D, you'll most likely be like damn gg idc about my grades anymore in the future, and it goes downhill from there.

BASICALLY work on your core classes instead during your freshmen year and take micro/macro in the winter/spring mini semesters (1-2 month classes so W) OR the summer.

Econ Stats

\-> PLEASE NOTE: Econ degree is weird. You need ECO STATS which will be a pre-req to MICROTHEORY which is a pre-req to everything else.

With this being said, ECO STATS will be HARD. This is why I would recommend taking your first semester doing core. There is a chance that you will get Professor Wiseman(the GOAT of economics) to teach this class in the SPRING. If you do get the chance to have Wiseman as your ECO STATS professor, TAKE THAT IMMEDIATELY. Any other professor will be 10000% harder and you will be in the PCL eating jolly ranchers and sour patch kids for hours while studying till 2-3 AM for your midterm/finals.

Idk about other Econ stats professors, so feel free to add to this thread. Ik people taking Econ stats in spring 2023 were dying lolol

Micro theory

\-> This class will be extremely difficult. There will be two different professors I will be talking about.

1)Professor Santiago/Professor Devrim (same class)

2)Professor Oettinger

Option 1: Professor Santiago is a goat while Professor Devrim was iffy(bc his lectures included bad hand writing and fast paced, making it difficult). Santiago is a great lecturer and he will be a good professor to take the class with if you are someone who will be willing to ask questions and go to office hours everyday. I took this class and it was extremely difficult, with the class averages being around 40/50's for each exam. SO, if you are some genius and willing to work your ass off, this is the class for you to get an easy A. This is because your class grade was based off RANK and a heavy curve. So if you are an outlier, take this class, as it will be easy since you'll be scoring higher than the average, giving you an easy A. This also means a guaranteed B if you're somewhat competent and actually care about learning.

Work load is just a set of homework problems due every Thursday. These homework problems are somewhat difficult and lengthy, taking up to maybe 1-3 hours to complete. If you do not understand the lectures, you will definitely fail these homeworks, which will be a factor between you getting a B vs C or A vs B,

So Pros: Take if you're smart smart, easy A for you

Good TA's, go to office hours everyday for help on the HW, this will get you a guarantee B

Cons: HARD EXAMS and LONG/Somewhat difficult Homeworks

Option 2: I was in this class for a bit. The lectures are recorded and kind of boring. It will be hard to rely on the lectures if you have ADHD or just get bored really easily. You'll have to watch these lectures, take a pre-lecture quiz before every class. So if you're not organized and fall behind in classes easily, good luck. There is also a set of homework problems every week just like Devrim's and Santiago's class. There are REVIEWS. REVIEWS THAT ARE LIKE THE EXAM BRUH

So Pros: Take this if you want a guarantee C or B to pass the class for credit bc reviews = similar toexam. This means easy B on exams. This means you don't have to work your butt off for the average grade (unlike in Santiago/Devrims)

Somewhat easy homework, easy workload if you can manage

Cons: Exams are meant to be an easy C or B, but he will make it pretty difficult for an A. I've heard this class to have averages of like 80's on the exams (which can prompt a harder exam in the future btw). So basically hard to get an A.

Pre-lecture lectures and quizzes are annoying

Electives!!!!!!!! (that I've taken so far)

I've only taken two and they are: Financial Literacy with Professor Pflug and Socl Econ with Professor Wiseman

1. Fin Lit - Take this class, Professor Pflug is a goat and very understanding. This will be one of the easier if not easiest econ elective credit you can get. You also get to learn a lot and meet guest speakers (for networking and learning opportunities). Exams are writing and take home if he lets you. There is a big project and 2 one pagers but you can literally grind this out in one day. You learn a lot from the exams and projects, so double win win.
2. Socl Econ - Professor Wiseman is a goat for the 3rd/4th time. He has the option of the Wiseman Award (get 95+ on final exam -> grade letter: A no matter what). His class is reasonable and difficult at the same time, but not impossible. Just put in your work and grind it out. This will be a guaranteed B if you don't slack ( go to lectures and practice the exams ).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thanks if you made it this far. I've always found success in getting a high GPA/good grades throughout HS and College asking for tips regarding Profs and what to expect. Just passing it forward now

&#x200B;

TLDR:

1. econ not bad
2. professor Wiseman for econ stats if possible
3. Professor Devrim/Santiago = hard class so hard C or B, but easy A if you're an outlier

Professor Oettinger = not difficult class, guaranteed/easy B if you put in effort

4) Fin lit + Socl Econ = good electives"

The Short Version: Im 25 (about to turn 26 this month), Im in GradSchool working towards an MFA in Visual Development. I have 2 years left (exactly 4 semesters of part time classes) and I am burnt out. Earlier this week I had a melt down and now as I type this I literally feel nothing towards my studies except the desire for them to be over so I can go on with my life. Not only am I struggling with burn out, but I feel as if I made the wrong decision going into this particular school and enrolling in this particular program. I can do the work but I feel nothing. I have a mid point review coming up in a couple weeks and at times the apathy continues but then I become so stressed that I won't pass, that my work is not up to par with wherever it should be and Ill just fail or they will prolong me from graduating. I dont even know if this is a possibility but Im just so scared and I dont know how to not be scared. I will go into some more detail below.

The Long version:

I enrolled at the school during covid, and at the time I was in a really weird place. Basically, when I was younger I really really hated my self. I felt completely worthless and was just coaxing through life. I did what people (mostly adults) expected of me because I was desperate for positive feed back. I didn't go out and had no friends. Days would go by without me speaking to anyone besides my mom (who was going through a painful divorce). I was just so low. I did not honor my personal desires, I did not go after anything that brought me joy. Instead I simply kept my head down and just focused on getting an English degree because besides art it was the only subject in school that made sense to me.

When I enrolled in my current school pieces of my self hating personality were slowly slipping away but deep down I was still struggling with my self worth. It's only now I can see that I enrolled in grad school for the wrong reasons. It came from a place of fear because even though I had a bachelors degree, I still did not think I could get a job anywhere. I still had no sense of drive or confidence, and had convinced myself that my resume was not good enough with an English degree. Also my mom really wanted me to get my masters in something (education is very important to her). My decision to go back to school was extremely impulsive. I did not do any research. I did not know what I wanted curriculum wise. I did not ask any questions. I simply rolled with the first offer, and just focused on getting assignments done so I could get another degree. It all just sounded like a good idea and something I ""should"" be working towards.

At the beginning I enjoyed some of my classes, others made me feel nothing but because I know how to work and get things done I just kept going. At first I was just going to get a Masters but then when speaking to my counselor we decided it might be more beneficial for me to get an MFA. I now have no recollection of why we decided this. I only remember my mother being excited because their MFA programs involves internships somehow and the idea of me having and MFA and job connections made her very happy.

I can't tell if I want to learn what I am learning anymore. I do not know what I want to do career wise. I love working though and always saw myself in some kind of creative career. I just want to be done and at times I feel so trapped. I love art, and creative people but instead of being excited about my classes I often fantasize of going out to my local art classes and learning how to make my own art at my own pace outside of school. Can anyone relate? I also recently started a YouTube channel, the process of creating it has served as another escape outside of school.

On the bright side I have changed so so much since I started grad school. I am a completely different person. Im not afraid to put myself out there, Im not afraid to make mistakes outside of school. Im excited for my future and have so much hope and belief in myself.

Aside from this current burnout I am feeling so much guilt and regret on how I put myself in this situation. I hate how clumsy I was when going into to this thing (the MFA program). I can't quit, that's just not an option for me. Im in it, I don't love it, I feel nothing at this point but at the same time I still believe the work is important. Art in all its forms will always be important to me. Visual storytelling is still fascinating to me, but in this classroom setting I feel so devoid of joy. I want to make art, I practice daily and I want to do it more for myself. I say all this but like I said, the Mid Point Review is coming up and it feels like a heavy shadow. I have nightmares about failing and not being up to their standard whatever it may be. Is there any solace for situations like this? Any advice or personal stories is much appreciated. Thanks for letting me vent. Thank you for your time."

Not only am I struggling with burn out, but I feel as if I made the wrong decision going into this particular school and enrolling in this particular program. I can do the work but I feel nothing. I have a mid point review coming up in a couple weeks and at times the apathy continues but then I become so stressed that I won't pass, that my work is not up to par with wherever it should be and Ill just fail or they will prolong me from graduating. I dont even know if this is a possibility but Im just so scared and I dont know how to not be scared. I will go into some more detail below.

The Long version:

I enrolled at the school during covid, and at the time I was in a really weird place. Basically, when I was younger I really really hated my self. I felt completely worthless and was just coaxing through life. I did what people (mostly adults) expected of me because I was desperate for positive feed back. I didn't go out and had no friends. Days would go by without me speaking to anyone besides my mom (who was going through a painful divorce). I was just so low. I did not honor my personal desires, I did not go after anything that brought me joy. Instead I simply kept my head down and just focused on getting an English degree because besides art it was the only subject in school that made sense to me.

When I enrolled in my current school pieces of my self hating personality were slowly slipping away but deep down I was still struggling with my self worth. It's only now I can see that I enrolled in grad school for the wrong reasons. It came from a place of fear because even though I had a bachelors degree, I still did not think I could get a job anywhere. I still had no sense of drive or confidence, and had convinced myself that my resume was not good enough with an English degree. Also my mom really wanted me to get my masters in something (education is very important to her). My decision to go back to school was extremely impulsive. I did not do any research. I did not know what I wanted curriculum wise. I did not ask any questions. I simply rolled with the first offer, and just focused on getting assignments done so I could get another degree. It all just sounded like a good idea and something I ""should"" be working towards.

At the beginning I enjoyed some of my classes, others made me feel nothing but because I know how to work and get things done I just kept going. At first I was just going to get a Masters but then when speaking to my counselor we decided it might be more beneficial for me to get an MFA. I now have no recollection of why we decided this. I only remember my mother being excited because their MFA programs involves internships somehow and the idea of me having and MFA and job connections made her very happy.

I can't tell if I want to learn what I am learning anymore. I do not know what I want to do career wise. I love working though and always saw myself in some kind of creative career. I just want to be done and at times I feel so trapped. I love art, and creative people but instead of being excited about my classes I often fantasize of going out to my local art classes and learning how to make my own art at my own pace outside of school. Can anyone relate? I also recently started a YouTube channel, the process of creating it has served as another escape outside of school.

On the bright side I have changed so so much since I started grad school. I am a completely different person. Im not afraid to put myself out there, Im not afraid to make mistakes outside of school. Im excited for my future and have so much hope and belief in myself.

Aside from this current burnout I am feeling so much guilt and regret on how I put myself in this situation. I hate how clumsy I was when going into to this thing (the MFA program). I can't quit, that's just not an option for me. Im in it, I don't love it, I feel nothing at this point but at the same time I still believe the work is important. Art in all its forms will always be important to me. Visual storytelling is still fascinating to me, but in this classroom setting I feel so devoid of joy. I want to make art, I practice daily and I want to do it more for myself. I say all this but like I said, the Mid Point Review is coming up and it feels like a heavy shadow. I have nightmares about failing and not being up to their standard whatever it may be. Is there any solace for situations like this? Any advice or personal stories is much appreciated. Thanks for letting me vent. Thank you for your time."

But yeah i do have intermediate or somewhere more expertise in it. My parents advised me to go abroad and do masters but I know they can't afford this. So i skipped that plan earlier i though working and enhancing my skills can earn me handsome salary in this field of Software engineering. But i was wrong i feel.  
Need your advice what should I do. Because time is running out quickly and I don't want to waste my efforts.

To give a bit of background I graduated last july 2020 with the ff:

Bachelor of Science in Accounting
Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology

The pandemic became worse as I was reviewing for the upcoming CPA board exams and I fully stopped reviewing as I could not focus anymore. 
I discovered crypto through a friend and it was fun but it did more harm than good for my life and career as I emerged with nothing. 

Right now I am being forced to take the CPA board exam for the second time (I failed the first time as I was depressed and could not bring myself to review anymore) and I believe I will fail again because I have not reviewed for it.
My parents don’t seem to understand my feelings and will just stand by their decisions.

Fast forward to right now I am currently 24 and unemployed. I have no prior working experiences except for my internship when I was in college. I believe that amounts to nothing as companies want real working experience.

Is there any hope for me? I am looking to break out of this depressing cycle by applying in an audit firm (SGV or PWC) and trying audit or tax work. Another option I am looking at is going in to a bank for work due to other opportunities.

It would mean a lot to me if you could recommend a career path I can take or give some advice on the career paths I have mentioned.

However, from what I see, most if not all of the local students here in engineering is doing an integrated masters or have plans to take a MSc in the future. Thus for me with a BEng, it will be harder to find a job as it makes sense for employers to hire someone with a higher qualification, however I do have 2 years NS exp and 3 months poly internship exp.

This is where the dilemma kicks in. If I were to do a Masters, and then still not find a job and go back to singapore, most employers would say that I am overqualified or something along the lines of that since most grads in sg don’t do postgrad studies. 

Anyone here could share their thoughts on this? Thanks."

To clarify, I believe I am not a ""bad"" software developer (3.9+ gpa and a  teaching assistant for my DSA course), but I do believe I neglected to  grind outside of school and I currently suffer from a weak resume due to a lack of internships/projects.

I just started an unpaid internship (yes I know its exploitative) at a  very early stage startup. This has been my experience so far:

\+ Full remote so there's no commute time

\- No onboarding (first task is to create a NextJS application with a upload feature)

\- Expected to work 40hrs a week

\-  Being lectured that I am working on company deliverables and not my hobby project (I used Mongodb Atlas instead of setting up a Docker container as suggested)

I can't tell if I'm just over-reacting or are there red flags here? I  have not signed a physical contract yet so I could technically quit  immediately. However, I'm concerned that it's harder to get the same  benefits/learning outcomes from self-learning vs an internship.

All that being said, I do have a few options in mind for summer:

1. Go through the internship (learn as much as I can).
2. Focus more on side-projects, attend hackathons.
3. Open source contributions. (I currently contribute to one but it's only trivial work like fixing minor bugs and integrating new linters etc.)
4. <your recommendations>     


Thanks all!"

However, I'm wondering what would be the best way to graduate debt-free while also working on projects to enhance my resume and gain practical knowledge for my career. Even if I receive scholarships that cover most of my tuition, I believe I would still need to work, possibly at a fast food place, to make some extra money on the side to pay for the living expenses.  However, the prospect of attending classes for around 8 hours a day, studying at night, working on side projects, and finding time to work during evenings or weekends seems highly unrealistic. Additionally, from what I've seen internships are highly prioritized in the CS field so if I want to get an internship over the summer I would not be able to work during the summer to pay off the living costs. When I calculated the approximate cost of living at some of the colleges it came out to be approximately $2,500 a month including every expense I could think of. So, anyone who has gone to college and has a degree in this field how were you able to pay off all your living expenses and tuition at the same time?"

It feels so rude and unprofessional. Idk what to say. This makes me lose motivation in doing these assignments as I feel like they'll not respond anyways. I don't mind joining a company with a little low tc in the beginning but they should ateast have a respected culture so I can have some learning and growth. Any advice and help will be really appreciated."
13bv17a,1,2023-05-08,What you guys consider when receive an propose?,louisebabs05,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13bv17a/what_you_guys_consider_when_receive_an_propose/,"Hey, recently i got an propose for a internship in other company differente workload but same benefits. I'm currently completing 1 year intership in a company and they wouldn't efetivated me, just hire for another year of intership. But when I talked about the 1 propose and said that i was going to quit the current company, they offered me the efetivation, saying that because i'm not graduated yet they were being exceptional to me by offering me that but they valued my work and stuff like that. 

Accepting the first offer i would continue as an intership in other place but learning others things, by staying i would receive way better and would have more responsaibility to make projects (which is something i like but haven't the opportunity to do so).  

What u guys would do in my place? I'm starting my career and it seems a hard decision to make right now."
13bw4w0,6,2023-05-08,Starting college this year - tips and tricks,Curious_Total6365,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/13bw4w0/starting_college_this_year_tips_and_tricks/,"Hello everyone. I'm going to be studying computer science and software development starting this year. Aside from attending lectures and doing all my assignments (which I won't have problems with), what side activities would you recommend doing while in college? My intention is to start preparing for internships/jobs on day 1.

For those of you who already graduated, what tips and tricks would you have for new students?
For those of you who interview graduates for jobs, what qualities are you looking for in a candidate? What will make a graduate candidate stand out when compared to other candidates?

For internships, what would a solid candidate have in their cv aside from good grades (assuming every student is on an equal grade level)?

On a side note, I'm already familiar with programming and I'm not going into this blindfolded. I have a good grasp of fundamentals so first and second semester shouldn't be a problem. I like solving problems on Leetcode and similar sites, but I'd consider myself still a beginner. I've been doing some side projects of my own. Nothing too complicated - things like calculator,  hangman game, blackjack, some 2D and 3D simple games. I don't have skills to create something more complicated yet.

I've heard of git, github and heard people recommend having it. Honestly, don't know exactly what it is for. Would you recommend making them and putting all projects on them as you go through years?

Basically,  what would you do if you went to college to study computer science again?"
13bwm4r,18,2023-05-08,How hard is it to get into US unis from Poly,Academic_Fail,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/13bwm4r/how_hard_is_it_to_get_into_us_unis_from_poly/,"I am a poly student looking to study CS at US or UK unis. Im targeting unis like Berkeley, Michigan, UIUC, Imperial and Cambridge.

I have a 1540 SAT Score (800 M, 740 R+W) and graduated with a diploma of merit with a 3.95 GPA in an IT course. I also have various math and physics olympiad awards from my sec school days (although those were a couple of years ago so I'm not sure if they'll still look at that). 

As for extracurriculars, I built my own website even before I joined Poly that I wanted to turn into a startup (The startup failed but I was able to use the website to get internship offers). I also worked on my final year project and various other projects in my poly course and have 5 months of internship experience as a software developer. My lecturers and internship supervisor have also given me glowing letters of recommendation.

This year, I registered for A levels as a private candidate for the following subjects: H2 Maths, H2 Econs, H2 Further Maths, H2 Physics and H1 GP. I am now spending my time studying for these exams and also learning machine learning on the side so that I can redo my startup idea but with AI this time.

Do I stand a chance at any of these schools with just my poly diploma? Are my extracurriculars good enough? If I managed to do well on my A-Levels would that significantly boost my application?

How much more competitive are these schools than say NUS or NTU CS?"

13bwtea,20,2023-05-08,California schools for OOS?,Wild-Heron,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13bwtea/california_schools_for_oos/,"I’m a parent helping my daughter out. She’s got a few years still, but I want to make sure she’s on track for the schools she wants. 

Daughter is interested in business/marketing/finance (maybe). Possibly interested in law or an MBA after undergrad. 

She plans to enter the IB program her junior year and will complete the diploma. She will take AP human geography and AP World history before entering IB. Obviously gpa and test scores are a large component, but essentially unknown at this time. So far she gets good grades, and the expectation has generally been that she maintain straight A’s. She has a private math tutor and will do sat/act boot camps. 

EC: on JV volleyball, speech and debate, plays guitar, member of art club. Looking for an opportunity for law or business summer internship, also considering one of the Hispanic leadership summer programs. 

I (her mother) am considered Hispanic (4th generation) so daughter is roughly 25% hispanic. I’ve always made sure to check that box on paperwork, but I know daughter feels slightly funny about it. 

One of the issues has to do with money. Her father and I are divorced. I earn roughly 60K, but her father earns over 250k and owns multiple homes so we are screwed on that front unless the school doesn’t require the NCP CSS application. She lives full time with me though. The divorce paperwork doesn’t specify college so we will likely be heading back into court over it. He will likely try to get out of paying anything more than in state tuition (WA state). I can’t afford to spend much on her college tuition, but will try to help her out as much as possible. I don’t want her taking out massive loans especially since she may want to get her MBA or go to law school. Unlike her father, I see the value in going to a very good school where she can make connections and network. He doesn’t value private or elite schools at all and only attended community college himself. All of this is to say she will likely require merit based financial aid. 

Daughter and I live in Nevada and both UNLV and UNR are absolute backup options. She really doesn’t want to go there. Her dream is to attend college in southern California. She prefers the climate. UW (Seattle,where her father lives) is another option but she’s not crazy about Seattle or the weather there. She’s not interested in other WA state schools. ASU is another one that is a given to apply to, not her first choice (too hot) but I think it’s better than UNLV/UNR. 

I don’t think it’s worth even bothering with any of the University of California schools (besides maybe UC Merced) since we are OOS. We might as well try USC, hopefully national merit finalist, we will see. Other private schools we plan to consider: Pepperdine, Thomas Aquinas, the Claremont colleges, Santa Clara. I would prefer her to attend a smaller private school with small class sizes, as her IB cohort will be fairly small. She hasn’t voiced an opinion on that though. 

**What are some other colleges to consider in California that offer merit based aid, have good business or pre-law programs (I guess more law school placement) and anything specific she should focus on for EC’s?**

I hope I’m not coming off as micro managing her or applying too much pressure. She’s a smart girl with loads of potential and I want to help her reach her goals. The district we live in is awful unless you navigate the special programs like IB. Without parental assistance she would be stuck in the gen ed classes and best case scenario would be UNR or something like Eastern Washington University. Neither of those are the worst things in the world but I know she wants more and is capable of getting of into a much better school. Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I’ve applied to hundreds and haven’t had a single offer. I’m smart but don’t have much experience coding. How hard will it be for me to find a job when i graduate and can i get an internship in the summer after graduating? I feel like there’s no hope for me. Im not sure what to do.
13bwyub,0,2023-05-08,"Graduating in a year, how to maximise opportunities",rbasi02,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13bwyub/graduating_in_a_year_how_to_maximise_opportunities/,"In a year from now I’ll be graduating with a Computer Science degree from a top 30 UK university. I should be on track to get a 1st in this degree (🤞). Additionally, I am doing a SWE internship at a top UK bank this summer. 

My goal is mainly to move to the US (NYC) for the higher salaries especially when compared to the UK. I would like to achieve this goal as soon as possible. 

However, I’m not sure the best way to go about achieving this. I don’t have the money to afford a masters in the US, which would probably be the easiest route. 

Should I: 

• Do a masters in the UK, then apply for jobs in the US 

• Try (and possibly fail) to get a scholarship that will help with affording a US masters

• Graduate then work for US companies with offices in the UK with hopes of getting a transfer

• Try intern in the US after my degree

• Something else? 

Thank you 👍"
13bxvhd,66,2023-05-08,CSE student not knowing basic stuff,FatSadBlob,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/13bxvhd/cse_student_not_knowing_basic_stuff/,"So I am a basic science student doing an internship at a premier scientific institution in India. My roommate at my accommodation is a CSE student(not first year) from one of the reputed NITs and has an AI/ML based project. 

She doesn't seem to know basic stuff like using google slides, clearing google drive, making ppt and knows rudimentary coding. She has been asking me to help with her project, basically trying to get me to do almost 50 percent of her work. While I kind of do computational work and know some coding, I don't have enough knowledge of ML. 

Also, I am not supposed to do her work because her guide will think that she is doing the work on her own and she will get a certificate on the completion of her project; so me or anyone else doing work is unethical (not to mention we have projects of our own that we have to finish within the same deadline). 

I am just curious to know(no, I am not throwing shade at any Institute) what is taught in CSE that she know even lesser coding and computer stuff than what basic science people do or how can't she figure out google slides and drive. 

Is the curriculum that old/not so useful or have an met an exception? 

Sorry if it comes across as a rant and I apologize for grammatical errors."

Since then I've applied to so many places but I haven't gotten past the first interview and I don't get it. The only thing I can think of that's holding me back is my degree. 

I'm an advanced Excel user with 4 years experience.I know pivot tables, vlookups, macros and most functions like the back of my hand. 

 I worked for a startup for 3 years during my degree, where I did all the financial projections, all the modeling, made sure all our fillings and internal documents were consistent with GAAP. I also have 2 unrelated internships. 

Ive constructed P&L statements from scratch, done the leg work on M&A, worked on valuation and discounted cash flows. All of this is on my resume so I don't understand why I keep being told I 'have no experience'. 

Am I simply being crossed off the list bc of my degree? If so, what the hell am I supposed to do? Are there any positions in finance where my degree isn't going to be an immediate red flag?"

I am trying to get my friend out of Russia to avoid him getting drafted once out of college. I hope he'll get an internship with an extended offer in the US or Europe and leave. Since I am in America and have experience getting internships here, I offered him help adapting his resume.

He studies CS at one of the top programs in Eastern Europe (St. Petersburg State University). While it would be dishonest to hide it, is it better to emphasize it, hoping that recruiters at tech companies recognize the name, or should I put it in some remote corner of the document, hoping that the HR reads everything else before they see that he's in Russia?

In other words, is being in a top-5 CS program in Russia a benefit or a disadvantage in getting an SWE internship for the upcoming recruiting cycle?

Again, thanks a lot in advance for your help!"
13c0ega,3,2023-05-08,Changing Major at the end of junior year,TrueElitist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13c0ega/changing_major_at_the_end_of_junior_year/,"Hi everyone, I'm posting here because I wanted to ask for advice on my current position.

I'm a third year mechanical engineering student at an UC school, and I've recently realized at the end of my spring term that I would rather pursue a career in software engineering rather than mechanical. I've done 3 internships (2 at notable EV companies), but I just do not enjoy the nature of the work. My background in programming comes primarily from USACO in my highschool years, and I managed to compete in gold. I've always been interested in computer architecture and back end development, and I believe CS would be a better fit for me.

Here are my current options:

1. Stick with mechanical engineering & finish the degree, hold onto a full time role as a mechanical engineer while I apply for masters in computer science (OMSCS @ Georgia Tech)
2. Change my major now to Math-CS (Cannot swap to pure CS because my school caps the major), graduate as a 5th year and apply to CS roles

Pros & Cons of 1:

Pros: 

1. Would have a stable income out of college
2. Can do OMSCS while working, not losing out on money
3. Learn CS at a graduate level

Cons:

1. Sunk Cost Fallacy: I'm scared that all my time and energy spent into developing a career into mechanical engineering would go to waste
2. Would take 2 years to complete the masters
3. I'm not sure how employers would view the pivot from mechanical to computer science

Pros & Cons of 2:

Pros:

1. Would graduate with a degree related to SWE
2. Can learn the foundations of CS in depth during undergrad
3. Can pursue graduate CS degrees at schools that restrict enrollment to BSCS

Cons:

1. 1 extra year
2. Would effectively throw away my mechanical engineering background
3. Job market is tough right now, I'm not sure if I'd be able to land internships / FT roles

Some advice would be appreciated, as I'm really stuck on what to do right now. Thank you!"

Because of this, I did renege my position a little later than most people would (2 weeks before start date). I sent a pretty basic email about how I had an unforeseen personal circumstance and apologized.

This seemed to be the end step for most people, but my recruiter emailed back to me about how disappointed she was, which is fair, and wanted to call before she let the team know. She mentioned things like delaying start date, so I think she wants to try to convince me to stay, except I have no intentions of attending that internship. I have a feeling that she will probably ask what my ""unforeseen personal circumstance"" is. I know that I probably shouldn't say that I have a better offer, but what would be the politest way to decline her over phone? Does anyone else have experience reneging over call?"

What should I do?,Plus-Estimate-6184,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13c5dit/i_feel_trapped_in_my_career_path_and_dont_know/,"I know it's a long read but I hope you people would spare a minute or two and help out a fellow redditor.

I (24M) am doing bachelors in Software Engineering from a reputable university in my country and currently in 7th (out of 8) semester which means I'd be graduating in less than a year. To provide some background context, I wasn't even interested in the field of I.T. to begin with, I was rather pressurised into choosing something that would be called an 'Engineering' field, by my father. I always proved to be outstanding in subjects related to sciences (especially zoology) in school and still have a keen interest in them to this day, so much so that I get hooked on anything from quantum physics to paleozoology.

I do struggle with mathematics, and trying to make way in an engineering field, mathematics did me the most damage. Long story short, not having grades good enough to get me in fields like electrical, mechanical, aeronautical or electronics engineering, I had to take up Software Engineering.

Now, even though I've gotten good grades all the way and have maintained a GPA of 2.9/4 up till now (as I was a sharp student since childhood), I always feel like I'm not cutout for this. Even grasping the very basics of programming and softwares seems hard to me at times. The thing that made me sure about this was I got a paid internship in a well-known software house in the start of March'23 (that would become a fulltime job when I graduate) and they require us to work and develop products using ASP.NET. I was really happy on such an accomplishment in the start but as time went by, I realised I really can't make myself do this. Programming/coding really seems like something I'm forcing myself to do and it's been a long battle of mixed thoughts so far. On one hand, I feel I'm really lucky to have been given such an opportunity at a time where people are struggling to find jobs and employment. On the other hand, I feel miserable that I've grown tired of it in just two months, how am I gonna do this for a few years let alone my whole life.

Among this turmoil of thoughts, I was exploring my options on what I can do. I took the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator Test too. But the thing is that so much time has passed by in all of this that even I'm not sure anymore what I want to do in my life. I'm really standing in pitch black darkness atm and have no idea what should I do, is career change even worth it, how much struggle needs to be put in at this point etc. What do I do? How can I identify what career would be best suited for me? If switching (at this point) is it even worth it or not?

Tl;dr: I was pressurised into taking Software Engineering by my father and my internship made me realise that programming is something I'm forcing myself to do, but can't decide what  career I want to pursue. Is career change even worth it? If yes, how can I identify what career to choose?"

Today I found out that the company uses their own internal programming language to make their services and told me I will be making bunch of testing softwares. I've never heard of any company use this language (useless and probs won't have any carry over benefits for my future internships) and am not even sure why they listed java/c as their requirements, let alone advertise the job opening as software dev if I'm pushing out test scripts.

I am a junior in college, but I have only 6 classes left before I graduate. Unfortunately, I don't have an internship over the summer, so I'll be working as a research intern in a CS lab at my university.

For the next 2 semesters, I have 6 extremely easy classes left before I graduate. I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who have taken the classes, and I'm pretty confident that I can pass the classes by putting in very little work (maybe just 1 day out of the week). At this point, I don't really care about my GPA, which does not even matter in my opinion for CS degrees. I have a pretty high GPA(4.0/4.0), so I don't need to care about my classes as long as I pass.

My question is, if you were in my situation, how would you spend the year? I have a couple of projects I want to do, hopefully, have a paper out from the research work, and start looking for a job, but is there something specific that I should be doing ?"

Because of this, although I spent a lot of time teaching these kids, I didn’t get to do all of the things I wanted to and wasn’t sure if I had really made an impact at all. 

On Friday when I walked into the classroom, there was an envelope on my desk with cards from each class period where all my kids signed their names and wrote thank-you messages. A bunch of them brought me flowers and gifts (which I wasn’t expecting at all). After the school day ended I had a stream of them coming back in to give me hugs/tell me goodbye and that I would be the “best teacher ever.” A lot of them were students I would not have expected this from (I just didn’t think I made that much of an impression). It felt so special to me to know that I made a difference for them or made them feel seen in some way.

I am an international grad student studying CompSci(MSCS) in a US university. 

I have 25 months of professional full stack software engineering experience that I gained after my undergraduate degree back in India. I worked in two startups - one was a small one (now it's decent) but second one was and is one of the biggest startups in India. I also built numberous personal project for 9 months after quitting my first job. 


## Scene

I tried getting an internship but I think I was probably a little late in my internship applications (was adjusting to a new country).

At this point I have multiple professors who are ready to take me as a researcher in their lab during the summer. I will be paid.

My question is should I still keep searching for an internship or should I just work under a prof during the summer. 


## Argument against internship:

With my search paused I thought I could put my focus on one thing. I also won't have to relocate and I am anyways paying the rent here till the start of fall term. Additionally I could practice leetcode more rigorously because I would have more time than if I were interning. If the professor is happy s/he could also give me an RAship that would reduce my tuition for the next year and recommend me if required. Even if I apply to internships right now, none of the big companies are searching, their search is complete. So in my opinion I will end up in a mediocre company fetching coffee.

## Argument in favour of internship:
My peers say that I don't have ""US Work experience"" so it's better to get an US internship. 
The internship will likely pay more.

My final goal is to work in the industry (preferably Big Tech)."

\------- 

Started off by being taken into a room where the recruitment manager told us the plan for the day: group assessment, tour, interview, networking.

The group assessment we were watched by several people over the course of an hour. We were given a sheet of paper that gave us the case, and we had to come up with strategies on how to tackle the case. During the hour we had to also draw up the slides on paper with markers and present it to one of the staff there. While our team was working together, I saw they had pieces of paper with all of our team members, and they started annotating notes down.

After we presented, we then got seated into a ball room they had in the office. While waiting, we had groups going on office tours, while the rest waited for their turn for an interview with one of the staff. 

After waiting around 45 minutes, it was my turn to have an interview with one of the directors at the firm. The first question he asked was “why do you want to join KPMG?”.  
This was followed by the interview going over my code for the coding assessment project I previously had to do. He noted that I did the optional additional stuff, and asked me how I coded my project and why I did it that way. 

After going through my code he continued with the general questions such as, when was a time I had a disagreement in a team? I gave him my example that me and another developer came to a disagreement with the output of my code, and how I was ultimately in the wrong, where I then compromised to meet in the middle. The interview then asked why I coded that specific way, which I answered. 

He then asked me “What makes a good developer?”, and “What are your future ambitions in terms of a career?”. Last but not least, he asked me if I had any additional questions, in which I asked him a couple questions.

At this point interview sessions were finished, so we both stood up and headed out to a networking event that was after the interview sessions, where we got free food and drinks and was able to network with the staff at lighthouse. This went on for an hour, until they had to go back to work, and all applicants at the assessment centre went home.

Generally, the advice I've gotten is to make up for that using ECs and research and whatever. I'm looking for some more specific advice. 

I'm hoping to go for Poli Sci or something related, so I'm not sure how research or working with a professor would fit into that.

As far as ECs go, what are the kinds of ECs I should be looking for? I'm captain of my school's debate team and I am a good debater(national level). Is this something that I should focus on? is competitive success in debate actually valuable for college apps?

I'm currently looking for internships for local politicians and other things of that nature. are these important? how would you decide what internships to go for?

&#x200B;

I know I've asked a fair number of questions, but the last pressing thing would be the importance of the stereotypical ECs. Are things like founding or leading clubs, starting non-profits or making a business necessary/valuable?

I am a junior in college, but I have only 6 classes left before I graduate. Unfortunately, I don't have an internship over the summer, so I'll be working as a research intern in a CS lab at my university.

For the next 2 semesters, I have 6 extremely easy classes left before I graduate. I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who have taken the classes, and I'm pretty confident that I can pass the classes by putting in very little work (maybe just 1 day out of the week). At this point, I don't really care about my GPA, which does not even matter in my opinion for CS degrees. I have a pretty high GPA(4.0/4.0), so I don't need to care about my classes as long as I pass.

My question is, if you were in my situation, how would you spend the year? I have a couple of projects I want to do, hopefully, have a paper out from the research work, and start looking for a job, but is there something specific that I should be doing?"

Stopped applying for full-time jobs. Committed to build a startup soon. Considering working part-time, freelance or side-jobs. Looking for advice from people who did something similar.

&#x200B;

I’m about to graduate college from a prestigious(ish) University with a really good CS program. My GPA is not great but also not bad (just above 3.1). I have some internship experience as a SWE and my resume looks decent (experience, leadership, clubs, languages, etc).

Couple months ago, while on hiring season, I stopped sending job applications after I had a shower-conversation with myself and realized that I was just doing what society induced me to: apply to as many jobs, be active on LinkedIn, memorize all of leetcode, hack the interview, land a high paying job, escalate the ladder, get promoted, ..., you get it. The reality is that I was not thinking clearly and critically about what I wanted for myself, and who I wanted myself to become. So I made the important decision to not follow a conventional career anymore, which means I stopped applying to jobs, and gave myself a rest from draining interview prep.

I made this decision based on several factors:

1. Personal beliefs/goals. I don't buy the idea of working hard now, then retire and be happy later. I rather just work on what makes me happy forever... I'm also not willing to work for a company that does more harm than good, or doesn't treat equally their workers. I don't want a BS job ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit\_Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs)). And I want to be able to see the fruits of my work.
2. The current hiring freezes and layoffs in big tech are just scary, and show how rapid the industry changes. AI is most likely going to exacerbate the problems. Job security is not anymore a thing in big tech.
3. I just hate, with passion, going to the process of getting hired. It's so standardized that recruiters quite literally just fill out an HR document. Interview questions are just a way to filter out people and are not a good indicator of job-related skills. Also, getting rejected hundreds of times can be demoralizing.

I want to become an entrepreneur in the intersection between Agriculture and Computer Science, and I already have an idea. While I understand that dedicating so much of my life to such project is extremely risky in terms of my professional career and financials, I have to say that I'm deeply invested into the idea and the direction it will take me.

The thing is that I still need to pay my bills, so the plan is to find a part-time job (most likely a type of freelance) that gives me the flexibility that I need to work on my startup. So my question is: What are some of the best alternative careers I should consider for a part-time/side-job? Think about it as side quest on a videogame lol. E.g. freelancing, web-dev, mobile, etc. I'd like to receive some career advice from some of you that found success following a non-conventional CS career."

Basically I am not a jealous person and I always knew he watched porn. However did this never bother me, because I was always convinced he thought I was the prettiest girl ever and that even in a room full of girls he would still pick me. Soooo stupid I know, but he always made me feel so confident and beautiful. I also thought he would watch porn sometimes, like a few times a month and that he would just watch random videos of random girls.

A few months ago I downloaded Telegram for my internship and guess who was on there as wel...... my bf.

I know it's 'wrong' but I wondered why he was on there because I have never seen the app on his phone before. I went in his recently downloaded apps and I found out he uses reddit, telegram, discord, twitch, twitter EVERYDAY to watch OF girls.

I am not kidding, literally EVERYDAY, since i have seen how many times he has logged in.

We see each other everyday and we have s\*x almost everyday and I always do everything he wants so I don't understand why he redownloaded all those apps EVERYDAY.

He also always searched the same 3 girls (for over 2 years he had been looking them up). This is what broke me the most.

We have talked a lot about it and basically he told me i am a 'pretty' girl and they are more 'hot'. This really broke me, because I am trying so so hard to look good and to look sexy for him.

He also says he was just looking them up, because he was curious and that he was never jerking off to them. I find this hard to believe, because if your just curious, you will just look it up 1 time, not everyday for over 2 years.

It really makes me feel like I have been living a lie for the last 2 years of my relationship. I was so in love with him and while I was thinking about just him everyday, he was lusting after other women, who are 'hotter' than me.

My BF tells me I am making this into a bigger deal than it actually is, and that it was never a big deal to him and that he doesn't even care about them.

My question to all the men out there; do you think he is telling the truth and that he was just bored and looked them up without thinking or do you think they are what he really wants and he is just 'okay' with me?

And also, do you think he was thinking about those 3 girls everyday, because he did look them up everyday..... and now that he had deleted the apps, do you guys think that he is still thinking about them or do you think that he misses watching those girls?

I feel like I am actually going crazy, because I am thinking about this situation 24/7 and I am comparing myself to them constantly to see what I can do to make myself look as hot as them.

I was a very confident girl before all this and I just feel totally broken and I think I wil never get over this.

&#x200B;

EDIT: We have had multiple conversations and he said, he can not promise me to stop watching porn, but he won't look up  OF anymore. I don't know if I believe the last part and I am still scared he is still watching them or thinking about them everyday... I also just feel horrible about my body because I will never look like the girls he has watched

&#x200B;

And I also think its fine for him to just watch porn on pornhub, but it just really broke my heart that he has been watching the same 3 girls doing sexual activities for over 2 years and went through a lot of time everyday to redownload all those apps and look them up. I just keep comparing myself to them."

At this point, I'm not sure exactly how to progress to maximize my odds for full-time recruiting, so I wanted to ask for any advice from those of you who have gone down the same path, either for internships or new grad recruiting:

\- I currently switch between Python and C++ when doing LC questions, but I don't really know either with much nuance past what is needed for LC-style programming. I've heard there are many more job postings for C++ devs compared to Python, especially when it comes to quant SWE - is this true, and does the increased difficulty due to being asked C++ trivia make the switch worth it? If so, what's the recommended path for being ready to answer esoteric language questions?

\- What level of OS knowledge is necessary for these positions? I did well in my sophomore-year OS class and I've been reviewing my notes + the textbook we used for that class to round out my knowledge - do I need to go more advanced than that?

\- Are system design interviews common for new grads in these positions?

\- Is there anything else I should be doing for the next few months to be ready for new grad recruiting?

Thank you all for your help!

EDIT: To clarify, I'm aware that some unicorns have a hiring bar equal to or lower than FAANG - I'm more so referring to the subset of 'elite' unicorns that have a higher hiring bar and higher compensation. Generally speaking, I'm trying to see what the next step is in terms of goals and preparation after having completed FAANG internships."

I would like to ask some questions about Machine Learning Professional Certification provided by GCP or AWS or Azure. 

About myself, I’m a foreigner living in France for almost 5 years. 2 first years were for studying in a double degree program in French and in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. However, in the last academic year, I went to IT major  and I decided to change my career into the AI domain by taking Coursera online courses (Deep learning, Machine learning specializations). Luckily, these courses helped me to find an end-of-study internship in a start-up and after that I was kept on permanent contract as R&D AI Engineer (Computer Vision) and I’ve been working there for almost 3 years. 

Currently, I desire to change to ML/MLOps Engineer and I’ve applied for many open jobs but I received only rejection. I see the reason is that I’m working mainly with Deep Learning models for Computer Vision (model: research, training, optimization) and I don’t have strong exp in software engineering or DevOps. Therefore, I intend to take a ML Engineer certification to strengthen my profile. I would appreciate very much to have advice from our group:

* Does it really add value to my profile if I could obtain this kind of certification to take in the ML/MLOps career?
* Which certification provider that I’d rather take (GCP or AWS or Azure)? 
* Apart from certification, are there other practical ways to obtain exp in MLOps Engineering?

I (36m) began my self taught journey about 1 year ago after spending 2 decades in the arts. I had been looking to leave the arts world for several years just trudging through until I found something that felt like a good fit for me. Then my wife suggested I try learning computer code. I knew absolutely nothing about computers, and was not technically savvy at all. But I figured sure I'll give it a shot. 
I started with beginner python, tried a few different free platforms (freecodecamp, udemy, codecademy). I liked how codecademy broke down the info so I landed there. Built a few small things and I loved it. I'm pretty detail oriented, methodical, and never happier than when I can zone into a project and grind. I felt, and still do feel, like I've found something I can really transition into. I purchased codecademy pro, and set a 1 to 2 year timeline for myself, studying casually 1 to 2 hours a day every day.
Having no idea about the difference between all job titles I elected to do a general computer science path figuring it would get me some knowledge I could use no matter what direction I specialize in. I loved that course, did a lot more python, basic data structures and algorithms, databases and SQL, binary and computer architecture, and discrete mathematics.

After I finished that path I tinkered around with data analytics courses. I was feeling insecure about not having any kind of STEM background, so I jumped ship and started a backend web dev path. I learned basic front end HTML and CSS. I learned a lot of javascript, which I actually loved. Built some interactive front ends for random stupid ideas, from scratch. I'm currently working on learning express routes, GET/POST/PUT/ DELETE requests, and maintaining DRY code. All in all I feel great about the knowledge I've acquired, I've learned so much about software, programming, and how the internet/websites work. There is still so much more to learn, and fields of study I haven't even seen yet. But overall I feel like my timeline isn't being over ambitious. 

Reflections: 

1- pick a language and get at least an intermediate understanding of it. This will help you so much as many concepts are shared across all languages but you need conceptual knowledge not just syntax hence an intermediate level of understanding. For me it was python which made javascript a breeze and even helped with HTML despite HTML being  declarative language.

2- don't be afraid to repeat courses especially hard ones. 
I've done beginner python 3 times now and I picked up a lot the second time through. The third time wasn't as helpful so 3 may be overkill but 2 is great. Especially for hard concepts like recursion and DSA.

3- don't rush. I can't wait to quit my current job but rushing this kind of thing leaves big holes in your knowledge base that will need to be filled later.

4- get into a routine. Every night after I put my daughter to bed I code while my wife watches reality TV. It's a win win, she gets to watch milf manor and I get time to code and don't have to feel my brain cells committing suicide while watching that stuff.

Next steps: after I finish this current path, I plan build some basic proof of concept websites, as a full-stack web dev. Using those I might start looking at jobs and what other skills I need to add to my resume to be more employable. But this is where I'm open to suggestions, I'm not married to web dev it just seemed like the best starting point. I'm also considering other platforms to now that I actually have a knowledge base to build from, again open to suggestions as to which ones. Bootcamps are not feasible for me at the moment. Then there are internships programs and such... it's a lot to navigate and could use some reddit hivemind help in planning these next steps. 

Thank you to everyone on this subreddit one of the most positive places on reddit.

English Language and Global Perspective teacher (9/10) She was my class teacher for two years and taught me two classes. I had a lead role in the school play that she directed when I was in 9th grade so she knew me from that. She definitely had a very high opinion of me. One of my favorite teachers in high school. I knew I was going to ask her for a recommendation and I logged in 10 minutes early to every class during covid to talk to her. 

Economics teacher (9.5/10) 

She taught me in my junior year and left halfway through my senior year. I also logged into every class early to create a better connect with her. I talked to her a lot outside of class and was very helpful during online class. I participated and was a top student. My whole class knew she loved me. 

\*\*Interviews\*\*

I’d say 9/10. My interviewee had graduated in 21 and we got along really well. It went on for over an hour and he even got up to use the bathroom after 40 mins? There was an emphasis on my personality instead of extracurriculars. It’s not what I had prepared for or expected but I felt really good afterwards. I tried to show why Duke was a really good fit for me. 

I did interviews for Haverford, cwru, weslyan, washu and maybe 1-2 more before I had applied because they give you the option to. It was good practice tbh 

\*\*Essays\*\*

I procrastinated so much. I restarted my whole common app essay on October 27th. I had written 5-6 drafts beforehand but I didn’t love it. I chose a new topic which was talking about my leadership role on 4 sports teams. I was the captain of all four and focused on playing with all sorts of different people. I also tied in living in india and the struggles of being American Taiwanese and sticking out. Played the diversity card and talked about how it has shaped me.

As context I am in my 4th year of computer engineering right now and I was hoping to land a summer internship this summer, however, I couldn't land one. I have a total of 1 year of soft dev experience (4 month internship + 6 month part time volunteering). I had a lot of OAs coming in from pretty big companies, but I wasn't very confident with my technical skills as I did no leetcode practice.

As I have a lot of free time during these four months (summer term) and intend to graduate in April 2024, I want to make the most of my time and improve my skills to increase my chances of getting a full-time job after graduation. During my university experience, I realized that I haven't done enough learning outside of my course material, which has left me feeling unprepared to compete in the current job market for new grad and full-time jobs. Therefore, I aim to engage in self-learning in software development this summer and explore various fields to determine my interests.

Throughout my university experience, I feel I haven't done enough of learning outside of university courses for me to be able to qualify and compete with the current market for new grad and full time jobs. Thus, with the free time I have this summer, I want to do a lot of self learning in the field of software development and also get a specific idea onto what I want to do in the future (what kind of software development? Which area sparks my interest?)

Since I never gave myself the time to work on leetcode which I now see how important it is, I am planning to give myself time to become really good at it by the end of August, so that I am prepared for any technical interview when applying to full time. I also plan on doing hackathons, which will help me get a good idea on what sparks my interest.

Would you guys have any other tips or plan of action that would help me plan out these next 4 months so I know what to focus on? As I really want to get more into the field of software development which I feel I haven't really gotten through my last experiences.

Is there any other things I can do with the free time I have this summer that can help me be prepared when applying to full time jobs?

Thanks!"

\- Differential Equations: A-

\- Probability Theory: A-

\- Statistical Inference: A

\- Machine Learning: A

\- Numerical Analysis: B-

\- Discrete Mathematics: B

\- Advanced Linear Algebra: C+

\- Graduate Regression Analysis: B-

\- Python for Mathematical Computing: C+

To take:

\- Abstract Algebra I & II, Complex Analysis, Statistical Computing, Experimental Design, Real Analysis, Fourier Analysis, and Game Theory.

I have not taken the GRE or Math GRE; will do so when the time comes. I'd of course love to get into HYPSM or at that level, but realistically I'm looking at schools like Stony Brook, Rutgers, BU,  Penn State, UNC, etc (not to say that these schools are easy to get into, but my chances are considerably better).

To make it somewhat non-identifiable, I work for a hospital system, in their patient satisfaction department. I’ve worked here just under 5 years, and moved departments twice before landing here for the last year or so. Before working here I had other “unskilled” healthcare jobs (nurse’s aid, home check in aid, etc) in other companies. I also have my bachelor’s degree in a STEM field, with about 2 years of laboratory experience relating to that field. I live in a medium-small sized Midwest city. If I’m missing anything you may need to help advise me, please let me know.

Now for the issue.

I currently make the most money, and have the best benefits, I’ve ever had in my working career. I make about $57k a year and  the workload I do is significantly easier than most other jobs I’ve had (the lab work turned out to be lots of heavy lifting and things I found physically hard to do. I’m talking 10,000+ steps per day. And nurse aid was physically moving and lifting adults, housework, etc). I usually actually do things considered work 3-4 hours of the day. It would be a great job if it weren’t for my boss, and their boss. We’ll call my direct manager A, the other manager in the department B, and their manager above the two of them is C. A is a BRAND NEW MANAGER. As in, went to school, graduated, did an internship here at the hospital, and immediately became our manager. We had another manager who was going to be A’s mentor, a fantastic person who everyone says is the best manager they’ve ever worked for. They left a few months into me working here, and in fact A never actually worked directly under this fantastic manager at all. They relied on B to help them manage until C came along.

Before C was here, A and the people they manage (me and my coworkers Y and Z) had some serious communication issues. A wanted weekly touch base meetings of over an hour with each of their subordinates, which were repetitive and not helpful at all. A told my peers that the 3 of us were not allowed to talk to each other, A accused us of gossiping about them behind their back, and of other things like lying. We have been working with HR to work through those problems and A had legitimately gotten better over the course of last summer.

C was made to be B and A’s manager and everything turned right back around south. C lies to HR, C singles out people in public and degrades them, C has gone so far as to demand C is included in personal texts between myself, Y and Z, and the other coworkers in the office managed by B. Things like recipes for lunches we bring, pictures of kids/pets/etc, and checking we get home safe in bad weather. Since C was hired, A has back slid. We can’t get a straight answer about expectations, I was nearly denied time off for a funeral in January, and we are constantly being micromanaged. We can’t even complete our tasks without C’s administrative assistant being sent to check in on us.

HR has even recently warned us that, due to the investigation into C and A’s behavior, we should expect retaliation and to report it if we see it. And so far both Y and I have both had something that could be considered retaliation happen. We’ve reported it of course but it’s been months of no movement from HR, and I don’t know if I can stay in this environment much longer.

So my dilemma is this. I’ve come to rely on this new salary, and my benefits. My partner and I are trying to have a child, and both options terrify me. I could stay and have this stress looming over me, and risk retaliation from my manager or their manager. Or I could attempt to find a new job and leave. I would not have the option of FMLA time until I’d been at my new place for a year and I would risk not being able to take as much time with a potential future child. There is also no guarantee that with my limited skills and experience that I could find a position that pays what I would like it to pay.

13d6ddh,16,2023-05-09,Should I stick with CS,inigoMontoya65,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13d6ddh/should_i_stick_with_cs/,"Hi, I am a current sophomore. I am about double majoring in mathematics and computer science.   
I always had an interest in mathematics, so I started off with that as my major; however, big reason why I wanted to major in CS as well is because it felt more down to earth and focused on solving more tangible problems compared to math at higher levels (in my opinion and limited observations). I took a chance on it and started taking computer science courses at the beginning of my sophomore year. And I just went through CS61b. I have all the classes I need to declare  
However, the reason I now feel very unsure is because of a final I just had in CS61b. I am pretty sure I got a lower score on that despite spending hours preparing and keeping up with the class for the semester.  
Here is a bit of a rant on why I do not think I should declare:

1. Based on my performance so far, I feel like I am simply just not good enough to be a part of the CS program at Berkeley. The tests are meant to let students show their skills with problem solving in programming and reflect their deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I just showed that I am not up to that standard. This is not one-off fluke as something similar happened with the second midterm. I simply just do not feel adequate enough to guarantee success in the program especially as I already have a chip on my shoulder with joining the major later than the usual student and not originally intending to be CS.
2. I have seen how strained the CS department is and how hard it is to be part of the program for those intending to join. If I end up joining as CS, I feel like I would exhaust a lot of resources from the college, and it may not even be enough to help me succeed. I know the issues about how the classrooms have limited seats due to their stress in supporting all the students and how a lot of the professors/course staff and not being paid enough for the effort they put in.
3. The CS major is very powerful, but I do not feel like I have much of a future in it. So, I have not been able to get any internships for software engineering nor have any clubs ever expressed any bit of interest in wanting me to be part of them despite already trying 3 times. Academics was one of the few things I had going for most of this year, but recently even that has slipped away in this field. I think what would be most optimal is if those with a CS degree can all make the most out its great potential. I do not really think that would be me. There are a very limited amount of CS degrees that can be given during graduation so far, therefore, I would rather have someone actually deserving of this degree to be able to wield it. Honestly, I kinda suck, this degree might just be too good for me.

Here are some reasons why I am still holding on:

1. I may never get access to certain classes in the computer science program that I am really interested in like the CS 160 series. I want to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes in my computer and have a little bit more confidence and practice with being able to work with the backend of the systems.
2. The computer science degree is still very employable, and hopefully having it will help me get in the door after I graduate.
3. I still have a strong interest in software engineering, and I think getting the degree and doing the requirements and projects is one of the solid ways to get there.

Please let me know what your insights are as I look forward to hearing from your insight. Thank you and feel free to let me know if you need any more information/clarifications"
13d6dmj,19,2023-05-09,"I want to be in academia, but I didn't learn how until way too late. Am I screwed?",miniZuben,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/13d6dmj/i_want_to_be_in_academia_but_i_didnt_learn_how/,"Apologies in advance for the long post, but thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it. I feel a bit desperate here.

It took me until after finishing my grad program to realize that I made some critical mistakes because I did not know what I was doing. I was a first generation college student in engineering. **Nobody in my family went to college and nobody I know has gone to grad school for a STEM degree.** Anybody who went on to grad school from my undergrad went into an MBA program, which is admirable but nothing like the path I hoped to take. I didn't have access to advisors or career counseling. I wanted to get into research but I didn't - and still don't - know how. 

I've realized now that there were lots of things I should have done differently:

1. I should have been better prepared for what it would take to get into a career in physics
2. I should have applied for PhD programs, not masters
3. I should *not* have earned my masters degree entirely online during COVID
4. I should have prioritized getting internships instead of taking summer classes

So now I am nearly 30 years old, stuck in the same jobs I had before going to grad school, and have no idea how to get out. I feel really stupid looking at all the jobs that sound so interesting asking for a PhD, years of research experience, publications, etc, and I have none of that. What I *do* have is a resume that's chock full of job experience that I didn't want in the first place and doesn't seem to translate well based on the *hundreds* of job applications I've been rejected from.

With all that background, can anyone give advice on how to break into an academic/research setting without already having research experience? Is it possible without going back for yet another degree? Financially that doesn't make sense anymore because I now have even more student debt, plus living expenses are drastically increasing and a graduate stipend is not enough to provide for my family. I just don't want to be miserable for the rest of my career. 

Thanks again to anyone who made it all the way through, and to anyone who can give me some guidance."

I know most people say to start early, I'm still in the early/mid stages of grinding leetcode but I'm ready to turn the heat up on that and review OOP and System/SW design to start this process though to get the best position possible if that selectivity is available to me.

I've heard that it would be better to start interviewing at lesser preferred companies first if possible, and then interviewing somewhere you may prefer more later on so that you can get into the rhythm of interviewing as much as possible. Not sure if this is a valid approach in this economy or in general, but it never hurts to ask here.

Lastly, have cover letters helped any of you get a job? I would rather not create one for each company but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to set me apart if that is something worth doing.

What I'm more worried about is 2nd year summer PEY and getting jobs in general. My CGPA is kinda bad, but it's pretty much the average for this year, 2.55. A lot of my marks were unfortunately just on the cusp of the next grade point, my numerical average is a 71%.

Oberlin and Case having upper hands over each other for different factors are causing the confusion. The financial aid packages are very similar and so finance is not a deciding factor here.

My intended major is Computer Science. Although I have no plans for double major, my target has always been to get a well-rounded education (which I think I will get at both places). I plan to at least pursue a Master's on CS (not sure about PhD for now). That is why the college that would help me more to get into a top grad school is also what I am looking into. I have immense interest in working in managerial positions in tech giants. 

The confusion rises because Oberlin reportedly has stronger CS faculty and so the teaching and personal attention would be better at Oberlin. On the other hand, Case being a research university, seems to have more funding for research and ""maybe better"" research opportunities (top notch research for bioscience, really cannot say about CS, so looking forward to comments). For internship and career prospects in CS, I seriously cannot compare between Oberlin & Case. 

Being an international student, I cannot visit both campuses and try to catch the vibe. Please help me decide."

For context, I'm a Junior college student studying CIS and I live on the west coast. I've had two part-time internships within the last year: my previous one as an IT Technician Intern at an MSP, and my current one as an IT Support Intern at a manufacturing company. Both roles were a mix of help desk and desktop support responsibilities because they were at small companies. I am interested in becoming a Systems or Network Admin eventually, but I understand that it will take effort and I am not looking for shortcuts.

I lurk on this subreddit as well as r/sysadmin pretty frequently, and a common tip that people give to students is to get internships ""above support."" I am nervous because I've only had internships at the support level.

On job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn, I find it rare to see an internship above support. If I do see one, it is extremely competitive at a big company, with hundreds of applicants.

How do I better optimize my search for internships above support? What skills should I brush up on so I have the qualifications for these internships? Worst case scenario and I don't find an internship above support before I graduate, is support experience still valuable?

Thank you all!"

While I am thrilled to have these options, I am having trouble deciding which school to attend.
I would like to consider a few factors before making my decision. Firstly, proximity is important to me as a California in-state student. Therefore, attending a school in state would be preferred if possible.

Secondly, I am interested in pursuing a degree in either Computer Science or Data Science and want to ensure that the school I choose has a strong program in these fields. If anyone has personal experiences with the quality of the programs at any of these schools, I would appreciate hearing your insights.

Thirdly, I am curious about how easy it is to switch into Computer Science or Data Science majors at each school. I may want to make a change later on, so this is an important factor for me to consider.
Fourthly, while prestige is not the most important factor for me, I would like to take it into consideration. I am interested in understanding the reputation of each school, and how this may impact my career prospects in the future.

Finally, I am also keen to learn about job opportunities and internships available to students at each institution. If anyone has information on this or personal experiences to share, I would be grateful.

We had known each other long before that as our parents worked together and by all accounts he was a great guy. He acted like a real gentleman to me and we had a lot in common. Once we started dating red flags started to show. It got to the point where my therapist was telling me that she was worried about me staying in the relationship so I ended things a couple weeks before our first semester ended. He didn’t take the break up well but he was codependent so I expected as much.

After about 4 weeks, I heard he was in the hospital. I messaged him telling him I hope he feels better and I understand if I’m the last person he would want to hear from. He messaged back saying he was happy to hear from me as he felt very alone at the time. I started to get the feeling that we could probably still be friends but then, like a switch, he started acting crazy. He was saying he would kill himself and I was to blame. I ended up letting his parents know to keep an eye on him and it took a toll on me. I stoped messaging him again and ignored his attempts to reach out. It got to the point where he was calling me 30 times with in a 10 minute window. I blocked him but he would call my sister asking for me. She blocked him too and things calmed down before our second semester started. 

Things went smoothly overall and I was thinking that I would just ignore him for the rest of my time in college but I ended up getting close with one of his friends. His friend ended up developing a crush but we decided to stay friends. My ex told his friend that he was happy so long as everyone else was but I still felt like he would get hurt. I ended up learning that my ex was still gaslighting the people around him and he often threatened suicide. His friend had told me he had lost someone to suicide before and the things my ex was pulling was scaring him. I told him that he should let police or his parents know if you think it was at that level so he did. Not long after my ex started threatening his friend and I felt hostility towards me too though he couldn’t it send me direct messages. 

I though I could ignore it all and he would calm down. Three weeks ago he ended up watching me at work as I talked with my boss. After I got off work he followed me home before driving off. I told everyone around me and started being safer on campus. I made a promise that if he did it again I would make a report. One week later he did something similar so I made the report. Nothing else has happened with me since but his now ex friend has had a few encounters and a few more threats. 

Since me and my ex both have internships for the University over the summer the University is involved. There is already an investigation going on with the police but the University is asking if they should run one too so I can be safe on campus. I am being told by friends I’m crazy for not wanting that. I knew him for a long time and I have convinced myself he is going through something rough right now and he will calm down eventually. A lot of people have told me that he would do nothing to hurt me even if he does give off that appearance. I really don’t know if I should push for the investigation or give him some space. I know there can be a lot of consequences from this and I don’t want his life to get ruined if it doesn’t have to be. Any advice?"

13dbc4v,3,2023-05-09,I’m burned out and need change. Where do I go from here?,Raging_Moon,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13dbc4v/im_burned_out_and_need_change_where_do_i_go_from/,"I graduated in late 2019 from a well known local university with a bachelors in exercise science (emphasis on health/fitness). Prior to graduation I landed my #1 choice internship at a corporate wellness company. I worked there part time and part time at a local gym as well. The corporate wellness company did a lot of downsizing due to Covid and my position was eliminated in late 2020. I started a full time salaried position in January 2021 as a service/rental technician at 40k although the job description was for 50k. About 1.5 years ago we lost a sales rep and two technicians in my department and no replacements have been found yet (My company is very small (<10). We have 3 partners in my company who are all heads of departments (sales/service/accounting). My supervisor (service/rental manager) has now transitioned into a sales support role and I manage the rental and service department with the help of 1 part time technician. I feel like I have all the responsibilities, but not the authority to make change. My current daily workload has at least doubled from a year ago when I already felt proficient in my role. At this point I’ve been extremely frustrated and taken advantage of. After over 2 years at the company, I asked for the 50k about 6 months ago and was given the excuse that it was more for someone who was knowledgeable in the field and had management experience, although they gave me nothing but praise for the job I was already doing. They countered at 44k, which I am still at. 

Side Note: I had an undiagnosed syncope episode March of 2022 and was hospitalized for a few days, eventually having a heart monitor implanted. My company helped to pay my deductible, but has never given me a raise or inflation adjustment without asking for it. I’ve changed many aspects of my lifestyle since but I had another episode in March of 2023 that could be due to the stress. Unfortunately I’ve had to make the decision to not continue monitoring due to the monthly cost. I’m extremely stressed in the position I’m in and don’t want to have to put my financial needs before my health."

13dbs5v,1,2023-05-09,This past month has been a LOT,Aninx,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/13dbs5v/this_past_month_has_been_a_lot/,"I know this post is probably going to sound a bit like a humble brag, but it's really not.

A lot has been going ""well"" for me this semester. Great even! I mean, there's been the usual tough assignments and whatnot, but academically, socially, mentally, and professionally things have been great! I've got good grades this semester even though I've been incredibly busy, I've come out of my shell at last and made some more friends, I've done better with coping with depression and anxiety, and I have been getting really good at making resumes and writing cover letters.

This past month things have kinda spiked in that mess. One of my friends confessed(they kinda told me to read the confession and respond whenever I had the mental energy because they knew I had a lot going on(which was really nice of them)) and honestly I'm not sure I have any kind of time or energy for a relationship right now regardless of my feelings(which is a whole 'nother can of worms) but they're still a great friend and I want to stay friends with them; I got an internship I've been working really hard to get which is having me do all the usual pre-employment stuff this week during finals week because I start Monday next week; and it's also finals week and I have both finals and projects due for my classes, for some classes both.

It's all a lot of really good things but I'm just exhausted all the time, and it's getting to me. It's not physical exhaustion(mostly), I'm just mentally drained even as I keep going. I've noticed it's been starting to get to me as I've felt more irritable around people than usual. Not outwardly, I haven't snapped at anyone or been tense, but more of a internal negative thoughts if someone is talking to me in a social sense for more than five minutes, especially if it's about all the stuff I need to do. But again, everything that's happened has been good. There's a lot, sure, but it hasn't been absolute hell or anything like last semester was for me, so I don't know how to feel about all this.

I don't know what the point of all this was, maybe just venting, but does anyone have any advice or feel a similar way?"
13dbsnl,1,2023-05-09,You should be fluent in a language to teach,Objective_Syrup_1217,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/13dbsnl/you_should_be_fluent_in_a_language_to_teach/,"Note: I am specifically talking about a STEM class, not a language class. 

One of my profs at university is teaching a programming course outside of the traditional computer science department. I am a CS student. Since I am double majoring I need to take this class anyways and figured it’d be an easy A since it’s an intro to business programming class. The professor regularly teaches practices that are 10-15 years out of date. I went to office hours to ask about it at the start of the semester because I figured maybe my internships were just teaching something different. The professor doesn’t have a strong enough grasp on English to have a conversation about this. I would say one thing and he would just start talking about something that was kind of related but had nothing to do with the topic I wanted his perspective on. It feels kind of xenophobic to say that profs should be able to speak English but if you are teaching at a public university you should be able to hold a conversation about what you are teaching."

13dcep1,1,2023-05-09,Chance me for getting into an MA in Art History program,ImaginaryGrocery3341,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/13dcep1/chance_me_for_getting_into_an_ma_in_art_history/,"I'm applying for a Masters in Art History with a focus in American Art next January to start in the fall of 2024. I went to the same college for undergrad and I took four art history classes, with one B+ and three As. I completed dual degrees in studio art and psychology with a certificate in social work and social welfare. My cumulative gpa was a 3.6. I was a teaching assistant for a junior year writing class for three semesters. 

In 2019 I completed a BFA thesis project where I integrated folk art with religious art objects. I installed my show in a gallery on campus and applied for an won a grant from the humanities department. I've gained strong visual analysis and critique skills from my studio classes. I'm very interested in folk art and outsider art as someone who grew up in rural areas and seeing art at flea markets. The first time I went to a museum was for a job interview at my college's contemporary art museum. I worked there as a gallery assistant all four years and helped with some installation tasks and worked at almost every opening event. I was a departmental assistant for the studio art department for about half a year. I volunteered in a kitchen in a survival center once a week for three years of college; I trained new volunteers and gained leadership skills running the kitchen during a summer internship. I gained some experience working for local artists and helping install a show in another gallery on campus throughout college and the summers also. 

After graduating I worked as a mental health crisis counselor through the first fall, winter, and spring of the pandemic and I planned and ran art making groups. I also worked with elementary school kids coming back to in-person learning as a teaching assistant. For the past two years I've worked at a college art museum in a security type role (one level above gallery assistants) and I go to a lot of curator talks and meetings and I'm going to a museum summit next week. I'm in-charge weekly so there's leadership experience, and I served on a hiring committee. I also taught a class for one of the student clubs on campus. I know one of the curators well and she'd write a recommendation letter for me. 

There's a diversity fellowship for students overcoming significant socioeconomic hardships, and I think I can qualify for that. I am a first generation college student, I grew up with housing and food insecurity and we experienced homelessness when I was in second grade. I put myself through college living way below the poverty line and fully supporting myself. My dad was evicted last year so our situation has always been really rough financially. Pursuing the arts has felt risky but it's the only thing I feel passionate about for graduate studies. I really want to teach at the college level and get into curation. 

I'm currently part of a critique group on campus there which leads to a group art show on in the fall. I was recently interviewed by an undergraduate art history student about a mural I painted on campus, which was selected as part of a student-curated exhibition. I also have a blog post published where I was interviewed about my favorite artwork in the museum I currently work at. I'm still living in the area so this program would be really perfect (for many reasons aside from that too). The museum I work at is at a college one town over from where I went to school for undergrad and where I'm applying for this MA. I see professors bring classes over frequently and they still recognize me and we talk when they come in. 

The application calls for a writing sample no more than 20 pages long and the longest I really have from an art history class is five pages. I'm a little worried about that. I've been in museums for a long time, but mostly in the front of house positions, and I feel well rounded in my understanding of how museum roles function. I'm really interested in intergenerational museum practices and the inequities between front of house and back of house employees. 

I'm mainly hoping I'm not too far behind people who have bachelors in art history with significant research and writing experience, and with more advanced museum internships or experience than I have. This program provides a stipend or fellowship for funding throughout while covering tuition for all students admitted.

I learned css/html, java,c++, and a little SQL. Unfortunately, I didn't do my research and quickly realized after getting that degree that an associates and simply knowing the language isn't enough to find a job. I transfered my credits (mostly gen ed) to the 4 year school and just completed the first half of sophmore year (I have 44 credits total atm). I realized that you have to build projects and I'm interested in front end development. Right now I'm learning Java script and hope to learn React. I'm taking calculus and computer science fundamentals this summer and I'm excited. I was wondering if there is anything I can do now to improve my skills in order to find an internship (perhaps by spring or summer 2024). I'm asking this question because while I did learn things at cc, I wasted alot of time not actively applying the skills I learned and not learning about what skills employers look for. Thank you!!"

13deiuo,1,2023-05-09,Advice needed (current undergrad),TrueElitist,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/13deiuo/advice_needed_current_undergrad/,"Hi everyone, I wanted to post here to ask for advice.

I'm currently a third year mechanical engineering major at an UC school, and I realized recently that I want to pivot towards software, either backend development, machine learning, or robotics (CV / Motion planning). I've done three internships so far (2 at notable EV companies), and I just do not enjoy the nature of mechanical design work. My background in CS mainly revolves around USACO, where I was competing in gold/platinum. I also currently have a portfolio with two projects I've done in the past with React and Javascript.

I have two options thus far:

1. Stick with mechanical engineering & finish the degree, hold onto a full time role as a mechanical engineer while I apply for OMSCS
2. Change my major now to Math-CS (Cannot swap to pure CS because my school caps the major), graduate as a 5th year and apply to CS roles (or pursue OMSCS)

Pros & Cons of 1:

Pros:

1. Would have a stable income out of college
2. Can do OMSCS while working, not losing out on money
3. Learn CS at a graduate level

Cons:

1. Sunk Cost Fallacy: I'm scared that all my time and energy spent into  developing a career into mechanical engineering would go to waste
2. Would take 2ish years to complete the masters while part-time
3. If I switch to SWE, I would lose the years of experience that I have as a mechanical engineer since the fields don't correlate

Pros & Cons of 2:

Pros:

1. Would graduate with a degree related to CS
2. Can learn the foundations of CS in depth during undergrad
3. I do not have to start from square 1 after I gain YOEs as a mechanical engineer if I start as a software engineer from graduation

Cons:

1. 1 extra year
2. Would effectively throw away my mechanical engineering background
3. Job market is tough right now, I'm not sure if I'd be able to land internships / FT roles

The reason why I want to do OMSCS is because of not only the cheap cost, but the fact that I have a chance to pivot if I do not get a bachelor's in CS. I know a lot of people might say to do a boot camp if I wanted to pivot easily, but I genuinely am interested in the field and want to develop strong fundamentals for myself. I'm more than willing to take the undergraduate CS classes at my school to qualify for OMSCS admissions if I stick with option 1.

Former mechanical engineers, do you guys regret not switching sooner? If you had the opportunity to switch to CS during your undergraduate years, would you have done so? I'm having a sunk cost fallacy on mechanical engineering, so I'm not sure what to do here. Any advice would be appreciated."

I am seeking your assistance in identifying any shortcomings in my application process for software development summer internships. I am currently a graduate student in computer science at the University of Florida, having started my studies in the fall of 2022. I began applying for internships around October, which I acknowledge was a bit late. However, it took me longer than usual to tailor my resume and make general adjustments, which I understand is not an excuse. I would appreciate your insights on where I could have gone wrong, whether in the application process, resume, or something else. Despite the current economic recession, I am sure there are a lot of opportunities out there.

Although I did not apply aggressively during the first month of my search, I submitted applications for approximately 600-700 internships in November and December. Unfortunately, I received rejection emails on a daily basis, and some companies did not even bother to respond. Since then, I have applied to roughly another 500 internships. Please find my resume attached at [**https://resumelinkedhere.tiiny.site/**](https://resumelinkedhere.tiiny.site/).

If my interviews were not going well, I would have worked harder to improve my technical skills. However, it is disheartening to have my resume rejected without even being seen by a human. Any suggestions on where I could improve are greatly appreciated. TIA."

I got off the waitlist for Berkeley EECS yesterday and I'm currently committed to Northwestern for Computer Engineering. I'm unsure if Berkeley is the right decision, despite the strength of EECS. I have no interest in working in FAANG, so in that sense, the ""better"" CS won't matter. I'm much more interested in going into research or industry for something like biomedical devices or avionics and I might go for grad school. Cost is 11k direct Northwestern vs 5k Berkeley. 

Berkeley Pros:

* EECS... 
* Has an aerospace engineering major, though it's very very new 
* Close to homes, means I know more people in the area and have friends going 
* I did an internship at LBNL so I have connections and could probably get another position 

Berkeley Cons: 

* Massive class sizes
* The campus is not all that, feels crowded 
* Seems very competitive and stressful 
* Lack of flexibility in changing major, double majoring, etc 

Northwestern Pros: 

* Course flexibility 
* Lots of opportunities in their undergraduate machine shops 
* Manufacturing engineering major (planning on doubling)
* New environment 
* I loved the campus and the town of Evanston, though I really like the city of Berkeley as well
* Doesn't seem as competitive to get into cool engineering clubs (Formula SAE, rocketry) 

Northwestern Cons:

* The cold 
* Theoretically worse for engineering

Actually my idea would be to move to Germany, Netherlands or Denmark to pursue the major there, but my dream would be to move to the US one day and I know that the bureaucratic process is very slow and it’s really hard to get a visa, so my ideal plan would be to study there and try to get a job in the meanwhile to be able to move there.
So my questions are:
- which are the european countries you consider valid to move to even if I decide to not get a major and why?
- how hard is to get an F-1 visa for the US? Which states do you think are more affordable and liveable? How long before should I start the visa process?

13dn0ol,1,2023-05-10,Should I take this job while developing my UX career?,jubblywubbley,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13dn0ol/should_i_take_this_job_while_developing_my_ux/,"Hello all, I'm completing my UX bootcamp soon and plan on applying to basically everything internships/apprenticeships/jobs and doing pro-bono work to get some experience. My background is I graduated a year ago with a BA in Psychology.

Since I'm just starting my UX career, I know it will take months before I even get a job as the field is competitive especially for junior roles, so I thought I might try get temporary jobs to gain transferrable skills and leadership skills and so I applied to Whole Foods for a customer support supervisor position. (I also want to avoid lower paying jobs because I have a degree so I think it would make sense for me to get roles that give me better pay/professional development).

I know this job can develop my professional skills, but I'm worried about it being full time and taking time away from me developing my career in UX. Should I consider even working this job? this is my chance to gain some higher level experience bc right now, I only have experience as a sales associate at target and sbux barista (unofficial trainer). I'm also worried it being a full time position will take away time where I can focus on my UX career/internships. Should I work this temporarily and try to negotiate for some flexibility if I do get an internship?"
13dp4r1,1,2023-05-10,how to avoid temporary relocation? is it worth it?,TranslatorFriendly32,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13dp4r1/how_to_avoid_temporary_relocation_is_it_worth_it/,"i’ve been at my job for a year, with good pay and benefits with no degree. i like it, it aligns with my values, but it does have a high workload and regular periods of weekend work/high stress (with subsequent time off). 

i was hired off of an internship last year that took place in each of the locales where we’re active. at the time, there was no local staff in my area, we were supervised remotely. 

this year, the internship is taking place in one locale, which is less urban than where i live. i am born and raised where i live, and have no desire to ever live somewhere with less activity. they apparently need several FT staff to relocate for june and july to support this internship.  i do not want to go for several reasons. i’m dating someone new and find it unpleasant to immediately be separated from them. 

i also have a trip planned for the end of the month and a concert the subsequent weekend, and we’re just now being told apparently we have to leave early for preparation, i am not willing to move these things around. 

on top of losing my social milieu and support system, my car is on the fritz. i was planning to buy a bit later in the year, but having to drive the 3.5 hours to the worksite and to come back home to visit is possibly hastening that. i am not in the best financial standing for this though, so although i can make it happen i think i shouldn’t take out a loan for something i want to do. 

i also have adhd and struggle with maintaining the stability necessary to do the job already. i feel that if i am uprooted and understimulated, it’s likely i would do worse. considering getting a note from my therapist/doctor stating this. 

however, i do not want to lose this job or goodwill within it. it’s doing exactly what i think needs to be done socially. i’m thinking of meeting with senior leadership with my union rep to ask about flexibility, but i don’t know how to go about it. 

thoughts?

tldr: my job wants me to relocate for 2 months to a sleepier town, condemning me to a shitty summer without social supports. i value the job, however and could maybe do this with flexibility. looking for advice on how to approach."

Unluckily I have no working experience, but I’ll probably land an unpaid internship of 300 hours in September which will be related to my thesis, but I’ve some
projects related to my exams (just to fill my CV lol). I don’t have great coding skills and I’d say my English is okay, I have an expired IELTS certification (7.0 overall, but I can do better).
Actually my idea would be to move to Germany, Netherlands or Denmark to pursue the major there, but my dream would be to move to the US one day and I know that the bureaucratic process is very slow and it’s really hard to get a visa, so my ideal plan would be to study there and try to get a job in the meanwhile to be able to move there.
So my questions are:
- which are the european countries you consider valid to move to even if I decide to not get a major and why?
- how hard is to get an F-1 visa(student visa) for the US? Which states do you think are more affordable and liveable? How long before should I start the visa process?

ACADEMICS : 
- I am from a Commerce background with a degree in Management Studies. 
- Pursued Actuarial science (8 CT papers) along with graduation. (For those who aren't familiar with actuarial science - it is a stats and math focused course)
- Decided to switch to Data Science in the pandemic
- MOOC courses from simplilearn, coursera (Andrew Ng), Udemy
- Pursing a part time Diploma in Data Science from a very reputed college. Course is pretty good. Focuses on linear algebra and stats.
- Additional courses : Calculus in single variable, Multivariable calculus, Programming, Data Structures and algorithms using python 
- I have recently started my own blog for data science articles + part of author community of a well known MOOC company 
- Multiple Hands on personal projects. Nothing extra ordinary but enough to showcase my skills
- Comfortable with python and SQL
- Completed AWS CCP

WORK EXPERIENCE:
- 2 internships in Actuarial science
- Almost 1 year of experience as a Data analyst. 

I have tried to complete all academic pre-requisites and want to apply for MS in Data Science. USA mainly but I'm open to UK as well. I will be giving GRE soon. 

I am looking for suggestions on improving my profile and Universities for MS in DS for ON CAMPUS FULL-TIME courses. I will require a student visa for both USA and UK.

I am planning on apply for the T15 schools this September. Hoping for some insights into my profile. Took inspiration for the format from a similar post that I've seen here.

Profile

* **Sex:** Male
* **Race:** Asian
* **Current Age:** 23
* **Country:** India
* **Academic Background:** Bachelors degree in Computer Science
* **Hobbies:** Sports, Reading, Blogging
* **Undergrad University:** IIT, One of the top schools in India
* **Undergrad Major & GPA:** computer science, **3.1 / 4.00**
* **Work Experience:** Software Engineer, 2 years of experience working full time in fin-tech startups and 9 month of internship experience. Will be 3 years of full time exp by the time I join. 
* **GMAT:** 750
* **Volunteer:** Mentoring 50+ juniors in college over a 16 hour workshop. 40 hours in community service teaching 5th grade school kids
* **Letter of Recommendations:** 2 x Managers at companies I've worked in.
* **Current Targets:** Want to apply to HSW, Kellogg, Sloan, Tuck, Ross and Yale
* **Post MBA Goal:** Want to start up in the financial space with the aim to help people all over the world manage their finances better.
* **Why MBA:** I have always had an entrepreneurial bug, and have been working in various early to mid stage startups over the past 6 years. I believe an MBA would be the perfect platform for me to acquire knowledge, hone my skills, understand the business world better, and be able to network.

My concerns

1. **Terrible GPA:** My GPA is obviously pretty terrible as I did not focus on grades during college due to personal issues I was dealing with.
2. **Need financial aid:**  I would be applying for financial aid as I make under 30K dollars currently and I can simply not afford an MBA

How well would my profile fare if I don’t apply for fin aid?

Do I have a chance at getting into a T15 school? Thanks very much in advance"

This semester, and if I don’t manage to drop my grades even worse, will showcase a C in General Physics I (5 hours), A in Beginning Spanish I (4 hours), C in Calculus I (5 credit hours), A in Art History (3 credit hours), and C in General College Chemistry II (4 credit hours). 

I passed Calculus I last semester with a C and because I’m taking 5 classes this semester, I thought it would be a good idea to retake it with the same professor since he was very good and had a great connection with students. 

This professor left out of nowhere after spring break and I failed my last 2 exams. Ended up going from an A to a 79%, but since I failed my last two tests my new professor doesn’t want to get me to a B. 

In general, my exams were horrible for all my classes. I have piled up homework and never spent time studying because I was playing catch-up all semester. Engineering is my passion although I don’t think my brain was built for it. I don’t even think I’ll be considered by most universities come transfer in the fall. I want to take this seriously, but feel like I’m so lacking while others are succeeding.

I’m taking Calculus II this summer and even decided to opt out of my first internship to invest most of my time into it. If you are/were in my situation, is there light at the end?

I'm 26 years old and currently in my third year of undergrad, working towards a BS in Computer Information Systems. I've got an Associate of Science in Business Administration and I'm aiming for a Junior Sys Admin role after I graduate. Right now, I work for a FAANG company, but my job doesn't really use my degree. I'm planning to get an internship within the same company in the next year after my workload becomes easier because I would have to work full time during my internship (currently part-time due to in person class sessions and full-time student). I live in Los Angeles and will be getting some certifications over the summer.

I'm not sure whether I should go for the CCNA certification or do the CompTIA trifecta and then the CCNA. I want to learn as much as possible, but I don't want to take any unnecessary steps. I've heard the CCNA is harder, and understand the more “traditional” approach is to get the trifecta first. My goal is to become a network engineer or cloud engineer in a few years and maybe move into a management role later in my career. I'm also thinking about getting a master's degree in CS/IS. Any advice or feedback you can give me would be awesome. Thanks!"

It's a 1.5hr drive from Silicon Valley Bay Area where internships & jobs are plenty. The downside I can think of is that I'd be competing with Stanford & Berkeley students (but either way I'd be competing with them for jobs).

I also accepted UIUC's Computer Engineering offer. UIUC is considered T5-T10 range for CS/CompE so I'm guessing it's much more reputed (even in California?) than UC Davis which is in T20-T30 range for CS/CompE? Is that mostly correct? Assuming similar resume & skills, would recruiters for jobs in SV Bay Area likely prefer a candidate from a nearby UC compared to UIUC which is on the opposite side of the country?

The cost for both are similar and fortunately not an issue. Won't be needing loans. UC Davis is among cow farms and UIUC among corn fields. But at least UC Davis has Sacramento 20 minutes away, no first-year dorm requirement & better weather than UIUC. Which uni is likely to open up more opportunities in engineering and software for Int'l students like me? I prefer to work in California or Texas. East Coast would be the last choice for me.

On a side note: Is the UC quarter system more fast-paced and difficult than UIUC semester system. I'm unfamiliar. What are the pros & cons of each system?"

Well, what do I say? I am the first one to graduate from my family. Did web-development during first and second year in Ruby and Rails, and Vanilla JS. Started with Machine Learning, learnt some basics of neural network, CNN, LSTM, etc, was interested in NLP. Left that because I felt that it was slightly harder to understand, went to explore blockchain and contract programming, hated it, came back to ML/DL in Computer Vision. Fourth year started, went with a group who chose a really hard topic related to drone, computer vision and flame detection. I was the one who did most of the work, including creating dataset (all the pipelines, collection, preprocessing, etc, you get the point), training the model on Collab because my shitty university didn't have their own machine, and even assembling the drone, Jetson Nano and Arduino with the flight controller and programming it. Yes, the project half-succeeded, but at least we didn't copy like other students from GitHub, we didn't practice dishonestly, all of it was my own work. When I was working my ass off, the rest of these students in my group were preparing for their job and let me sink in the burning ship alone.

I've contributed to open source during last September-January, especially to GitLab. Had an internship secured last November, the pay was dog-shit, quit the job at the end of January because bad work culture. I regret fucking up by not choosing the career domain properly. I've been trying to learn NodeJS/React/Mongo from fullstackopen, but I've lost my interest in web development, because I love working on niche stuff like Artificial Intelligence, Kernel and Graphics Programming. Now I've started learning Vulkan, OpenAL and GTK4, all in C, for some reason, I don't know why, perhaps because I am enjoying it. I don't know what the fuck I am doing right now. I hate normal jobs, I wish I had some money to give IELTS as well as fill college applications for my masters for academia. Would anyone care to share some tips to help me get out of this mess?"

I got diagnosed almost 2 years ago and my mom still hasn’t done any research on adhd because she simply thinks she knows it aka “troubled kids in school”. So she basically has no idea what adhd is. 

I have a lot of social anxiety, always thinking about things that could go wrong when doing things that involve people. I try to plan what to say and do before going out so I don’t say unnecessary things. Change of plans are basically impossible, I break down and feel like a 3 year old not being able to control my emotions. 

I recently moved out and have to do schoolwork in order to get money to pay rent, I also fill in sometimes at a elderly home. 

In school we have to do an internship for 4 weeks in order to get a grade. At first I was sure I wouldn’t go because of my anxiety but then I went and it was okay and after a week the person I was supposed to go with got sick. I found out when I already was there so they put me with some guy, immediately I felt anxious and stressed. He asked me to touch his hair and told me his wife looked like a 15 year old… I was super uncomfortable and wanted to throw up since I was alone with him the whole day. I called in sick the next few days until they called me and told me that the person I was going with first would stay home longer so they have to put me somewhere else. 
This ruined everything, when I got home I just broke down in tears and had a panic attack. I don’t want to go through the same anxiety again like I did the first days. On top of that I have an eating disorder that is spiraling out of control right now because summer is close.

 Also my meds aren’t working like they should and my doctor is going on vacation soon for the whole summer so he doesn’t have time to change my medication because he can’t follow up. I feel sick and want to just lock myself up in my apartment and just wait until it’s over. But my mom is stressing me about money and won’t listen to me at all.

Firstly, when the mentor was explaining the project, I didn’t understand anything he was saying because of my speaker and his accent, so I couldn’t really understand the project very well and was only able to ask one or two questions. Second, there were times when there was actually no conversation between anyone in the zoom meeting and whenever I tried to say something, someone would try saying something at the same time and it felt very awkward. Third, they were constantly talking about technologies and processes that I had never heard of like Java springboot and Java solar, which is making me feel very under-prepared for the internship This is a highly-regarded company and I really need a return offer if I can work hard enough to get one, but I feel like I left a bad impression.

This is a long one but I really hope someone can help me figure something out. Also apologies for any formatting issues; I’m on mobile (EDIT: I tried fixing some of the formatting issues).

I recently got out of the hospital a couple weeks ago for something that I won’t share for privacy reasons (also I’m not sure if it breaks the rules or not). I’ve been dealing with it for about five years now. I was doing pretty good for about three years but it’s gotten worse the past year and have had some really bad flair-ups recently. This is not the big problem; however, it means that I have had to take some incompletes on my college courses AND I’ve moved back in with my parents lately.

My parents seem to be of the opinion that since I’m no longer 3 years old, I can take care of myself. And while I very much wish that was the case, it’s not. I need a lot of help and support. It started out fine with my parents taking half days and switching to stay home with me and take care of things that I need help with. But now they are back to pretending everything is normal and this is the worst I’ve been since it all started. 

My parents are fine people, I guess, but they probably should not have had a kid. I’ve been taking care of myself since I was 7 or 8 and the cuteness of having a baby/child wore off. I know they’re busy people and they have their own stuff they’re dealing with, but it’s so hard to be around them. My dad’s an alcoholic and my mom is…something. They both also have their own mental health problems that they need help with but frequently ignore. A lot of my friends wonder why I haven’t gone no contact with them and here is where the problem lies:
1) There really isn’t anyone else in my life.
2) I am still financially dependent on them.

Ironically the friends who ask me why I haven’t cut them off are the same people who stop responding after I bring up problems. That’s fine; some people get triggered by stuff and I can understand that maybe we aren’t close enough to talk about personal issues. I’m currently on therapist number eleven and looking for a new one (turns out when you find a therapist without a waitlist, they usually don’t have a waitlist for a reason). I’m stuck inside a bubble with no one to talk to and it’s probably part of the reason why my health is so bad.

The worse problem is finances. I started saving up my freshman year, but I have a hard time working for health reasons (especially during the school year) and every time I manage to save money, it always seems to disappear (inflation sucks ass). I’m currently working two jobs—I tried working three last semester but had to leave for, wait for it, health reasons. I also donate plasma twice a week just to make ends meet. (One job is an internship for my major so I basically get pennies and the other is freelance work, which means it’s not constant. The third job is a cashier job that I work when I can.) 

My parents are paying for my tuition and rent, but they are doing it through a fund that my grandparents set up (I think it’s one of those Gerber things? I’m not sure). They also frequently miss payments which means 1) my apartment complex is really ready to kick me out and 2) I now owe a couple thousands dollars to the attorney general’s office because my parents missed a tuition payment and the college handed it over. I can’t do anything about it because I don’t have that kind of money and I don’t have access to the account. It is constantly accruing interest and is thus draining my account and lowering my credit score. The apartment is under my name because both my parents got denied (low credit scores and income amounts I guess).

The apartment complex is raising my rent and so my parents want me to move back home permanently. After living with them again for three weeks, I can’t do it. It’s like living alone but worse because you think you aren’t alone (if that makes sense). I tried looking for a roommate but everyone I know either lives on campus, already has a roommate, or both. I know that I should be able to do adult things because I’m an adult now and it frustrates me that my body just won’t work like I want it to. I know there is so much more context that I haven’t provided, but I literally don’t know what to do.

My question is: what do I do next? Can I gain access to my account somehow? Should I find someone else to move? Is it better to be alone rather than live with abusive people? I should mention that I’m still on my parent’s insurance so if I go no contact with them, I worry about medical bills. I mean they have good insurance but even with that it’s pretty expensive and I can’t imagine paying without.  I can’t even think about my college work right now because I have absolutely no energy or motivation. I need help."

Due to drinking too much cscq juice I've managed to get myself an (admittedly exploitative) internship after my freshman year which helped me now land a summer internship with a fintech, paying above faang rate in my area (eu).

This is obviously great news, good money, free accommodation and it only lasts 2 months so it doesn't impact my studies. Generally a golden offer.

However, I haven't had any vacation since I started my uni and I feel kinda tired and I miss some friends and my summer hobbies. I am generally advised to push and do it to secure myself a good future though, which is fair.

I would like some anon advice. Is this internship really a career spring? Does it matter for long term income that much? I will have 2 tier 1 internships on my resume (one my own and one through uni programme) and will likely do a masters since it's almost free in my area.

If someone has a story similar to mines or advice or advice please everything will help. Resources, YouTube, certification, etc. and with respect to my resume, how do I change it to get an IT role? Do I have to rewrite my skills to make them more technical or do I have to keep my experience on my résumé?

When I was 17 and finished high school, I moved from my country (in Maghreb) to study and live in Europe, because my parent wanted me to have a better life since they consider that the state of the world is becoming worst and worst. So, they paid for me my medical studies in Belgium.

Honestly, when I enrolled, I told my parent that I’ll probably never succeed in med university. I thought the experience will be useful for the next year (I wanted to enroll in engineering). At my surprise, I succeeded. Even if it wasn't really my objective, I decided to take this opportunity, to become a doctor.

And so, my routine was to work with my 3 close friends 10h/day for the next 5 years. After my 3rd year, it is necessary to move to Brussel to continue the 3 remaining years.

All of my time went in my studies, to the point where I didn't make any new friend, and obviously never had a girlfriend during these years. It did really concern me, I felt that my appartement was suffocating.

Then COVID came in, it was one of the worst things that could ever happens to me. The few things that kept me happy and motivated every day disappeared: my sport club closed, all my non-medical friend were working online so they all went back to their country with their family, I still needed to continue my internship in hospital... What I didn't say either is that coming from Maghreb, I was used to have my dose of sun every day. During COVID it was: wake alone at 7, it's rainy and dark outside, finishing work at 18, it still night and rainy outside, go back home, study, sleep.

In this period, I started smoking weed, one of my biggest mistakes, what an addiction I developed.

All in all, I was depressed, didn't had any interest in anything.

Obviously, what was supposed to happen happened. I wanted to be surgeon , and thought that after finishing my 6th year I would re-discover life. Well... I didn't go the surgeon specialty. What a shitty state I was at: no friend around, no family in the country, addict to weed, failed at work.

I decided to take a year to re-focus, try new thing, try new style, go to the gym... I tried to take a new start. Well now I found some new friends, that I love and that really care for me. I have a girlfriend and it's going really and I smoke way less. But one problem remains, I want to be a surgeon!

Look like the more I try in Belgium, the less I succeed. After two years, I was sick of staying in the same state. So, I decided to learn German! 4 hours of online course every morning, it has been 6 months. Soon I’ll have my B2 level, and end of August I will be moving to Germany.

But now I’m thinking: I feel like after all this shit, I’m finally kind of comfortable with my life in Brussel (except for the work aspect, which is totally annoying me). My friends that are like a second family to me, my girlfriend, my everyday lifestyle... And as my girlfriend is Canadian, after this year she will have 6 months to found a job, or else she'll have no Visa to stay in Belgium.

I'm starting to get scared: of not staying with my girlfriend since she may quit the country, of being alone anew in Germany. I have uncertainties related to my understanding of the German: will I be able to blend in? will I be a good doc there if I don’t fully master the language?  I hope to come back as soon as possible in Belgium, but normally becoming a surgeon needs a 6 years formation… It’s really long 6 years…

A friend of mine told me it's possible to do my first formation year in Luxembourg. In my opinion, it's not a place really convincing to learn surgery, but it's true that it's not that far from Brussel, and it’s also true that the people there speak German French and English (I’m fluent in English and French). So, it kind of looks like a good transition year.

Well, all in all, I’m 25, and I'm lost. The closer I am to the end of august, the more fear and anxiety I build.

What do you guys think?"

I've been in IT for about 7 years now. I started as an intern installing specialized software, then moved into a level 2 desktop support role. Now I'm working as an application/system admin. I've been in my current position for 5 years.

I'm bored with my current position. I'm rarely doing the ""real work"" anymore I mostly just babysit the vendors. I'm also not getting paid enough. I'm making 65k and I'm struggling a bit financially.

For the past few years I've been self teaching myself a few programming languages. Some of the projects I've been working on include:

* basic CRUD web apps with: javascript / python / django / flask
* 2D pixel art games: python / java
* Discord bot: python
* automated email: python
* other various small automation / scripting projects: python

I'm currently working on:

* Custom map editor for my 2D games: java / swing
* Custom map rendering / chunking system: java
* Chess server: javascript / java / spring

I want to go to school online and get a computer science degree and then try to get a dev job. I feel like I'm close to being capable at an entry level software dev job, but idk I have no frame of reference. I'm also sure that given the current entry level job market getting a job without a degree would be miraculous.

I've also been thinking about getting a CCNA cert and using my connections to get interviews with the vendors I work with. I've studied for the CCNA in the past and taken and passed a bunch of networking courses at a local trade school. I'm confident I could pass it with 2-3 months of study. I also have some cisco switches and a router I got from work so I could set up a lab. I feel like this is the quickest path out of my current position and towards higher pay, but I just have this nagging feeling like I'm throwing away all the programming skills I've worked for.

I'm not sure what to do and its really starting to get to me. I'm extremely unhappy in my current position and I don't know if I can stick it out much longer. Maybe if I had a plan and an end in sight it would be manageable.

Please any advice you could offer I would appreciate immensely. Thank you for taking the time to read through all of this."

My current manager at my internship is giving me the opportunity to join which team I want to be on for my term. My options are 

&#x200B;

1. Mobile Development: I would be working in a small team of mostly interns to create a secure chat feature, this is not an existing project so we would be building it from scratch. The role would be 50/50 research and coding, and it would involve researching the languages/frameworks/technologies we want to use, presenting our recommendations to managers and then creating a proof of concept/prototype of the project. The languages/frameworks I would most likely be using would Swift/React native and a bit of cloud technology
2. Cloud: I would be joining the cloud/DevOps team at the company (working with senior developers instead of just other interns) and would be working on improving an existing project that the company is currently using. This role is mostly hands on and less research, I would be using AWS and Azure
3. AI: I would be working with probably only one other intern to create a semantic search feature to allow users to search through databases easier. Like the mobile development team, this is not an existing project and we would be building this entirely ourselves with some guidance from our managers. This role would be mostly research and involve us evaluating various AI tools and giving recommendations on which ones the company should use to create it, if we are able to we would create a proof of concept for the feature

&#x200B;

I'm leaning towards cloud/AI just because I'm not really interested in mobile development and most of what I would do on that team, I could just do on my own for a project. Also, I have the ability to join multiple teams, and balance my time between both, but I would probably only be able to manage 2 max.

1. Is the program more pure-math focused, or more applied? or is it just what you make it
2. How's the course rigor? At a first glance, it seems decent (some somewhat ""deep"" courses on the catalogue like differential geometry and probability theory - exciting stuff :) ), but if any of y'all took courses like those and have firsthand reviews, I'd love to hear!
3. Any advice on finding opportunities (e.g. undergraduate research, internships, etc)? I know it's a large school so it's a bit harder to seek them out, but hey

I’m not sure if this is the best sub for this post, but I would love to get some advice from data science professionals. 

Over this recruitment cycle for summer internships, I’ve been fortunate enough to receive two data science internship offers, and I am extremely torn on which to accept. For reference, I am a second-year Data Science student at UC San Diego.

Firstly, I received an offer from a midsize software company, where I’ll be working with large text datasets and performing NLP and data analysis. I see it as an great opportunity to get hands-on experience working with large, real-world datasets, and think it would allow me to develop my skills at a high level. This role, and its earlier start date, would require me to relocate within the next three weeks, and take the final two weeks of my academic quarter online. In terms of pay, it’s 23/hr, with no housing/relocation stipend.

The other offer is at a small startup that is building a learning platform for a specific industry. With this company, my role would be less hands on data science, and instead more focused on establishing the company’s data pipelines and data management systems, as well as generating insights/visualizations for investor pitches. I am drawn to this offer because I think that getting experience working with a broader scope of a data-driven product would allow me to define my own specific interests in the future, and by getting experience in other aspects of a company, I hope to gain domain expertise on the business side of companies. This company is offering 25/hr and fully remote work.

Overall, I think that both of these opportunities are very exciting and would allow me to learn and grow in different ways, but I am not sure which experience would be more valuable, for both future job prospects and also my overall skill set. I also don’t know how much to weigh the difference in pay, which will be close to $3000 after accounting for housing. I would love to hear thoughts and advice from the community. Thank you!"

Disclaimer: this was not really intended as a direct question, I re-uploaded with one because of the automoderator. It is more of a vent, really, and a way to know some strangers' opinions. 

Hi everyone, 

I'm an engineer working in Europe, not in my home country. Different place, different language. 

I did quite well in college, good grades and good extracurriculars/awards to make my profile more interesting. Out of school I managed to get my ""dream job"" in the largest company in Europe in my sector, even though I didn't speak the local language at the time and with no internship in my CV (something not too common in my home country, very common in the one I am now). It was a bit tough the first ~1.5 months, being the only foreigner in the team and forcing everyone to speak to me in english, but eventually I learned the language and it's the only one I've been using since then. Still, you get looked a bit like an alien sometimes and people (not everyone of course) are generally stiffer with you. No biggie though, things did improve *a bit* when I learned the language. Almost all sunshine  and rainbows then. Nope. 

I've had a nice relationship with all the team, but it didn't take long to recognize that this one guy quite clearly hated me from the start... 
Some examples over the one year I've been here: 

- when I got my computer (we're talking first week, not first day because they messed up the order so I sat there reading some stuff they gave me lol), I had to install a ton of stuff, doing a lot of troubleshooting and getting things working. Give it 45 minutes (making everything work properly usually takes days, I've seen it myself afterwards with new arrivals in the team) the guy cracks and nervously tells me there is a lot of work to do and that I can't be losing all this time just to get started, comes at my desk and presses some keys only to pretty much receive the same errors I did and hilariously leave again, all irritated. 

- some weeks later I try for the first time remote working. The guy, who of course was chosen as the one following me at the beginning, sends me messages every freaking 30 minutes requesting updates and we keep going till 9 p.m. 

- he regularly made jokes about me thinking I wouldn't understand, sometimes managing to get an awkward smile from the coworker he said it to, but clearly creating discomfort. 

- grumbling when I asked questions. 

- fast forward and the first yelling-in-front-of-the-team happens. 

- he's the only one still talking to me in english sometimes, throwing out the window all your effort to integrate in the team and foreign culture. 

- needless to say, hardly received any compliment, points out every single detail he would have done differently. It is true that this is a cultural thing, fairly common here in general, but I don't think at this level. 

I could go on... Needless to say, the situation is not easy even though now I am not completely passive anymore. When given the chance to do it I answer, calmly. In general however there is clearly tension between us two pretty much every time we interact. 
Plus the hours honestly suck 9-7/9-7:30 are very common, 9-6:30 is the minimum. Add it to the ~40 minutes commute from/to home and you pretty much have no energies left (I do keep exercising as much as I can anyway though). 
I live alone and I do feel all the posts here wondering how to keep this up for 40 years, regardless of coworkers.

So I've reached the point when I've come to hate what was supposed to be a dream job;. there is not much better than this out there, on paper. 
But I'm not motivated anymore. I wake up in the morning thinking about what else will happen and how to deal with this situation when I'll get to the office. I'm basically on survival mode and burned out. 

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, I guess I just need to vent a bit. Boy what a way to get things started with the work life :')"

However, my boss found out that I had been interviewing with other companies and has lowkey threatened to let me go.

Worried that my offer at Company A might be rescinded before I start, I decided to continue interviewing and ended up accepting an offer at Company B.

The problem is, B is a company that currently serves as a consultant/contractor to A, and it’s very, very likely that I would be working with my supervisors/coworkers from A if I join B.   Personally, I know they will be shocked and upset if I leave, and I know they will feel doubly so by me going to their own consultant. 

I know some Redditors might say “screw them, who cares” but my field is veryyy small and everyone knows everyone and will have to work with them at some point. As this is my first full-time job in my career, I need help to not burn any bridges when resigning.

I know some people will suggest being curt and saying nothing, but I can’t comfortably do that because I know I will still continue my professional relationship with them after I leave. I want to come off as incredibly nice and grateful to my boss and coworkers but of course not say too much. I want to gain their empathy and understanding so that they are less upset and that things won’t be too awkward when I run into them again in my work or at professional events. I also don’t know how to respond when they ask who I’ll be working for, since I know they’ll find out sooner or later through LinkedIn, etc.

Thanks for any help you guys can provide!"
13e646m,25,2023-05-10,Is it too late to post a summer internship?,ATechAdventurer,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/13e646m/is_it_too_late_to_post_a_summer_internship/,Recently I was able to convince my company to set up an internship program. We are an early-stage SaaS startup. We are drafting the job description and interview process for a software engineering intern but I’m starting to worry that we are a little too late and most students have either already got an internship lined up or have given up the search for this summer. Should I even bother posting it on handshake or should I just wait till we are closer to the fall semester to post it?
13e6ssk,8,2023-05-10,Take offer at small company or remote startup,Mediocre_Strawberry4,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13e6ssk/take_offer_at_small_company_or_remote_startup/,"Hello! I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this post, but I would love to get some advice from y’all.   


  
Over this recruitment cycle for summer internships, I’ve been fortunate enough to receive two data science internship offers, and I am extremely torn on which to accept. For reference, I am a second-year Data Science student at UC San Diego.  


  
Firstly, I received an offer from a midsize software company, where I’ll be working with large text datasets and performing NLP and data analysis. I see it as an great opportunity to get hands-on experience working with large, real-world datasets, and think it would allow me to develop my skills at a high level. This role, and its earlier start date, would require me to relocate within the next three weeks, and take the final two weeks of this academic quarter online. In terms of pay, it’s 23/hr, with no housing/relocation stipend.  


  
The other offer is at a small startup that is building a learning platform for a specific industry. With this company, my role would be less hands on data science, and instead more focused on establishing the company’s data pipelines and management systems, as well as generating insights/visualizations for their investor pitches. I am drawn to this offer because I think that getting experience working across a broader scope of a data-driven product would allow me to define my own specific interests in the future, and by getting experience in other aspects of a company, I hope to gain domain expertise on the business side of companies. This company is offering 25/hr and fully remote work.  


  
Overall, I think that both of these opportunities are very exciting and would allow me to learn and grow in different ways, but I am not sure which experience would be more valuable, for both future job prospects and also my overall skill set. I also don’t know how much to weigh the difference in pay, which will be close to $3000 after accounting for housing. I would love to hear thoughts and advice from the community. Thank you!

I got diagnosed almost 2 years ago and my mom still hasn’t done any research on adhd because she simply thinks she knows it aka “troubled kids in school”. So she basically has no idea what adhd is. 

I have a lot of social anxiety, always thinking about things that could go wrong when doing things that involve people. I try to plan what to say and do before going out so I don’t say unnecessary things. Change of plans are basically impossible, I break down and feel like a 3 year old not being able to control my emotions. 

I recently moved out and have to do schoolwork in order to get money to pay rent, I also fill in sometimes at a elderly home. 

In school we have to do an internship for 4 weeks in order to get a grade. At first I was sure I wouldn’t go because of my anxiety but then I went and it was okay and after a week the person I was supposed to go with got sick. I found out when I already was there so they put me with some guy, immediately I felt anxious and stressed. He asked me to touch his hair and told me his wife looked like a 15 year old… I was super uncomfortable and wanted to throw up since I was alone with him the whole day. I called in sick the next few days until they called me and told me that the person I was going with first would stay home longer so they have to put me somewhere else. 
This ruined everything, when I got home I just broke down in tears and had a panic attack. I don’t want to go through the same anxiety again like I did the first days. On top of that I have an eating disorder that is spiraling out of control right now because summer is close.

 Also my meds aren’t working like they should and my doctor is going on vacation soon for the whole summer so he doesn’t have time to change my medication because he can’t follow up. I feel sick and want to just lock myself up in my apartment and just wait until it’s over. But my mom is stressing me about money and won’t listen to me at all. Sorry for this rant, I just don’t know who to talk to."

Just finished a class in networking fundamentals and I feel like there are still huge gaps of information and ""fundamentals"" I have no clue about. I was very keen on nailing the 7 layer osi model covered in the first phase of the course as I knew we'd go over each. During quizzes and assignments I feel like I did not absorb anything in the chapter and had to keep looking up basic definitions and examples of the client and server relationship. It feels like throughout the course all these terms get used interchangeably in unrelated scenarios and I don't even know how to orient myself. 

We did not have any labs this course like we did with survey of operating systems. All we used was Wireshark for some hands on assignments and I took to tutorials and articles to figure how what the heck I was looking for as our textbook wasn't much help.

I'm hoping it will all come together obviously by the time I graduate. Definitely when I start my internship which is a year away. I know this is just an associates degree but it's disheartening spending all this time studying and it is so much information without any hands on real world labs to work in which help the most for me. It just gets me discouraged and worked up on how well I will demonstrate what I've learned in my internship and in my first IT role.

Have any of you found once you started doing work related tasks to IT and being in the environment that it became easier to retain the information? How much of your textbook help you and classroom time?"

2. A crossword club — recreational club made just bc my friends and I liked crosswords
3. Intern at a Legal Office — did a good number of volunteer hours here, but I don't think it was particularly impressive
4. Obligatory piano involvement, because I'm Asian, and some Ballroom Dance. Also all done for fun (read: close to no awards, just certificates for passing grade levels, and, I think, a minor thing in the AOs eyes).
5. Language learning on the side, purely for fun (never became particularly proficient in any)
6. That's it y'all. 💀 That's literally it. Half of my EC list is literally just stuff I thought was fun.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Questbridge National College Match Finalist — I didn't Match. So.... yeah
2. National Latin Exam (for 4 years! Did very well, but also a school/class-based thing oops.)
3. That's all 💀 Unless you count attendance awards from elementary school?

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. History (7/10) - I really loved this teacher but I don't think I was the most interesting student so IDK if she had anything to write. I also did everything related to requesting recs and filling out questionnaires rather late.... genuinely felt so bad about this
2. Math (7/10) - Another case of an amazing teacher that I loved so much but I was just a bit of a boring child. She asked me to send her a college essay to read and I sent a really bad draft (I started essay writing late, and I sent this draft late too. SORRY)
3. Guidance Counselor (8/10) - I think my counselor understood me on a more personal level (I talked about some really personal things that were troubling me during senior year), but I am a somewhat reticent person and didn't reach out to her very much before the college process began.

**Interviews**

What they say about interviews not mattering very much is really REALLY true. They either help you slightly (shows interest in that you accepted/reached out for an interview) or they hurt you (if you're a walking red flag. Rare, but ig if you're a red flag don't do interviews?)

**Northwestern** (7/10) - My interviewer knew a bit about law and we had an interesting discussion on the Commerce Clause, but I don't think my answers were particularly impressive, and it was virtual so it was hard to gauge his reaction at all.

**Princeton** (6/10) - I think I was super unprepared and I regretted not asking specific questions about the interviewer's profession because he was literally a lawyer. I want to do law. But I got intimidated. So embarrassing

**Georgetown** (9/10) - The interviewer was literally amazing, but I was too shy, I think, so it felt like she had to pry answers out of me with targeted questions, and I think that definitely docked me a little. But we also talked for ages and ages. The best interview I've ever had.

**Stanford** (3/10) - Virtual, like the Northwestern one, but even less of a personal connection. I think it was because of the Stanford interview that I started pushing to make everything in-person.

**Columbia** (8/10) - I think my interviewer was impressed by what I was saying in relation to my interests (at least on an intellectual level), but I also accidentally ghosted her when she initially reached out to me + since I had no ECs to speak of and weak research to continue the conversation, the interview sputtered out a bit.

**Essays** (8/10) - Questbridge asks for two essays. I had one that was based on the bad draft I mentioned earlier (under Math Rec, if you guys weren't reading closely 🙄🙄) about glasses and perspective/worldview, which in my opinion sucked. The second one I was rather proud of; it was juxtaposing myself with Pinocchio, and a statement on how I felt the need to lie about my family situation and financial circumstances all the time because of the ever present shame I felt about being indigent, and showcased how I eventually learned that literally no one cares through working in my community/tutoring.

**Decisions**

*Acceptances*:

Swarthmore (QB Match -> RD) (which I thought was super weird bc I wasn't even offered an interview?? But also I was SO HAPPY) -> committed

various safeties

*Waitlists*:

University of Rochester (RD)

Skidmore (RD)

*Rejections*:

Lehigh (RD)

Northwestern (QB -> RD)

Princeton (QB -> RD) (my second choice 💀)

Stanford (QB -> RD)

Williams (RD)

Georgetown (RD) (upsetting to say the least, bc I thought my best supps were here + amazing interview. probably thought i would be a bad fit though)

Columbia (QB -> RD)

And lastly, my dream school (as concocted in one of my various prestige-induced stupors)...

>!Yale (QB->RD) — you'll notice that there has been no mention of Yale anywhere in this post prior. Yes, they did not offer an interview. Yes, I felt crushed when I saw this decision (and I saved it for last, so it was after all the other rejections that day 💀💀💀) But it also made me realize that, maybe, just maybe, it WASN'T the right school for me. That maybe the school that would suit me best and develop my specific interests the most was SWARTHMORE! So I've essentially attempted to extirpate Yale and any mentions or thoughts of it from my mind and my writing, so that I could finally recover from this ungrounded assumption that somehow Yale was the only choice for me.!<

As you can see, for these particular schools, my stats were pretty far below average and my ECs were all the more lacking. The only thing I had going for me, then, was being broke and having essays. And the only thing there that I actually have any leverage over is my essay-writing, and thus I believe that having strong essays must have been the key to my admission. I don't know what they saw in my essays (goofiness? verbosity?) but somehow it worked, and I am so so so grateful.

I did not have anyone read over my essays. I regret that now, knowing that my application would have cried out for joy if only there were a reader other than [grammarly.com](https://grammarly.com) and my drowsy midnight self. I also wrote my essay a day before the Questbridge deadline (I think the deadline was Sept 27th?), which is a terrible, TERRIBLE idea. Please do not do things last minute :D

I also struggled a lot with my supplemental essays, floundering a lot because I didn't really know what to say and I was eking out all my brain juice hours before the deadline (noticing a pattern?) I know for a FACT that, of the schools that I was rejected from in QB, I had the most horrendous supplementals to ever be conceived, some of which were recycled from other prompts and then contorted and banged into some irregular shape in order to fit a different prompt simply because I was running out of time. Please do not do this. Give yourself ample time to get everything done AND have time to review/edit AND have people look it over. Even if it feels super weird and awkward (that's how it felt for me, and that's why I didn't want anyone looking over mine), if you can get someone to read it, DO get someone to read it.

**A final note:**

I am privileged. I grew up in an environment where, despite not knowing whether there would be dinner that night, or wondering if we'd soon be tossed to the streets, I was allowed to—even *encouraged* to—pursue education and learning. I attended a high school that was filled with rich students and teachers with dazzling academic credentials, where I knew that I needed to study harder, to be better. Not everyone has that privilege (in fact, just today I was reminded of just how fortunate I am, when reading about a high schooler, just like me, was told by her dad that it would be better to just drop out and work at the family restaurant. Told to abandon her dreams of med school. Told that books did nothing for an empty stomach), and I recognize this. Even in admissions decisions, I had agonized over being rejected from an Ivy. Not everyone has the privilege of even *dreaming* of an Ivy. I count my lucky stars, then, whenever I remember that I will be the first to go to college."

**Awards/Honors**

These were so sad 😭

1. AP Scholar

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

I don't know how good my LORs were because my school really wasn't equipped to deal with applying abroad. I did get letters from my counselor, Math teacher and CS teacher all of whom were very sweet and have known me for years. I'm sure they would've spoken about me positively but don't know if these letters would have stood out (maybe I'm being too harsh oof). Still really thankful they wrote for me though.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Stanford- 6/10: This was my first interview, so I was a little nervous. But my interviewer just seemed disinterested from the minute we started and that really threw me off. He did have some anecdotes about his time at the school that were great to listen to though.

Duke- 10/10: LOVED this interview and came out wanting to go to more lol. My interviewer was really sweet and she had participated in a lot of programs that I was really passionate about joining at Duke. We connected really well and this was the only reach school I was a little disappointed to not get into.

**Essays**

I didn't get to show my essays to anyone so this is just my personal opinion.

CommonApp Essay- 9/10: I started my main essay like a month before the EA deadline? I spoke about my connection with words- from when I was a child and how that evolved as I grew up (kind of like a full circle story). Probably one of my best pieces of writing. 

Supplementary Essays: I really enjoy writing so I definitely had a lot of fun with these, although I did most of them the week before they were due (wrote around 30 essays during winter break, would not recommend). I tried to cover a wide variety of topics for each school to make my essays as less repetitive as possible and think I did a great job (honestly, who knows?). Only had very few essays that I was unhappy with.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Rejections:*

Not sad about these as all were reaches (maybe expect Georgia Tech?). My parents wanted me to apply to some and others were ones that I wanted to apply to just so I wouldn't have regrets later.

* Georgia Tech (EA- okay I lied, this was the only rejection I was really sad about. Would have loved to go.)

**Additional Information:**

I understand that I don't have the strongest profile according to A2C standards, but I'm honestly pretty happy with my results. As someone who started researching the process during November of junior year and only with access to online help, I think I did pretty well! I didn't really have time to plan my ECs according to what I thought colleges would like or according to my major and I ended up doing just the things I liked throughout school and I think (I hope?) that showed.

Honestly, I had planned to never post my college results here but changed my mind because this hopefully might help some other international students going through the same process. If you all have any doubts or want someone to go over your essays or something, feel free to reach out!

13egem8,4,2023-05-11,Debating between Berkeley Data Science and UCLA Applied Math,stressedandsobbing,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13egem8/debating_between_berkeley_data_science_and_ucla/,"Hello! I recently was accepted off the waitlist for Berkeley's data science major. I've been feeling super torn between Berkeley and UCLA, because UCLA was my dream school but I want to pursue data science and take more CS-related courses compared to UCLA's applied math or math of comp majors which are more theoretical. These are the reservations I have about Berkeley:

\- Campus/surrounding neighborhood safety, especially compared to UCLA

\- Academic stress and difficulty: I'm nervous about the general stereotype of Berkley being a really competitive and stressful environment. I also heard that a lot of the CS courses are extremely difficult, and the only experience I have in CS is AP CSA. I'm concerned that I won't be able to handle the workload at Berkeley or have to end up studying all the time just to keep up and be stressed constantly with no social life.

I'm used to working hard since my high school is really competitive and rigorous, and I’m aware that I probably wouldn't be able to maintain a 4.0 into college, but how difficult is it to have around a 3.0-3.5 gpa? How much time do people usually spend studying and how do people here balance their academics with other activities?

\- Being able to declare my major: how hard is it to pass the DS prerequisites with at least a 2.0…

\- Housing: because the housing situation is so bad, how difficult is it to find good housing for all 4 years?

Other questions:

\- For CS/DS majors, what do you think of the department? What opportunities are available to undergrads, especially clubs, research, internships etc. (also in comparison to UCLA's L&S)

\- What fun stuff/social activities are there at Berkeley? I kind of want to learn to dance (no prior experience).

I also love UCLA's campus and food but the biggest factor for me is the major and academic opportunities. I'll also be visiting Berkeley this week. :D If anyone has some time to help or provide more insight from current students perspective that would be really really appreciated. Thanks in advance!!"

I am a complete beginner and honestly have gotten this internship through a referral and a bit of smooth talking in interviews.

I know a bit about cybersec but consider me a complete beginner.
The job description is as follows:
“The following needs to be studied by you
1) Most common security threats
2) Overview of Common vulnerabilities and exceptions(https://www.cve.org/)
3) What is the OWASP project ?
4) As part of the various resources to mitigate the threats, DAST(Dynamic 
Application Security testing ) tools are identified.
https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools
5) You have to download some(number depends on the time available with you, 
after you do the study) of the open source DAST tools available and run them 
on a web application and provide a comparison of the tools.

Project Title could be ""Comparison of Open source DAST tools""”

So if I am exploring the field of Cyber sec and a potential Career option, would this work help me get a better hold of it as in help me understand it better? Also, what is the quality of this work? Will I learn anything useful?

Lastly, would this internship experience help me in my resume and/or help me in interviews for SDE roles in placements/internship interviews in on campus placements.
(I am a second year student rn at an IIT but from mechanical Engineering and hope to get into the software field)

Any help is appreciated."

I’ve been doing an internship in the job of my field for over a year (Business research/analytics). My GPA is great, there’s no way it’s getting me filtered out unless they want a 4.0. 

In the last six months I’ve applied for dozens and dozens of jobs. I have had 2 interviews in that time. The first ghosted me after the interview, the second told me they went with a more experienced candidate. How could I possibly have more experience? What am I doing wrong? Is the field just so competitive that it’s impossible to find a truly entry level position? Any advice is appreciated. I’m getting pretty desperate at this point."

This summer I want and need to make my portfolio as I’m an animation student and have my internship applications this winter. A lot of my friends are already way ahead of me and have been working nonstop since school ended, creating amazing work, but I’ve just hit some sort of wall. The moment the semester ended I crashed so hard. We have a super intense program, around 10 classes per semester with around 20 credits, and I was basically working 16 hours a day 7 days a week. I was sleeping nonstop for a week after school ended. The following week I tried to start working, but kept falling asleep at my desk and got nothing done. This week has been the same, except now I can’t even get out of bed. I’m just tired all the time, no matter how much sleep I get. Sitting in an upright position makes me exhausted. I feel physically and mentally weak. All while there’s a voice in my head yelling at me to get to work, but I just keep laying there. Some friends I’ve spoken to that have continued to be productive tell me they didn’t care about school and basically did the bare minimum and worked on their own stuff instead. This allowed them to keep their momentum into summer, and now I regret not doing that. I busted my ass in every single class I had and now I’m stuck. I cannot get myself to work and just want to sleep all day despite the guilt I feel. Is this just massive burnout or is there something wrong with me?"

I attended university as a Chemical Engineer with a minor in computer science in Ontario, Canada.  I graduated a year ago and have since struggled to find a job in Chemical Engineering within my province. 

Speaking to colleagues has persuaded me that leaning into my computer science minor might be the way to go instead but I worry that my lack of work experience in the field (I did an 8 month internship which included a little bit of programming but was mainly geared towards chem eng) as well as the fact that I only have a minor puts me at a severe disadvantage compared to other applicants.  

I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit has experience with a masters in cs (please specify if course or thesis based) and whether or not a course or thesis based graduate degree would be worth the time and money to help me land a job in the field. I appreciate any help. Thank you all!"

I feel stressed in a way. At the moment I'm the only junior on backend part (Spring Boot) and my first tickets were something like creating a new crud rest api, which yeah, it's pretty easy, but still I'm afraid I can't do my tickets in time. 

Structure of the project also seems really complex to me and sometimes I don't really know what I'm doing - I just copy-pasting chunks of code from other developers. I don't even know what I will do when I will be assigned with new more complex tickets. 

Is it okay to feel like that? In the past I thought impostor syndrome it's a joke, but now I feel like a very big one."

I recently graduated with my MSEE in mixed signal design and I have been applying at ASIC/FPGA design and verification roles but have not gotten much luck. I got an offer for a hardware board design engineer role at a large semiconductor company (AMD) ,since I have 2 years of experience working in board design and some FPGA stuff.

It is a decent offer and the only offer I have currently, however I wish to work in a more chip design/verification role. Will it be possible to internally transfer from the hardware design team to a ASIC/FPGA design or verification team within the company after a while? 

Should I take the offer and pursue side projects? Will it be hard to get into a chip design oriented role a year or so after getting an MS? I got my masters part time and online, therefore I wasn’t able to get an internship in the asic design/verification unfortunately.

Any advice will be helpful, thank you"

I tried solving 30 leetcode sums in one week, got hang of it but now again I'm afraid to start.

Plus, one of my friend got selected for GSOC and it's a huge deal so I dunno people expect me too to get into some big shot this summer. I tried getting internship, no luck. Just one company hr keeps saying he'll get back and all but still no response. 

So I decided to focus on open source contribution this summer along with learning Ai/ml but then I feel, I'm wasting a bit of time and need to solve leetcode too.

**Thoughts:**

I'm incredibly grateful to be committed to UNC-Chapel Hill! #GoTarHeels

I think, in general, I overestimated the power of one's extracurriculars and activities vs one's stats. It really is a game of luck. Compared to my school, I had mid-stats, and my essays were written pretty formally. While they were genuine, I think that nowadays, colleges are looking for more quirky (?) or self-aware type of writing. (Just my theory pls don't attack lol) I know it is difficult to achieve a T20/T10 regardless, but I would like to hear your guys' theories on what parts of my application led to my decisions!

I don't want to seem ungrateful AT ALL, but UNC is pretty expensive for me and while I am going to give UNC a try, I really wanted to attend a smaller private school on the east coast with a notable Philo/study abroad at Oxford program. So, I am considering transferring after my first year. If you guys have any resources, tips, or advice about transferring after your 1st year, please drop them below! Thank you guys and good luck next year!"

sunt in căutarea unui internship, fiind studentă în anul 2 la UPT pe automatică si calculatoare.
Printr-un proiect organizat de liga studențească am participat în cadrul firmei Continental la niște laboratoare organizate de ei, long story short ajung la perioada de sfarsit a acestei activități si mi-a fost oferita o pozitie de Internship in cadrul companiei.
Separat am aplicat la un internship la Hella la care totul a mers bine si mi-a fost oferit si aici un post, doar ca in proiectul de Summer Practice, urmând ca după să poată fi extins dacă totul merge bine.
Sunt putin cam nehotărât legat de oferta pe care sa o accept si ma gandeam ca ma puteti ajuta cu niste argumente pro/contra despre firme. 
Mentionez că la Hella internshipul al fi unul de software developer pentru partea de testare, iar la Continental încă nu stiu exact cum ar fi titulatura, dar ceva legat de embedded systems. 
Mersii fain!"
13ewz8c,1,2023-05-11,CUNY or Top Mexican University for CS,CuriousStudentEc,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13ewz8c/cuny_or_top_mexican_university_for_cs/,"Hi everyone, I am currently a Bachelor’s student of CS in Tecnologico de Monterrey, located in Mexico, which is the #2 best Mexican university, top #170 globally and top #86 for cs globally. It recently came to mind transferring or just applying to certain CUNY colleges, more specifically City College of New York or Hunters College, since I have always wanted to live in New York and I think studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there. 

My question is, which one do you think would be a better choice? I would really like a job at FAANG, and I know that many of the cs students at my current university have had internships at FAANG and also have jobs in this companies. But I also think that studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there (is it not?), since I think these companies would prefer people studying in the US at a not prestigious college rather than a somewhat prestigious college in another country, which is why I was thinking of applying and going study there.

What do you think would be the best choice for me? 

I should mention that my gpa isn’t that good, which is why I didn’t think of applying to some university more prestigious than CUNY, and that I am about to finish my first semester here."

The stars were many and bright. Beautiful and small. He looked up and marveled at the gift he was given, to observe the night sky in all its glory. He always did love stargazing, every bit of it. He knew the names of the constellations and the stars that made them. He knew how many there were in the sky, and because of that, he thought he could see forever.

  
He was wrong.

  
He woke with a start and squeezed his eyes shut. He never did like how bright the lights were when they turned on. The automatic cycle always lit them at the same time, and always startled him out of a dream. He squeezed his eyes shut tighter, and began to wonder why the ancient Humans decided to make every light so bright. After a few minutes of contemplation, when he deemed himself ready, he opened his eyes slowly. At first, only light greeted him, but as his eyes adjusted, he decided, for the millionth time, that he was finally going to paint his bedroom walls black.

  
He rolled himself out of his bed and stood up, rubbing his eyes and yawning. He never was someone who woke up quickly. He slept like a log and awoke just as fast. Still half-asleep, he trudged over to his wardrobe and pulled some clothes off the hangers. He knew not what he picked, for he had the agency of a zombie and the vision of a mole. So he just put them on and opened his bedroom door. His house was laid out like any other. It was two stories, with four bedrooms on the second floor. Each bedroom was for a different member of the family. The first and farthest from the stairs was his own. Across the hall from his bedroom was his little sister’s, though she would already be at school having lunch by now. Next to her bedroom was their mother’s, who was probably asleep, judging from the lack of light shining from under the door. Finally, next to his bedroom, was his father’s, who would probably be on his way home from work about this time.

  
Still groggy, he headed towards the stairs, making sure to step lightly as he passed his mother’s room. As he reached the bottom floor, he heard the sound of kitchenware softly clinking against itself. He supposed his father was cleaning up after his dinner. Armed with the knowledge that his father was indeed home, he crouched, steadied his breathing, and started towards the sink. Keeping his steps as soundless as possible, he crept closer and closer to his oblivious father. As he approached, he stood up and extended his hand, intending to scare the heavens out of his patriarch. The tip of his fingers were inches away from the back of his father’s neck. He smiled in anticipation and lunged forward.

  
Only to catch a pot full of cold water straight to the face.

  
He fell backwards, coughing and spluttering, wondering where he went wrong. He rubbed his eyes, clearing his vision before looking up at his father’s chuckling silhouette .

  
“You’ve really got to learn how to keep your laughing quiet, kiddo.” His father smiled, extending his hand.

  
“Hey! It’s not my fault you’re used to listening closely, you’re an exterminator!” Accepting his father’s hand and standing up, he laughed loudly.

  
His father shrugged. “I guess you’re right about that, bud. But you should be much more alert, you are a hopeful cargo pilot.”

  
“Yeah, I guess.”

  
“Speaking of which, you’ve got work starting soon, yes?” His father asked.

  
“Well, it is an unpaid internship, so it’s not technically work, but yes. I have to be at the landing pad right on the fourth Chime.”

  
His father glanced at the display on his wrist, eyes widening.

  
“You had better get going then! It’s a few clicks away, so you should have enough time, if you hurry.” His father opened the refrigerator, pulling out a small plastic container, “Here, your mother packed you lunch for today.” Tossing it over, he smiled, “Catch!”

  
Reflexively, his eyes widened at the food hurtling towards him. Food was precious, but he held his lunch in higher regard than most, so he thrust his arm out, seizing his beloved sustenance. As he breathed a sigh of relief, he examined the container.

  
“Is this spaghetti?” He asked, taking the food.

  
“Yes” His father responded.

  
“With the good sauce?”

  
His father smirked, “I think you know.”

  
He smiled wide, throwing his right hand up in the air, “YES!”

  
Chuckling, his father waved, “Have a good day at work, son!”

  
He turned towards the door, waving goodbye to the family member he saw most often.

  
“Sleep well!” He responded, pushing the door open and breaking out into a run towards the landing pad.

  
Luna was always bustling. There was constant movement, people rushing to and from their jobs. Everyone was important. Some people dashed towards the soil farms, where fruits, vegetables and precious, oxygen-producing trees grew. Others made their way towards the cell farms, where cellular cloning of meat, eggs and other similar animal products took place. Everyone had a different schedule, determined by which job you had. The farmers always had rotating shifts, so at any given time, there was a farmer leaving from a hard days work, and a farmer arriving to give it their all. The only constant in the Lunan rat race was the Chimes. At a set interval, in every habitat-dome, loud bell tones rang depending on how many have rung before it. The first Chime was when most schools started session, the bells ringing once. The second Chime was when most stores and outlets opened up, bells ringing twice. At the third Chime the bells rung three times and at the last Chime the bells rung ten times. After the tenth Chime the cycle reset, starting from the first, repeating unto eternity.

  
By the end of the tenth Chime, the lights on Terra had visibly rotated, so he always made a point of watching.

  
He though about all this as he sprinted towards the landing pad as fast as he could. Weaving in between adults and children alike, quick and agile. He always was very coordinated, leaping and vaulting over anything in his way to hopefully arrive before the fourth Chime.

  
After a while, he saw the landing pad in the distance. He also heard the bells begin Chiming and he knew he had to rush.

  
The bell chimed once, he leaned forward and ran harder.

  
The bell chimed again, he ducked under a palette on its way to the warehouse nearby.

  
The bell chimed a third time, he fumbled for his access key, scanned it and slammed open the gate, seeing his boss looking at her watch, waiting for him.

  
The bell chimed for the fourth time, he tripped and fell on his face, skidding on the rough tarmac before coming to a stop right at his boss’s feet.

  
“You’re late, kid” She looked at him with disappointment. “What do you have to say for yourself?”

  
“I’m sorry, I got held up on the way! I was on my way, earlier than usual, when I happened to look up and I saw a light in the sky that wasn’t on Terra!”

  
“Gee, where have I heard that before?” His boss sighed. “Listen kid, you have potential, but the more you talk about lights in the sky, the crazier I think you are. Give me the real reason before I put you on cutter duty.”

  
“Okay Boss, I’ll tell you! I don’t want cutter duty please!” He pleaded for mercy, clasping his hands together and praying she wouldn’t make him do it. “I just spent too much time at home playing with Father!”

  
Boss looked at him, squinting suspiciously. “Okay kid, you’re clear.”

  
""Really? Yes!” He bounded up and down with excitement. “I hate cutter duty!”

  
“Don’t mistake me, this will go on your record, which is pretty abysmal as it is. Work harder.” Boss grabbed his ankle as he went flying above her. “Don’t get too excited, I don’t want you to cause any damage to the equipment.”

  
He quickly calmed down, knowing she wouldn’t hesitate to kick him off the team if he did damage anything.

  
“Sorry boss” He apologized. “So, where am I working today anyway?”

  
“Cutter duty.” Boss replied simply.

  
“What?” He said indignantly. “You said you wouldn’t put me down for that, I apologized, didn’t I?”  
“Yes, you did, but I had already scheduled you for cutter duty before you were late.” Boss smirked. “Nothing personal kid, good luck!” She turned away and waved, heading off to help the pilots check the ship before takeoff.

  
“Cutter duty, I hate cutter duty. It’s too boring.” He muttered angrily to himself as he reluctantly made his way over to the workbench, depositing his lunch in the nearest fridge and donning heat-resistant work gloves. On the workbench was a face-shield and a small object shaped like a metal stick with a handle. He grabbed both, putting on the face-shield and flicking a switch on the plasma knife, flaring the business end up with searing blue light.

  
“I guess it’s time to cut.” He sighed, pulling over a large piece of sheet metal with a design etched into it’s surface. “I’m in it for the long haul today.”

  
So his started his work day, spending so much time at the workbench that he had the design memorized, where to cut, where to fold and weld the sheet metal together, and what electronics went where. He was technically only on cutter duty, but that entailed more than just cutting the metal. The job of the cutter is to take a piece of sheet metal, cut out the shape of a rudimentary piece of equipment, and assemble it as instructed. He had been working long enough to know enough about schematics to assemble the machine, which appeared to be a thin panel that could fold to about a quarter of it’s original size. He raised an eyebrow, why would anyone want just a panel on their ship, it would just take up space! He looked at the schematic again, reading the new equipment’s description before widening his eyes in surprise. It was a panel that could absorb energy from the artificial light in their domes! This could mean that anyone with access to this panel could draw energy directly from any light source! Flashlights, house lights, streetlights. It’s a completely portable energy source!

  
He looked at the panel again, now noticing that it was no ordinary piece of metal. This piece was more like a titanium sandwich, with an incredibly strange crystalline material inside. The outer layer of metal was colored black, presumably to absorb as much light as possible. He tilted his head, curious as to why this wasn’t in use publicly, like on sidewalks or roofs to recycle all the lost light energy.

  
Figuring this would eventually be useful in some way, he made sure no one was looking  
before discreetly copying the schematic and instructions to his private folder on the company’s server. Satisfied with his daily act of rebellion, he got up, grabbed his spaghetti lunch from the fridge, and turned his attention back to work, listening to the Bell outside chime eight times.  
On the ninth Chime, he stretched. The panel he had been working on was finished, and his shift as the unlucky schmuck on cutter duty ended. He stood up, stuffing the empty lunch container into his bag. It was only a little after the ninth Chime, so he had a little time to say goodbye to his coworkers and Boss before heading out the door to his favorite place.

  
His favorite place in the dome he lived in was a little hill with one lonely tree atop it. As he approached the tree, he looked up, admiring the planet Terra above him. Terra was the only source of light in the sky, and so, instead of stargazing, he watched the Terran city lights. He only knew the name of one. The brightest light was the capital of Terra, the city of Oppidum. Oppidum is a large city made up of the Prima Oppidum, the largest and central light, and the Oppidula, four smaller lights in a circle around and connected by lines of light to the Prima Oppidum.  
So he laid down under the tree, watching Terra and its many lights. Prima Oppidum was clearly visible, along with the Oppidula on the right side of the planet. He pointed at each Oppidula, naming them as he went.

  
“Greg, Bob, Anna and Penny.” He laughed. His names were never that good, and they were always different from the last time he saw Oppidum. He moved his finger along the surface of Terra, naming all of the lights and patterns he saw, counting each one. Then he saw something new.  
He sat up. There was a bright light on Terra's left side. It shone brighter than every light he saw, brighter than even Oppidum by several orders of magnitude.

  
“Huh, that’s weird.” He wondered aloud. “It almost looks like it’s coming from behind.”

  
He watched that new light as Terra rotated, getting brighter by the second, before separating from Terra entirely. His jaw dropped.

  
There was a new light in the sky!

  
Giddy with excitement he reached for his bag, intending to capture a picture of this strange new light to show his family. When he finally found his phone, he opened its built in camera and angled it towards the light, which was nowhere on his screen. He paused, putting his phone down and looking at the sky with his own eyes to find the new light. He did, but he noticed that it was moving away from Terra. Mesmerized, he continued watching the light as it stopped for a while. He used this opportunity to snap a quick picture before the light began moving again, this time towards the surface of Terra. The light moved slowly, almost as if hesitant to approach, before streaking towards Oppidum like a comet, and disappearing.

  
He only had a second to wonder if he was dreaming, before seeing a bright orange flash on Terra's surface, and noticing with horror that one of the Oppidula had gone out.

I’m an incoming senior in CompE and only have a 3.25 gpa at a pretty popular state school, though I’m working on getting it up. I feel proficient in coding but honestly only feel decent at actual hardware engineering, though I did find junior design easy.

I have not had any luck getting and internship and now that I’m looking towards getting a job I’m a bit anxious that I’m not going to have much success there, I’m especially worried about technical interviews since I’ve never had one before. 

Is the job obtaining process generally very difficult? Please let me know if you have any tips or advice."

I don't feel fully confident or necessarily really good in any one language or type of coding as I've done a lot. How do I decide what I will want to focus on for when I'm looking for a job. I feel I should have a focus when job searching or looking for internships and not just go into it thinking ""yeah I just want to be a software developer"" I should instead have a specific field or type of software I want to develop.

So I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student doing an internship to get some experience. Mostly I've been doing simple tech support and handling basic issues. My supervisor asked me to clean up some old files on one of the servers to free up space. He left for a meeting and I got to work.  
  
Now, I know my way around Linux and servers, I thought this would be easy. As I was deleting old log files and backups, I accidentally typed 'rm -rf \*' into the wrong directory. I instantly realized my mistake, but it was too late. I had just wiped every single file on the main database server.  
  
Panic set in. 5 years of records, course materials, enrollment info, you name it - gone in 10 seconds of stupidity. I broke into a cold sweat, paralyzed not knowing what to do.  
  
The server was redundant, so data could be restored from back ups, but those were in the hands of another department. I had to confess to my supervisor what just happened.  
  
He turned ghostly white, swore a bit, but then focused on contacting the backup admins to start an emergency restoration. I spent the rest of the week helping get data back online and apologizing profusely.  
  
At the end of my internship, my supervisor said I caused some of the most dramatic on-the-job experience he's ever witnessed, but appreciated how I owned up to my mistake and helped fix it. While they'll be double checking any commands I enter for now on, I'm still welcome back again next term!  
  
Lesson learned…be VERY careful when wielding powerful commands, especially on production servers. RIP data, you will not be forgotten! I will always be haunted by that ""rm -rf\*"".  
  
TL;DR: Accidentally wiped out my university's entire database as an IT intern, spent a week restoring from backups and groveling for forgiveness. On-the-job experience gained, humility attained, and commands now triple-checked."

Letter of rec #1: 8/10
From my AP seminar teacher, he thought I was incredibly smart and talked about my ap research project and my writing skills etc. Didn’t have a ton to talk about besides AP capstone. Wrote my older brother his LOR and he got into USC so

Letter of rec #2: 9/10
From my business/ap research teacher, I’ve had him for 4 different classes, 3 business classes and the other was ap research. He loves me, however I got a chance to read it later on and it mostly focused on AP research rather than the stuff I did with DECA which I was hoping he’d write more about since my other teacher would touch on that more.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Common app was well written, however the substance of what I was talking about could’ve been better, I tried too hard to be metaphorical. My UC essays on the other hand I thought were really good. For my supplemental essays I wish I did my USC one later because that was the first I did and probably my worst, my other supplementals were much better after.

**Additional Information:**

Going into this process after reading all these posts, I went in expecting to get rejected from everywhere which I pretty much did, but my parents had high hopes I’d get in everywhere. It’s been a whirlwind. Originally back in November I was a POSSE finalist and matched with a school, but ultimately didn’t go through with it because that gave me hope I’d get into somewhere better. Then I got all these rejections and debated on planning to go to UCSD. Then I got the Trojan transfer plan and decided to commit to go to community college for a year, then an hour after I told my parents I decided on community I got an email that I was off the waitlist at Berkeley and I committed the next day. Reflecting back I wish I would’ve applied to USC Dornslife as an Econ major instead of to Marshall which I realized later I was going to get rejected from, however I’m ecstatic to be going to Berkeley this fall 🐻‼️"

It's true though what he said though, the code's shitty quality (I don't have any idea how to design the code so I just did it... and it works but it's hard to read) and the command line interface is too confusing. Where do I pick up from here though? My internship is ending soon and it looks like he's going to rewrite the whole thing or throw it away. And when I leave nobody is going to maintain it, the principal engineer already told me that from the start.

This sucks. How do I improve my programming skills so this doesn't happen again?

I got accepted to UC BERKELEY AND JHU. I got into Berkeley as Data Science major and JHU as Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I also plan to study double major with CS at JHU. Now I got a bit struggle between choosing these 2 schools. 

UC BERKELEY 
PROS: 
#1 for DATA SCIENCE OR CS
BAY AREA- great for start up, tech internships 
Cons:
Harder to switch major if I want to change
Big school- more competitive to get resources 

JHU
PROS: 
Very easy to do research here( based on what’s I heard from current student)
Open curriculum- double major, triple major, change major very easy 
I visited the campus and love it. 
Cons:
Not good at cs as Berkeley 
Not huge start up culture or cs culture 

I also want to go to industries after I graduated so I don’t know if Berkeley or JHU would be a better fit. My goal of coming to college of is also figure out what I like or love.

13f6e2a,2,2023-05-11,I (M29) I am interested in my student (F21-22),jeshuah9344,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13f6e2a/i_m29_i_am_interested_in_my_student_f2122/,"**BG:** I have been teaching students of 6th, 7th and 8th semesters of university since the beginning of the pandemic. I've never been very open to people in general. Specially after the pandemic. Since this semester began I've been actively looking for other jobs outside of education. I want to go back to creating projects in regards to the courses I teach. I don't have a relationship, I haven't been looking for one either, I just have been working on myself and my projects.

1. This female student 21-22 yo, near the first period exams, had a dental surgery, so she was away from the class for a week and a half. She didn't had good grades because of this. But I was really forgiving in terms of date deliveries and explaining some complex exercises we made through email.I always give extra points to students who deliver essays after each period. After the first period evaluations, she delivered a plagiarised essay for each of the courses. But, when she came back from surgery, she couldn't open her mouth. I asked her about the essays and since it was difficult to communicate, I told her we would speak after the weekend. That weekend I realized a few other students did the same thing, and for some reason I felt uncomfortable to talk to her in private (I don't know why). The next class I avoided speaking to her in private and we all got a solution as a class. I obviously removed the extra points to those who plagiarised.
2. After springbreak, there has been some friendly comments with her, nothing weird, just a very few very general questions outside school stuff. ""Have you completed your internship, she told me she was from other town, I told her about my work, That I lived in her hometown, etc"".
3. Since then we've had a few times to chat. One day I injured my foot, but had to walk to school, at the end of class I asked all students if someone could give me a ride, she volunteered. She said: ""Only if you grade me an A"". I joked that I would in assistance grading only. We talked a bit about ourselves in general, I told her I was looking for a job next semester since I won't be a teacher etcetc, She told me that her employer is hiring, I exchanged details etc. **Weird part: She told me that her employer would grant her a bonus if she refer someone to the company. I told her it was a ""win win for both of us..."".**
4. She also drove me home in car that has no license plates, she left them in her hometown. This weekend without any connection I was going to travel to her hometown, I offered to bring the plates to class next week so she wouldn't drive like that. She told me she was going there this weekend so no need, but she was thankful.
5. At this point is when I began to recognize that I feel open, caring, and comfortable to talk to her. I feel excited to express myself openly and in this recognition, I also reflected on the situation above. The comments, the teacher student power dynamic is weird, and it creates interpretations that may or may not reflect the reality at all.

**This situation arose 2 years ago** with a student I really, really had a LOT in common, she was really direct to me about wanting to know each other after class was over. **I was extremely shy, I had a lot of negative self talk, and I was scared of the whole situation.** I didn't ask for advice, she did even left it open for me: ""I've had a boyfriend in the past which the age gap was bigger then yours and mine"", etc etc. **I SERIOUSLY regret not having the balls to say: ""Sure, Lets see after the course is over"" or anything that referred to interest from my part. We finished the course and things fade away in silence.**

Now, with this in mind, **I was thinking about talking to her** after one of the remaining few classes and telling her: **""Please don't answer this question until we finish the course so it doesn't get mixed up with school, I feel comfortable with you and I would really enjoy asking you out after the course is over, I didn't want to finish the semester and not say anything and then regret it"".**

I want to be straightfoward with my intentions towards her. I've never done that, I have had my regrets because of the fear of rejection. And misinterpreted all the time.

Here's the question for the advice: Today I am not feeling very straight forward about this whole thing. Is it my negative self talk? Is this situation wrong?

Thanks for the read.

13f714j,2,2023-05-11,Should I take a new job if there's a good chance I will be moving cities in 12-16 months?,Specialist_Concern11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/13f714j/should_i_take_a_new_job_if_theres_a_good_chance_i/,"Hello,

I work at a F500 company that is a little behind in my particular field (basing this off my 3 internships in same field with competitors). I enjoy parts of my job, but don't enjoy my group, and I have offer that I could get same or better pay, with more PTO, and a commute that is 5-10 minutes instead of current 35-60. Also, I think the path to what I want is more straight-forward and what I'm looking for + I would be working under someone who went to same school and specialized program as me. 

My alternative would be to stay at my current company but try and switch groups to one where I have more relationships, work would be similar but a little more streamlined with less pull from higher-ups AKA less churn. I know the potential routes to get where I want to go but not sure which one they will funnel me into. Other than the uncertainty of different culture/possibly more working hours (probably made up in commute as I work 45-50 hours anyways), I am leaning towards the job with the new company. 

My dilemma arises because my wife wants to move and is going to be applying to grad school in other cities. Most likely we will end up in a city that still has my job, but it is uncertain if either of these companies would send me if they even have an office in said cities. So, there is a very real possibility that I will leave in 12-15 months. If I take the offer with the new company, I am worried that I will be wasting their time, and giving myself a bit of a hoppy resume. However, I also think it makes sense to take the new company in case plans change (as they have many times for us recently) and I don't end up moving. For some reason I have this guilt knowing that I would be going into the role with almost the intention of leaving within the year. Even though I've talked to my wife, dad, and closest work friend about this already I am still overthinking and hence landed here asking strangers on the internet for their thoughts/experiences?"

I want to start this off by saying I am so incredibly grateful for my CT, who has been nothing but kind and understanding to me. I'm grateful to my supervisor for pulling so many strings for me and supporting me. & I'm grateful for my placement for the work they're doing for multilingual learners.

Now that that's out of the way, some context. I'm graduating with my MSed in June and am currently in a two way immersion elementary school in a full inclusion district, where my research is focused on scaffolding curriculum for multilingual learners on IEPs. I received a grant that pays for most of my tuition, but also means that my research supervisors are breathing down my neck because they need data for all these conferences they're presenting at. I'm at this school with another grant recipient who is essentially on the same track as me, same cohort, same Cooperating Teacher, oh, and same neighborhood too.

At this point, I'm not waving. I'm drowning. Because I was one of the few grant recipients with a car, I was designated to pick up my fellow ST (student teacher) because she lived about 10 minutes away from me, didn't have a car, and we had a summer internship roughly 30 minutes from home. She expressed she'd pitch in for gas & was working on getting a car herself to lighten the load. Fine, cool! Carpooling is wonderful on so many levels- I'm helping out a friend, I'm saving money, and cutting back on my carbon footprint? Score!

This was last June. I have picked her up, and dropped her off almost every day since then. I haven't received a dime. I've texted her, created a literal spread sheet to track the expenses, commented on the spreadsheet.. still nada. & I try to be understanding, we're broke ass grad students who can't work while we student teach. On top of this, my car broke down & was going to cost me over 7 grand to fix in the middle of our practicum. When trying to come up with solutions, she was of absolutely no help, forcing my hand to buy a cheap car with all of my savings just so I could get MY student teaching requirements taken care of. I get that it's not her job to help me figure out that kind of financial/ transportation issues, but why does it feel like it's mine to help her? We are in *almost identical* financial situations, so it's frustrating to have to carry this weight on my own.

Some added sprinkles, carpooling with her adds 20 minutes to my commute on a good day, but every day I have to out front for her in a busy street anywhere from 5-15 minutes, making us late every. single. day. She uses the time on the commute to do her make up, eat breakfast, or respond to emails. I get feeling like there's never enough time, but helping her out is eating away at mine. I've tried to communicate this to her, and ask her how I could support her in getting out of the house on time, but every suggestion she had has not worked when I tried to implement it.

Our research is a whole other beast. Our study is a reversal design, so we run a curriculum as it's written, switch to our intense scaffolding, switch back to curriculum, then back to scaffolds. Baseline is easy. I met my students, immediately set up my expectations/ routines, and could jam through lessons quickly. Because I was getting data so quickly, I got to move into the intervention phase, which I was excited about as I'm super passionate about our cause, but also is 20x harder. Scaffolding the hell out of this curriculum and doing multilingual explicit instruction while being videotaped to have professors score you for fidelity is *draining.* I have done 3 lessons so far, and because we only needed 5, I was eager to move back into the basic curriculum for not only the sake of my brain, but my neglected edTPA.

However, the research design has now shifted to multiple baseline. Because my fellow ST wasn't able to set successfully set up any behavior management system, her data is all over the place with her kids. All the professors that come in give her feedback to the point that she cries, but if I'm being honest, it's all super valid. However, because her data is everywhere, they've decided to just keep her with the basic curriculum for longer. Which means I have to stay in this intervention phase until the end of the year. Which means I have to spend roughly 4 more hours a week lesson planning, translating, and collecting data than her because I did a good job at making sure my group ran smoothly.

I feel for her, I know behavior management with kids is **not** easy right now. But I have a group double her size. I'm exhausted from lesson planning/ implementing, & now she's happy as hell because she can essentially kick back and relax for the rest of the year. I regret giving her the lesson plans I spent hours on after finding out that she literally just changed a few words and submitted it to our supervisor without telling me. Making it look like I'd be the one plagiarizing if I submitted my work to her.

To top it all of, cherry on the absolute tippity top of this shit mountain, our CT is leaving this year. We both interviewed for the job. She got the job at our placement, I got offered a position to the middle school it feeds into. They pitched it perfectly, & if I'm being honest, it makes sense to me after her expressing her discomfort handling 4th & 5th graders multiple times because they're too ""cool"" and scare her. I feel very grateful that I got a job, and I think that these are honestly the best fits for us.

But now everything has changed at my placement. I'm not invited to planning meetings because it's ""just about next years kids"" so it's really only important for her to be there. The other learning specialists in the building who I used to work super closely with don't even say hello to me anymore. She just got her very own big metal teacher desk to put her stuff and work from with the other specialists, while I still have to go sit at the tables in the hallways that LSAs do pull out supports at to do any kind of work.

Her afternoons are now spent planning with her team for students on her caseload, which often runs over our ""contract hours"" as student teachers, which means I have to sit in the parking lot and wait for her to wrap up. I would LOVE to go over to the middle school in the afternoons to plan with my new team, but because of my student teaching requirements, I have to essentially follow my CT. I've expressed that I won't go over my hours anymore, and she understands. But now when I do go to leave and she rushes out (refuses to get an uber) and it makes me look like a bad person for not just waiting for her?

All of this to say, while I realize this post may come off as whining or hating on a fellow grad student, it's absolutely not the case. This woman is my friend, I don't think she's doing any of this with malicious intent, and I see that a lot of it is not in her control. I care about her a lot, and I'm so happy to see her finding her groove. But now that's it's gotten to this point, I know I need to do something but can't figure out what.

I have a meeting tomorrow with my CT and my supervisor, two people who I respect tremendously. I want to explain this situation to them in a way that doesn't rat my friend out about anything, but does lay out most of the facts. I'm incredibly worried that my lack of? boundaries? might make me more susceptible to situations like this in the future. And in a field that's already so exhausting, I can see myself burning out very quickly if I don't come up with personal solutions to how I can prevent this in the future.

I want to professionally lay out all the facts, ask that my fellow ST not be affected, and honestly just get some advice from them on how I can navigate this in the future at any other school I work at. I'm on this sub all the time, and it seems like exploitation is just part of the teacher job description at this point. But I don't want to accept that. I feel lucky to have experienced something like this while student teaching, while I have mentors I'm paying to support me, rather than later down the road when my income is on the line.

I told another professor yesterday that student teaching is essentially free labor. She laughed and said ""No no, you're *paying* to be there and work."" If I'm paying to learn, gain understanding of how to be a teacher in a way that's meaningful to me, then I'd like to learn about the human part of teaching. I do not want to be a martyr, but I don't want to be a snitch. If you made it this far, I appreciate you more than you'll ever know."

I graduated College this past may and interned at an industrial supply company in my hometown. They offered me a full time position when my internship ended, and this past week, they moved me up into sales.

There’s just one thing - I have a speech impediment. I have a slight stutter and suffer from speech blocks. This means that sometimes I simply cannot get my words out.

It is so frustrating to have to pick up the phone knowing the customer may not understand me or mock me, thinking they are being funny and not realizing I have a speech impediment. I want to excel so bad though! I really do enjoy what I do, but my speech impediment is such a hindrance and I feel as though i’ll never be successful in sales.

Do any of you struggle with something like this? 

Thank you."

I just ended my final semester and will graduate with a degree in English in the fall. I pursued it out of interest and did decently in it (second upper honours). However, the job market in my country [I’m from Southeast Asia] is extremely tight, and jobs that are directly relevant to my qualifications such as teaching, editorial, marketing/communications and journalism are not hiring as much. Personally, I’m trying for marketing/communications and have held two internships during my degree, but I’m not blindly positive that I’ll immediately land one in the field. I have been applying quite a bit but I don’t hear back often; for every 50 applications I hear back from 1 or 2. I suspect I won’t land a job until August, after speaking to my seniors and going off their experience. 

I don’t want to remain idle, so I applied to an IT desk job position at a pretty big government agency (among other ‘unrelated’ jobs). The job scope is basically handling tickets, and troubleshooting/installing basic software and hardware stuff. I got the offer but it was based on my pre-university qualifications in math and computing, so the salary isn’t of a graduate. I have also negotiated with them and let them know I’ll continue looking for a job, so I’d only be signing a 6 month contract. My thought is that I’d be learning some technical skills that my degree is lacking in and have heard some opinions from people close to me that that’s always helpful. However, others tell me that if it’s not relevant I shouldn’t do it, and it might make recruiters that think I don’t know what I want. They’ve also pointed out that I could do another internship in a marketing/editorial field to make possible connections or get an admin job at a marketing company instead. So, I’m in a bit of dilemma.

I thought I might post here to get some thoughts on whether I should pass on the offer and focus full time on the job hunt in something more relevant, or whether this is worthwhile. Any and all perspectives are appreciated! :)"

I will be 19 when I start this internship, I just happened to get the offer a few weeks before turning 18. I graduated HS at 16 with a 3.0 GPA, enrolled in a community college, and did 1 year. Transferred to a SUNY as a Mathematics Major for Spring 2023. I took 3 classes(non-STEM) in order to grind for an internship, polished my resume by going to hackathons, joining the E-board of a club, and doing side projects. All the CS-related knowledge I have is self-taught and Im a chump compared to people I know. After 300+ applications with over 50 rejections, and getting ghosted by several companies, I was able to land an internship for this summer(python instructor @ camp) and the one mentioned in the title. I have worked in restaurants since I am 15 picking up dirty dishes and getting paid minimum wage, so the compensation offered to me is well enough to put me through 2 years of college which is a huge help considering I'm not getting any help from family members and I have no academic-based scholarships. It is crazy to think I was considering joining the Marines 6 months ago because I thought I was not smart enough to compete in this current market and the fear of not getting into the current University I am in. Anything can happen if you put in enough work and you sprinkle in a fair amount of luck. This post is for motivation as I know a lot of STEM students are put under a lot of pressure and I always believe in a good Reddit post can go a long way. and yes, I do have an immigrant story I milk every time I get to talk with a recruiter. feel free to contact me!"

I’m looking to go back to work soon but I know the economy currently isn’t too great and a gap on my resume doesn’t help. I enjoy coding but have not been able to focus on it much during my time off and do not feel confident in more advanced topics like system design, security, etc. I’m seriously considering getting a Master’s in CS/software engineering before getting back into the job hunt to brush up and learn some new skills to use at my next position. Alternatively, a quicker and cheaper route might be an online course/bootcamp that focuses on similar topics? Most people that I’ve spoken to have recommended just going straight into job-hunting and learning on the job but I’m not sure if that’ll work out well, especially with how competitive the market seems to be now. I’m also concerned that employers will see the gap as a red-flag but I’m not sure how to address it without revealing personal health details. Any advice or suggestions would be highly appreciated!"

Additional Information:

Ngl I was a huge prestige whore prior to the college application process. I was always trying to game the system, which left me little time to truly explore my passions. I really only did certain extracurriculars to put on my resume. I lowkey hated doing lab work, but I always felt at home in the studio. Still, my interests were varied and scattered - also why I applied for a bunch of different majors. What I'm trying to say is to not get too caught up in the college application process. Don't spend too much time stressing over a name that in the process you forget what you truly enjoy doing. Just try and have fun with it. That being said I'm super grateful to be accepted by USC to study Film & Television Production. Always had a gut feeling I wasn't really cut out for STEM, but I do like to think of myself as more of a creative arts person instead. Anyways, as cliche as it sounds, do what you love not for extrinsic validation but for yourself.

But if you really want a better chance at those t10s, from my experience, I think near-perfect academics are a prerequisite for international students. Unless you've participated in the Olympics or played in Carnegie Hall, you have to be very strong on paper for them to give more attention to the rest of your application. While it may be tempting to take harder classes for the brownie points that come with ""course rigor"", only do that if you're sure you can still maintain a near-perfect 4.0. This is because my best friends, who both got into Duke, boast 4.0s and 1600s despite fairly average ECs. In other words, better grades trump harder courses. Still, take this with a grain of salt. I'm no admissions officer."

During my application period (September to January), I came across an internship opportunity that seemed unusual. I applied to an individual who was looking for interns, but I wasn't sure about the company they represented. They showed interest in having me as an intern, but there was a condition. They required me to complete a three-month training program before starting the six-month internship.

I decided not to pursue it at the time. However, five months later, I saw the person's profile on Facebook (where we initially met) and reached out to inquire about any internship opportunities with better terms. To my surprise, he decided to rub it in that the people who accepted the offer are now working or interning.

Why didn't I get an internship, I tried for one and never heard anything back and sort of gave up as I already had 2 jobs on campus that weren't related to my field and yet they let anyone do the IT support even if they weren't taking the courses.

Upon graduation, I could find no jobs and had to take the first thing I could get, working at a bank as a ""temp"" Property Valuation officer (I had this job for roughly 4 years, I was applying to most jobs I could find but was not up for relocation scams). Eventually I moved to NJ and found a job as Printer Technician.

As a printer tech I put printers together and installed printers on clients networks (I did not get to do this job very long and they lied to me, I mostly drove a box truck that was mostly broken, it didnt stay in park most of the time, and had no GPS so I had to figure out where I was going with my phone in my hand while driving). They let me go after like 2 months (half the time I had no work, so it made sense that they didnt want to pay me to sit around).

My current job is called Customer Care/Dispatcher. Where I monitor ticketing machines and if they go down, I either reboot them or send a technician out to fix them. I then jog everything down on an excel sheet.

&#x200B;

My life at this point seems worthless and a waste. I make 2 dollars more than minimum wage (it was 10 before the increase). I'm still in financial debt for college (I've never missed a payment, however I did stop paying when they put the breaks up and talked about cancelling student debt). This and the high cost of living is what is preventing me from putting money towards certifications.

I do not know what to do. I'm applying for anything that looks like it could be somewhat entry level. According to Indeed, I've applied to 49 jobs (it's more since some do require applying out of Indeed) in the past 14 days/6 months. I've had 3 interviews first stage interviews. Two via cell phone, one in person. Only one second stage interview and I guess I bombed the interview so bad or they thought I lived too far away that I couldnt copy images from one computer to another.

I just feel like I've wasted the past 10 years of my life, my (and families) money.  Please let me know if I should delete this. Maybe I need to seek professional help or something."

Tech graduate currently working wfh in my first company as a frontend developer (with tech stack majorly focused on vue.js, js, ts). The work life balance is great and pay is more than reasonable.  
I started working from dec as an intern and got converted to full time role in may, this past couple months I have been feeling a little down, doubting my skills and sometimes it feels like I should be more skilled than I currently am. I know that it is still early in my career and I have a good role and tech stack but still sometimes it feels a lot like an imposter.  
So what I want to ask my you guys is how to overcome this imposter syndrome and how to upskill myself further, learn some other tools and languages related to my current role that will help me improve my skills.  
Currently with my tech stack, I am majorly focusing on learning how to better use debugging tools(debugger, chrome inspect, etc) to debug UI & functionality related bugs and how to better review other's PR / MR.  
please feel free to share any tips that you personally use yourself.

I am thinking of learning js and vue from scratch again(I get very much confused when doing some complex computation using array prototype methods and with promise related stuff), I think as this time I have worked on real life product, I will better understand the concepts and when to use which  js predefined function.  


Any advice or personal experience of how you unskilled/ improved yourself will be hugely appreciated.  
Thank you"

I've been reading through this subreddit and I've noticed a lot of discussions about internships and gaining experience in the tech industry. I've realised that finding relevant internships is impossible in my country without a degree. This is a concern of mine because it seems like we're falling behind the rest of the world in terms of producing adequately skilled workforce.


From what I gathered in this sub, it seems like internships are a crucial part of the learning process. They provide valuable experience and sometimes lead to full-time job offers. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, the culture around internships is not the same. This makes it difficult for us to gain relevant experience before entering the workforce. 

I don't want to feel like I've been left behind. How can I mitigate these concerns I'm having? Thanks in advance."

I was a young 18 year old when I choose ecology and although I love the environment I came across a rude awakening when I saw some of the salaries our environmental scientist made after graduation. I mean the 50 percentile of graduates earned less than 45 k a year. While the grads in the STEM department which houses computer science had a salary of over 60 K in the 25th percentile. It seemed so incredibly ridiculous. What broke me was when I took a internship for 12$ an hour working on green roofs in the hot summer day. I got paid more at my part time gig at starbucks. I was to deep into my degree to call it quits so right before graduation I had a deep conversation with my family and we decided it's best I stay and give a sincere effort at a double major/ dual degree in computer science. I know CS is very tough. I need to take calculus 1 and 2 and discrete math. I must also take Java 1 and 2 then my university does computer systems which is in C. I know C is very tough since it's such a low level language . I start with the first year course sequence in the fall, computer science 1 (in java) and calculus 1 (FML I took AP calc and it was tough). I know this degree is hard and I wont be accepted into the program unless I pass both these classes. I have to on my first try. Im ready to grind this last degree out. Taking an intro programming course in C++ over the summer to prepare for fall. I cannot wait to be confused lol"

There are so many things. I am studying so many things. But people are getting placed in CME for just few DBMS questions and then doing internship in react and getting 12 LPA.

Who am I ? Am I some mf ? Or Am I a person with high knowledge of CS things. 
I start doing development, I forget to do DSA. I do DSA then I'm not in line with dev. Such a shitty thing.

My head's bursting. Why do I see theese experience people getting laid ?


I used to believe that a person who has skills even if that get's laid, they're gonna find something back very soon. But I see ...


I shouldn't be analysing so many things. I just need to see my timeline & life. Single Player mode not a frickin multiplayer mode."

What do I do?,OwlAmazing7410,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13fu70l/first_internship_being_asked_to_develop_an_app/,"Hello all, I (first semester M.S. student, graduated with B.S. in CS last year) am about to start my first internship and I am a little nervous.

It is a center associated with my university. They engage in mechanical and environmental engineering projects, so most of them are completely in the dark on anything SWE/SWD related. One project I’m on is solid, and I have someone who is a Software Engineer who I can learn a lot from. On another, I am being asked if I can handle taking lead on a project that I am uncomfortable about, and they want me to let them know how doable it is.

Essentially, it’s a mobile app that they want to build, but the specifications are very vague and they realized yesterday they need to make clearer distinctions. My experience is one semester of Android mobile programming in Kotlin. I built 1 app in that semester but the prospect of what they are proposing seems extremely daunting, as I imagined I was going to have a more experienced person working with me. Also, I am still very much a beginner/early intermediate, and to read “Build iOS app” on the document seems like such a grand expectation.

Obviously, I am going to tell them my concerns, but how much should I express that? I don’t want to sell myself short. I value challenging myself, but with this being my FIRST internship ever I have no experience gauging my abilities for a three month period."

Alternatively I could continue searching for one and hopefully land one for Fall or Spring and then graduate in May.

Demographics: Male, Asian, NJ, public but very new school (7 years), No Hooks  
Intended Major(s): Finance/Econ Dependent on School  
ACT/SAT/SAT II: Mid-high 1400s havent gotten result back, but aiming for (1500+) so retaking in June/August  
UW/W GPA and Rank: 3.93 UW, 4.0 College GPA, No Rank  
Coursework: School has no honors/AP, but graduate with associates. However, we take school curriculum up until 11th grade and then can take any classes we want after May of 11th grade. Going to maximize my course rigor here so like Calc 1, Stats 1/2, Econ/Finance Classes, etc (going to be difficult but doing a lot over the summer), dont think anyone else in my grade is doing this  
Awards: Project Invent Semifinalist, will get more from College Honor Society/FBLA  
Extracurriculars:

Debate Club 3 year Member

Democrat College Club- focused on organizing for Democrats and discussing relevant issues related to the Democrats. Will be VP by end of May, can definitely extrapolate more out of this  
  
Project Invent Member  
  
Co-founder of FBLA- deadass made this at the end of February, won't be official club until its signed off with principal in June so we eligible next year for competitions, currently just teaching fundamentals like marketing and other concepts, will look to fundraise and do other initiatives; club is on pace to be the most popular in school  
  
Research at Rutgers/whatever t50-t20; I have a nice cold email strategy that should work (nathan a2c helped me out with it), so if it does the research is in the field of finance/econ (will start sending emails out next week)  
  
 Stem Club at college- Member, but also in this selective program for people who are the smartest at the college, do about 80-100 hours of research over the summer, and present, etc not tryna dox but this is only unique to my college in the nation so its prestigious to be in this (i have to better contextualize this)  
  
Math Club/Mu Alpha Theta Member  


College Honor Society- similar to NHS at school,  ( leadership program i have a decent chance at since i'm the only student, and will be working in the finance team. Currently being considered for director as well (can definitely contribute more and better contextualize)  
  
Student Government  - board member position, can definitely make this more significant in college apps. The next highest position is executive board so that's like VP, President, etc. Not sure if I will do that but my position rn is decent, and there is like 2-4k students on campus so can use numbers to better imply my significance, high chance I work for the new president who is sworn in next month (presidential advisory council), can make this seem better too but not trying to dox  
  
Religious Volunteer- Taught 3-6th grade boys (35-50) students about religion; additionally part of brotherhood that meets weekly; will have 150-200 volunteer hours by November  
  
Paper Trading - i have an account that i briefly did last year but now I started looking at it after SAT. Trying to learn new strategies and ways to maximize ROI (am new to stocks); thinking of turning this into a blog and talking about my experience  


Financial Internship, also school requires us to have one senior year so I got a good chance at a local Morgan Stanley Branch since ppl from my school district have interned their in the past. 

Trying to make an NPO with others online or at least a team for competitions or smth, if anyone is interested and is down just PM and we can do sum. (**TBD)**

Essays/LORs/Other: Engineering Teacher 8/10, History Teacher 7/10

Essay: 8-9/10 going to start writing Personal Statement over the summer leaving me plenty of time to change and adjust.  


**Additional Information**: No cap, will have the best applicant by far out of anyone in my grade, for reference <15 kids have been admitted into a t50 since our school was found. I have tried to do everything I can that my school allows me to do bc frankly we have nothing. Anyways if anyone wants to do some type of npo/org or do some competitions PM me, I am down to do anything with anyone.

  
Schools: 

All Ivies, Nyu Stern, Duke, Rutgers, Vandy, Tufts, UMich, Stanford, IU Bloomington, UChichago, (not sure where else to look at)

Not sure where I will ED but probably Stern  


  
Please give any tips or suggestions to improve my EC or if I even need to? I feel disadvantages because even compared to public schools we are a ""magnet"" technical schools and have no oppurtunities."

Since I only have 1 semester left (for my thesis) and I wasn't able to get into any FAANG/well known companies, I applied to internships in my home country.

There are no places I really really want to work at (at least places that are hiring interns atm), so I also applied to a research fellowship/grant at my university and thankfully got in. The project is related to Computer Vision/Deep Learning and it will also allow me to develop some coding skills (like Docker and DL frameworks). Given that my goal job would be to be a Machine Learning Engineer (more coding and less stats than a Data Scientist), would this research opportunity hurt my CV?

I've already interned at 2 other companies, but didn't really like what I worked on. One was completely bullshit (consulting), and the latest one taught me about other ML fields, but I didn't really practice coding much. This last one is considered to be very good in my country, so I'm a bit afraid that this research thing is a ""downgrade"" compared to previous position in my CV because it is less ""exclusive"". Does this matter? Would hiring managers/recruiters care? Should I go for regular internships instead?"

I'm also looking to write a bachelor's thesis in the next year (not sure how much that actually helps, lol). Have not taken the GRE, and I would prefer not to unless it's absolutely required.

Not sure what schools I should be applying to. So far, I've identified Stanford, UCLA, UCSD, Columbia, and NYU plus one safety school for MSCS. My guess is that this list is too ambitious and I'm likely to receive all rejects, but not sure what match schools I should be applying to.

Today, things reached a breaking point where he couldn't handle both his personal difficulties, and the difficulties of the business any more, any decided that he was quitting. So far things have been amicable, and we've already settled on a verbal agreement for a buyout, where I will pay him a certain amount for his half of the company. He's returning to his home country a few thousand miles away to be with family and decompress, for likely at least a year. 

It's not a real option to keep pushing forward with his ownership without him contributing any work at this point. We are experiencing high growth and anticipate seeing 4-5x growth per year for the next few years, so him leaving for a year or two just to return to a much larger company which he owns half of is not something I am willing to stomach. 

Has anyone else gone through something similar? How have you successfully picked up the slack once your business partnership ended? I've never worked alone before, and personally I feel I might slip up without the accountability a business partner will provide. Have any of you ran businesses where you are alone and succeeded? Is there anything I can read that might help me prepare for the coming shift?

This is all happening during the busy season, and he has essentially been responsible for half of our business model, so it's not going to be a trivial change. I just feel quite overwhelmed right now by what is to come, so anyone who's been through something similar that could give me advice would be helpful right now."

I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science at one of the most prestigious universities in Pakistan. Despite my academic standing, I find myself facing a few challenges that I am eager to overcome, and I'm reaching out to this community for some guidance and advice.  
  
Like many of my peers, my goal is to eventually work internationally. But before I can achieve that, there are hurdles I need to overcome. First and foremost, I've yet to secure an internship, mainly due to a lack of discipline in keeping up with applications. Additionally, I recognize that my LinkedIn profile isn't as polished as it should be, and I can't shake off the feeling that I'm lagging behind in terms of skills development. These challenges have been affecting my confidence, and I'm determined to change that.  
  
Here are the areas where I'm seeking advice:  
  
Productivity and Discipline: How do you all manage to keep track of deadlines and tasks, especially ones that aren't immediately urgent but important in the long run (like internship applications)? Any tips or techniques that have been effective in improving your discipline and productivity?  
  
LinkedIn Profile: I understand that LinkedIn plays a crucial role in professional networking and job hunting. However, I'm uncertain about how to optimize my profile. What information should I highlight and how can I use LinkedIn effectively to find opportunities, especially those abroad?  
  
Skills Development: As a CS student, what essential skills should I focus on that would make me a competitive candidate internationally? Are there any resources or platforms you would recommend for self-study?  
  
I would greatly appreciate any advice, resources, or personal experiences you could share. I believe that with improved discipline, productivity, and skills, I can enhance my professional presence and move one step closer to achieving my goal.

Sunt student în ultimul an (anul 3) la o facultate de informatica. 
În anii ăștia de studenție am avut ocazia sa ma angajez la o firma de automotive, cam acum un an.
Am început ca intern, iar odată cu începerea ultimului an am fost trecut și pe post de junior.
Salariul e mulțumitor, workload-ul și munca în sine mai mult decât lejere, astfel încât sa am timp sa îmi termin și studiile, însă problema e alta. Nu pot spune ca ma vad atât de pasionat de partea asta de embedded și automotive.

As vrea sa pot sa ma axez pe ceea ce îmi doresc cel mai mult sa fac după ce termin facultatea (orice legat de web, fie frontend, backend, ori chiar ceva fullstack).

Când am început ultimul an, am aflat ca Nagarro organizează un curs gratuit, care era împărțit pe mai multe tehnologii. Eu am aplicat pentru toate, dar am fost acceptat doar pe partea de java.
Tot ceea ce pot spune e ca tot cursul în sine (care se va termina cam peste o saptamana) a fost ceva ce chiar m-a ajutat, am învățat multe lucruri și pot spune ca am fost și destul de dedicat în tot timpul asta pentru a afla și învața chestii noi.
Recent, mentorii mi-au propus un internship la ei, care va dura cam 2 luni și care va începe fix după ce termin cu licența.
Problema e următoarea: fata de cât câștig acum, salariul ar fi cam pe jumătate, având în vedere ca de la junior ma întorc înapoi pe internship, dar nu o vad neapărat ca pe un downside, având în vedere ca as avea și ceva chestii noi de învățat și ca voi face cam ceea ce îmi place ( din ce am înțeles, pe acel proiect se lucrează in special pe backend cu spring) 
Curios și totuși dornic de a afla mai multe, am întrebat și dacă după aceasta perioada de internship voi putea continua cu ei, adică dacă voi putea trece pe post de junior sau ceva...
Mi s-a răspuns cu faptul ca nu se știe care va fi cererea de noi angajati in momentul in care voi termina cu internship-ul și ca nu ar avea cum sa îmi ofere un răspuns concret de acum...

Eu cumva as fi tentat sa accept provocarea asta, dar am și teama asta de a ieși din zona de comfort. Având in vedere ca între firma la care lucrez acum și nagarro vor exista conflicte de interese, pentru ca și nagarro are departament de automotive, situația ma cam obliga sa renunț la jobul actual in situatia in care as dori sa continui cu ei.
Asta ar înseamna totodată ca in situatia in care nu ma vor angaja după internship, voi fi cam cu ochii in soare și ar cam trebui sa îmi găsesc altceva de munca.

Voi ce ați face in locul meu? Chiar as fi curios sa vad și părerea unor oameni care au ceva background int-ale joburilor.
Eu totuși ma gândesc ca firma nu ar pierde 6 luni ca să pună niște traineri care sunt și seniori sa invete niște newbies bazele, cel puțin nu fără a le oferi acelor oameni care au terminat cursul posibilitatea de a lucra la ei.

Also, dacă cineva de pe aici lucrează la ei, orice părere e binevenita.
Mersi mult!"

So I am from India and I am currently doing B.E. in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science(BITS), Pilani.
I am almost hitting the end of my first year.

I got a keen interest in Quant field recently.
Currently I only know C++, python upto intermediate level and am versed in DSA in both languages.

I have a Jee Advanced Rank of 2802 and qualified KVPY(2 times). So apart from Jee level Maths I have not done anything advanced in Mathematics.

I'm order to get a SDE internship in Jane Street which I am aiming in my third year what can I exactly do (especially in maths apart from the tech portion) to get my resume filtered off for the interveiw for my offcampus application.

I am ready to grind myself to any extent during this 2 year span. So please suggest me some breif plan/steps to achieve the same.

Thank you!!"

I recently committed to UCI as a Computer Science major and am very excited to attend UCI :) 

I also got into the Honors program and was wondering how it is. It seems like a lot of work with the extra classes. If you’re part of CHC, we’re part of it, or have any thoughts on it, would you recommend it? How is the workload? Do you still have time for projects, doing stuff in organizations/clubs, internships, or relaxing? If you’re in CS, do you think that CHC’s benefits (first pick of classes & research) are worth your time?"

After taking classes like Algorithm Analysis and Calculus 2, my GPA went down from 3.9 to 3.2 (Some students were able to pass those courses with curve). I was expecting this to be happened because I transitioned from Game Design to Computer Science. The reason I did that was I want to develop apps and programs rather than computer games as my job and as a full stack software engineer. I am also depressed as I see students doing much better than me. They learn very quickly and able to work as a TA or Tutor and search for jobs while holding a good GPA. Reduction in GPA also happened because some professors were not really good at teaching (they had bad rating at [RateMyProfessors.com](https://RateMyProfessors.com)). Despite that I was able to find an internship and left good satisfaction in the company. I am also planning to graduate with that degree because I have 1 year left to graduate. However, I feel like I have to do some reforms for myself because I want to get more salary in order to start my own company at least 3 years after graduation. My mental health is okay, I am good at topics I like (programming, software engineering theories, certain platforms and front-end development). However, I am not good at topics I am weaker at (Algorithm Development, Calculus, Making Turing Machine and Making circuits). What do you recommend?"

I just received an offer for An Amazon software military etp internship. I don’t really know what the difference is. I’m currently waiting to hear back from Boeing for a full time offer there but Amazon said they would need to hear back from me by Wednesday.

A bit about me. I currently have one class left until graduation that I can either take over the summer or in the fall. I’m walking for graduation ceremony here in June either way.

I currently work a contract to hire job but I have no idea if they actually intend to hire since I have been here for a year and extended twice for 6 month contracts. Before this I had an internship at another large tech company but not really a household name.

How prestigious is amazon intern on a resume? Is it worth it leaving a full time contract to hire position for it? My current position is with a large contracting firm brooksource. I currently make $40 p/h and the internship is $57 p/h

Anyway any advice on what to do would be good because my wife and I are unsure. We have a 4 month old baby, a mortgage, we are very stable and have a 6 month emergency fund. We can pay the mortgage off of just her salary if need be but it would be very tight."

I only focused on internships and fortunately got an internship with the company I am currently working at.

I wanted to get my masters before but thought that since my gpa is less than a 3.0, I wouldn’t even stand a chance with zero work experience. 

So, my question is if I apply right now to top Masters in ECE programs like Georgia tech, Carnegie mellon, UC Berkeley etc, do I have any chances? I can get the LORs from my manager and internship mentor, and/or I can contact some of my professors as well for the LORs and can even go for a GRE if that would help.

Or should I look for not so bigger ranked schools for MS? Any help/advice would be appreciated"

My preferred course was CS in all applications, and I put data science as an alternative course. 

What do you think would be the better option out of SJSU data science and PSU computer science, I’ve always liked programming so I preferred the CS course. I know PSU has much better reputation and overall rankings but I was inclined towards SJSU because of its location in the Silicon Valley and the various opportunities it can offer me over PennState which is located on the east coast. (SJSU is also significantly cheaper.)

I’ve compared the core courses and various electives between the two courses(Data Science and Computer Science) in SJSU and there are a lot of common ones, so I should be good interest-wise.
Do you think I should go for data science instead of computer science?

Just to be clear my priority is a good-paying job and good internship opportunities and not research/career-exploration. How good is the job market when DS is compared to CS ?

Any help would be appreciated, thanks for your time!"

Even for remote work, I have faced several rejections simply stating I don’t have the work permit for that country. And I can’t get a work permit because I don’t have a job in that country. 

On top of that my grades in Engineering school have been terrible because of numerous health struggles and having to take care of my health on my own with very limited resources.

I have a few good internships and coding skills above my sleeve and that’s about it.

So, what can I do if I want to work in a company that’s international, like, I don’t know, AI department at BMW, IBM, Google, UN programmes, Microsoft, Tesla, Intel. Or Bandai Namco. Especially if they don’t have offices in Pakistan. Could be any country in the world. 
I know, maybe I’ll never be capable enough to even have my application looked at twice here. Still I want to know what would be the best way to approach this situation and the most effective steps I can take.

i read several posts saying that internships and jobs after bs would be difficult to get in the bme field

13gc948,11,2023-05-13,Update on the Chives,looking_at_my_hand,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/13gc948/update_on_the_chives/,"I thought I should give an update on the chives as so many people asked for it.

Last year, I got my mom super mad at me while I was working on my internship from home. I didn't want to deal with it, so I went out to have fun for the afternoon and casually told her I'd buy some chives when I got home.  This was my previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/uwxn3y/i\_got\_my\_mom\_super\_mad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/uwxn3y/i_got_my_mom_super_mad/)

I managed to buy some from T&T late at night, just before closing. I considered just continuing to have fun in downtown Toronto until midnight and forgetting about the chives. However, filial piety compelled me to keep my word and buy the chives. That, and I also had work the next day, and I didn't want to wake up with a headache.

When I got home, I just threw the chives on the kitchen table instead of putting them in the fridge. I wanted to be passive aggressive and not make things convenient for her. My mom often does these sorts of things to me, so I wanted to do the same for once. I was also being petty and was still mad at her.

The next day, I saw the chives were gone and that my mom had made dumplings for lunch. I found out they were not chive dumplings when I bit into the first one. They were dill dumplings, which is actually better since I like dill more than chives. They were much better than the radish dumplings that my mom used to make. Our neighbors told her they were healthier and my mom bought into it. I had to eat radish dumplings almost every time I had dumplings for a few years during my childhood, and my quality of life was poor. She only stopped years later when another neighbor said they were poor people's food. Apparently, me telling her for years that I didn't like them was not as effective.

The chives were made into a Chinese meat and chive pie for dinner. The chives were okay, like 5/10. The leaves were a bit too wide and seemed old. PS, my mom also used to make Chinese meat and radish pies. I strongly believe my neighbor was purposefully trying to make my life worse."

Considering joining the military for a technical role. Seeking advice or insights from anyone with experience in this area.  
  
**Background**: I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, although I haven't had any internships. My GPA upon graduation was 3.42, if that holds any significance. I understand that the industry is currently challenging, but I've tried to maintain a positive outlook. I've been actively engaging in online courses on platforms like Udemy to stay updated, tackling at least one coding problem from LeetCode daily. I've focused on various technology stacks, particularly front-end development, while also keeping my object-oriented programming (OOP) fundamentals and best practices sharp. Although I have a full-time sales job that pays the bills, it consumes a significant portion of my day, and I'm exhausted by it.  
  
Unfortunately, I'm growing increasingly depressed, as I feel stuck in the same place I was a year ago. To compound matters, my girlfriend, who was my main source of support, recently left. While unrelated to my career struggles, this event has severely affected my mental state and self-worth.  
  
Feeling frustrated, I decided to take a chance and applied to Revature. I'm currently participating in their PEP program, which offers self-paced training without any guarantees of employment afterward. However, feedback from previous program participants hasn't been positive, with many reporting a lack of job offers upon program completion.  
  
At this point, I'm contemplating either abandoning this career path altogether or exploring the military as a last resort. My hope is that it could provide an opportunity to utilize the skills I've studied for. If anyone has any suggestions or personal experiences related to pursuing a military career, I would greatly appreciate hearing them."

I have 3 questions :  
  
Is it possible to do a ""full"" virtualization of this infrastructure ? I want something like packet tracer do(or GNS3 but never used it before) to configure 802.1X on switch port, a windows server with NAPS->NPS fonctionnality, test wired and wireless login.  
  
I belive it's possible to do 802.1X on packet tracer but for the windows server configuration ? It's possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the 'graphical' interface on the computers is enough ?  
  
2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It's something I'm learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?  
  
3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I'm screwed to do it in entreprise... Because we have a hybrid/full cloud infrastructure in Azure AD. I think it's a total another lvl of difficulty . Does anyone know more about this ?  
  
I'm not alone in my entreprise, we have a provider to take care of network tasks et management but he is not often there and I don't dare to ask basic question :(

13gd5ea,2,2023-05-13,Please help - MCS :’,toogayforthislmao,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/13gd5ea/please_help_mcs/,"I’m a final year CS student from India (no work ex, just few internships) who had originally applied for Fall 23 but got a deferred Spring 24 (inaugral intake) admit for UIUC on-campus MCS program. I am really confused about whether I should take it up or not and would really love your help!

Before the confirmation from UIUC came through (with Summer 24 CPT), I was all excited and confident to join UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) for MS in CSE. I’m considering the following factors :

1. Weather : I’m not a winter person at all. It makes me worry if I won’t be able to perform well during the two winters I’d face at UIUC (Spring-Fall-Spring) while the weather in California is fine.

2. TAships : It is crucial for me to secure some sort of funding during the masters since I’ll be taking loans. Since the TAships aren’t abundant for MCS students and even the intake has increased since Fall 22 from what I could gather - 600+ instead of old around 200, would any other on-campus jobs help like Course Assistants etc? At the same time, I’m almost guranteed a TAship at UCSC for most quarters.

3. Program Duration - Internships : The 1.5 year program seems kinda rushed? In the context that considering the already unstable market with hardly any people with internships, would the time be enough for me instead of the 2 years that I’d get at UCSC? Also the fact that it starts in Spring - would most programs be done for Summer 24 since hiring cycles generally start in Sept for Summer Internships?

4. Course Structure : The program at UCSC helps me to do a project with an advisor whereas UIUC MCS is just the coursework. From what I know in CS, your projects matter a lot for interviews in entry level Data Engineering/MLE roles.

Honestly the only thing holding me back is that UIUC has big brand value and is T5-10 program whereas UCSC is idk probably a T50-100 program. UCSC is like a cushion where I’d be at ease to get my things done whereas UIUC has quite a few variables but is doable if things fall in place. 

PS : I kinda deal with imposter syndrome a lot and feel most of the time I’m not really good at stuff lol. During my undergrad, I couldn’t land a good school even though I had good grades. Even for master’s, I wasn’t expecting to get in at UIUC, so just makes me worry if I’m passing on a great opportunity to attend UIUC?

I would love to hear from folks in the MCS program and perspectives from international students.

Thankyou :)"

Especially the second wave. I was lucky enough to not lose any family members, but it did enough to destroy my life. It's hopeless now.

For context, I am currently 20 years old, doing my second year of engineering in a Tier - II college in Bangalore.

When Covid hit my state, I was having my 11th grade final exams. Wasn't a big deal yet, but it was definitely scary. The news was all about it. Finals ended. 12th grade started on March 1, 2020. Coronavirus was definitely big now. People start wearing masks. March 13th, first Covid death in India happens in my state. All schools, colleges, malls, etc., closed. It was a Friday afternoon, I get down to the ground to eat and the PE teacher tells us that schools are closed, summer vacations are beginning and we will have an early start in May.

Well, definitely not. Literally the next Wednesday, online classes begin. Even my coaching classes for JEE moved online. I mean, coaching centre did it literally the very next day my school was closed. I don't think I need to explain how shit online classes are and how awful it is to do everything from my home.

Covid rages. I sit in front of my laptop for 14+ hours a day, in the same position for months. Being indoors drives my family crazy. My mental health dips to an all time low, as if the pressure from all the competitive exams wasn't any less, and as soon as October, I get suicidal thoughts about jumping from my building's roof. That went even worse, but it's not the point of discussion right now.

I basically give up all hopes on competitive exams. But still I try. Second wave hits and the rest is history. Board exam gets postponed a 2-3 times. Finally, they decide to show some mercy on us and cancel it. The competitive exams continue. I join a Tier - II exam through their entrance exam, but the competitive exams are not over. College even starts classes, and I write my JEE Advanced Exam after two weeks of classes. I never even felt the transition from high school to college.

As expected, I flunk all my exams and continue with the college I joined. The first two semesters are hell. According to their schedule, they started late than they would normally do. So, everything was rushed. Classes after classes. It was rushed. I score a crappy 8.5 GPA. Plus, I also lost my summer to recover the time lost due to Covid so that college gets back on track.

I've finished my 4th semester now. I haven't had a vacation since the start of 9th grade. The holidays between 9th and 10th was full of coaching classes for 10th Boards. Between 10th and 11th was JEE. 11th and 12th was non existent. 12th and 1st year of engineering was robbed by Covid and my college. 1st and 2nd year was robbed by my college. 2017 was the last year I had holidays. Now, it's 2023. 6 years. I am burnt out. So burnt out that my mind is literally charcoal black now.

I am mentally drained. My mental health has deteriorated so badly. College is extremely stressful. To not think about suicide or my depression, I have been overworking myself in the past semester doing projects, research, etc. And I'm tired of that too now. My GPA is shit. It's 8.5/10. I am planning on doing master's after my undergrad, but for my GPA, it seems hopeless. 

I get 2 months of holidays, and I cannot even enjoy it because I have to do an internship. It starts literally 2 days after my last end of semester exams for this semester. If covid hadn't hit, I would have had the holidays between 12th and 1st sem. I would have had a proper break between 1st and second year too.

Looking into my future, I don't think I will ever be able to get time to sit back and even understand what is going on in my life. I feel like a spectator in my own life. It's like I am just standing there while the whole world moves on so fast that it's almost a blur."

Is starting at QA a good way of breaking into the industry?,Apprehensive_Win251,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/13ggahf/i_am_an_aspiring_professional_game_designer/,"I am first class graduate in Computer Game Programming and have also worked as an intern game programmer at a small company, currently working part time as a game tester. I applied at Rockstar for a QA role and after some stages have been invited to attend a final stage interview. 

Even though I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to work at Rockstar, I applied in QA with the hopes I can break into the industry properly first but eventually move to other departments such as in design or programming. Not even necessarily at Rockstar but my thinking is if I stay there for 1 year or so, then start trying to move my way up, it would give me important experience for my future prospects.

You might be asking, why haven't you applied for these design/ programming roles? I have but right now it is a bit dry and if I'm honest I am a massive Rockstar fanboy so any opportunity to work for them and potentially move up I would take.

Any advice would appreciated if this is a good way to go about things for my case, as I am aware that staying in QA for longer then intended may lead employeers to see me nothing more then a QA person who can't move departments, so I'm stuck at a crossroads here."

With the vast amount of applicants, the odds for your resume to get seen increases if you can get a referral. Of course I’ve tried to use my immediate connections such as family friends, however, for a bulk of the companies I’ve applied to, I’m just like everyone else with no referrals.

I went to a pretty big state school in undergrad with a huge alumni network. I noticed this was the best place to start regarding networking.

However, I want to be professional in this: I want to reach out to folks from my alumni who are at companies working as data scientists, to get to know what they do, but also, honestly, so I can get a referral. 

I want to do this in a manner where it doesn’t seem like I’m fishing for one and I’m desperate. 

My approach was to:

1) send a connection request

2) in a message, if accepted, tell them about my background, and ask if they had time to chat about what they do

3) if 2) works, then go ahead 

However, from 2) idk how I can eventually get the referral. 

Does anyone know the best way to approach someone via LinkedIn, to get your foot in the door while not seeming annoying??"

I recently had my first ever therapy appointment after being diagnosed with ADHD and it was actually great! The therapist actually made me feel validated and like she understood me and that she knew how to help me. Which leads me to my problem. 

When I was originally trying to find a therapist, I reached out to multiple because I knew it would be hard to find someone with an opening and kind of assuming I would have to go through meeting a few therapists until I found one that I responded well to. During this process, I actually booked an appointment with two different therapists (basically assuming the first one wouldn’t work out). Do I now cancel the appointment with the second therapist? Or do I just keep it in case the first one doesn’t end up working out in the long run? Is it acceptable/normal to temporarily see 2 different therapists at once?

Additionally, the therapist I already saw has an intern who could possibly be taking over my sessions down the road. The intern was in my first session but didn’t speak much at all so it’s hard to gauge if I’ll get along with her eventually or not.

Should I cancel the appointment with the second therapist??"

I am an international student set to begin my Masters in Computer Science in the USA this fall (2023). I am eager to make the most of my time as a student, as I aim to join the industry after graduation, preferably in the High-Performance Computing (HPC) domain. However, I am also open to other domains as long as I can continue working on optimization-related projects. Coming from an Electrical Engineering background, I possess rudimentary programming and problem-solving skills, and I am determined to improve them while maintaining good grades and making significant research contributions.

Considering the current challenges surrounding the H1B visa, I am seeking your valuable insights and advice on how I can best prepare myself during these two years to secure employment upon graduation. I am particularly interested in the following areas:

**Balancing Academics and Research**: As I plan to work as a research assistant while pursuing my Masters, I am curious about effective strategies for managing my time between coursework, research responsibilities, and personal growth. How can I ensure I maintain good grades while also making valuable contributions to my research topic of optimization in HPC systems?

**Networking and Industry Engagement**: Recognizing the importance of networking, I am eager to explore avenues for connecting with professionals in the HPC domain and related fields. Are there any particular conferences, workshops, or online communities I should be aware of? Any tips on how to actively engage with industry professionals during my time as a student would be highly beneficial.

**Internship Opportunities**: I understand the significance of gaining industry experience, and internships can provide valuable exposure and networking opportunities. What steps should I take to maximize my chances of securing internships in the HPC or optimization field? Are there any specific companies or research organizations known for offering such internships?

**Understanding Visa and Employment Challenges**: Given the uncertain nature of H1B visa sponsorship, what actions can I take to improve my prospects of securing employment in the USA? Are there specific companies or industries that are more likely to hire international candidates, especially in the HPC or optimization domain? Any advice or insights regarding the current job market and potential alternatives would be greatly appreciated.

I am incredibly grateful for any advice, tips, or experiences you are willing to share. Your guidance will undoubtedly help me shape my career path and make the most of my time as a Masters student in the USA."
13gidwu,18,2023-05-13,Rejected OOS CS Asian Male from Georgia Tech,blockyworld9926,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/13gidwu/rejected_oos_cs_asian_male_from_georgia_tech/,"I am not exactly sure if schools offer feedback on why a certain person did not get in. I applied to Georgia Tech and was rejected to transfer there yesterday. The was my 2nd application rejected from GT. In my first application that I filled out as a high school senior, I could definitely see some weaknesses which caused me to get waitlisted. However, I fixed all those faults and applied to transfer but got rejected again (no waitlist this time). I would like to reapply to transfer again in the spring but I am in the dark about what went wrong. How can I get feedback on what happened when the rejected letter was generic and the AO probably does not remember my application?

For context: Applying as OOS CS Asian Male (Skull Emoji). I had completed all course requirements for transfer except 1 course which was in progress at the time (they allow this as long as you complete the course by June 1st which I have done). I now have 80 credits at the end of my freshman year and the average for transfer admissions is 60. My GPA is 4.0 and my ACT was a 34. I have credits from 13 AP classes.

Here are my extracurriculars which I reported (Keep in mind they only allow a 1 page resume to report these, so it is not like the common application):

* Software Internship at a unicorn tech company (these are almost equivalent in difficulty as cracking FAANG so its very impressive as a freshman)
* Another internship at a biotech company completed earlier
* A Cybersecurity job which I do while in school (relevant to the CS major I guess)
* Founded a tech company and registered it as an LLC, it has multiple employees and we are working on creating and launching an app
* Founded the math club at my university
* I was able to list 2 awards. The first one was 1st place in a NASA App development hackathon and the 2nd was a combined award from NASA and Boeing from a completely different competition
* Fellowship at USC related to the CS major
* A personal project that I've been working on for the past 4 years that taught me a lot about CS. (Honestly this wouldn't look that impressive to an AO but it impresses tech interviewers so I decided to leave it on my resume to show that I actually had interest in the field.)

At this point your probably thinking that my essays were trash but I don't think so. I got them edited by 3 people (2 of which attend T20ish schools) and the 3rd was some random I paid on Fiverr who focuses on college essays to suggest changes (and she helped a ton). She provided feedback on the essays and said that they looked great and should not cause a problem for admissions. By the end of the editing, I had essays that I was actually really proud of and definitely were not the sole reason I got rejected.

So ATP I don't even know what to fix for my next application. Any thoughts? I had good grades, credit hours and GPA. I had a lot of relevant work experience and leadership positions in certain activities. I had awards from reputable organizations and my essays were good. So what went wrong? Please let me know if this isn't a good competitive application and I'm being delusional. "

13gj8ci,8,2023-05-13,Supervisor Problems/Unethical?,deadgirl5683,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/13gj8ci/supervisor_problemsunethical/,"Hi everyone. I'm going to keep this brief so please ask questions if needed. In essence I have tried negotiating a higher hourly rate for residency at a small private practice that I currently work at as an intern. I'm an upcoming resident and my first ""pay week"" will begin May 15th, 2023. Yesterday, 5/12/23, I discussed a higher amount with her. She was defensive and hesitant at first but my reasons were sound. She wouldn't discuss what my clients were paying for their sessions and first stated that she was uncomfortable and then said it was due to her insurance contract not being allowed to say what it was. The conversation went on as we discussed what I needed and what she was willing to do. We discussed extenuating factors and I made my case that 35/hr was not sufficient for the work I am doing. I told her how much I loved it at her practice and working with her but I also needed to be paid fairly in order to do the best work and avoid burnout. This is because I would have to take 30 clients and work weekends to sustain her initial offer. I also had to negotiate up to 35 to begin with as her original offer wa 30/hr. She spoke about different insurance rates and thought she could possibly do higher for certain ones to which I countered and said I was happy to discuss that but would likely refer out the other insurance clients with the lower amount as many of the ones from that carrier were brand new clients anyway and I had met with maybe once or twice. The vast majority of my clients were the ones from the insurance she was willing to increase the amount for. The conversation ended with her agreeing to do 40/hr across the board and after a month higher to 45/hr which is what I was asking for. She said she needed time to review the numbers and we made a plan to meet on Thursday at 4.

Well Friday night I got an email at 10:07pm saying that she had thought about the conversation and there were things she was uncomfortable with. She said in the email that she needed to talk to me this weekend. Obviously, I was taken back and really anxious about this as we had ended on a pretty hopeful note on Friday afternoon agreeing to keep the conversation open etc. I responded that it would be difficult to meet this weekend due to the holiday (Mothers day weekend and I'm a server) but that I could do Saturday morning early or possibly sunday evening. While I was documenting all of this (covering my butt) I had seen a reminder to put a client's appt in that I had forgot to put in the portal. Well, I went in and can no longer see ANY billing or insurance information for any of my clients. This is VERY unnerving and upsetting. It seems like she wants to avoid having to pay me at all before 5/15/23 comes around. I can't tell you how disappointed I feel and betrayed. Obviously I don't know the specifics yet but what else am I supposed to think right now? She texted me this morning 5/13/23 to say she couldn't meet this morning and I texted her as well. I also stated that I hoped she didn't think I needed things I shift right away this first week because we discussed it friday and was fully prepared for what was stated in the offer letter. I told her I was more than flexible and was willing to work with what she needed.

Any thoughts at all would be helpful I just feel really flabbergasted I guess? I mean there's a lot to unpack there but suffice to say I have never done anything unethical or said anything in that conversation to warrant such swift actions. I have another second interview for another job next week and I am prepared for this to fall through. I'm just so devastated.

&#x200B;

Update: She fired me via email today (5/14/23), stating the following: ""After further reflection of your multiple requests to renegotiate our agreement, I am not comfortable continuing a working relationship with you. I appreciate the work you have done with your clients and it has been nice seeing you grow during your internship. Please take the next two weeks to terminate with your clients, you will be paid, per our signed contract, for your time. I will be sending you a list of the clients that I will be taking on and will be providing you with two names of clinicians that you can refer the rest of your clients to. Let’s plan to FaceTime @ 9:30 tomorrow so we can discuss the best and most appropriate way, putting the clients best interests first, for you to terminate with them."" I sent her a short response and the resignation letter I had already drafted up from 5/12/23, so it seems to have worked itself out. However, all around just awful behavior from start to finish. She's not comfortable paying a liveable wage? It's ridiculous how terrible some supervisors are as soon as you try and actually advocate for yourself. And by ""multiple attempts"" she means literally twice and I also assured her I would be happy to wait a month or so out before increasing the amount. But it's fine! She can find someone else maybe that's willing to take that low, again her original offer was 30/hr per client."

Dating is an internship: When you date someone, you are the boss and they are the potential employee. **They don’t have the job yet.**

**YOU SHOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY RUSH INTO A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP. IF YOU DO THIS WITHOUT KNOWING THE PERSON, YOU ARE TAKING A MASSIVE RISK.**

At all points of dating someone, you should evaluate:

*Is this person kind to me?

*Is this person kind to others?

*Does this person share values with me?

*Does this person agree with me on politics/religion/money/sex? If not- can I honestly accept this?

*Do I feel calm and peaceful around this person?

*Would I trust this person to look after a newborn puppy for me?

*Would I loan this person $1500?(assuming they have the ability to pay it back)

*Do they ever try to pressure me into doing things I don’t want to do? (Not just sex)

*For 1+ year plus relationships only: How do I feel about spending the rest of my life with this person? Having kids? Bills? Conflict? In-laws?

If you follow these tips, you can avoid 90% of the suffering involved in relationships. 

**Finally, and most importantly know your non-negotiables and always be ready to walk.**

Set these out before you start dating. These should be based on your deeply held values and can never be trivial. For example, mine are:

*Abuse of an animal

*Overt, obvious racism or bigotry, including but not limited to use of slurs, violence, or other harassment. 

*Disrespect of my family, including but not limited to putting herself between me and my family, fighting family members verbally or otherwise, insulting my mother, brother, father, or grandparents 

*Theft

*Cheating

These tips have worked well for me. I often see dating advice here and I wanted to share. I don’t want to see any of you end up in a bad situation. I hope this helps you all as you make improvements in your life."

I’ve graduated from civil engineering 1.5 years ago. I didn’t work as a civil engineering and I don’t have any experience. And I’ve graduated from another country. It is possible for me to get this paper called ZAB(Annerkennung). I applied to some jobs but no success. Maybe it’s because I don’t have any experience or driving license, or my Germany isn’t perfect(B1.2-B2.1). I know that I have a lot of disadvantages. That’s why I want to study again. I’ve actually talked with an university about a bachelors progrom which is called duales studium and they told me that they can recognise most of the classes that i’ve already passed it is gonna take me like 1-1.5 years to study and most of it is actually internship.
My second option is getting a solid bootcamp to be a Frontend Developer. It is gonna take me like 6months(full time) or a year(part time so i can work at the same time). 
I’ll be honest with you right now i am working at a 14€/hr job that doesn’t require any education or skills and i feel bad because i am more than that i have some qualifications but since i have some disasvantages i don’t really know which path should i choose. If you ask me which path do i want ? I would say Programming but if i don’t have a great chance to be employed than why would i even bother.

Thank you much everyone i am sorry if a broke any rules"

 - **iTunes** - Not Verified so have a backup planned. Some of these movies are from back when you used to need both the digital disc and the code to get the movie. You no longer need the disc to redeem these but they will probably redeem in SD quality. There are also a few codes that are the split portion from a Paramount, Lionsgate or Universal slip.  If you need an iTunes code because you don't use UV, a lot of the codes in the MA section above have the ability for direct redemption on iTunes. Let me know if that is something you need more information about.

13grjnc,6,2023-05-13,Career crisis advice,vocalswan,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/13grjnc/career_crisis_advice/,"Hi guys,

I posted a little while ago about my job offer from a boutique IB firm being rescinded due to market conditions. I have now hit an inflection point and I am seeking general advice and guidance. 

For background: I recently graduated and I was supposed to start with this firm earlier in the year, and ultimately after some pushing back of the start date, I settled for an remote internship with the firm instead of FT. Originally, the plan was to relocate to a new city far from family and friends. 

As of late, the firm is doing somewhat better, and I have been working hard in the role. I believe the conversion to a full time role is about 50/50 odds. I’m not willing to be on those odds and more importantly, I’m not sure if I’m willing to move across the country for a high risk opportunity. 

I have been applying to jobs in my current city for some time now, casting a much broader net than just IB, but I have had no luck. I’m seeking any advice regarding this process beyond the traditional “network network network”. This job market has been increasingly difficult for me. 

I’m also curious to know what my plan b should be. I’m thinking of either entering finance through a more FP&A / back office role to an MBA to IB. 

I feel relatively burnt out from the job search and honestly taken advantage by my current firm. Im just lost and don’t know what do. Any help, guidance, and brutal honesty would be greatly appreciated."

13gsh4n,1,2023-05-13,Asking to go on a date with me once a week is it too much to ask? I need a advice...,Maleficent-Caramel-8,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13gsh4n/asking_to_go_on_a_date_with_me_once_a_week_is_it/,"My boyfriend always keep on working, if the code doesn't work, he'll get upset the rest of the day. His goal is to be successful, so he works hard on that.. He loves his family so much. He is the eldest son so he has certain responsibilities at home. His parents are old school, obsessed with caste and wants to take every major decision in his life. They don't like these relationships (his parents doesn't know but his mom has doubts on him, because we make late night video calls) His parents are not happy with his earnings and and scolds him that they are disappointed for having mediocre life. He wants to do masters but his parents are not supportive, they want him to get married. He told me his father doesn't provide the income to the family, he gives his income to his mom and takes 5k for him to look after his expense. 
Considering this situation, is it too much to ask him on date? I want to meet him often too, but he can't come on weekends, they mostly go out, he as one day to rest, he has to take care of some household works. So i travel by plus wait for him at nearest bust stop near his workplace for 2 hours on rare occasion till 3 hrs too..and wait near his workplace bus stop and wait for him till his work gets over, then we'll have dinner and he'll drop me home. We meet like monthly twice or even once( one time only). I want to meet him monthy 4 times. I want to meet him  on weekend, but he won't come, he doesn't want to get caught by his family for now. For now he wants to get into good university and move out. Because he is scared if his parents will stop him from going university, since they are already searching out reasons to stop him. So at weekdays he just tells his mom he is working overtime when he is with me. Monthly i am barely spending with him 4-5 hours..  He cancels out plan telling he is busy with work and deadlines.. He cancels sometimes telling he ran out of money to take me on date, (I am working unpaid internship, I am broke too, I have only my scholarship amount with me in that i am paying for dates sometimes, or put some money while paying or he'll pay). Now i am pretending to be full and make him eat since he will eat dinner soon, he is so hungry (I didn't tell him, i don't want him to feel bad, since his parents are complaining he is incompetent). I told him I don't want to go dinner just come and see me, i really want to see him that's it. 
But if i think in another scenario i am getting pissed off. His mom gets expensive skincare, chanel perfumes, spends too much on shopping household items, when they go out on weekends to family restaurant they eat in expensive restaurant, his mom within last 6 months already went on 2 international trip. Hearing this makes me question is he really broke or not? If his they had to pay loan with his money and manage expenses with his money, why spend lavishly? He supports his mom she is spending her income from her small business. I too want gifts, but he tells me he doesn't have money, eventhough i feel slightly disappointed I'll adjust for him. I savs up money by not taking cabs or auto and get him gifts. Atleast a love letter or handmade some gifts will make me happy. Last time when i forced him to meet me, he vented out his anger, he said he has only 600 not having enough money to put petrol too. Then after sometime when he chilled a bit, After getting to know i am on my first day period pain, he took me to Mcdonald's and got me to eat. (Around 415, bill was 515, which i paid, i sent him 300, so he returned me 715, next day morning i recharged him 300 for his mobile) And on the way he put petrol(idk how much he putted, maybe 1000 or 1500, becoz i remember last month he putted petrol for 1500). he told he don't have petrol money too but he gpayed me 715 plus petrol. After that incident i lost faith in him, idk if he really telling the truth or not.
Before when we were dating he used to take me to expensive restaurants we used to split bill but still it cost around 700 to 900 per person. I wonder that time too he was earning the same amount, he didn't used to tell he is getting less pocket money but still take me on good places. 
Recently he took 3 days holiday and Saturday, sunday (5 days trip) and went to visit his grandmother. I was planning on trip with my friends and him, before his family trip, Weekends (Saturday and sunday, but monday by afternoon around 10 am only return) when i said this he got mad saying he has deadline he can't take monday holiday, he said even if i come I'll feel forced. But now he took friday, momday, Tuesday holiday and returning on Wednesday, idk whether he'll go to his office on Wednesday or taking holiday on Wednesday too.. this trip he went on same day i planned with him. I got so devastated after hearing this. Before this first time we went on a trip with him and my friends, he was making fuss at last minute that he is not coming and has work. I forced him to come, We went on Saturday morning, he stayed in hotel room whole afternoon to do his work in his laptop, by evening 5.30 he joined us after completing work. Next day morning he forced me to leave by 11 am saying he had work and need to rest.. My friends stayed there and had fun and left at 4 ish... i was s pissed.. this trip was like last trip.. Because we both moving for higher studies.. It'll be 2 or even 4 years of long distance.. based on country he is getting admit, I got into all 3 countries he applied for, he got into none still (becoz his agent messed up).. The point is due to long distance we won't meet.. But he give out reasons.. After that these 2 scenarios ( taking leave to visit his granny, and not willing to take on date telling he is broke as reason).. i don't feel like he is giving me Importance, I feel like he is guilt tripping me by telling his story, or idk if he is manipulating me.. Other than this he is very caring, kind, respectful person, career goal oriented person. Even if he looses temper he never talks disrespectfully, which is a huge green flag for me (coz I've seen my friend's boyfriends how they talk in abusive words, even my parents)..: I behave sometimes psychotic too, burst out of temper he handles my flaw too (which my ex boyfriend broke up with me for that reason). 
I Don't want to loose him, he promsied he is like this because of his family, after he starts a family of our own he'll change it and prioritize only me. But anything can happen, I am scared he is giving so much importance to his parents, what if he marry someone his parents look, Its not 100% guarantee he will marry me. What if my efforts go in vain? For now i care only about the present, At present, seeing this 2 scenario really pisses me.. Is he being a toxic one ? Or am I being the toxic one? Any advive pls.."
13gsxjz,98,2023-05-13,I worked in a museum of oddities until the oddest thing happened to me,Horror_writer_1717,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gsxjz/i_worked_in_a_museum_of_oddities_until_the_oddest/,"I never wanted this to happen. I didn’t want to be standing here, staring horrified at the blood dripping from my hands as people screamed and ran away.  
It was all my boss’s fault. He made this happen. He had plenty of chances to make things right, but there was money to be made. And the love of money is the root of all evil.   
You know those people who strive for excellence? Who work hard to get the grades because they’re destined for better things. They’re bound to leave the small town they grew up in, get out there and set the world on fire.   
I wanted to be one of those people. I studied like my life depended on it for my entire school career. But when it came down to the wire, I missed being valedictorian by two points.   
I didn’t get the scholarships or the accolades. I didn’t get anything. The only thing I got was an invitation to do a summer internship at the local museum. It was an unpaid internship, but I thought it would look good on an application, so I took the job.   
When I first started working here, I was terrified. Especially walking in the door for the first time and getting the stare down from an eight-foot-tall Bigfoot statue with arms outstretched and fangs showing in a frozen roar.   
After I realized what it was and restarted my heart, I was greeted by the owner, Mr. Applebottom. He was a small, thin man with round glasses and a receding hairline. He looked like a stiff breeze would carry him away to the land of OZ.   
He took me on a tour of the museum, showing me all the attractions.  
Most of them were cryptids. There were drawings and paintings hanging next to blurry photos of just about any cryptid you can think of. The more popular ones had full-size wax models.    
All these creatures captured my imagination, but not in a good way.   
There was also a theater with around twenty seats and a video playing nonstop about sightings of various cryptids.  
Once he finished the tour, he showed me how to run the cash register and then showed me the janitor’s closet. My jobs were to take care of customers during open hours and take care of cleanup during closed hours.  
After he had shown me everything, he turned the sign from closed to open and told me good luck as he went upstairs to his office.  
I stood there, frozen, staring at the cash register like it was going to bite my fingers off if I touched it.   
So my big internship turned out to be a janitor/ticket collector job. I was worried I would get overwhelmed by the rush of customers and have no clue what to do.   
Fortunately, for me, I didn’t have a single customer all day. It turned out the museum had been open for a few years and people had already seen everything there was to see. Repeat customers weren’t exactly the museum’s forte.   
I stood there waiting for over an hour. I soon became bored and walked through the gift shop, acquainting myself with the bric a brac we sold. That lasted around fifteen minutes.    
To keep myself from falling asleep, I made the mistake of going to the theater and watching the videos of cryptid sightings. As if the wax figures weren’t enough, now I had it in my mind that these things not only were real, but could show up at my doorstep anytime they felt like.  
At the end of the day, Mr. Applebottom came down and asked how many customers we’d had. His face fell when I told him none. He turned the sign from open to closed and told me to do floors.  
I stared at the floors.  
“But, you and I are the only ones who walked through here today,” I said.  
“Is this the way you’re going to talk to your supervisor?”  
“No, sir, it just doesn’t make sense to me.”  
“Call it a practice run,” he said. “I want to see how you do.”  
I sighed and went to the cleaning closet. I vacuumed all the floors, cleaned the TVs, wiped down the counters, and washed the windows. The lights were turned down to night levels, making shadows dance as I did my chores. As I worked my way through the museum, I swore I could feel eyes on me and they weren’t Mr. Applebottom’s. The statues of the creatures were so lifelike, I didn’t dare look up at them for fear they’d grab me and drag me off to their lair.   
I regretted ever taking this internship.  
‘It’s only for the summer and it can help you get a better job.’ That’s what I told myself. I just wish I would’ve quit after that first day. Maybe I wouldn’t have…   
When I was done, he mumbled that I had done satisfactorily and told me to be here bright and early tomorrow.  
The next day was exactly the same as the first, except I knew what to expect. I brought a book to read so I wouldn’t be bored. Of course, it disappeared when the boss was around. I got the feeling he was a, ‘If you can lean, you can clean’ kind of person.   
After a few weeks with barely more than a handful of customers, I wondered how he was even able to pay the electric bill. It was no wonder this was an unpaid internship.  
I’d taken to cleaning in the afternoon so I could be done as soon as he closed up. It was also something to do. Boredom in a hall of monsters can do terrible things to your imagination.  
One day the boss came down from his office very excited. He told me he had found a new exhibit and it was being shipped in today.  
It was funny and very encouraging to see him so excited, like a kid waiting at the mailbox for a toy or comic book to arrive.   
When the delivery man showed up with the package, the boss nearly knocked him over with the door.   
After he accepted delivery, he stood there, staring at the shoebox sized package in awe.   
“What is it?” I said looking eagerly.  
He was so focused on it that he whipped around and nearly lost his balance. He composed himself and smiled sheepishly.   
“That was a close one,” he said. Then he straightened. “You shall have to wait until I have the display set up.”  
I frowned as he carried the box up the stairs to his office like some trophy.   
I shook my head and continued cleaning.  
An hour later, a frantic Mr. Applebottom raced down the stairs and flew over to me. I’d never seen him run so fast. I cringed not knowing if he was going to stop in time or plow me over.   
Fortunately, he stopped just in time.  
“Where is it?” he said breathlessly.  
“Where is what?” I said.  
He looked at me for a long moment.  
He tried to compose himself and regain control of his breathing.  
“Have you seen anything out of the ordinary?” he asked with a forced calmness.  
“No, I’ve just been cleaning.”  
“And you haven’t seen anything… unusual?”  
“No, sir.”  
His eyes scanned the room, with special focus on the floor. He searched the room, then went into theater, finally coming back to me looking defeated. He turned and walked slowly away, shoulders slumped.  
“Is there anything I can do to help you, sir?” I called after him.  
He just waved me off and kept walking.  
I took the vacuum back to the cleaning closet and got out the carpet scrubber to tackle a stain where some kid had spilled soda. I filled the upper tank with soap and water then went after the stain. I found it interesting that no matter how clean the carpet looked, the water in the collecting tank always looked like chocolate milk when I was done.   
After two run throughs, I examined the stain and it was much better, but not perfect. This carpet cleaner did a good job, but never seemed to get it one hundred percent clean.   
I returned the cleaner to the closet and pulled the tank of dirty water out to empty it. As I dumped the water out, something jumped out of it and bit me.  
I screamed and dropped the tank, recoiling against the wall. Whatever kind of bug it was took off out into the museum. I looked at my bleeding hand then gathered my courage and followed it.   
I grabbed a broom off the closet wall and held it out in front of me like a sword. I scanned around the floor of the room but didn’t see anything. There weren’t even tracks to follow as I passed each exhibit, holding my breath for fear of this thing jumping out at me. Checking around wax figures of monsters didn’t help my general anxiety.   
One by one, I checked each exhibit, paying close attention to the floor around it and behind it. But I came up short. As I started back through for a second search, Mr. Applebottom rounded the corner and scared me nearly half to death. I swung my broom only to realize just in time who it was.  
“What’s going on?” he said, holding up his arm to defend against a woman brandishing a broom.  
“I’m sorry, sir,” I said. “I heard noises and thought there was an intruder.”  
“Oh,” he said composing himself. “Glad to see you defending the interests of the museum.”  
“Yes, sir.”  
“How did you injure yourself Miss Premrose?” he said looking at my bloody hand.  
I stared at it for a moment. Should I tell him something bit me and ran away? Should I let him know there’s something dangerous roaming around? Or will he blame me for not finding it? Would he fire me? God knows if anything happened to a guest because of me…  
“I must’ve cut it in my haste to grab the broom,” I lied.  
“Oh, well best tend to that,” he said. “Don’t want you bleeding on the floors.”  
“Yes, sir.”  
“Carry on then,” he said. “I’m leaving for the night. You’ll lock up on your way out, won’t you?”  
“Of course, sir.”  
With that, he turned on his heels and headed for the front door. I watched him go, then turned back to the now empty building. All that was here was me and the little monster that had bit me.  
I panned around the room feeling more alone than I had in a long time. I slowly made my way back to the cleaning closet, holding my broom tightly. When I got there, I leaned my broom against the wall next to the first aid box hanging on the wall.   
As I got a bandage out and covered my wound, my eyes kept darting to the door. When I was done, I picked up the broom and carried it to the edge of the doorway. I scanned the empty room searching for my attacker. The deserted floor mocked me, like it was a field of landmines waiting for me to step on one.   
I wished I had some sort of sci-fy goggles that could scan for lifeforms like in the movies. But I was on my own. I took a deep breath and started for the door, holding my broom to defend myself. At first, I walked toward the door, eyes darting all around, but as the door came closer, I stepped more quickly. It didn’t help that I had to pass one monster after another.  
Until I got to the door I was at a full run. I slammed into the door in a full panic, pulling the keys out of my pocket and dropping them like in every horror movie. Sweat poured off my forehead, making the keys slip out of my hand a second time.   
Finally, I got the keys in the lock and opened the door only to whip around and try to slam it shut. But it refused to close. It was as if the building was saying, “Oh no you don’t. You get back in here and deal with this thing.”  
I slammed the door over and over but it refused to shut. I looked around in a sheer panic when I saw a piece of wood sticking out of the door. I bent down and picked it up. It was the broom.  
I threw it back inside and slammed the door shut, locking it and breathing hard as I leaned against it trying to compose myself.  
The longer I leaned against the door, the more my breathing slowed. The more my breathing slowed, the more my mind told me how foolish I had been.  
‘It was just a bug,’ I thought. ‘Nothing to get excited about.’  
I wanted to tell my mind that it was full of bologna, I wanted to believe it was just a bug. But something wouldn’t let me. Some small niggling feeling wouldn’t allow me to simply dismiss it.  
I went home and tried my best to forget about the events of the day. I made myself a microwave dinner (meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn) then laid in bed laughing my head off to ‘Whose line is it Anyway’ until I fell asleep.  
\*\*\*  
*There were ants crawling all over me. No, not over me, through me. I could feel them under my skin. I looked down at my arm and saw them moving around, hundreds of them, like there were highways full of ants moving up and down beneath my skin.*   
*I scratched until I dug the skin open trying to yank the ants out of my body one at a time. I grabbed one and pulled it out of my arm. I looked at it and to my surprise it looked like a miniature version of the thing that bit me.*  
*I tried to squash it, but it didn’t seem to faze the creature. It got tired of me trying though and bit me… again. I threw it to the floor and stomped on it.*   
*It looked at me then just skittered away, unharmed.*  
*The rest of me felt like I was being slowly devoured. Pain shot from every inch of my body as these creatures dug deeper into me, reaching my bloodstream. It carried them all through me, causing even more havoc.*   
*I desperately tore at my skin, scratching, digging, tearing with my nails. Anything to get these little monsters out of me. I didn’t care about the blood running down my arms and seeping into my bedsheets, I just wanted to be rid of this torture.*  
*They were relentless. I could feel every molecule they invaded. The pain was beyond description. I was about to go completely insane if I didn’t…*  
\*\*\*  
I sat bolt upright in bed and screamed. I felt my arms, my legs, my face, searching for the tiny invaders that had destroyed my body. But they weren’t there. I looked down at my arms, relieved to not see tiny creatures roaming under my skin and blood where I had torn the skin away trying to dig them out.   
However, I did see something disturbing. I had a rash. It ran all the way up my arms and disappeared under my sleeves. I threw off my sweaty sheets and ran to the bathroom. I turned on the light and wished I hadn’t. The person who greeted me in the mirror was a stranger.  
Red blotches ran all up and down my body. Even my face was covered in them.   
Had I scratched myself in my sleep?  
I examined the blotches more closely. They didn’t appear to be scratch marks. In fact, they weren’t itchy. That in itself seemed odd. Not that I wasn’t grateful that whatever this rash was that covered most of my body didn’t itch. It was just unique. I’d never heard of a rash that didn’t itch at least a little.  
As if on cue, I started scratching. As soon as I scratched the first spot, everywhere else began to itch at the same time.  
I watched in the mirror as my nails tried to reach everywhere at once and failed miserably.   
I had to do something quickly before I scratched myself apart like in my dream. I ran a hot shower and jumped in clothes and all. I stripped in the shower, revealing even more red splotches.  
The water seemed to have a soothing effect on the itching, and soon I wasn’t scratching at all.   
I plugged the tub and ran water in, settling in for a bath. Relief washed over me as the water covered my skin. I was left with the obvious question. ‘What the hell is this?’  
As I looked around, I noticed the spot where I’d been bitten was swollen. I examined it carefully. I’d never seen a reaction like this before. Was this like a bee allergy? Was my throat about to swell shut?   
I swallowed just to be sure I still could. It went off without a hitch. It didn’t even hurt. So what was going on with the rest of me? I needed to figure this out, but a hospital was the last resort. So-called ‘medical professionals’ have proven themselves to be untrustworthy as of late. I would probably end up being dissected in the name of medical science.  
I got out of the tub, dried off and put on a bathrobe.   
Next, I camped out in front of my computer searching for anything even remotely like this.   
Several hours later I was startled awake by my alarm clock. I got up and turned it off, then went to the bathroom to check my rash status. It was still there. In fact, it seemed to be getting worse.  
I decided that work was the last place I wanted to be while dealing with this. ‘What’s wrong with your face?’ I could hear children saying over and over. Having to patiently admit that I don’t have a single clue, repeatedly during the course of a day held no appeal to me.  
I called the boss and told him I wasn’t feeling well. I could hear him practically go into convulsions at the thought of me calling off.  
“How bad is it, really?” he said. “Can’t you come in and just take it easy?”  
“I don’t think so.”  
“I don’t allow you to call off,” he said trying to assert himself.  
“Well, I won’t be there today, with or without your permission.”  
I could almost hear his little head boiling like a cartoon tea kettle, about to blow.  
“If you call of, you’re fired!” he said, thinking he had fired the killing blow.  
“Ok, and that’ll solve your problem of having no assistant how?”  
He sputtered and chuffed, and made sounds I couldn’t even identify. I was about to ask if he was having a stroke, when he suddenly regained control.  
“We have the school children’s tour today,” he said. “How will I do tours and run the counter at the same time?”  
‘Dammit! I forgot about the tour.’  
I sighed deeply.  
“Ok, I’ll be in,” I said. “Under two conditions.”  
“Name them.”  
“First, I don’t do the tour,” I said. “I’ll run the concessions and ticket sales.”  
“But… “  
“Deal’s off,” I said.  
“Ok, ok, I’ll do the tours,” he said sounding quite exasperated. “What’s your other demand?”   
“No questions about my medical condition.”  
He hesitated.  
“Or I could hang up right now.”  
“No, no,” he said quickly, then cleared his throat. “I agree to your terms.”  
‘Great,’ I thought sarcastically. ‘I was hoping he’d refuse.’  
I sighed heavily.  
“I’ll be in.”  
He hung up the phone. Presumably before I could change my mind.  
An hour later I unlocked the door and walked in.  
“We’re not open yet,” Mr. Applebottom said. “I don’t know how you got in here, but you’ll have to leave until regular business hours.”  
“That’s fine with me,” I said. “I didn’t want to be here anyway.”  
He paused and took a closer look at me. To be fair, there wasn’t much to look at. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt even though it was supposed to be in the eighties today, I had gloves on as well as sunglasses and a hat. I looked like a movie star trying to be incognito.  
“Oh my goodness, Miss Premrose? It is you under all that.”  
“New condition, don’t mention the outfit.”  
He put his hands up in playful surrender.   
“So, if I may ask, when did all this start?”  
I sighed. “Yesterday, I was cleaning and this bug bit me.”  
“You say a bug bit you?”  
I nodded.  
“And it caused all this?”  
“I’m fairly sure. I know I didn’t eat any shellfish yesterday.”  
“Could you describe this bug,” he said slowly.  
“It was small, it kinda reminded me of a scorpion, but different. Honestly, it happened so fast I didn’t get a good look at it.”  
He stared off into space.  
“I’ll be back,” he said, his eyes glazed.  
“Ok, I’ll start getting ready for the morning.”  
“You do that,” he said without looking back.  
I watched him go. He reminded me of a zombie, just slow and listless.  
I shook it off and started preparing for the day.   
The tour went smoothly and the day was less eventful than I imagined it would be. I only had three kids stare at me the whole day. I said, “Boo!” to two of them when their parents were looking the other way.  
They jumped and ran away.   
Mr. Applebottom kept checking on me. It seemed nice at first, but there seemed to be more to it. He kept stealing glances at me. It was getting a little creepy. I wanted to ask him what was wrong.   
All through the day workmen came in carrying all kinds of construction equipment and pieces of metal.   
“What’s going on,” I asked Mr. Applebottom.  
“They’re setting up our new exhibit,” he said excitedly.  
“I didn’t know we were getting a new exhibit.”  
“It’s very exciting,” he said. “Let me show you.”  
I followed him to a large storage room that had been cleared out, where a solid metal cage had been constructed.   
“That’s impressive,” I said admiring the gleaming metal. “When will the creature arrive?”  
“Soon, it should be here within the next day or two.”  
“And it’s live, not a statue?”  
“Our first live exhibit,” he said, so excited he was dancing on his tiptoes. “Would you like to see the inside?”  
I shrugged and followed him around to the back of the cage. He stepped inside and I followed. It seemed like the animal would be comfortable. There were pillows disguised as rocks all around. In the corner was a nest that was a mattress disguised as a slab of stone. I sat on it and chuckled at how soft it was.  
Just then I heard the cage door slam shut. I jumped up and ran to it. Mr. Applebottom was standing on the other side.  
“Very funny,” I said. “You’ve caged me, now what are you gonna do with me?”  
“Wait,” he said, then walked away.   
I banged on the cage.  
“This isn’t funny,” I yelled. “Let me outta here!”  
I banged and carried on for a little while, then slowly walked a lap around the inside perimeter of the cage. There was what looked like a freshwater stream, fed by a spring. I took a closer look and found the PVC pipe that was hidden from visitors' eyes. It fed into a plastic pool that was decorated to look like rock.  
They definitely went all out to create the illusion of wilderness. After a few laps around, with some more cage banging thrown in for good measure, I sat on the slab rock bed and wondered what had possessed Mr. Applebottom to pull such a cruel joke. I’d been a good employee, or at least I thought I was.  
What if it’s not a joke? My mind said. What if it’s some sadistic torment?  
‘But why?’ I thought. ‘Mr. Applebottom is a kind man and a respected businessman.’  
As far as you know.  
‘What does that mean?’  
You have no idea what he’s like in private. Maybe he’s some weirdo, whack job, sadist, that gets off by locking people up and pretending they’re animals.  
‘That’s a bit of a stretch, don’t you think?’  
Are you sitting in a cage?  
‘Yes, but… ‘  
Did he put you there?  
‘Well, yes, but… ‘  
Have you been a bad girl?  
‘Stop that! I’m sure it’s nothing like that. He just… ‘  
Just what?  
‘Just went crazy and locked me in a cage, how the hell should I know?’  
You ever watch those crime shows on TV where the perpetrator was always the quiet sort no one would ever suspect of killing his neighbors and grinding up their bones to bake into cakes that he donated for bake sales?  
‘That’s sick.’  
 That’s what Mrs. Jones said when he invited her over and turned her into a Bundt cake.  
‘You’re just making this up to scare me.’  
If that’s what you want to believe.  
‘I tired. I’m gonna lay down on my nice soft rock and go to sleep.’  
Pleasant dreams.  
I sighed and laid down on the surprisingly comfortable fake rock, trying to imagine when and why Mr. Applebottom had gone crazy.  
I pulled out my phone and stared at it. I didn’t want to call the police and raise a fuss only to find out it really was a joke. I started typing what had happened to this point. Maybe I could send it to myself and have a good laugh about it when things got cleared up.  
\*\*\*  
I woke up feeling stiff and sore. I guess laying on something that isn’t my own bed had its consequences, no matter how comfortable it was.   
For the first time, I realized a design flaw in the cage setup. I didn’t see a bathroom. I did a full lap around searching and found something disturbing. There was a small door in the corner and a tray of food had been set inside. Right beside it was a bucket.  
‘Oh, I don’t think so.’  
I did another lap to make sure there was nothing I had missed. There wasn’t.   
I started to feel uncomfortable. Not only did I have to pee, but this entire scenario was getting out of hand. The joke was over. I’d had enough.  
I got my phone and held it to my face to unlock it, but it wouldn’t unlock. I tried again, but it refused. I went to type in my password but was distracted when I saw my thumb. The rash was gone, but in its place were layers of something that looked like scales.   
I stared at it with morbid fascination. I flexed it and moved it around, then pulled my sleeve up.   
To my horror, the rash on my arm had been replaced with scales as well.   
I panicked, pulling up my pantlegs, to find even more scales. I tried to pull off my shirt, but it kept getting caught. I pulled harder and harder until the shirt began to rip. I was determined at this point and continued ripping until the shirt finally came off.   
I stared down at a belly full of scales just below my bra that was also hiding scales.  
I screamed, terrified of this demonic possession that had overtaken my body. But even my scream was unfamiliar. My voice had changed. It was deeper and had a different quality to it.  
“No!” I cried out.   
But my voice only roared.   
“It can’t be,” I said, but only guttural grows emerged from me.  
I unlocked my phone with the password and called 911.  
“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator said.  
“Help me, I’m being held hostage in a cage inside the museum,” I said.  
“I’m sorry, could you turn down the TV, all I could hear was animal sounds.”  
“I’m not watching TV, this is me talking, can you please send help?”  
“If this is a prank call you could get criminal charges.”  
“It’s not a prank call,” I roared.  
“Last chance, either talk to me or I’m hanging up.”  
“But I’m trying to talk… “  
The line went dead.  
“… to you.”  
I stared at the phone.  
‘How can I get a message out if I can’t talk?’  
I looked through the options on the phone when it hit me.   
Text to speech, of course.  
I called the police again, then started typing like mad.  
“Hello, I’m the one who just called,” I typed, hearing the electronic voice say the words for me.  
“The one who had the TV up too loud?”  
I wanted to say it wasn’t the TV, that it was my voice that somehow won’t work. But I figured that would be the quickest way for her to hang up again.  
“Yes, that was me.”  
“What’s your emergency?”  
“I am trapped in the museum. My employer locked me in a cage.”  
“Are you in any danger?”  
I looked around the cage.  
“Not at the moment.”  
“Are you injured?”  
I looked at the scales on my arm.  
“No.”  
“OK, we’ll have someone there shortly, you hold on, ok.”  
I nodded my acknowledgement, not realizing she couldn’t hear it.  
“Yes, I will hang on until you arrive,” the mechanical voice said.  
The line disconnected.  
I did a fist pump in celebration.  
I started pacing, I was so excited to be rescued.   
The next ten minutes were the longest of my life. Finally, I heard voices, they were coming toward me. The door opened and in walked Mr. Applebottom with an officer.  
“Help me!” I screamed. “He’s holding me hostage!”  
The officer stepped up to the cage, then turned to Mr. Applebottom. I smiled in anticipation of seeing him led away in cuffs.  
“I see what you mean,” the officer said to him. “It really doesn’t like you very much.”  
“Well, we only just got it in yesterday,” he said. “She needs a little time to adjust to things.”  
“She?” the officer said looking at me. “Oh, yeah, I guess it is a she.”  
I covered my breasts, not even thinking about the fact that they were covered with scales.  
He laughed.   
“I see she understands perfectly well.”  
“Yes, sometimes a little too well. I’m going to have to keep a close eye on her to make sure she stays where she belongs.”  
“So my question is, how did she manage to get a phone and call us in the first place?”  
“I had an assistant who wasn’t very careful and let’s just say she won’t get too close to the cage again.”  
“Got a hold of her, eh?”  
“You could say that.”  
“You gonna try to get that phone back?”  
“Would you?”  
He looked me up and down. I pleaded one last time for him to save me. It only came out as a growl.  
“Nope, I think I’d leave it right where it is. The battery is sure to die soon, unless you charge it up for her. What are the odds of that happening?”  
He looked me in the eye.  
“Zero,” he said.  
“That’s what I thought. You have a nice night now, and we’ll just block that number for the moment. Let us know if you get it back or it dies.”  
“I surely will. You have a good trip back, officer,” he said.  
Once he was gone and the door was locked, Mr. Applebottom came back and stood just out of reach beside the cage. He held out his hand. I reached for it but he pulled it back.  
“No, give me the phone,” he said.  
I shook my head.  
“Give it to me!”  
I stepped back and shook my head.   
“All right, keep it,” he said. “It’ll be useless soon anyways.”  
I started typing and hit the play button.  
“What happened to me?” the mechanical voice said through my phone.  
“You have been transformed into another species.”  
I typed.  
“No shit, Sherlock, how and why?”  
“I had ordered a creature that I had hoped would be the star attraction of the museum. However, when it arrived I realized that it was too small to be a main attraction. That plus it doesn’t look that distinctive. It could easily be mistaken for a scorpion. As I was transferring it to it’s new cage, it escaped.”  
“And found me.”  
“Yes, I was quite unaware that a bite would cause such a transformation. However, here you are, my new star attraction.”  
“I don’t want to be.”  
“I do apologize for the inconvenience, but the transformation is quite irreversible.”   
“Inconvenience?” I typed, then picked up a real boulder and threw it at the cage.  
He ducked and covered his head as it hit the bars and shattered into a million pieces. He squealed in pain as the small rocks hit him like a shotgun blast. He ran to the door and stood behind it, peeking his head inside.  
“Make sure to get plenty of rest,” he said. “Tomorrow is your grand reveal. I need to get the word out, and I need to hire a new assistant.”  
“Fuc… “ my phone began to say but the sound was overwhelmed by me throwing another boulder at the bars.  
He dove out the door and slammed it shut just before the rocks hit him.  
I collapsed to my knees under the sheer weight of my life being taken from me. My eyes burned. I wasn’t sure if this was some new aspect of transformation or just my tears.  
I looked down at my mutilated, monstrous hands. My phone was still in one of them. I reached back to hurl it at the bars as well when I noticed my cell reception. I had four bars.   
I still had internet.  
My battery was still half full.  
I began desperately typing my story. When I was done, I found a website that dealt with cryptids and unexplained phenomenon.   
If you’re reading this, please help me. I’m at the museum of oddities in Frost Creek.   
I’ll keep posting until my phone dies.   
\*\*\*  
Mr. Applebottom was true to his word. People flocked in today, walking past my cage and staring. I considered throwing rocks at them. Maybe a few injuries would make them go away. But then I saw all the little kids and thought better of it.   
I decided to take a different path to show my protest. I laid on my fake rock with my back to the people and refused to move.  
It didn’t take long for the complaints to bring him back to my cage.  
“What are you doing?” he said through gritted teeth.  
I typed on my phone, “Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”  
“Wrong, you’re embarrassing me,” he hissed, grabbing the bars for effect. “Now get up and give them a sh… “  
I moved like a flash. My hand grabbed his and held him like a vise. I pulled him close. He was smashed against the bars.   
“P- please, don’t… “  
I grabbed the top of his head and turned it around in a full circle, enjoying the satisfying cracks of his vertebrae snapping. I pulled up and his head came off, showering me in blood. I stared into his face with a look of shock permanently frozen on it.  
The people in the room began to scream and run away.  
I stared at the dead body that was only upright because I was holding it. I looked back and forth between the head in one hand and the body in the other. I dropped them both and stared in horror as they hit the floor.   
Blood poured out onto the floor. I watched with morbid fascination as a bug skittered over and began darting its tongue out, licking up the blood.   
As I watched, I saw it was the same bug that had infected me and turned me into this horrible monster.   
I reached out through the bars towards it. It paused and looked up at me. I could almost see it make the connection between us. That it had been responsible for me. That we shared a kind of kindship, a bond that could barely be fathomed.   
It reached an appendage out towards me as well.     
I smashed my hand down, splattering blood everywhere and crushing the thing that had destroyed my life.   
I withdrew my hand and stared at the flattened creature laying in the blood of my boss. The two entities most responsible for this hideous transformation.  
I trudged over to my fake rock and plopped on it.   
I opened my phone, saw the battery indicator was flashing, and made this last entry.  
I will escape this cage.  
I will find where the creature came from.  
I will find a way to change back to my human form. And I pity anyone who stands in my way."

Of course, I will work my butt off trying to get an internship in the summer after Junior year, but I feel so hopeless, I feel like I don’t stand out. 
I have a 3.0 GPA right now, and i know thats gonna go down to a 2.9 or maybe  even a 2.8 after this semester’s grades come out due to how horribly I did. This semester was such a mess. I just want to get a job that pays well after college because I have to work during college to help my mom pay the mortgage and bills. It takes a toll on me … 
anyway i don’t want to turn this into a major vent but I just wanna know what should I start doing to assure that everything is gonna be okay after college? i mean networking and applying to places is important; but what should i focus on the most?"

I joined this sub so I could learn more about computer science in general. Not see posts about the job market and sending applications and crying over being the perfect applicant. I don't wanna learn how to come up with a solution in minutes. I want to spend time with my code. I want to think about it, experiment, get things wrong, and keep doing that. I love researching into algorithms and reading about them just for fun, even though I don't understand stuff most of the time. 

It's sad to see how many people here started studying computer science because they found computers and writing code interesting and fascinating and now getting a good job or internships has sucked all the passion out of them."

Does anyone have any experience or tips for this? Or certain things I need to keep in mind before going into Merced? What ECs aside from internships should I be doing?  


Also, I am aware that going to a CCC and transferring (I am from California) is more viable since UCs tend to prioritize admitting CC students since they have nowhere else to go afterwards, but my preference is to go to UC Merced since I am guaranteed my preferred major (CS&E), and even if I don't get into another school when I apply for transfer, I can still graduate with a UC degree."
13gz3mi,5,2023-05-13,[Trigger]: Recovering from being falsely accused of rape - join me,SapphireOnSunset,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/13gz3mi/trigger_recovering_from_being_falsely_accused_of/,"I had the privilege of attending a prestigious school in the UK, where I excelled in every aspect of my academic, extracurricular, and social life. I consistently ranked among the top students, and everything seemed to be going exceptionally well. However, my world took an unexpected and devastating turn when a girl I had been intimate with accused me of rape, claiming she had no recollection of the events.  
This incident occurred during my early days at university when she invited me to her room. She was capable of walking and willingly brought me there. When the police reviewed the CCTV footage during my interview, they dismissed the accusation as baseless and even found it amusing. Consequently, I was released without any further action the following day.  
Unfortunately, due to the prevalent influence of the MeToo Movement, the university initiated its own investigation. The girl rallied her friends and witnesses to support her claim that she was heavily intoxicated, asserting that her impaired memory meant she could not have given consent. Consequently, the university expelled me shortly thereafter. I want to make it clear that my frustration does not stem from a disdain for feminism, but rather from the abuse of power by certain individuals who seek to destroy the lives of others.  
In an instant, my entire world was upended. The accomplishments, scholarships, friendships, and internship opportunities that once stood as pillars of stability now feel uncertain. Just a few months ago, they were solid as a rock. This immense setback has engulfed me in a profound darkness, leaving me feeling trapped and overwhelmed. However, as a resilient individual, I understand that if I surrender to despair, no one will allow me to move forward. It is with this realization that I have chosen to share my story here, as a testament to my determination to persevere.  
I will survive. I will continue. Though I am currently in immense pain, I refuse to let my life crumble before me. Like a shattered crystal, the fragments may reflect the brilliance of the surrounding light. While it is challenging not to harbor feelings of bitterness, I understand that dwelling in hatred will not serve me well. Yet, it is undeniably difficult when everything I have worked so tirelessly for is now uncertain and wavering. My once-promising future now feels shaky and unpredictable.  
Despite these hardships, I will rebuild my life. It is my own journey, and I refuse to let this setback define me. The path ahead may be arduous, but I will not allow myself to be consumed by darkness. Instead, I will summon the strength within me to forge a new path, and in doing so, I hope to inspire others facing similar struggles. Though my current circumstances are painful, I remain hopeful that with time and resilience, I can regain stability and create a future filled with purpose and success."

I know though that they usually prefer MS/PhD kids (Im a rising senior), so I was wondering if anyone had any specific advice.

I'm aware I could get in as a SWE intern and then try to choose a project in ML, but i would prefer the role be specific and not have to risk it (I really didn't like my past SWE internships bc they were full-stack focused which I find boring)"

Any places that won't even ask for my GPA? Also this is for full time after I graduate but I do want to look into internships in the fall.

I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering at a university in the US. Recently, while browsing on LinkedIn, **I noticed that many people who have obtained 20+ online certifications (such as Coursera) have been able to secure top job positions.**

As someone seeking advice from experienced software engineers or data scientists, I would like to share my situation. Although I have gained valuable experience through three engineering internships, I must admit that my GPA is not impressive. While I am confident I can graduate, I am concerned that my low GPA may hinder my chances of finding employment after graduation. Despite my understanding of the concepts, exams have never been my strong suit, and this has affected my grades.

**I am wondering if pursuing certifications could help me demonstrate my understanding and expertise to potential employers.** Although I have been able to secure internships through personal connections who are familiar with my skills or employers who prioritize skills over GPA, I recognize that I may not always be so fortunate, and I aspire to have a stronger educational foundation.

I enjoy both working and studying, so taking online courses would not be a burden for me. In fact, I think I would find the online course interesting. However, **I am hesitant to invest my money and time into certifications if they won't significantly benefit me in the long run.** Therefore, I would greatly appreciate **hearing your opinion on whether you think online certification programs are valuable for students.**

Additionally, **if you have any suggestions for fun personal projects I would be delighted to hear from you as well!**

Thank you very much for your time, and any advice you can provide would be immensely helpful."

Recently, I accepted a data analyst internship under a school programme that spans across 1.5 years (full time internship during breaks, part time internship during school term). Now I'm 5 months into the internship and I realised the internship is not what I imagined it to be. Although I did small projects on data analytics using Python, I'm mostly doing app development using PowerApps and PowerAutomate. Even when I'm doing my data analytics project, my manager can't really help me with it because his day to day job is mainly developing apps using PowerApps and PowerAutomate so I feel like I can't grow my data analytics skills here either. I feel like I do enjoy building the apps that I'm building but it feels like I wasted my degree and skills because the things I learnt in school is much more difficult than what I'm doing at work. I have little app development experience apart from this internship but I do know a bit of React, HTML, JS, CSS, Flutter etc.

I just don't know how beneficial this internship will be in my career if I want to be a data scientist or data analyst once I graduate. Should I get out of this internship programme and find other internship (which is not guaranteed that I will even get any) or stick it out for 1.5 years so that I can save some money and focus on full time job hunting? (I'm using a lot of my free time practicing Leetcode and SQL). The company that I'm working for actually has very decent work life balance, very nice colleagues and has very flexible working arrangement, so apart from the actual work I'm happy with the company. My manager is also very nice and constantly compliments the quality of my work."

Also manipulated freeRtos but couldn’t get deep into thread synchronization.

At that time, everything I wrote used HAL abstraction layer, so it was intuitive at some degree.

As of now, I want to dive into the core of concepts and work “bare metal” (whatever you definition of that is). But the real goal is to get to work more on mcus and step into this side of embedded.

So the questions is, are MOOCs from ST a good start ? 
Seems a bit to me as a waste of time, as it is too much “stm oriented” and I could be better off learning more of a general “mcu programming” course.

If you have any suggestions on courses or guides or any type of documentation I will be more than pleased to get your input!"

To set the space: 

Imagine a 2 bedroom apartment. When you walk in, there is a large kitchen with a peninsula shape counter top. A little further in is the living room. To the right is my roommates (28M) room, and to the left is my somewhat smaller, but master bedroom (24m). There is bathroom and closet attached to my space. 

My roommates is determined to make the living room his gaming space...with a set of subwoofers and a sound bar. So whenever he plays, I can practically hear him all the time unless I tell him to turn it down. His bedroom is also empty. Like, just a mattress with blankets in the corner and a small desk. 

Lastly, he works a 7pm - 7am shift 4 days of the week 

My internship this summer will be 9am -5pm 5 days out of the week 

Now, the issue(s):

So, I got an internship this summer that is remote (yay!)  They are sending me a ton of stuff, between two monitors, a laptop and other accessories. I am a strong supporter of creating work-life balance.  And to me, that means not isolating myself in my room and rolling over to go to work. My room is already pretty cramp and stuffy (recently moved in 3 months ago. Moved from a 1bed room to a double)

I'm hoping to get advice on how to communicate to my needs with my roommate and avoid conflict. I want to move my desk to the living room, and he move his gaming set up to his bedroom. Primarily because he literally doesn't have anyone behind his  room, so he can be slightly louder without disturbing any AND can game or watch TV before going to work (which he frequently does). 

When I brought this up once before he said he would on consider buying a new TV and TV stand for his room only...and if he did he HAS to buy a good TV because anything lesser than what he has now would hurt his gaming and TV experience...AND that because I'm not family, and asking him to spend money on a new set up, he feels less obligated to.

Which for the record, i never told him to buy anything, just to move his gaming set up to his bedroom. 

 So. Any advice?

Thank you!"

Or should I go to MSU where I’ll be paying 40k per year for the same major 
I might get some more aid that’ll reduce the cost to 30k per year

13hgq9n,5,2023-05-14,Is interfaculty transfer significantly more difficult than intrafaculty?,bbrioche12,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/13hgq9n/is_interfaculty_transfer_significantly_more/,"Hi, I have two offers for McGill, one to Bachelor of Arts and one to Bachelor of Science (Bio, Biom, Life Sci).

My goal is now to study computer science - either a CS major in BA or BSc. I do not have a Bio, Biom, Life Sci major that I would like to do.

I’m aware that BA and BSc can be the same course wise, but I prefer BA for its Freshman Year and the fact that I wouldn’t HAVE to transfer.

However, my parents encourage me to consider the BSc because it looks better to employees. I know many disagree, but I accept that that may be true in some cases. Other benefits of BSc:

1) An option to do Honours Specialization (not open to BA) if I end up loving CS and want better preparation for grad school, OR option to drop to Liberal if I have other interests (same flexibility as BA).

2) Option of the 8/12/16 month Science Internship instead of solely the 4 month Industrial Practicum available to BA CS.

But that means I would have to accept my Science BBL offer with the intention of transferring to Science PEMC (which has CS). People warn not to do this, but I’m 60-80% confident I could maintain at least 3.5 GPA. My parents insist that an intrafaculty would be easier than an interfaculty transfer from Arts to PEMC.

Would the GPA requirement be any different? Would my chances be lower coming from Arts? 

Personally, I’m not convinced because I know I could do Arts and take the courses needed to transfer to Science after U0.

I need to accept an offer today, so thank you so much for any insight!"

After getting his degree he will be moving back to his home country, which is half way across the world. He is excited of moving because south africa is falling apart (we have no electricity for half the day, everyday). I would love to go with him, but i still have 3 more years to study (not this year included).

I could move to him after getting my degree, but it is unlikely that I would be able to find a job in his country and I have my student debt to pay. I am however guaranteed to get a job in my country from the bursary loan provider, but then I would have to work 1 year ""internship"" and 5 years fully to pay my debt (if I do this I only have to pay back 25% of my loan).

We haven't really talked about next year yet, but I'm planning on bringing it up next time I see him. I want to know how he feels about the situation, and if he will be able to wait for me. There has been a few times when he and his friends were talking about the future and then I would ask him why he doesn't just stay here. He hates my country and is also unsure if he would be able to find a job that pays a living wage.

I really don't know what to do. I love him and would love to marry him one day and it feels like he feels the same about me, but I also don't want to continue the relationship if we are just gonna break up next year. What are some things we can discuss that will help us?"

So, I wanted to go to umd because I wanted a better life opportunity. I didn’t want to go back to PA as it gives me ptsd because my parents passed away. As of right now, I got my drivers license switched, registered to vote in Maryland, obtain lease for apartments, affidavits from my mentors in a church organization and pastor, I’m also going to be doing a internship for an ambassador program for my church organization. I haven’t got the chance to file taxes as I did not make enough. Also, I couldn’t really get a job because I’m trying to keep my scholarships. 

Is there anyone that can please help me! Going to college without parents is tough along with financial problems as well. I really need to this reclassification. So if there is anyone, please help."
13hi0pq,1,2023-05-14,Overthinking New Grad,ALeafys,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13hi0pq/overthinking_new_grad/,"Hi Everyone,

I am a new graduate in need of advice of those in the CS industry. I recently signed a direct contract with Company A for a few months. It will be converted to a full time role by 4 months if I perform well with my duties. 

I signed all the required papers and start this week. My interaction with hiring manager and the office was quite positive. The location is quite far, but after onboarding, I will be remote mostly. The work here is client based, but they have quite a few clients lined up. They also worked with well renowned names to develop products for them. I am excited and can't wait for my first day.

However, am I making a mistake? I never had a contract role before, so maybe there is something I don't know that I should fully consider.

The reason I say this is because I have an interview for another internship at Company B, whose name is quite prominent. The work here will specifically focus on Company B's software.

I am not sure what to do with this interview. I can attend it, but that means asking time off for the first week of my job to attend an in person interview. I can reschedule it, but I won't be free for a few weeks. That leaves declining it until the foreseeable future.

What should I do?  Focus on Company A and forget Company B. Or somehow try to get time to interview at Company B. I would appreciate any advice, thank you!

P.S Company B intern salary is quite low for an intern salary. I received higher before, and the prospective of full time employment I am not sure. The biggest issue is I don't wanna risk a good offer for something I am not sure is worth the effort."

Hey fellow Redditors! I need some advice and I have come  
here to ask for help from people that have more experience and are way more  
knowledgeable than me. It’s a long read so I appreciate your time.  
Me:  
I'm a 32-year-old second year computer science student in  
the UK with a previous MBM and experience in the hospitality industry. I  
decided to change careers in 2021 and took a risk in pursuing something I have  
always wanted to do( study computer science). Ideally, I want to become a  
front-end software engineer for a big company right after graduation( who doesn’t),  
but I'll take whatever job I can get even if it’s for a no-name company and  
have nothing to do with front-end development. For now, I only have one  
internship from a big company, but it's not related to software engineering. I  
attached my CV for some constructive criticism too. [CV LINK](https://imgur.com/a/4VWKtM0)  
Here's my dilemma:  
I recently had a few interviews and when it came to the  
coding test, I realized I didn't know anything. That surprised me because I  
have only high marks in uni. This experience got me down, so I turned to Reddit  
to figure out what to do. That's when I discovered the importance of LeetCode  
tasks. The problem is, I couldn't even solve a single easy LeetCode question  
out of the one I look at! This got me even more discouraged, especially when I  
read posts from people who graduated five years ago and still can't land an SWE  
job. Panic set in because I have one year left of uni, and I can't even pass an  
internship interview. I think I am so stressed now because I am old, I am  
self-funding my second education and I realise that the chance of not finding a  
job when I graduate is bigger than I thought.   
   
What am I currently doing:  
   
I am aware that I must organize and arrange my upcoming  
summer to acquire knowledge that will enhance my chances of obtaining a job  
after graduation. At present, I am enrolled in a Java introductory course  
offered by Stanford, aiming to refresh my foundational understanding.  
Additionally, I have watched a beginner's Java tutorial video on YouTube  
created by Mosh. My objective is to fill in the knowledge gaps from the past  
and gradually engage in tasks on platforms like LeetCode. Ultimately, I aim to  
gain a strong grasp of the basics, enabling me to impress potential employers  
and secure a job.  
   
My goal:  
By the beginning of October, my goal is to be ready for the  
technical parts of the interviews. This summer, I plan to work on two projects.  
One will be a personal profile page built with JavaScript and React. I find  
portfolio pages interesting and visually appealing, and they provide a great  
opportunity to showcase small details during interviews. As for the second  
project, I haven't decided yet, but I want it to be in Java (open to ideas!).  
   
My ask:  
If you were in my position, how would you plan out the next  
five months? What projects would you work on, and how would you allocate your  
learning time? What resources would you recommend? Also, I'd appreciate any  
advice on what I should change on my CV or any other suggestions that can help  
me out. I'm grateful for any help you can provide even if its just advice. Of  
course, studying won't stop on October 1st, but my goal is to be ready by then,  
and any extra time after that will be a bonus.  
   
Looking forward to your valuable insights and suggestions!"
13hjcwg,72,2023-05-14,Final Notes on Software Engineering,denzz312,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/13hjcwg/final_notes_on_software_engineering/,"Hey,

So this semester is my final semester studying Software Engineering Co-op (BEng) at Concordia University. When I just started, few posts helped me to get a general idea about the program and some tips about it.

So I would like to do the same thing and leave a few of my comments here for future students.

Intro:

I got accepted to Concordia in Fall 2019 as a mature student since I missed some credits. After searching for some reviews about general prerequisite courses, I decided to take them at a college instead. Situation did not change much and you can find many recent reviews about intro calculus, physics and chemistry classes proving it.

**Notes:**

* **Be ready to learn.** Once you join the program you're gonna find out that many people already have a background in coding, some are self-taught and some are coming from a programming related college program. There will be a gap between your knowledge and theirs, so at the beginning you will have to put more effort to shrink that gap. Generally this gap cannot be felt after 2-3 semesters. Even after graduating, we will have to continue learning to be up-to-date with technologies and stay competitive.
* **Laptop.** For the first 2-3 semesters it doesn’t matter since mainly the classes are related to math or to intro programming courses - OOP1, OOP2 and DS&Algos, which do not require any resources. After starting getting deeper into specific topics you will figure out what you need. When it comes to whether to use Windows, Linux or MacOS, it again does not really matter, just make sure that you master the system that you use. But make sure you know how to use other systems as well, don’t be that Mac person who cannot install applications on Windows, nor be a Windows person who cannot navigate thru Linux terminal.
* **Tablet.** (Optional). This is a personal recommendation since it requires extra spending, but I really liked using an iPad with Apple Pencil for taking notes or reading the lecture material. Apps like Notability and GoodNotes make taking notes easy and accessible. It is nice to get access to the notes of the class that you took 4 semesters ago in a few seconds. It decreased the number of things I had to carry with me. At the beginning of my education I bought a mechanical pencil with a lead refill pack which I used for exams and some courses. Still have more than a half of my lead pack….. Some profs prohibit using any tech during the lectures, just get a normal paper notebook for that and let it go, you may get 2-3 profs like that.
* **Practice.** Make sure u code whatever u learn in your classes. Do not consider that you learnt something if you cannot code it up. If you cannot code it, you have learnt nothing! This is very important for intro courses like COMP248, COMP249 and COMP352 (for these courses specifically you can practice topics on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)), but still holds for other courses as well.
* **Git/Github.** It is a separate point just to make an emphasis on it. Learn how to use version control in your first semester. It was never taught explicitly in uni, so many skipped it. In my third year, I had teammates who sent the project as a zip file. Don’t be like that.
* **Github student pack.** There are many services that are discounted or even free for students, use them! The link -  [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). So beside getting Spotify on a lower rate, get some developer tools as well (many even for free). My favourite in this category are the products from Jetbrains, especially IntelliJ since the main programming language in Concordia is Java and I found it to be better than Eclipse, but feel free to check their other products.
* **Co-op.** It’s a nice option that is provided by the university. It is helpful to find your first internship. Will you need it to get you something afterwards? A year ago my answer would be no, but now, with decreasing demand in the market, it is better to stay and use this additional resource.
* **First experience.** Try to get work experience during your education. At least you would see how things work in real life and won’t be shocked in your first after grad job. Having four years of education does not guarantee that you will be a good candidate, so look to the market, try it, identify the skills that you are missing and work on them. Therefore once you finish your degree you will be more or less ready. (But don’t forget about point one)
* **Outdated courses.** Some courses may feel irrelevant and you may have a feeling that you will never use them in your real work because the material is old, and it might be the case as well, but many of those courses actually teach you different ways of thinking about something. It’s like math, you probably won’t take any integrals in your job, but you will use many other skills that you acquired while learning how to do them. Few of the courses are useless tho, and even the university accepts it and removes some from the program.
* **Missing semester.** Many of the things are not covered during education. It is the case even at the best institutions of the world. So students from MIT shared what they were missing - [link](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J). It is a nice complementary resource. I would add containers to this list as well. Go over the topics by yourself.
* **Good teammates.** There are several courses with team projects, you will work with good and bad teammates. Unfortunately there is no way to avoid bad ones, you can only try to complain to the prof. If you are lucky and the prof cares, then s/he would give a fair evaluation, but it was not the case for a majority of my classes. Just make sure that you got a good team for minicap and capstone. If you are registering for capstone and you don’t have a solid team, sorry, you are late to the game.
* **Time horizon.** It is okay if it takes longer. You do not need to finish your degree in 4 years, if you feel that there is too much on ur plate, extend it, it is better than burning out and losing fully your  interest and motivation.
* **Teachers.** Not gonna list any ratings here. The ones that made me enjoy my classes are - Aiman Hanna, Peter Rigby and René Witte. Check the reviews on ratemyprofessor. If you end up being obliged to take a class with a prof with bad reviews, give it a chance, go to the first few lectures, you may get a different opinion. Keep in mind that generally people would go and write a review on a bad experience, but the ones who had good experience with the same prof just wouldn’t mention it after finishing the class. So do your part, leave your review!
* **Course Load/ Time management.** Any course load is manageable, just depends on how disciplined you are. There is a maximum number of credits you can take per semester and whatever is allowed is actually doable. I started to see questions like - “Are COMP-XXX, COMP-XXX, SOEN-XXX, COMP-XXX and SOEN-XXX doable in one semester?”. Well, yes! Whatever the combination is. During my education I took maximum allowed credits for one semester, and worked full time and studied full time for a year, doable! Of course you would have to sacrifice some free and fun time to manage such an extreme load, but generally 5 courses per semester are doable without any huge effort if you manage your time correctly.
* **Experience >> Grades.** And lastly…. Put getting real experience as the main priority. No one will look at your GPA (Except if you want to do Masters ofc), you will be evaluated by what you can really do and not by what you only “know”. And the best way to become someone who is able to do things is by …. surprise surprise …… doing things. Have side projects, go outside of what you learn in your classes (check free [udemy](https://www.concordia.ca/it/services/udemy.html) courses that are available for students), build things, find a job that will allow you to gain experience etc. My GPA had a nice fall from 4.1 to 3.5 during the last three years after I started working or giving more time for my personal projects. I would give up every decimal of my GPA if I had to make that choice again.

&#x200B;

Outro:

Hope it will be helpful to all upcoming students. This is only my personal opinion. All my peers are welcome to add anything that was not mentioned here or correct me if they have a different opinion on something.

All the best,

DD"

I only have one, and they live an hour away. It's hard to make plans to see eachother so we've been drifting apart. I have a boyfriend but I want to have friends I can do stuff with other than him. He is very busy so I can't do stuff with him often. I just want a friend I can call up randomly and go get food or something. 

The issue of why I don't have friends from highschool or other places is because I have Autism, ADHD, and anxiety which makes it hard to connect with people since I'm usually viewed as weird. I went to school an hour away, so I couldn't really make friends that I could hang with outside of school. Also, I was in theraputic schools all my life so I have always been around people like me so I find it difficult to interact with people who aren't autistic or have ADHD. But I still love people, I really enjoy being around them and have more fun when I am with others. I hate being alone.

I tried going to college and dropped out in like a month and a half because it was too much. I was hoping I would make friends there but I didnt. No one ever talked to me, even when I had to do things with another person they barely talked to me. I tried going to events but again, nobody. I joined a club but it only met once a month and I dropped out before the first meeting. 

A big issue is that I can't get a job. I have applied to so many places and no one will get back to me. So making friends at work isn't really an option. 

I volunteer, but all the other volunteers are much older than me. The only people my age are interns and I don't really get a chance to interact with them or the ones I have interacted with don't have any interest in talking. 

I even tried to download Bumble because they have a friend feature, but that hasn't been working for me either. I've had it for months now and the closest I got was exchanging numbers then they kinda stopped talking. 

I looked online for clubs in my area, I even put in a 30 mile radius around where I am to see if there are any a but further. I didn't find anything. I looked ever week for a month and didn't see anything so I just gave up. 

Like I said, I hate doing things alone. If I don't have anyone to do stuff with, I'll usually just not do anything at all. When I try to do things alone I just don't have fun.

I have about a year of college under my belt and I completed a 6 months long internship as a data analyst after 6 months of training.

I tried finding a job after that but it was still very difficult so I decided to go back to college and try to at least finish up my associates before trying to job hunt. 

A friend of mine recommended I take the Google course for data analytics and I've been hearing some decent things about it. Although admittedly it was from Google's own source so the bias seems kinda strong.

Does a certificate from Google hold weight? Would a company take me more seriously despite a bachelor's degree? What do you all think?"
13hp29r,4,2023-05-14,How do I know when I'm ready for a senior position?,CanadianBacon18,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/13hp29r/how_do_i_know_when_im_ready_for_a_senior_position/,"I have about 4 years of experience at Amazon as a SDE-2 on a team owning some fairly critical systems. I've led projects to completion, mentored new graduates to SDE-2 positions and interns to full-time hire positions. In general, I'm quite satisfied with my position but I do like to keep my eyes and ears open for better opportunities.

Recently I've been exploring leaving my current job at Amazon due to tech stack and career growth concerns. For the most part, these concerns are around pigeon-holing myself in the proprietary Amazon internal technologies rather than getting experience in more modern and broadly used tech. I'd like to avoid downgrading my compensation substantially, so this is leading me to look at positions in the USA or remote positions for American companies. These are almost entirely senior engineer positions however.

My concern is that I am unprepared for a senior position. That by taking a risk and trying to move into a senior SDE role I'll end up losing a great job and fail (and ultimately lose) at my new role as well. These concerns are largely around the ability to perform technically in system designs which is weak point I am actively working on.

How can I self-assess and determine if I am ready to move up to a senior position?"

I'm a 32YO Indonesian currently finishing my Biomed Sci doctorate at a university in one of the EU countries (THES ranking >400). My contract has just ended and I'm just left with writing up my thesis plus a viva, but I won't be graduating until this September at the earliest.   


I had a 3-month internship in the Netherlands during my study, which was a positive experience. Basically, I've been on the hunt for a position in biotech / non-academic research, with a priority on the countries above in the hope that I can settle down for good. I can communicate in English and Indonesian without problems, I get by with Japanese quite all right, though I need to polish up my Dutch. I'm aware that tough is a gross understatement when it comes to finding work in the EU, let alone Switzerland, for non-EU nationals.   


I'd just like to get feedback on what options are available for these countries, and I'm also open to suggestions on other countries that I should consider. Alternatively, do you reckon it's worth getting a Master's degree in these countries to put a foot in the job market?

I've 3y+ experience as a full stack dev/analyst in a very big US firm before Masters, have good (but not the best) GPA and a solid research internship in a very reputed US uni but it seems like my profile is outrightly being rejected as someone requiring a visa sponsorship.
I want to try applying for roles outside Spain now, where the tech/AI industry is thriving and having better pay. Spanish pay is horrible even compared to my previous job from 2y ago. Very reluctant to try because while on one side I'm confident my profile is much better than average, however the lack of progress in the last 1 month of applying to endless companies is just killing my confidence. Is it realistically possible for a non-EU recent grad with 3yoe to get a job outside of the country in which they did their masters?"

How hard is it? Like leetcode easy - medium? Also what type of questions, like strings, hash tables, linked lists? 

This is exactly what it says about the OA:

""If you’re applying for a role in America. There is no time limit for the assessment but please plan to allocate approximately 60 minutes in total to complete it. The challenge contains two coding questions followed by a video question. Both coding questions can be taken in primarily Java or Python. Please note, you do not need to complete both questions in one sitting.""

**One more question:** can I only take it in Python or Java? Since I usually do OA's in kotlin. I am ok at python, can brush up if needed.

Thanks in Advance


Edit 1: For those wondering why I’m already looking at 2024 internships is cuz they start rolling out now, but most in August. **A lot of them are also reviewed on a ROLLING BASIS so getting your application sent asap increases your chances a lot. ** So start applying for next year internships asap.

Edit 2: It seems the first question is a document parsing question. And the second is a graph traversal question."

I’ve already dipped my toes into full-stack web development and machine learning and want to explore a new field - like mobile development.

Since I’m a dedicated Apple user (plus Apple UI looks so much better), I want to learn Swift and potentially build a full-fledged project with it.

I have a couple of questions:


1. Resources to learn Swift?
2. How long will it take to be able to learn enough to create a basic, full-fledged project that is resume-worthy?
3. If I study 10 hours a week for 3 months, can I gain proficiency to the point where I can apply to mobile development intern roles?
4. Curveball question: is mobile development a good field to explore, or should I go learn something else?
5. Heard I have to use XCODE. However, I despise XCODE and prefer VSCODE. Am I missing out on anything if I use VSCODE instead?

For reference, I’m already familiar with OOP (Python, C/C++, Java) and web dev languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I'm new to reddit and I don't know how this works but I'll just put my query out there.

I'm a 2023 grad, coming from one of the most tier-3 colleges in India. So tier-3 that even Infy, TCS and CTS didn't visit our campus for bulk recruitments.   
I think I'm an above average student, not smart enough to solve DSA problems in half hour, but given sufficient enough time, I can solve a couple. I've been an integral part of all the projects that I've worked on. 

I'm not yet placed because my current organisation (where I'm working as an intern) hasn't given a guarantee about an employment offer. But they aren't firing me from my internship as of now.  
Companies off-campus aren't accepting my application. Because I'm not experienced (read, not an employee).

Family suggests doing a 6-7 month bootcamp which is ridiculously expensive and not worth the time. I know I can work and focus on building my own projects. Experienced and recent grads out there, what do you suggest?

Some things about me:  
1. Working currently in MERN stack  
2. Working on Java and Springboot for a stack change because I'm honestly sick of MERN.

All suggestions are welcome! Thanks!"

DE classes: calc 2, calc 3, chem 1, chem 2, microbio, cell/molecular bio, english 1 & 2, first aid, literature, etc. planning on genetics next year!

5. state seal of biliteracy

**Extracurriculars**: so basically im stressed out cause none of them are connected to my hs (except soccer) and only 2 are connected to cc. also the hours are lowk crazy but that is because I take all courses on college schedule so a lot of the time I work at my job during the day. plus my stem ambassador position is during the school day and i also work on my honors project and org i founded during the school day (mostly instead of doing schoolwork!!) 

1. niche sport (9-12, team captain 11-12, 20hrs/week), national champion, 2x nat qual, 2x midwest champ, state champ, etc. (THIS RUNS YEAR ROUND EXCEPT FOR 2 MONTHS DURING HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER SEASON)

3. intern/research assistant to PhD student at local T50 university (summer after 11, 6 hrs/week): in food science so not super major-related
4. varsity and club soccer (9-12, club captain 12, 15 hrs/week): lowk self explanatory, all conference 2nd team, club team was 2nd, 3rd, and 5th in state for past 3 years.
5. summer research program at local T50 on health and social media (6 weeks, free, not sure how many hours/week i think its 10-15, summer before 12)
6. job as pharmacy technician (11-12, 10 hrs/week) self explanatory
7. STEM ambassador at cc (12, 10hrs/week) paid, application required, starting this fall. basically plan events, organize guest speakers, etc.
8. 1. intern for largest news source/social media page for sport in #1 (11-12, 5 hrs/week) write articles, reach out to teams and players offering interviews/podcast spots, make graphics
9. honors project for cc (11, 7hrs/week): wrote lit review on certain cancer treatment
10. part time job teaching sport in #1

**Essays/LORs/Other**: 

manifesting that theyre good!!!

LORs: no particular order

1. bio prof who also runs stem ambassador program at cc
2. calc 2 prof. she liked me. i participated even tho it was a large class. she wrote LOR for summer program i got into
3. ap world teacher: i lowk sucked at this class but still got an A. shes also my hs soccer coach and likes me (she heard abt me being in calc 3 and thinks im  a genius so ill just let her keep thinking that)

But most of the courses I come across are beginner oriented and some courses tend to deviate from web technologies.

What should I learn to grow as a software engineer? Should I learn more frameworks? Get a better grip on architecture designs? Is it more about who understands the computer fundamentals better?   
Can someone please help, it feels like I've been learning nothing for the past few months."

What is the best way I can spend my summer to maximize my chances of landing a decent internship for the next summer?  


I've been doing The Odin Project for a while, and I'm learning intermediate level HTML and CSS. I will then branch out to learning JS and build some MERN projects. I've done a bit of grokking the coding interview to keep practice, but I'm not sure if this is a good way to do both at once. Prior to choosing JS, I was learning Ruby (to learn ROR later), but it now feels like a waste of time due to less opportunities being available (from what I've seen from linkedin and indeed - not saying it's worthless).

I applied to very few applications during the spring semester (<50) and was rejected from all of them. My resume was very weak, and my current goal is to strengthen my resume.

Here are my reasons for going:
I already have a degree in media & communications, so I would be doing it mostly for the experience and classes. I’ve always wanted to take English classes, which I’d be taking. They also offer an internship while over there. I have also always wanted to travel, the idea of seeing the English countryside on weekends thrills me.

My reasons for not going:
I do not like the people in the program, and I’d be required to live in a flat with them. All of my friends will be at home, still at college. It’s my senior year so I’m not sure if I want to miss out on the last bit of time I’ll have with my closest friends. If I don’t go, I can pursue a second degree in either English or Computer science- making my degree a double major.

This is a big deal because I am concerned about the job prospects when graduating with a single degree in media and communications. If I get a double degree now, maybe I can just go to london later for grad school after becoming more financially stable?

I was wondering if anyone has any tips for getting into top grad schools/programs.

I am a CS major, and my goal is to get into UCLA/USC, but I'll probably try for Stanford or MIT as like reaches. My main career path is to land somewhere in the AI field, specifically the machine learning/deep learning areas.

For a little more context, I am only a junior-standing undergraduate who will probably graduate in the next two years. I'm asking this question so I can plan ahead on what I need to do.

Is it really as simple as just getting internships and good grades? Or should I focus on getting research experience? Also, if I go this route, should I try and get research experience with a professor from these schools?

I have a problem statement, which may or may not be a part of Analysis. And Need your Help.

**So basically Business Statement is** , we wants to connect with new clients, as they could be our potential new customers. And a Team scrape a list of company names from web, and we match their names  with our already existing clients. So that if the list contains already existing client, We don't wanna contact them again.

And those with no name match, will add a column, named <Status> which will mark them as, **Exiting\_Client**, or **potential\_clients** based on their match result.

Now issue is, It is not good to directly match their full name to name, bcz if the our existing client name is in Scraped List, but its not exact name, but some variant name. So full name matching will say, we didn't found this name and mark it as ***potential\_clients,*** So I wants some method to match names on fuzzy basis so that, ***<Indus-valley limited corporation>*** could match with **<Indus valley ltd>** and so on...

**At the End I wants something like this.**

I have read about *Levenstein distance*, and applied it on few cases, and this does the jobs, but Since our Database of existing Client name is big, so I thought it would take lots of computation, as for each name in Scraped Data, it will create n-vector space for n-names in our Database, and then will give final name with closest match.

So, can you please recommend me any method I should Try or Any blog, which I can use as Guide for this project. Also, if I am wrong in levenshtein distance, please correct me.

13i5udx,1,2023-05-15,Feel super jealous of guy I’ve been seeing because of his job,chillearn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13i5udx/feel_super_jealous_of_guy_ive_been_seeing_because/,"TL;DR person I’m seeing romantically makes way more than me and I can’t get over my jealousy. Looking for tips to calm my nerves 

Hey,

Would love some advice or maybe just words of encouragement. So I (M22) have been seeing this guy (M29) for the past 1.5ish months and we hit it off really well. We grew up in the same area despite living abroad so we connected in a great way. He’s really nice to me and I love spending time with him, go over to his place a lot, etc and I could see myself wanting to take things further with him.

I noticed right off the bat that he was well off. He lives in a beautiful high-rise condo above the city which much cost a fortune, and he mentioned offhand how he owns multiple properties, travels frequently, etc

I figured he just came from a privileged background (which he does btw), but what really made me feel sick with envy was when I asked what he earns at his job.

Some background is that we both work in finance, I in investment banking and he as a derivatives trader at a market maker / prop shop. My WLB is horrendous and I usually pull 70-80+ hour weeks including weekends for what feels like little in our city (think just around $100k total comp, maybe a little less). I asked him what he earns while out for drinks and he said he cleared $1.1m all-in comp during his best year at his firm.

I literally wanted to throw up when he said that. He works 50 hours per week max, shows up to the office when he wants, and never works weekends. Later that night, I began researching how I might get this type of job as it’s not too late for me to switch careers having just graduated college, I also did an internship in trading, etc, but quickly found out the screening process involves several math-heavy assessments which I know I probably wouldn’t be able to pass. I’m good at math but not genius-level, and some of these practice tests were just insane (like, solve 80 challenging mental math problems in 8 minutes, passing score 80% — just not something I could do that quickly). It makes me feel better that he told me he failed the test when he took it, but because he met the CEO of the company at a drinks reception later that day, the CEO gave him another shot at interviewing and was finessed in.

I’ve always been a very competitive overachiever. I grinded in high school to get to an Ivy League school, and I grinded in college to get my current job offer with like a <2% acceptance rate. Despite this, I never outwardly showed my competitiveness that much I guess? I was always very supportive of friends’ career paths no matter what they accomplished, but this feels way different as it’s a romantic interest.

Idk, I just feel like I’ll always be in second place to him because I’ll never be able to make as much money as quickly as he has, and if I do make that much money in the future it will be at the expense of my WLB. Like, I think I could do his job very well if I had time to prepare and didn’t have to do these stupid tests to get in. I think there are other ways to get the job — I could easily switch back to the trading desk I interned in and maybe lateral along with some networking, etc. but I keep telling myself I’m missing the point, which is that I am my own unique person with unique talents and strengths which may be better suited in a different role. I studied liberal arts and foreign languages in college, I’m great at writing and argumentation naturally, while he comes from an engineering background as has been doing the more quantitative stuff as a main focus for years. I keep trying to think positively about it but I literally just cried because of how jealous I was.

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any words of advice to give?"

Various liquid concoctions sit in glistening bottles of all shapes and sizes. It is said that there is enough chemical diversity to get any sapient species—and many of the non-sapient ones—drunk off their asses, or ass-equivalents. 

“Long day, huh?” the Yoyitna bartender clacks. 

“You’re telling me,” the human replies as he and his alien coworker sit down. The seats shift to conform to each of the organisms’ bodies. The bartender takes their orders and slides them their respective containers. 

The pair are interns at the Galactic Community Organization. A new sapient species, the Aemigs, has just been discovered and so hundreds upon hundreds of treaties now must be worked out. The humans, as the now-second-to-most-recently discovered species, are taking on the load of the work. 

“Micheal,” the Jolktion bellows out of their talk-mouth while pouring a stiff drink into their other one, “did you submit the revisions to the agriculture department?” 

“Please Ghyu, let’s not talk about work.” 

“Fine, fine.” 

The pair chat about other things. The newest video game neither have had time to play. The latest match between their respective species’s stellerball teams. Eventually Ghyu feels the need to bring up their day again. 

“What do these Aemigs even look like?” 

Michael is hooked. The legal stuff is all grunt work, biology is his passion, “They’re actually pretty interesting. If they were from Earth we’d’ve called them rodents. But they’re cold blooded. Furry, mostly, besides their faces. Four eyes, as well. But you can relate to that.” 

Ghyu nods before replying, “Rodents. That’s the same group that your species is in, right?” 

Michael tries not to take offense. A couple of years in the GCO has taught him that the most common human cultural norms are completely lost amongst the stars. He raises his glass and shakes it to signal the bartender that he is ready for a refill. “No, no. We’re closely related, all things considered. But humans are primates.” 

“Oh that’s right,” Ghyu says, “what’s the word? You’re…” he takes off his translator and tried to move his talk-mouth in a way to make the syllables like an English speaking human would, “a… ape… apes?” 

“Yep. Great Apes actually.” 

“Great apes? I’m not so sure about that,” the bartender interrupts the conversation as they pour brown liquid in Michael’s glass. 

“I’m sorry?” 

“There is no need to apologize,” the barkeep says matter-of-factly. 

“No, I’m wondering what do you mean by that?” 

“Well, it’s not like humans are among the greatest species in the universe or anything.” 

“No, that’s not what I…” Michael begins to say but the bartender has already turned away to fill the drinks of the other patrons. 

Michael turns back to Ghyu, “What’s that guy's deal?” 

“Well, it did sound like you were bragging,” the Jolktion says. 

“So what if I was? I happen to think we humans are pretty great.” 

“You’re a young species. Don’t get ahead of yourself.” 

“I’m twenty years older than you.” 

“A human year is quicker than a Jolktion year. You know that. We’re the same age.” 

“Either way,” Michael stops for a moment, “I mean humans built the Great Pyramids.” 

“You all sure like to add ‘great’ to your proper nouns,” Ghyu says as they take a swig of polychlorinated biphenyls, “Besides, everyone has pyramids. That’s like the starting shape for massive structures.” 

“What about Alexander the Great?” 

“Isn’t he known for killing a bunch of humans?” 

“Well… okay. The Great Lakes.” 

“That’s more of a natural phenomenon, isn’t it?” 

“Sure,” Michael thought for a moment before proceeding, “The Art of War. Shakespeare. The Quran. Frida Kahlo. Queen. Confucius. Friends. The Taj Mahal.”

I hope you're all doing well. I recently completed my bachelor's degree in commerce from an open university in India and scored 75 percent marks. Now, I'm considering pursuing a Masters degree in Finance, specifically at the W.P Carey School of Business at Arizona State University (ASU). However, before I take the plunge, I wanted to gather some insights and advice from the community.

&#x200B;

First and foremost, I would like to know if I am eligible to apply for the Masters in Finance program at W.P Carey, ASU with my background. Since my bachelor's degree was obtained from an open university, I am unsure if it meets the requirements set by the university. If anyone has knowledge or experience regarding this matter, I would greatly appreciate your input. It would be helpful to hear from current or former students of the program or anyone familiar with the admissions process.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, I would love to learn more about the program itself. Are there any Redditors who have completed or are currently enrolled in the Masters in Finance program at W.P Carey, ASU? I'm interested in hearing about your personal experiences, the curriculum, the faculty, and any notable aspects of the program. How did the program shape your understanding of finance and prepare you for a career in the field?

&#x200B;

Speaking of careers, I'm also curious about the career opportunities that may be available after completing the programme. Are there any specific industries or roles where graduates from this program tend to excel? I would appreciate any insights on job placements, internships, networking events, or career support provided by the university or the program itself. 

&#x200B;

Finally, I've been advised by some of my friends that Finance graduates are having a really bad time finding employment opportunities in the US, especially international students. They have advised me to pursue a Masters in Business Analytics, citing that the opportunities and pay are significantly higher compared to finance. I, personally am interested in Finance but I also want to know about the opportunities available to international students pursuing Finance.

&#x200B;

I apologize for bombarding you all with so many questions, but I believe your firsthand experiences and knowledge can provide valuable insights to help me make an informed decision. Thank you so much in advance for your time and willingness to share your thoughts. I look forward to reading your responses and engaging in a fruitful discussion."

I know that the computer science industry focuses more on your portfolio and not which school your degree is from (in sg context) so which uni will provide the best opportunities for internships and exposure to the industry?

Another factor im interested in is location. SMU is more accessible since its near central but the tuition fee is pricier whereas NUS and NTU though further away has the option of staying in halls. However im not quite sure if i will suit the hall life."
13i8j3a,20,2023-05-15,Internship Anxiety,hilpoint,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13i8j3a/internship_anxiety/,"I’ve recently started my first ever SWE internship (sophomore year summer) and I’m so anxious about under-performing. I’m not really trying to get a return offer (as I’m only a sophomore, and the internship isn’t based in my area). But somehow I just really want to perform well and make good contributions, maybe because I just hate being judged? 

I’m currently entering the second week of the internship, and I still have no idea what’s going on with the code base, architecture etc as there isn’t much documentation… My first week I just spent doing nothing much, waiting for access to be given. All I did was write a detailed root cause analysis for one bug, which was heavily guided by my mentor. Granted it was praised in a private group chat amongst the full timers, but I think that might just be them being nice (and also no code was written, so it’s not like I actually proved my coding skills) And idk if i’m just being self conscious but everytime they ask me stuff in the stand ups, I feel that I don’t speak very well, and they probably have a bad impression of me lol… 

Idk how long on-boarding takes and how long the average preparation time before actually being productive is, but I really don’t see it coming in the near future (also bc the code base is huuugggeee). I also feel really anxious that I look dumb to my mentor/manager/team members and I feel that it’s putting me in a worse position because i don’t speak confidently / eloquently as a result. Doesn’t help that since the internship isn’t based in my area, i have problems understanding the accent and sometimes team members speak in a foreign language amongst one another, and i’m just an intern so i don’t feel comfortable telling them to change it. I just feel like i should be as invisible as possible as an intern and not disrupt their work, but I don’t think this mindset is right. Plus it’s a fully wfh position, so it’s hard to make real connections with the other team members and all.  Just looking for advice and maybe anyone who feels the same way about their internship :("

My Project is literally a netflix clone and I was gonna slightly edit this [https://github.com/Gopalakrishnan-V/netflix-clone](https://github.com/Gopalakrishnan-V/netflix-clone)

This project uses TMDB api to fetch movie details and play trailers using youtube player now for now I atleast want to play one movie or video instead of just trailers in order to not embarrass myself infront of teachers. and it would be great if i am also able to download it.

For hours i have been searching on how to do it since I am not an android developer or a java guy (I only know frontend and some python) most of the tutorials i have seen play video from the file system on exoplayer but if it is possible to do it in a smarter way which can be integrated with the TMDB then please do tell me.

Any help or even if you can recommend me a tutorial then it will be much appreciated!"
13ia6go,1,2023-05-15,Who made the switch from engineering to sales/key account management? Looking to hear about your experiences,ckregular,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13ia6go/who_made_the_switch_from_engineering_to_saleskey/,"
Background: I (25M) currently work at one of the prime aerospace/defense contractors as a service engineer on the civilian aviation side of their helicopters division. Got my degree in Mechanical Engineering. During college I had two 3 month summer internships with engineering internship roles. I graduated with my degree when I was 21, however I worked my first engineering job full-time for the last semester of my senior year of college and went on to stay with them for an additional year after. I’ve had two other engineering positions before my current one (including the one I started with during my senior year of college) for a total of ~4.5 years of experience. 

In between the job changes (always voluntary, always on good terms, always for money) I would interview for both sales and engineering roles at other firms and get offers for both kinds of position. Despite getting close both times, I never made the jump into sales. 

In my current role, I’m essentially the go-to technical resource/personal engineer for only a few key accounts (people who own our aircraft). Essentially, since aircraft need routine maintenance and servicing performed in order to keep them legally-airworthy, I work with our aircraft owners/operators to keep their helicopters flying - with my time and the recommended servicing solutions/aircraft parts being what we invoice our customers against. This is my division’s primary revenue generator, as helicopters are quite expensive to develop and manufacture (low single digit % profit margin on the sell side)  

Ngl, I’m thinking this is gonna be my last engineering role once I’m ready to be done with it. Since I have no intent or desire to get a PHD or Masters in an engineering subject, I’m kinda hitting my career ceiling with this current role. I also love public speaking and presenting, but don’t get to do it as much as I’d like to. I think my combination of both technical and single-customer experience has prepared me well for key account management in one  of the industries I have experience in (probably aerospace). 

Sorry that was a lot, thanks for reading my Reddit-abbreviated resume lol. My three questions for those who have made the switch from engineering-sales are: 

a. What was the biggest adjustment? 

b. Are you happy you made the switch? 

c. What should I try to learn before interviewing for key account management roles?

Thanks"

I am in the process of transitioning from an intern position at the company I have been at.

I was sent an offer by HR for 85k yearly which was above what I was expecting, but I considered it possible because the position they were offering me was a different title and position than I was aiming for and I let them know that.

I went over the offer with my partner and decided it would be the right decision on Friday and signed the offer same day. Expected to transition into the position today and was confirmed by HR that I would be transitioning.

I received a call from the HR head explaining that the offer was a mistake (keep in mind I have already signed and was in the transitionary process to the new position already). They say they are ""rescinding"" the offer and are prepared to offer me 70k with a 5k signing bonus.

I called the two other companies I was in the pre offer stage with and finished my final interviews with that week, and told them I had accepted a position. I am quite upset. Normally I keep composure, but this is a huge hit for me.

Please let me know if there is anything I could do in this situation, I know I am not taking the 70k, but the best I can think of doing is telling them it's ridiculous and trying to get up to 75.

13icmsu,1,2023-05-15,Big Name Company Internship vs Working At Small Startup Part time for Deferred Admit,jesster2k10,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/13icmsu/big_name_company_internship_vs_working_at_small/,"Not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but, I'm trying to assess whether I'm at an inherent disadvantage as a deferred admit given my profile.

Since 2nd year (in third year, going into final September) I've been working part time at a series-a startup. Background is in engineering (studying EE, working as SWE). I've been able to assume a pretty significant leadership role (playing a huge part as lead engineer in one of the core product areas) in the company (albeit a small company \~20 employees). Likely to receive a full time offer to work in the company in a more significant leadership position also after graduation (2024)

Was reading through this sub, specifically profile reviews of other deferred applications, seems like most have several internships from prestigious companies (MBB, Big 4, IB, Big Tech etc) alongside some other pretty impressive work experience relating to these internships.

I'm looking to apply as a deferred admit for 2024 (matriculating between 2026-2028), so I'm spending this summer to assess everything and work on the aspects of my profile I can improve (which thankfully, is mostly everything) but wanted to see if I was at an inherent disadvantage, assuming all other factors are equal.

In other words, would admission teams prefer someone who interned at a prestigious firm vs someone who played a significant role at a smaller company (startup) assuming their profiles are similar (GPA, test scores etc.) 

I never did any internships with any big companies, never applied cause the opportunity cost was too big for me tbh. I had a pretty cushy job in a startup, with a pretty significant position so didn't seem worth while to ditch that for a 12-week stint at any company, where I wouldn't be able to contribute as heavily.

I assumed this wouldn't be a disadvantage, but I'm not sure how heavy these schools value prestige. Assuming this sub might have more information. 

---

For additional context: Haven't fully identified my post MBA goals yet but leaning towards Venture Capital or assuming senior leadership in a startup.

Also main schools I'd apply to is HBS, GSB, Wharton, Sloan (MIT)

Also an international student, 20M"

Greetings,

As a relatively young intern who has recently embarked on my own professional journey, I have encountered a recurring theme during my sessions that has left me pondering its implications. It is important to note that I come from a cultural background that deeply values respect for elders, and I believe this perspective influences the situation I find myself in.

Over the past two years, while honing my skills as an intern, and now as an independent practitioner at the age of 24, I have noticed a significant number of clients expressing doubts regarding my qualifications or raising questions about my youthful appearance. Despite my efforts to adapt my attire and even inject humor into the situation when these concerns are raised, I feel compelled to address this matter more effectively.

Hence, I turn to you, the experienced and diverse, in search of guidance. Have any of you encountered similar experiences either presently or when you first embarked on your professional journey? How did you navigate and overcome this challenge? I am particularly interested in hearing about your personal stories, strategies, or approaches that have helped you gain credibility and overcome age-related doubts within your respective fields.

Any advice or insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I genuinely aspire to foster a trusting and supportive environment for my clients, irrespective of their initial perceptions. Thank you in advance for your thoughtful contributions!

Warm regards"

Deadlines for projects I’ve never seen due that Friday on my first week and I was expected to meet it. I did end up meeting the deadline but my gosh was it stressful and I work 7-5 everyday and think about work unwillingly after I’m home. 

No don’t get me wrong, I like the people I work with and the type of work and everything but this is way too much and I am so stressed. I talked to the owner, also my supervisor, and he said we need all hands on deck for this stuff. He works from 7-7 everyday. I hate going home after work, making food, and then trying not to think about work, go to bed, and get up and go to work again. I don’t want my life to look like this after college but I’m afraid it will😭

So I guess my questions are is this what life looks like after college for engineers? If it’s exactly like this should I stick with engineering or do something else? What are someways to help you not think about work at home?"

So I have been accepted to 2 Master at 2 différente universities.

One is a Master in Metrology [main moduales : automatic Linear system, mathematics for metrology,  Thermal transfer theories, Spectroscopy,  industrial hygiene and environmental risks,Strength of materials,Nondestructive testing (NDT) , coordinate measuring machine (CMM, sensors and imaging, production management, production management...etc]

The other, an Industrial Risks and maintenance management [main moduales :. 
Quality management,Metrology and measurementsystems, Production management, industrial regulations, maintenance management tools and
methods, project management, Instruments and Measurement Chains, quality management, hygiene and security, Data analysis...& Others ) + an obligatory internship from the first year + a personal project (also the first year) 


So I feel like the first one is going to be easier for me to manage and will allow me to have free time, work no personal projects , no pressure but it's career opportunities after graduation will be limited. 

On the other hand the other Master seems to offer more career opportunities but feels heavy and too time demanding, knowing myself i'm afraid I'll crack under the pressure and end up having a burn out and fail.  

So as Students and graduated engineers 
What would your advice be ? (taking the jobs market evolution and demands into consideration) . 

Thank you for reading."

**Additional Information:**

Last year after hs, I went to community college and followed the ttt25 subreddit and their advice, and it really helped me navigate this process. I recommend doing this if you go to a cc, as I feel the reason for transferring will be a lot easier to explain. I didn't get in Umich in hs or again for the transfer cycle, and when I got rejected from them as a transfer I thought I had no shot at the other schools especially being instate, where the acceptance rate is a lot higher at 60% for instate cc transfers, but it worked out for me at the end. Ultimately it shows how fluky the process is. Also want to mention I feel like I could have gotten in NU or maybe even Cornell if I applied as a different major, not cs, but Vandy is an excellent outcome that shockingly costs less than any of my state schools, even Umich."

13ijaim,28,2023-05-15,[Mi] Unwilling to work with a coworker due to various reasons. Still scheduled with him.,dingus_berry_jones,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/13ijaim/mi_unwilling_to_work_with_a_coworker_due_to/,"TW: Mentions sexual assault/harassment/abuse, pornography, and drugs used to treat mental health related issues. 

(F22) have been working at a bakery for a bit over a year. We have around 8ish employees and are all pretty close to our boss due to it being a small business and him being so hands on. I became friends with a few of of my coworkers overtime and started hanging out with then outside of work. 

One of my coworkers (M early 30s) and I started hanging out a bit outside of work mainly in group settings. for about 9 months he seemed like a good person and I enjoyed being around him, until about 4-5 months ago. We started getting scheduled together every week . Before hand we rarely worked together. For background I have a small business online and due to us being fairly slow most days I work on stuff related to that at work so I don’t have to do that work at home. I make more money from my small business than I do at the bakery so it’s a big priority. My boss is aware of this and is totally fine with it. 

The first few times we worked things were good. We got to catch up and we spent a lot of our shifts just watching youtube together. I came in one day and told him that I had lots of stuff to work on for my store and needed quiet time. He continued to talk to me non-stop and kept getting up to show me videos. I gave him reminder after reminder that I had stuff to do and he wasn’t being respectful of that at all or would make passive aggressive “jokes” about me wanting him to shut up. 

This annoyed me to no end but where I reached my breaking point is when he started talking about things that uncomfortable talking about. The first time I could recall he asked me what dead famous person I would have sex with. I told him I wasn’t going to answer that since i’m in a relationship and I felt like that’s not an okay question to ask someone in a relationship let alone a coworker and he kept pushing. He started making weird comments about women’s bodies, talking about the porn he watches, past sexual experiences, etc. Every time he’d bring up something that make me uncomfortable i’d try to either tell him i’m uncomfortable or make it clear I was uncomfortable (He knows I have a hard time with confrontation, i’ve told him this before) 

About 3 weeks ago I was at work, when he came in I told him I was having an awful day and didn’t want to talk during our shift (Which was true I had a funeral earlier in the week he was aware of) He kept talking to me so I just flat out ignored. He started complaining about how no one liked him, how he needs to lose weight, how his ADHD meds cause a lot of issues (he blames his adderall on his lack of self awareness and him being hyper sexual). I still ignored him and he kept making passive aggressive comments and I told him I was not really in the mood to talk

Don’t remember exactly how this got brought up but he started telling me how his meds made him hyper sexual and how had a porn addiction and how he wanted to stop since he knows a lot of the porn he consumes is harmful to women. I told him he’s probably right. He then started telling me how he watched “violent porn” and how he imagines that they have talks about consent before hand. I found it disturbing he would not tell me that but weird if he was so concerned with consent why he just wouldn’t watch something “normal”. He is well aware i’m a victim of SA abuse because I confided in him about this when we were closer friends. I have no clue why he would tell me that information but it made me DEEPLY uncomfortable. 

It was getting to the point where I was going home everyday from my shifts crying and having panic attacks because he talked at me non-stop our whole shift which drained me, didn’t respect my boundaries, and brought up topics I told him we’re triggering to me. 

I had enough and went to my boss (who is also the owner we have no manager) I was vague about things at first because it made me uncomfortable talking about thing. Nothing happened so one day I sat and texted him everything and opened up about the fact i’m a victim of SA and him constantly talking about sexual stuff after I told him I made it clear I was uncomfortable was pushing me to my breaking point. I told him I was considering leaving and he told me he’d do something about it and apologized for not taking things seriously. 

It been over two weeks now, my boss hasn’t talked to him nor has he changed my schedule. Thankfully I haven’t worked with him because my friend/coworker who knew the situation was in between school and her internship so we were able to swap shifts for a bit. This Friday he’s expecting me to work with him. I don’t feel comfortable. Not sure what I should do at this point. Any advice would be appreciated. I don’t want to have to quit but I don’t know what else to do and could use an outside perspective"

Completed bachelors in 2016, at the time, I was interested in Entrepreneurship and wanted to start a business venture. Tried for 5 months, won competitions, pitched to investors, participated in workshops but couldn't raise funds. Then I got an employment offer from my University as I did an internship during my studies. It was an administrative job that slowly evolved into reporting but it didn't work either and I was let go in Dec of 2017. 2018 started and I resumed my entrepreneurship project, took me 8 months but I managed to launch the business and scale it on a good level. But then Covid came and I had to stop everything.

In 2021, I launched a digital agency with some friends but the partners weren't good so halfway through 2021 I had to leave. For the meantime, I resumed by business because the lockdown was lifted and I scored a gig for content production. By then end of 2021, I was managing my photo booth company, content production projects and freelance consulting which brought me back to startups. So I end up working as a generalist for a startup from Jan 2022. We were about to raise but due to a disagreement between the founders, the opportunity blew and I had to leave the company in Sept. Took me a couple of months but ended up in a Software house.

It has been 5 months now and I haven't been able to find my footing. I am interested to work as a remote closer and exploring opportunities, as I see it as a potential fit for me. But it's conflicting with my job at the moment. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to produce any results. Due to a number of reasons that are genuinely beyond my control. I am trying my best, I do see good growth opportunities but I am not sure it aligns with my values. I feel like there is too much to compromise including my integrity. Yes I am thankful to my employer for helping me out and finding me a place in their organization but it eats me that I haven't been able to show anything for it and that the culture and the practices are in conflict with my values.

I am 30, and professionally as a generalist and founder, I have gone through much. I don't mind working 9-5, under a boss. I am just not sure and uncertain about where am I gonna end up!

TBH I have lost motivation and hope, economic conditions are getting worse, so getting a paycheck is still considered lucky. I do have a job offer from another company but I haven't explored the opportunity yet, just don't want to stuck from one place to another. I feel like it's tiring, I am low on energy and most importantly, I am uncertain as to where do I fit in!"

I’m thinking about working in the sell-side of the quant finance industry like risk management. However like I said I’m a senior in highschool so I’m not sure and I know I’ll be exposed to a lot in the next few years. 

What math and stats concepts/classes should I be aware of focusing on most in the finance industry? - from what I’ve learned stochastic calculus and is arguably the most important math class I’ll need to learn but what else? Is there a specific curriculum at a college y’all know of so I could look at to help me fit my studies? 

What programming languages should I focus on most? - I’m self taught in python but I’ve learned C++, R, SaS, and SQL are extremely important as well. I’m interested in quantitative development, I’m just unsure that I’d like to do it as a career 20 years down the line…. So I’d like to know what are going to be most useful for roles outside of it. 

Is going to a T10 undergrad really that important? I’m going to George Mason University which is right outside of DC. It’s no ivy but I got a great scholarship and they have a fantastic systems engineering program and professors. They also had a financial engineering concentration which I was looking for. I couldn’t afford more prestigious schools and felt like a T10 masters degree would be more important. 

I built a four year plan that I’m willing to stray away from but I’d like to get some feedback on it. 

- Study systems engineering with a concentration in financial engineering 
- Minor in finance 
- Study Python, R, C++ and SaS
-Build multiple finance and systems engineering projects in atleast 3 of those languages before I graduate to showcase skills for a job
- get relevant certificates 
-Get an internship in DC or elsewhere for a firm

Thank you so much for y’alls time!

Looking for a back-end, front-end, or full-stack role with a .NET, Java, or Python tech-stack, but really open to almost anything at this point

I had an internship that claimed to offer a full time role, but never happened due to a bunch of people that I was involved with during the hiring process/HR process leaving.

Had another job fall through after a hiring freeze at the company, where they claimed I would've had the role.

Most recently, went a few rounds interviewing with a company and said they went with a different candidate but said that they would keep me in mind because they think I'd be a good fit.

&#x200B;

All that being said, is there something on my resume that's making me not a top candidate? How can I boost it in such a way where I'm not second to the person being hired like in my most recent experience?"

The team and hiring manager had good things to say about me and I was given an offer for 80k.  I don't have a lot of experience in SQL specifically and even though the role is somewhat heavy SQL they seemed ok with this.  My resume includes experience from internships so when I formally applied in order to get in their system to get the offer this experience was included.  

Then when the background check came I was told to exclude it since it wasn't paid experience and the companies I worked for aren't in business anymore.  So I just included paid experience which is 2 years.  HR then raised the issue that I didn't have 4 years of experience which is required by the role according to company policy.  

The HR person said they would try to get an exception approved but today I got a call saying they had to rescind the offer since I didn't have the required 4 years of experience for the role.  The HR person on the phone said that I couldn't be brought on to the role because it would create ""employee inequity"" which is a policy they implement as advised by their legal department.   The silver lining is that they might be able to put me in for a more junior role but the pay would be less.

I'm in a bit of a pickle and could really use some advice. I'm about to wrap up my Statistics degree which, due to some hiccups along the way, has taken a bit longer than planned and my GPA really isn't good.

Despite this, I've been able land three internships, two of which were as a junior data science roles at some pretty decent companies.

However, I recently hit a snag: I wasn't able to secure a co-op for this term. My GPA could be a culprit, but I also think the current job market might have something to do with it.

This has me really wondering about my next steps. My previous manager was pretty adamant about the importance of a master's degree for a career in data science. He also suggested considering data analyst roles as a Plan B.

From lurking around this subreddit, I've gotten the impression that data analyst roles are a lot about summarizing data and writing reports. But honestly, as a Stat major with a CS minor, I really love the complexity and problem-solving aspect of data science roles (also the money).

So, here are my questions: With my current experience and situation, do you think it's still possible to get into data science without a master's? Would it even be worth considering a master's from a less prestigious program? And am I completely off-base about what data analyst roles entail?

So here's all the details about me:

- CS major, math minor (BAD BAD decision for my GPA)
- Rising Junior 
- SOL with internships in sophomore year. Not a single OA even.
- I go to a subpar T500 school, HOWEVER everyone and their dog has an internship here because companies recruit heavier than my balls here since the overwhelming majority of the student body being minorities.. we also host one of the largest hackathons in the country 
- Heck I'm even on the executive board of a student org that connects students with companies and upskills them in CS etc.. yet the irony is almost none of our own partnered sponsors want internationals or even asians sometimes lol
- Didn't know most freshman/sophomore programs were targeting minorities so I applied to all of them exclusively in 2022, only to get ghosted by every single one of them whilst I saw everyone around me get into FAANG++ without even technicals somehow.. realised I was SOL to begin with around Feb and started applying to other companies and whatever I could find and at that point got mass rejected cuz my resume, projects, and skills are shit

Soooo.. I'm back in my country for the summer and I got 90 days until I fly back. I want to utilise every miserable second of summer to prepare so please help me.

Technical skills I do have:

- Python, Java, some SQL from taking a class (Postgres), some bare bones Kotlin from a Codepath course I barely finished 
- Neural Networks: I'm interested in AI and have a half-decent understanding of NN models, how to design them, train them, evaluate them, etc.. but I have zero application/creativity skills so they just stay in Jupyter Notebooks
- Git(?)
- about 7 LC easies so far 

Anyway, here are the things I ask of you:

- How do I upskill myself as a SWE to have the minimum skills to build impressive projects?
- Project ideas/tutorial links that'll help my resume pass through the filters at least
- Where to start with for Leetcode? I'm doing the easies so far and I can solve them with basic DS knowledge, but can't get all the test cases as idk how to optimise them. How do I start learning that?

And most importantly:

- How tf do I become cracked enough that recruiters can overlook the fact that I'm a South Asian international student like the 69344267518942819 other students just like me?

We have 3 full time engineers in total who you'll be working with, including myself, you'll be mentored by us for ~3 months. You'll be working on the same stuff we are; we won't have any special internship projects. So this will be as close to the real deal as possible.

Our goal is simple: to make it possible to use your phone number to pay anywhere and everywhere, with zero friction. We have a ton of cool ways to make that work, and a bunch of merchants and brands already using our platform. We want to add more features, start leveraging AI, and scale up everything we've built so far.

Apply at: [https://forms.gle/GBHJ3bnVdBxYYB4z6](https://forms.gle/GBHJ3bnVdBxYYB4z6)

Our stack:
- Front-end: JS/TS/React
- API: Node/TS/Postgres/Redis
- Services: Shopify/Twilio/PayPal/Stripe/Authorize.net

What we do: payments, vaulting, automated conversations, and merchant-facing dashboards. Plus a whole load of interesting things in-between.

Most important skill: be able to communicate well, and learn quickly. Doesn't matter if you haven't used every technology listed above, so long as you're a fast learner and happy to jump quickly into new things.

Experience level: anything is fine, ideally you can code and have at least tried TypeScript, Node, React -- but not mandatory for the right candidates.

Expectations: it's a startup, and we just finished YCombinator. So it will be busy, there's no avoiding that. But we want to create a great engineering culture that fosters innovation, learning, and mentorship. We want to teach, and we want to learn from you too.

Location: we're in CA (bay area), open to remote anywhere in US, *may* be able to make non-US work with some kind of contracting role but priority given to US-based folk.

Comp: let us know what you're looking for!

I'll be majoring in CS, but unfortunately I haven't been programming for very long and I'd like to have some guidance on what I should do to maximize my chances of landing any kind of internship for summer 2024.

I spent a lot of time in high school learning competition math, so I only started learning to code in late december of 2022. So far, I've:

* Completed an intro Java course on Udemy
* Went through most of head first java
* Completed most of Java Programming I & II on Mooc.fi
* Completed an intro java class at ohio state

Right now, I'm getting into DSA by taking a coursera class, and I'm working through The Odin Project to learn some frontend. My long-term goal is to make a personal project(s) so that I can land an interview, and my thought process is that I'll need to know a little frontend to make said projects. 

I'll be a lot busier once the school year starts, so I'm trying really hard to make good use of my time this summer to set myself up my (hopefully) success next summer.

Am I making use of my time wisely? What would you all recommend I do/change? What steps should I take to land an internship next summer (specificity appreciated)?"

**Current Location:** Punjab

I request you to please read the whole thing. It will help me with the specific advice really well. I realize it is long, but I am really desperate and depressed. Please help me. I really need to decide by 2 days.



**Background:**

In short, I took drop for JEE now but I'm learning German A1 at the same time, thinking of getting a good college. But I have no expectations on JEE now.
JEE was my only target, mainly. Only other thing I am getting at this moment is Manipal Bangalore IT (gave the exam when I was ill and sleep deprived). Fees is about 29 lakhs for course and hostel, for 4 Years. We have freezed the seat here for the time being. But need to confirm it by 25th. Will have to take loan to afford this. With compound interest, I will have to pay back 36 lackhs to bank for this loan.  I also have a option for a tier 4 college in my state, with fees of around 9 lakh.

Because of my limited options, started researching which foreign unis have fees lower than my above option  about I have high probability of getting accepted. Found a few Italian, Polish and German universities. Felt like Germany is the best option among them due to high number of start ups in IT sector there. I have calculated it will take around 24-27 lakh for 3 years.



**Few things I need to make clear as it will probably be relevant to remember/refer to as you read this post**:

1. I have never went outside my state alone or even outside my district for that matter.
2. I know some cooking. Can improve lot easily by practicing at home for a few weeks.
3. I am burnt out after all this stress and self-loathing as a result of my failure in JEE despite hard work of the drop year.
4. **Mother feels I should stay in India. Father doesn't care. Few friends and relatives who are engineers(ECE and EEE mostly) supporting the decision of going abroad if I can handle it.**
5. **If I decide to go to Germany after reading peoples advice and contemplative thinking on my own end, I will go to Germany after learning A1 level German at least. Most jobs and internships require C1 German proficiency. According to language learning websites, it takes 900-1000 hours of practice to learn German to C1 level from scratch.**
6. I need to improve some of my study habits. I know which areas I need to work on.

**The Dilemma:**

Germany is renowned for it's engineering. I feel education system/style will be better than one in tier 3 college in India. When I'll be spending 20lk or something in a private college here, I can pursue the same education from abroad. It will be less rote memory based and more application based. I think no one will deny that most tier 3 colleges are rote based. But the thing is, even though German intellectual culture fascinates me, I don't want to live there for a very long time. I want to settle with my future spouse in a English speaking country, with good education system, and strong global outlook, so that my future child(ren) can become a well rounded individual who can pursue any field he/she has interest in rather than being bound to choose a profession because of rigid circumstances. Also, I don't think I will ever be able to integrate fully into the German culture and will always be a outsider, because of it's reserved nature, from my research. Not to mention, European salaries are not that great on the global scale, compared to cost of living. Also, food is bland there.

**I want you folks to pitch in with your life experience here. If you have some direct experience working or studying in Germany or have gone through a similar dilemma, it will be especially great. But anybody can pitch in. Please, I request, just mention whether you are speaking from direct experience or not. I am willing to consider what everyone has to say.**



I have **4 options** here then, given my end goal:

1. **Do undergrad in India from Manipal Bangalore IT branch, try to self-learn demanded skills in time outside classes and assignments, get a job by making full use of on campus and off campus opportunities and networking and pay off the loan in next 4-5 years. Will change companies every 6-12 months. Use these 4-5 years to gain experience in startups. If I try hard, I can bag 6-8 lpa job right after college atleast if not crack FAANG/MAANG. Then, go for MS in english speaking countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore(multicultural, can survive on english mostly, there are many schools have english-speaking culture), USA. Then look for a job there.**

2. **Same plan as above but join CSE branch in any tier 4 college and pay off loan in 2 years. Only, networking in this option will not lead me much. Opportunities for placement will be non-existent other than service based companies, which don't help one learn a lot nor earn a lot. So apply for MS abroad immediately after repaying.**

3. **Do BSc in Germany. Learn German well, starting now, till the end of 1st year. Practice talking to people in German . Network as much as I can. Apply for as many internships as possible. There is no placement in Germany; all graduates apply for off campus directly. 2-3 Internships increase chances massively, along with good skills, both technical and communication. Practical education style in Germany can help my skills a lot, although as usual, for an aspiring programmer, internet is the main source of knowledge. Do enough work to pay off loan in 3-4 years, while learning on the job, and then apply for MS in English speaking countries as mentioned above.**

4. **Drop for JEE. I can't take the pressure individually, give some improvement exams to get some good percentage and become more financially stable and start preparing for language and all stuff for Germany next year**


**At the end, it comes down to language-learning struggles vs getting-the-job/interview struggle. I have been told CS is easier to master than other circuital engineering field. Both paths are ultimately high risk-high reward(only after high effort and struggle).**

**I will be grateful for any advise. Thank you so much for reading and advice.**"

This is going to be a pretty lengthy post about my background (TL;DR at the end) but here it goes:

So I've recently completed my undergrad with a Bachelor's in Biological Science at 25, in a focus that's intended for some kind of med school, pharm school, etc. I also received an Associate's in Science, and double minored in Neuroscience and Sociology. I'm feeling greatly burnt out and sort of at loss for what direction to take next.

I took a while to complete undergrad because of a ton of things life threw at me, and was fortunate enough to have scholarships, my allowance savings, and my parents to pay for my education. I graduated high school in 2016 with an advanced honors diploma and was actually pretty involved in my time there (honor clubs, language/cultural clubs, all that stuff). In my first roughly 2 years of college, I took my time completing general requirements not really knowing what to do and certainly not having much motivation to figure it out (I'm first gen with extremely strict parents, so I lacked guidance and was mostly pushed towards studying and aiming for the main careers that foreign parents like, such as medicine and law). Midway through my 2nd year of college, I found out that I had an interest in biology and decided to pursue this, so I finished the random pre-reqs I was doing and looked into the sciences.

But then at the end of my second year of college (2018), my sister took her own life and it not only put my family through extremely awful times, but aged the household. I continued being a full time student through fall of 2018 but it was unbelievably hard finding the drive to get myself through school as I've always had poor coping mechanisms - nothing drug related but more like I was having trouble coming to terms with it so I functioned on autopilot. Hardly ate, hardly slept, hardly understood what I was even doing any more.

Finally, in spring of 2019 I found the medical route again and chose pharmacy. My sister OD'ed and the paramedics were lowkey not... not very helpful in the situation, and I wanted to learn, understand, and educate myself about medicine and drugs and arm myself with the knowledge to pass on. I remember standing there, helplessly watching and not at all comprehending what was happening and I so very much wished I had the skill to do something. So with this drive, I started my general bio courses, and of course, we're hit with the pandemic half a year later. In 2020 I was mostly online and in the middle of 2021, transferred from community college, to university. By the time we entered mostly in person, it was already early 2022 and I was set to graduate that spring. Unfortunately, I get slammed with ochem, had to retake some courses (that thankfully replaced some grades and otherwise just cost me time and money, and tons of summer study-grinding). Spring 2023, I'm a graduate.

But in all this time, I was unable to find experience outside of school. I couldn't land a student research position because only my university had those opportunities with limited seats, and I was in person there for only a year technically, but even then, my campus was a 45 minute drive away so I opted for online as much as possible/restricted time on campus to be home for family. I couldn't work or get internships because I live with my grandparents, who I often took to doctor's appointments or cared for at home while my parents work, and also had to care for my mom's growing mobility issues, and at the same time I studied so much and so often that I barely had time to eat and sleep some days. I was involved in one or two clubs in each college but even those eventually had to take a back seat to all these other things-

And now that I've graduated, I'm sort of in a weird limbo. I want to take a break - like a month or two, even three like a summer vacation - because I've been in school, studying my ass off for 19 years at this point, including summer courses. At the same time, I don't even know if that's ""okay."" I don't have any professional experience or guidance so I don't really know how to put my foot in the door - I figured I'd start in academia and in hospitals and see if anyone is willing to take and train me if I need certification. Of course, I also have pharmacy school, but I don't want to start right away and instead see if I've got other options, and sometimes I'm not even sure of *that* since everyone's saying it's a difficult field to find a career in.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is: can I afford to have a break? How should I get my foot in the door? I know I've shot some chances what with not working or interning, but it's already said and done, and I'm driven to bridge that gap if I can find a job because I'm immensely passionate in the sciences and educating/helping people. I just don't quite know how to get there. I'm not even sure what to put on a resume and hope that clubs, accomplishments (competitions I've won) and volunteering (gigs for events for clubs, not with actual companies) along with some certifications I got from courses (there was an IS class I took that gave me certification in working with Microsoft Office for example) can help, and maybe any of my skills or hobbies or abilities (typing speed, decent communication, lab familiarity but mostly from courses I've taken - things like that).

I'm just a bit terrified and want to spend my short break (if I'm allowed this) relaxing and knowing my years of struggling both in my personal and my academic life weren't for nothing. I loved school and loved learning and I know I'll easily get bored, but I also want a breather and want to get over the anxiety of feeling too late/out of luck. Any advice or even some people out there who were/are in my shoes who can provide some solidarity would be deeply, deeply appreciated.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I spent 7 years as a full-time college student (+summer courses), not working or interning because I took care of family and forged through an awful loss. I've recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Biological Science (minors in Neuroscience and Sociology) with little to no professional experience and don't know what to do, but I want to take a short 1-3 month break. Can I have this break/would it be weird to have a 1-3 month gap before searching for a job? How should I go about looking for work? Should I be hunting both online and in person for jobs? What should I do if I lack some of the preferred/required skills/certifications that a job is looking for (as in, can I present myself as someone willing to work if they provide training for my certification)?

For any advice that comes my way, thank you so, so much."

I'm already a fifth year student and I decided to apply for architectural apprenticeship or internship, junior architect, architectural assistant. Some of them offer generous salary for someone starting but because I don't have any work experiences before I'm too anxious to go to interviews or to even answer phone calls. It's as if I'm afraid that I will be left alone to do jobs I don't have idea of without any guidance. I am really in need of money, of course, I'm adulting and my brother has been pressuring me to find a job so I could help him pay for my laptop + and my mom asking for a money cake this year for her 60th birthday. I turned down a lot of interviews already as I don't think I can accept a full time job right now because I feel like I don't have anything solid to offer for those companies in need yet. Some architectural internship do offer allowances but they are too small (not even enough to cover fare fees). Nevertheless, I think that that would the best for me right now — to learn and gain experience even for at least 200 hours.

I would appreciate any advice you have for me as I'm really stuck of what to do right now. I'm so afraid to take big steps that I'd rather take smaller steps to move forward. It's so hard when you want to take as much time as you want but you have responsibilities."

I'm a survivor of violence, a mom, a wife, and disabled. My degree took me five years, a lot of tears, a lot of frustration, and a lot of sacrifice from me (and my family). Here are some things I learned:

Figure out how to study for you. VARK is an amazing tool, using a combination helps more. Find people willing to help you study. This includes people willing to tell you that they know how much it sucks to not be able to do the things you want, but that studying is important. You are worth this.

Go to office hours. Your professors, regardless of your grades, will know you if you show up to their office hours. Most of them actually sit alone during office hours and would love the company. Your professors are your best path to internships, jobs, etc.

Always eat and get a good night sleep before a test.

Don't hesitate to make friends with people who se3m different than you. 

If you need accomodations, ask for them. Get tested for things like ADHD. You do not need to struggle in silence, or alone.

Take advantage of the learning commons type areas - the math lab, science lab, writing lab, etc. Its usually a free service and it's worth it to get the extra help.

Know that every time you step into a classroom you are one more day closer to your goal.

If no one has told you lately, I am proud of you. Going to college is hard. Learning about yourself is hard. Find people who accept you for you. You are valid. You are worthy. And you are amazing just for going out and trying.

My situation is as follows:

Currently a comp sci major and am not the most competitive applicant for the majority of graduate programs. I completed an internship prior to starting my 3rd year which puts me slightly ahead of those with 0 exp. If I extend my grad by a year with an honours year I will have the ability to potentially do an internship at a 'larger/more recognised' company over the summer and would put me in a far better standing to get into a strong graduate program and larger foot into the industry.

Is it worth going this path? Another aspect is that I will shave a year off my masters that I will eventually do.

I have the ability to go back to the company I interned with but it's fairly small in terms of opportunities to grow early career.

Ultimately my question is: Graduate and go into a role at a small(ish) company and take the year of exp then try to hop into a better company OR extend grad by a year, do an internship, and \*potentially\* get into a better grad program.

What kind of colleges should I apply?",Impressive_Drama7338,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/13iz4lz/daisdds_studying_abroad_how_do_i_make_my_gap_year/,"I'll be finishing my A level pretty soon now. Since I didn't apply last year, I will probably apply in the upcoming August.

My grades are really good. Physics/Chem/Computer/Econ A\* in all internal exams. EGP: a, I'm hoping I'll get atleast 3A\* in this A level.

I am a computer programmer. Have a few internships in hand but they are mostly remote. So, I have a lot of free time to myself. 

My school also offers volunteering inside school as a teacher. I got the offer to teach, idk if I should take it. 

All my employers say I have very good way of doing things while coding which makes me sometimes think that I might have a chance outside of school. 

&#x200B;

I want to get in a good college with good financial aid. My financial status is relatively weak especially after covid. My dad lost his job, mother got sick. Sold a land already. Living on rent in valley. I doubt my parents can pay for my college fee more than 80-90k per month for first few months. This entire year my parents had a income of less than 5 lakhs, the loan money is only being consumed.

 But I don't blame them. I think it is my responsibility now as I've reached 18. So, from the internships I have, I am planning to pay for my SATs and CSS fees. Also, some colleges require money to apply so, I might have to use it as well.  

Given my financial status, what kind of colleges are fit for me. US certainly is my priority but not my only option. I am ready to go to US, European countries, Singapore, Japan etc.. but not China, India or Australia.

The main thing is I am ready to sacrifice or fully utilize next 5-6 months completely for college. I don't want to spend a single second useless. 

But where do I invest my time? I have my personal projects already, but as they are coding related they don't occupy much of a time. So, I have a lot of free time to myself. 

&#x200B;

Please suggest some good things to do. Also, do Nepalese tech companies offer the youths some internships? Help a brother out here. Also, if any dais and didis have been in a similar situation in the past, lmk how you dealt with it. It is difficult to be born in a middle class family when times like this come. Some of my friends are rich enough to pay $20k-$30k EFC guaranteeing them some colleges."

I had okayish high school grades (still pretty competitive for my home country) due to a lot of reasons, but I like to believe I have good Ecs tho. By the time of applying as a freshman, I had a lot of leadership experiences; startups, coding projects (personal and freelance clients), organizing national events, internships, etc but I don't colleges seem to care any of that, apart from grades. 

My thing is I am hoping to transfer; primarily because my current college is expensive, and doesn't have a really good CS program. I think I'd be able to flourish more in a better tech community where I'd be able to be involved and learn more. How hard it is for international students and do colleges provide scholarships/financial aid while transferring? 

I believe I'd be able to score well, making up for my high school scores(3.6). Also, I am already working with remote tech companies as a web3 developer, and I'll only commit myself more to getting an internship at a FAANG company, doing more open source contributions, more real-world projects, more hackathons, and just more everything. Do you think colleges care about this, and what colleges particularly like good CS transfers, and If I will have any chance at all? Please help me we this, the college application has already given me enough stress."

Sunt student la informatica si pot spune ca ma aflu intr-o oarecare punct in care nu stiu care ar trebui sa fie field-ul, sau ramura, inspre care sa ma indrept.


În ultimul an pot spune că am fost un all-rounder, si m-am implicat în tot felul de proiecte si tehnologii, atat in contextul universitatii cat si in timpul liber, mainly din curiositate si faptul ca totul mi se parea avsolut fascinant. De la backend stuff in Java si in Go, la C++, Python, Data Eng stuff și puțintel ML, dar ultimele doua ceva mai amateurish.


Totusi, simt ca nu ajung atat de departe pe cat mi-as dori in felul asta, ca intelegerea mea e destul de superficiala in lucrurile cu care lucrez in felul asta, si ca ar fi o idee buna sa ma focusez mai mult pe ce vreau sa fac inainte.


Problema e ca nu prea stiu ce e acel lucru..dar pot identifica oarecum cu ce imi place sa imi bat capul, si e mainly incercarea de a intelege sistemele sau arhitecturile cu care lucrez cat mai bine, in detaliu, incat sa pot construi si itera peste ele in cel mai bun mod posibil. Si prin faptul ca tocmai am descris sofware development de orice tip..nu stiu pe ce ar trebui sa ma axez.


Pentru a oferi si mai mult context, începe tot mai mult sa ma atraga partea de ML, dar in special engineering, si chiar ma uitam spre MLOps ca ceva mix intre tot ce ma pasioneaza, dar problema ar fi ca nu gasesc pozitii de internship open pe ceva asemanator, totul fiind fie pe web, fie pe embedded, motiv pt care incerc sa gasesc si alternative pe ariile respective.


Pe partea de web, astept interviurile pentru niste pozitii de internship pe vara destul de interesante, mainly pe java, iar pe partea de embedded stuff, urmeaza sa particip, probabil, la o serie de ateliere hands on pe robotica, dar nu pot zice ca m-ar pasiona sa fac embedded de acum incolo toata viata



Ce-i drept, stiu ca intrebarea mea nu are un raspuns bine definit, si nu astept unul. Totusi, cred ca m-ar ajuta mult sa aud parerile oamenilor din diverse nișe, ramuri, de pe urma carora sa imi pot forma o perspectiva cat mai completa cand vine vorba a ma pot orienta mai departe.


De asemenea, imi cer scuze daca intrebarea mea e all over the place, dar cam asa ma simt si eu :)"

Little about me,  I have a B.S. in Computer information Systems,  been with my current company for 16 years for a Global manufacturing plant.  Started as a intern out of college, going from Helpdesk to Virtualization System Admin, to my current title of SAP Developer where I code custom reports and programs for our SAP ERP system.  Over those 16 years I've basically have always warn many hats and have picked up the projects as they rolled in.  Including everything from Black Berry Servers to implementing VMWare into the environment or even going from analog digital phone system to IP based phone systems.  

Short list of tasks skills include.  Virtualization of servers,  Managing/configuring multiple ERP and CRM services including SAP, SugarCRM and Salesforce, Developing Applications for SAP ERP, C#, and [ASP.net](https://ASP.net),  Digital Signage, Phone Systems, Networking, Active Directory/Exchange/GPO/Etc, Converting Finance/HR to paperless systems, Azure/MDM/Intune systems, Black Berry(not that it's relevant now),  HTML/CSS/PHP/MYSQL/Shell Scripting,  Label design with various programs using ERP data.  

Now I've been with the company a long time, we've been through rapid growth, sold off, bought, then grown multiple times since then to about 4 times the locations we support with no sign that it will slow down.  Now over the 16 years, I've gotten small raises and salary changes based on my latest job title but I've always felt that i've been underpaid.  I've worked weekends, late nights, and even a 30 hour shift once to do maintenance/construction on our server room or swap out switches in our main facility.  I've traveled to remote facilities to do upgrades and pretty much picked up 99% of new tech/projects because of the small IT dept and that my other team members are from the older generation and are just set on their ways. While getting moved to the SAP Development role my latest pay was mid 80's.  Although it was a nice bump, I still pushed for more and got denied.  Because I always question my skills , I just accepted as it was.

That being said, my direct boss has been with the company as long as I have,  we started around the same time, are around the same age and have the same frustrations with the company.  Company is too large and doesn't hire enough or the right people handle items.  The hierarchy is all over the place, too many people who do very little in some depts and not enough people in depts that need help.  No project managers of any sorts and with the growth of the company it just leaves messes at every new plant we open.

So that being said, I'm a tech guy, always have been.  Love tech, love learning about new tech.  I have a vast of other abilities of skills outside of what I do at work.  I've dabbled in Webhosting, Dedicated server hosting, game servers, etc.  I've been told I should be looking for a new job but I'm always nervous about starting new after being somewhere for 16 years.  I'm not very confident that I'm any better than the next guy.  To add to the mess, I have a child due within the month, so I am most likely going to take some time off for that.  So I don't know if any company would even look at someone with the potential of them being out for a few weeks.

What should I do?  Should I look at other opportunities that pay better with my experience?  Am I overthinking it and stay with my current employer?"
13jb9rc,1,2023-05-16,Choosing Between Multiple Programs (Masters+Certificate to Become School Principal),Anatiny,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/13jb9rc/choosing_between_multiple_programs/,"I'm going back to school to pursue a role in school administration (eventually hoping towards Principal with this degree, and then back to a doctorate to pursue a role as superintendent or in policy/legislation). I had the pleasure of being accepted into multiple schools, all of which are more of an applications-based/non-research model. All of these schools work such that I will be graduating in \~2 years through intense summer courses, while spending fall and spring on a lighter schedule and continuing work as a teacher. I know obviously, a decision like this is more personal to each person's individual journey, but I also appreciate the value of input from others. What would you recommend to a friend of yours in a similar situation? Thanks a bunch!

&#x200B;

**Local Liberal Arts College** \- This one is cheapest (\~$20k) and can eventually be rolled into a doctorate to complete both a Master's and a Doctorate in 5 years (the doctorate would still be focused on a Principal role). There are many graduates of this program, but I also don't get the feeling that there's a lot of name recognition or networking that happens as a part of the program. I'm under the impression that while the education will suffice - my resume will need to stand out on its own. (For reference, it is in the top ""200"" rank of education schools in the country, not that the ranking actively matters, just to give an idea). I also know that there are many that attended here and similar schools that have not found a role in administration. Of note is that I was actively recommended against this school by one of my mentors who went there, saying that the school is a little too cutthroat for ""someone as nice as me"" and that I would benefit from a more collaborative education (that same mentor did say that the other two programs here would be good fits for me). This and many similar schools was what I was recommended towards by many, citing that they are the cheapest options and as long as it gets me certified it doesn't truly matter where I go for school.

&#x200B;

**State University** \- This one is the top recommended school in the state for aspiring school admin. (For reference, it is in the top 30 ""rank"" of education schools in the country, not that the ranking actively matters, just to give an idea). It has a great in-state network, and will probably be best for supporting a quicker entry into administration. It's a middling price (\~$40k). This one seems to be very strong in teaching practice as they try to diversify what experiences you have by putting you in different school conditions and having you intern at a school different from the one you work in. Notably: this state university seems to have lower recruitment this year, so I would be collaborating with only about 4-5 other students. Those who have been in the program talk about how it's a lot of work, but that it is pretty doable. Students here tend to move into administration roles quickly: within a few years of completing the program. This one seems to be primarily taught by practicing administrators around the state so it's very focused on making you a good principal first and foremost.

&#x200B;

**National ""Top 10"" University** \- This one is a top ""ranked"" school in education, and is very well known in my field with a long history of amazing alumni. Having the chance to meet with my potential future classmates, this also is a great school to support my growth through collaboration. I've definitely felt very inspired by the work of my classmates: it's a large cohort model where I'll work with many others who are among the most impressive teachers in the country. Collaborating and meeting these other teachers, I definitely feel strong imposter syndrome being a part of this cohort. Notably, people who have been in the program talk about how intense this program is and that it will be a struggle and that sacrifices will need to be made. In addition, the curriculum is noted to be top-notch and literally everyone of my colleagues and mentors remarks that it would be the best education out of any of my options. This school would have the best national network, and probably be the best to prepare me for a potential later career in policy and legislation, which I feel is something I want to do to later to support fixing our education system. To my research: most people get into administration within a few years. This all comes at a cost though as it's by far the most expensive ($80k).

I am about to graduate college and I have an accepted job offer at a large company with a hybrid arrangement. I accepted this job back in October, and I have a start date in late July. I am currently employed part-time at a job, but I will be leaving this position in a week (temporary internship ending). 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I started having some heavy back pain about a month ago, and was told that I'd need spinal surgery at some point in the near future. Based on what I've seen, I'd need to spend a few days in the hospital, and then I'd be on bedrest for about a month or so. It would likely be about a month or two before I could drive. I'm assuming that I would be able to work remotely about a week post-surgery,

I know that since I have not started this position yet, I am not covered under FMLA. I also know that CT has it's own paid leave program that seems more flexible than the federal law. I have been working in CT for four years at various employers.

 I was wondering what the best way to approach this would be. This is an office position, and it's not essential for my job to work in-person. But, I agreed to a 2days/week in-office schedule. I don't want to seem like an a\*\*hole for starting a position and then needing to take off a week, then work remotely for 1-2 months soon after starting a new job at a company I want to grow with.

Regardless of whether I get paid leave, I know that this surgery is something I need, and I have sufficient savings to cover my expenses for a while. That being said, this is NOT something I want to lose my job over, nor do I want to ""look bad"" to my employer. So, I am looking for advice on how I should approach this situation."

I am a 12th grade student in Ontario Canada, and applied to universities with a 98% average and 8 months of work experience in software development. I have also done two half year computer science courses at University of Western with a 97% average for both.

I have heard back from all my applications, and I really need help making a decision, as the deadline for my offers is coming up fast.

Offers:

Computer Engineering at University of Toronto

Computer Engineering at McGill University

Engineering at University of Western with a pre=admission to a Biomedical Engineering double major(the university has a common first year for all ENG students).

Rejected from University of Waterloo Computer Engineering.

&#x200B;

I honestly have done a lot of research and am nowhere closer to making a decision, so I would really appreciate if people could offer insight. More info is that I am still somewhat unsure whether I want to stay in Engineering or eventually go to Medical School, which explains the mix in my applications. I am also greatly interested in COOP programs and trying to get internships at top companies during my undergrad if I can, so I was a bit bummed to be rejected by Waterloo.

If anyone has any information that might help me it would be greatly appreciated."

13jhtzg,1,2023-05-16,SWE jobs with CE degree?,bibertyliberty,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13jhtzg/swe_jobs_with_ce_degree/,"I have 2 years left of college and was originally in a Pre-Computer Science & Engineering program at my school (large state school, well known engineering program). Last year my mental health caused me to struggle academically and I didn’t get accepted to the CSE program but I did get into my second choice, Electrical and Computer Engineering, which I accepted and chose the CE focus. I could have rejected it and applied to CSE again later but I didn’t want to go through the stress of applying again and figured the hardware knowledge would be interesting and useful regardless. I do have 2 SWE internships under my belt, am working part time doing L2 help desk work while in classes, and will be looking for a 2024 internship as well. I’ve enjoyed the software side of things slightly more and have gotten A’s in all of those classes I’ve taken (with the exception of the semester I applied and did poorly, which I retroactively medically withdrew from and got a refund). My question is this - will I still be able to get SWE jobs (+ 2024 internship) after school if I’m in a CE program, or will I be more locked into embedded (which I do also find quite interesting) or computer engineering jobs? I’ve also gotten a lot more interested in learning about cybersecurity this year and have been studying for my Sec+ and am planning on getting a couple other certs before I graduate in case I want to get into that field. I realize this is sort of a rant but any help would be much appreciated! I’ve heard ECE majors say they chose it because they hated coding, but I really enjoy coding, so I want to make sure I’m not screwing myself over - probably mostly EE’s saying that I suppose."

For context, I was a pre-dental student and switched to cs near the end of my sophomore year of college (going to be a senior now). I decided to pick up a minor in CS and ended up really loving it and can see it being what I am doing in my future. The problem is I was late, I am lazy, and I am unguided. I have no work experience besides working as a TA for a biology class, and the only projects I can put on my resume are from intro CS classes. Last year, I didn't get an internship, but fair enough since I just switched at the time. This year, I didn't get an internship because I was lazy applying (only applied to like 50 or so places late in cycle) and making excuses that I wasn't ready for interviews. So I just decided to take some summer CS classes and go along with it, but I am unsure on what to do next. I know I should do a project, but now my classes are eating away at my time. My resume is pretty bad due to lack of extracurriculars and work experience. I am going to be graduating soon and all I can think of is to do a masters in CS/ML but I don't know what good that is with 0 experiences anywhere. I told myself I'm going to complete the 150 neetcode questions this summer, and that I will start applying heavy whenever apps open in july/august, but I don't know why a company would look at me, a student only minoring in CS, and choose me when thousands are trying with way more experience and credentials. Is a masters my best path forward, or do I focus on making a project this summer and pray that some company sticks?"

I realized later on that I would prefer to work as a software engineer/developer/related in CS post graduation. Because of this interest, I was able to obtain an internship last summer as a software developer, and I am still working as an software developer intern at this company. Additionally, I worked on developing an app last summer for a local start up company. I would like to explore opportunities as a full-time developer/engineer at different companies (probably in cities such as Boston, DC, Florida, NYC, or Wilmington) but I’m worried that my application will be tossed because I don’t have a CS/equivalent degree. Anyone have any insight on if it’ll be significantly harder for me to find a full time job as opposed to someone with a CS degree?"
13jjuvw,166,2023-05-16,Insanely Proud,Great_Association_51,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13jjuvw/insanely_proud/,"I started learning SD when I started college in 2018, but was slow to learn, never had any projects, and had no direction on how that could lead to a job, I thought just having the degree in CS would be enough and that I would learn on the job.

Wasn't until about late 2021 (after failing a decent amount of classes) that I discovered about internships, and how helpful they are in finding a job, and I realized I was violently unprepared for the job search. Because of this, I decided to restart, I pushed back graduation from fall of 2022 to fall of this year (2023) and began my journey. I joined a student organization that helps students get internships, and began working on projects. Eventually I gained a leadership position at the organization, which helped me get a job creating AR apps at a school lab. I kept working, improving a little almost every day, and found out along the way that I really enjoyed programming.

Fast forward to late 2022, and I began searching for internships. At this point I had a couple solo projects, a group project in which I was sort of a manager (I also worked on it but had a sort of ""mentor"" role) and a large project at the job I had previously gotten. On top of this I spent everyday practicing DS&A, applying, and improving my resume any way I could.

After hundreds of applications, a lot of rejections, and even more ignores all together, I'm proud to say that I landed a SWE Internship role at Microsoft, and to say I'm excited is more than an understatement. My family came from a communist country with nothing and had to work to set me up to be as successful as possible, and to be able to pay back that sacrifice with an opportunity like this just makes me really happy and proud.

I hope this post serves as an inspiration to all the devs out there that feel they are getting nowhere, it's definitely possible. If you put in the work and have an open mind to any advice, you can get anywhere."

Since then, I worked very hard to bridge the gaps in my knowledge and I felt that I had improved.
On Friday, the last day of the internship. They told me, verbally, that my full time offer was rescinded.
Since then, I only received one document via DocuSign stating that my internship had concluded. I have not received any further information regarding the full time offer nor next steps regarding how to return all technology provided by the company.

13jnw4q,6,2023-05-16,I am a Web Dev student who landed a GIS Internship. How can I make this experience worthwhile?,tetsujin44,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/13jnw4q/i_am_a_web_dev_student_who_landed_a_gis/,"So like the title says, I am a Web Development student. I have become pretty comfortable with html, and vanilla css and javascript. I interviewed for a GIS analyst job in my city just for the hell of it, and the manager ended up liking me a lot and offered me an internship as a way to get some experience.

The issue is, I don't know anything really about GIS. 

It seems he is giving me the freedom to get whatever I want out of the experience, and at the very least just add something to resume. 

So my question is... do you have some ideas for some projects I could maybe work on during this internship that will incorporate my Web Development skills?

I have already looked into the ArcPRO API for making web map applications, but Ive never really used an API before. I have a month before the internship starts to figure some things out. Any help or ideas would be appreciated."
13jnykf,10,2023-05-16,How to cut through as a mid level engineer?,choccysmeg,cscareerquestionsOCE,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/13jnykf/how_to_cut_through_as_a_mid_level_engineer/,"For context: I’m in my final year of uni but have been working as a intern and then a fully fledged software engineer for 3 years part time. I have multiple greenfield projects spanning over a year on my resume, 2 of which are fully built products that are being used daily, one with 3k MAU, multiple but minor open source contributions and hackathons.

As for my abilities, I can take ownership of entire features or products if they’re small to mid sized and deliver them without having someone hold my hand. My technical skills and knowledge of CS are also advanced relative to others and I have averaged over 80% in my engineering units for over 5 years.

This is a pretty unique position, I’m clearly not a junior anymore but I’m about to be fresh out of uni. This has led to me getting instant rejections at screening for mid level roles. I easily got into big tech grad role hiring rounds and I’m going through that now, I’ll take it if I get accepted but if I don’t, I want to get a mid level position somewhere else. 

Does anyone have some advice as to how to cut through as a mid level given my circumstances? 

I’m confident about cutting through when I’m on the phone to an engineer, I’ll tell them what I’m capable of. But recruiters don’t see that and I clearly need to change something to get past them."
13jocn8,4,2023-05-16,Asian pre-med who failed calc first sem 😛,Late_Stock_1355,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/13jocn8/asian_premed_who_failed_calc_first_sem/,"Demographic and faq: 
- Asian female
- highly competitive Bay Area school
- will not Qual for finaid
- no hooks
- applying premed, aiming for T20s, ivies, UCs and a few CSUs

Stats: 
- 3.83 unweighted as per first sem jr year transcript 
- 36 on act
- 5s for seven APs (3 self studied, school doesn’t offer APs til jr year)

Additional info: 
- I had solid grades 9-10th grade (just one B), but first semester of jr year, I got diagnosed w a disease and my parents were going through a divorce, which took a heavy toll on my suicidal dad’s mental health. There was a LOT going on in just those couple of months, and whenever I wasn’t in the hospital (missing school) getting treated, I was trying to take care of my family first and foremost. I chose to prioritize my health and my dad over my grades, so I got a C in AP calculus BC and a B in another subject (good news is, getting an A in all subjects, even calculus, this semester!!!). I cant even fully bring myself to say I regret doing so terrible academically, because I know I would not be able to forgive myself if I didn’t intervene in my father’s actions… However, I do have a sinking feeling that those two grades alone will just invalidate my application, and that I have no shot at the schools I dream of attending. After reviewing my ECs, please share your honest thoughts and how I can come across as a caring, empathetic human through my story, rather than someone trying to cover up their grades by giving excuses. 

ECs:
1) Supervising autistic family member’s ABA and Speech Therapy sessions (10-12hrs/wk, 52wk/yr, 7yrs)
—> involved in lessons and work with mentors to teach sibling new words and their usage, but mainly focus on developing social skills. These sessions have taught me that skills that seem like second-nature to me may not come as easily to people with special needs. This is where my passion for neutodiverse inclusion and support stems from, and it’s a big part of my motivation to be a caring, Empathetic doctor. 

2) Youth Ambassador for a national organization that is centered around neurodiverse inclusion in sports (2hr/wk, 52 wk/yr, 1yr)
—> has opened pathways for me to engage with adults that have special needs, and learn from them about what I can do in my community to create a more supportive community for neurodiverse individuals. I’ve also gotten the chance to meet athletes and celebrities that work with this organizations and learned how they use their influence to expand love and support for people with intellectual disabilities. 

3) Organized 2 healthcare conferences (10hrs/wk, 6 wks/yr, 2 years)
—> reached out to healthcare workers from various specialties, and medical students, to be guest speakers. This conference (which took place on zoom) served to make it accessible for high schoolers to learn about the path to becoming a surgeon etc, as well as to talk with and ask questions directly to a professional to better understand what it’s like to work  in their field. As a young woman in STEM aspiring to work in medicine, I always wished I had something like this so I could better understand the ""petals"" and ""thorns"" of studying to work in medicine I figured creating an event like this would not only fulfill my curiosity, but would benefit many others as well. We had over 300 students attend the first conference, and 500+ the second time!

4) Presented research at an international conference in Japan, won an award (14 hrs/wk, 30 wks, 1 yr)
--> Research was about brain tumors, and in all honesty, it all happened unintentionally. In 10th grade I started reading about neuroscience topics if I found myself with some free time in class, and the summer after 10th grade, I dug deeper into a niche area of neurobiology and ended up producing a research paper under mentorship. I submitted it to an international conference and got accepted! The cherry on top was winning the award too! Very unexpected, and I wouldn't have even dreamed of it in 10th grade! It feels surreal that I got recognition for this :D

5) Internship with dentist (10 hrs/wk, 5 wks, 1 yr)
--> Not related to neuroscience or neurodiverse inclusion at all, but I wanted to explore other areas of health as well. I came across an opening for this internship and thought it offered a lot of cool things that I wouldn't otherwise get to experience in high school. I learned how to take and interpret x rays, the nitty-gritty how certain procedures (crownings, root canals) are performed, and I was also taught about what kind of information is recorded in patient history and how it is all organized. During downtime, I would organize paperwork. 

6) Officer of Club: Best Buddies (5 hrs/wk, 40 wks/yr, 3 yrs)
--> Spend my free periods at school with the special needs students. I’ve seen how hard it is for my sibling to socialize with his peers, and it made me wonder how others with special needs feel. Best Buddies is aimed toward dismantling the gap between students who are and are not diagnosed with autism by having students spend time together during free periods. Favorite memories: teaching a student how to play piano, advocating at the district-level to plan a Special Prom (because students with special needs are not allowed at Prom, which robs them of a key high school experience, I felt strongly about this issue and wanted to organize a prom for these students). 

7) Officer of Club: Leo Club (3 hrs/wk, 40 wks/yr, 2 yrs)
--> Service club. I reach out to organizations to organize 3-4 service events per month. Compared to last year's totals, in just one semester I helped increase member count by 73, service hours by 923 hours, and funds raised by almost $600. 

8) Taekwondo, 3rd degree black belt (8 hrs/wk, 48 wks/yr, 10 yrs)
--> State-level competitor, several 1st place achievements. Assist in teaching classes of younger students twice a week. 

9) ASMR Channel (2 hrs/wk, 25 wks/yr, 1 yr)
--> As an insomniac, I watch asmr (ie massage asmr videos, not the slime etc ones haha) every night to fall asleep. I started creating asmr content for fun, hoping to help others relax the same way I've been able to through these videos. Not super successful yet (1k subscribers, ~30k total views among 15 videos), but I might put this on my application simply because it's just something I enjoy :)

10) Kpop dance covers (1 hr/wk, 52 wks/yr, 1 yr)
--> Just another activity for fun, a creative outlet. I have a youtube channel for this as well, 30k subscribers and 1 million views (crazy...). Just another addition to my application that is meaningful to me, but not something impressive. I actually know some campuses have dance cover teams, so I want to talk about how I look forward to being a part of those communities on campus!

11) Not an activity or anything, but I got waitlisted at SSP (I WAS EXPECTING A REJECTION!!!). What does that say about the quality of my application and rec letters?  

Essay: 
- Honestly, I'm still not certain about what I want to talk about in my essay, because I feel like there's SO many things that make me who I am. However, I am considering including this narrative in part of my essay: 
   --> My family (Indian) speaks Konkani, which is a very uncommon language unless you go to Goa. In most parts of India, people don't know what Konkani even is. Every time I visit my grandparents in Goa, I feel so at home because I can just talk in Konkani all the time, rather than being stuck in a limbo between English, Konkani, and Hindi at home. I also have severe eczema, which becomes full-blown everytime I visit Goa. Everytime we travel there, we have to go to the pharmacy to get steroids to numb the sensation. I pinch my nose as I walk to the pharmacist, the streets lined with vendors selling smelly fish (I'm allergic to fish so I'm sensitive to the smell too). 
 --> I'm basically thinking of having the narrative set in Goa, and talk about various experiences that reflect on me and my experiences with my family. I'd talk about my eczema, my sibling (and helping them acclimate to the new setting), meeting strangers that I instantly connect with and how they feel so familiar because we can converse in Konkani, etc. 

Extra: 
- To Scholar Grade: thank you so much for reviewing this. The way I describe my ECs in this chanceme are not the quality that I'll use in my applications, and the way I've written my essay topic seems underdeveloped compared to what I am crafting in my head. However, taking into consideration the depth and impact (on others and my own identity) of my ECs, where do I stand in terms of applying to T20s? How can I make my application better? Thank you again!

- To everyone else: Thanks for chancing me! My grades first sem of this year are scary to look at, but I plan on explaining my circumstances in my essays, and my teachers confirmed they'll bring it up in my rec letters as well."

I made a larger pros/cons list below but it essentially boils down to this:  

Medicine  

Pros: I've done biology all my life (national competitions, research, volunteering, etc.) and know that I love the subject. I've shadowed a bit recently and really enjoyed the interpersonal aspect, and felt pretty fulfilled. It's also obviously a great career in terms of stability, pay, recognition, etc.  

Cons: I'm not sure if I'm ready to brave the brutal reality of med school, residency, and an actual career in regards to wlb, debt, and burnout. I've heard so many horror stories about people hating their lives in medicine and it really scares me.  

Software Engineering  

Pros: I took Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms and Operating Systems this past year and found the material quite interesting, and I like the problem-solving aspect of CS a lot. SWE has immediate career opportunities out of college and I go to a pretty prestigious university so I think with proper planning, internships, and networking I could secure a nice big tech job out of school. And of course, the wlb and difficulty (in comparison to medicine) are much more bearable.  

Cons: I'm really just not sure how fulfilled I'd be. I'm worried that sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day working on problems that don't have a direct impact like medicine will eventually bore me to death, especially because I don't get to interact directly with people as much.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. Looking forward to hearing from y'all!"

13joxj3,0,2023-05-16,"MS Data Science programs, which to choose?",Busy_Telephone_1957,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13joxj3/ms_data_science_programs_which_to_choose/,"I previously obtained a STEM degree, and decided on making the switch to DS, so I ended up applying to MS programs and was accepted to about four of the five, I applied to. So far I had admits from Johns Hopkins, American University, Depaul, and one other, which I will not name, due to wanting to remain anonymous (more on this later). I also applied for UT Austin's data science program and should find out, within the next week or two, whether I got in or not.

Cost-wise, UT Austin is the cheapest, at 10k, and it would have been my first choice, but it seems to be geared more towards those with significant programming experience, based off of my research. While I do have a few computer science classes under my belt, I do feel as if I will struggle the most with this program. In addition, since I am an international student, I will have significant difficulty obtaining an internship where I live, and even if I were to obtain one, I would likely only earn up to $30k, which is around what I make now. The other options would allow me the chance to work in the States, via OPT, and I believe that experience will be valuable.

The program I am leaning towards is the one I didn't name above. The program is quite small, with around twenty students. The issue is that the program is quite new, so there isn't much info available on where grads end up working, since the first batch of students will graduate in 2024. The program is located in a city with a lot of tech companies, so obtaining an internship should not be difficult. That being said, the current batch of students are working as data analysts, instead of data scientists for their internships, so I am not sure, if that is a positive or negative. 

The third option for me, is to start at Johns Hopkins University, and to take a couple of graduate courses, in data science and to transfer some of the credits, to another program, next year. That program I will transfer to, offers students paid internships, with reputable tech companies, as part of the program.

Out of the three, which option sounds the best? I am leaning towards the second, but I don't know if it is wise to enroll in a brand new program, which I don't know much about. Would the presence in a tech city make up for that, or is it just not worth it?"
13jp1xl,1,2023-05-16,Seeking advice for my placements,d4nknibba,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/13jp1xl/seeking_advice_for_my_placements/,"Hi everyone! I'll try to keep it brief, I am from a tier 2 college and receive a bunch of opportunities from the college itself. I have just finished my 3rd year and have begun my placement prep. I was wondering whether I can get into the top companies as it stands and am seeking you experienced guys' opinions and suggestions!

I have completed 400+ problems on LeetCode (following the NeetCode problem set) and also have a decent contest rating (1550 something, only gave 2 contests though, I need to give more). However I struggle a lot on Codechef or Codeforces where I feel  the questions are based more on Mathematics rather than DSA. I am getting better by the day though!

My projects: Web Scraping and Fake review detection, e-commerce app (MERN), social media app (MERN). 
 
I also have 1 W.E (2 months in 2021) and am currently doing an internship in a product based startup. The first W.E was at a service based company in which our team made an ODM for construction sites but the overall experience kind of felt underwhelming and I feel like I didn't learn anything. However, in my current company, I absolute love the environment and am getting to learn a lot of stuff about how software is actually developed and delivered in a business environment.

Other stuff: I have an AWS SAA-C03 certification, a bunch of udemy certificates (although I have heard they are worthless), my main technologies are the web (MERN), Flutter, C/C++ (For DSA), Python, AWS, and a little bit of Java. It kind of doesn't matter but I also have 3 merit certificates (1 for every year).

As you guys might anticipate, the last year has been really stressful for me and the fact that I had to complete 50 credits in the last year alone has not helped one bit. The motive of seeking you guys' opinions is for me to set a realistic benchmark so that I don't disappoint myself and relieve some stress as a result... 

Thanks in advance!"

This is kinda early but I recently got accepted to work as a research assistant for a prof’s lab and I was unsure if I’d be able to handle it with all my other extracurriculars and engineering classes this fall. Rn, I’m planning on taking 5 classes each semester (fall and spring) but I have the option of moving two of those to the summer and taking only 4 each semester. I’m just a bit worried since Ik a lot of my peers r gonna try to intern then and I feel like I should do that too. On the other hand, I don’t wanna lose this opportunity to do research bc it is smtg Im interested in and if I don’t like it, I could know to not do anything like it in the future. I also still have 3 more years of school, so I could always do an internship next next summer before I become a senior. I guess I just wanna know what other people think about this. Also for context im a freshman in meche. So would only having one internship before graduating and research experience be worse than two internships and no research? What are your thoughts?"

How should I neogitiate the salary?,BowIofRice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13jpptm/got_offered_a_full_time_position_after_an/,"The position is for Data Administration Specialist (aka Data Analyst)

My internship was supposed to go until 6/30 but just recently 1 person left the Data team and my Data team manager also just put in his two weeks so I'm guessing they're in more need of positions being filled. They offered me 58,500. Would asking for 70,000 be too much? Anything above that would be ideal but I would also settle for 65,000. This salary is quite a bit below average salary for my position but my company is super laid back and it's remote too which is nice.

During my negotiation I plan to start off with something like:
I really appreciate the offer you guys have given me, I really enjoy working here, everyone is super nice and even though the office is 2 hours away I still make an effort to come in once a week because I enjoy the office setting and interacting with my co workers. However, the salary offered was much lower than I expected. Based on my research online, as well as applying to other companies and interviews, I was hoping to get something within the range of 70k. I've been with you guys since the start of the year, I'm familiar with the work and I know I can do a better job  than if you were to hire someone new


Should I mention the fact that 2 people just left and that they need some people now than ever?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions and tips"
13jpxkj,0,2023-05-16,Never thought I'd regret my psych degree until now - what do I do now?,pumpkinmoonrabbit,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13jpxkj/never_thought_id_regret_my_psych_degree_until_now/,"I got my BA in psych despite knowing all the stats of many people regretting their psych degree. I knew exactly what I wanted to do: pursue a PhD and become a professor.  
  
Now I'm finishing up my second year of an MA/PhD research psychology program, and I'm pretty disillusioned. Firstly, my program is pretty small, and my lab isn't super productive. As far as I can tell, my lab hasn't published anything since 2020. Realistically, I think becoming a professor will be much harder than anticipated due to the lack of publications, and transferring to another lab isn't really an option in my program. Because of this, I've been applying to non-academic internships, including UX research, data analytics, and more, but I think I screwed up by not applying to enough during last fall and only really began applying to a lot out of panic in March. I ended up not getting anything at all and will likely be working at a summer camp or something completely unrelated this summer (or just not doing anything at all and working on my thesis unpaid).  
  
Basically, I'm beginning to regret going into psychology due to feeling like I'm not going to be able to stay in academia and not being able to get my foot into industry either, at least not this year. I'm completely lost. Moreover, I've kind of forgotten why I was so interested in becoming a professor in the first place. I'm currently finishing up my master's thesis on a project I started out being somewhat interested in, but after months of back and forth writing and editing the manuscript, I've decided I despise this topic. (Okay, not really, but still.)  
  
My parents, who both studied medicine although only one of them is practicing now, think I should quit the program entirely and go to med school to become a psychiatrist. (They've been pushing me toward med school since I was a kid.) However, the primary issue is that I didn't take any prerequisites in undergrad. I literally have never taken a chemistry class, not even in high school. My other option may be to pursue an MBA or another sort of degree, but I honestly don't feel like applying for and going through more schooling, especially if I'll be paying for it.  
  
I've honestly fallen into major depression due to feeling like a failure. What do I do now?"

For example, people who like programming can simply program on their personal computers whenever they'd like. Has anyone found something akin to this, but for networking?

&#x200B;

I'm in a bit of a career conundrum and I could use your collective wisdom. Here's my situation:

I'm a 27-year-old senior at Texas Tech University, majoring in Petroleum Engineering. I've had one internship, which was with ExxonMobil during the summer of 2019. I'm scheduled to resume my senior classes this upcoming Fall semester and graduate in May 2024.

However, there's been a major change in my life that has me reevaluating my path. In November 2021, during my senior year, I was involved in a severe motorcycle accident. My recovery period was extensive; I wasn't able to walk for months and only fully recovered in December 2022. As a result, I couldn't attend classes or continue with my degree in the physical state I was in.

During this time, I fell into a deep depression. My passion for petroleum engineering started to wane, and with each week, it seemed to fade a little more. But as they say, every cloud has a silver lining, and mine came in the form of a childhood passion: programming.

Confined to my bed, I had nothing else to do but spend time on my laptop. I began to code, and as my interest in petroleum engineering faded, my love for programming was reignited. This love only grew stronger when I developed an app for my dad's trucking fleet company. It's a location tracker that allows truckers to log into their own worker accounts and send important PODs (Proof of Delivery) documentation for bookkeeping.

So, now I find myself torn between finishing my Petroleum Engineering degree or switching to a Computer Science degree. Here are the options I'm considering:

1. Finish my Petroleum Engineering degree and then work on personal programming projects.
2. Finish my Petroleum Engineering degree and then pursue a Computer Science degree.
3. Switch my major to Computer Science now.

The first option seems like the least risky, but I'm worried that my lack of formal CS education might limit me in the tech industry. My other concern would be the huge gap from the last time I attended class to this new start date: meaning, I will feel behind compared to my peers and classwork knowledge (I lost my lecture notes during the motorcycle accident). The second option could give me the best of both worlds, but it would also mean a lot more time in school, which is something I'm not sure I want at this point in my life. The third option is the most drastic and feels somewhat scary, but it might be the most fulfilling in the long run.

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated, especially from those of you who may have been in similar situations. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

I’m a sophomore political science undergrad and had some questions about the MPA program at UofU and just in general.
While I know it is a bit early to be truly sure, I’ve been pretty drawn to getting an MPA since I’ve been interning under a city manager over the summer. However, there are a couple things I’m not too sure about just yet.

Firstly, how is the MPA program at the U? Are their any specific focuses or benefits that set it apart from other programs in neighboring states?

Secondly, what sort of positions can recent graduates expect? I’m currently planning on getting into local/state government here in Utah, but am not too sure what positions I should be looking for in the future fresh out of college.

Thirdly, would a JD/MPA be a good dual program for someone who isn’t looking to practice law? I’ve heard it may not be, but I was still curious about it considering that a better knowledge of the law could, from what I could guess, would help me be more effective in my position.

Lastly, are there any internships or campus activities you would recommend I take part in before pursuing this masters?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

It’s a two years program, I’m half way through.

Job experience:
- one month internship as ux intern

- 2 years contractor for a research project at the previous university I studied in. Job duty including managing social media account +recruitment of participants 

- 6 months data entry for a machine learning project at the previous university I studied in 


Why I want to quit:
- short supply of junior positions, or even internship. I wanted to work+stay in EU for 1-2 years. But getting a visa sponsor with my experience seems tough. 

- I have always heard people say you could work with English in IT. But haven’t foreseen the local job market being so small, and mid-small sized companies require local  language skills.

- if the labour market situation is not ideal even for locals, then it’ll only be worse for foreigners  


- Now that I know,
It would be better if I have 2-3 years experience at home before moving to Europe fresh off college. And that I could get hired easily at home.

But, reasons to try?
1) just finish the degree, at least it’s beneficial for future

2) I have 9 months of graduation job seeking visa after graduation, maybe the situation would change after a year?  

3) I have a partner there. If I leave, then it ends because my partner is deeply rooted in this city. Unless I ask for a “visa sponsorship” and then stay there, do any survival jobs, learn the language. But that’s gambling my whole life, and it’s not good to put my survival weight on others shoulder.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

Project Complexity: I should mention that most of my projects were made specifically for exams, so they aren't super complex. For example, in web programming, I used the MEAN stack. But they did earn me grades, ranging from 90% to 100%.  
  
GitHub's Impact: I'm curious to know how much having my projects on GitHub can actually help me when it comes to finding internships or landing a junior position. Do you think it makes a big difference?  
  
Any advice or insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch in advance!"

What kind of colleges should I apply?,Impressive_Drama7338,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/13k16js/how_do_i_make_my_gap_year_fruitful_what_kind_of/,"I'll be finishing my A level pretty soon now. Since I didn't apply last year, I will probably apply in the upcoming August.

My  grades are really good. Physics/Chem/Computer/Econ A\* in all internal  exams. EGP: a, I'm hoping I'll get at least 3A\* in this A level.

I am a computer programmer. Have a few internships in hand but they are mostly remote. So, I have a lot of free time to myself.

My school also offers volunteering inside school as a teacher. I got the offer to teach, idk if I should take it.

All  my employers say I have very good way of doing things while coding  which makes me sometimes think that I might have a chance outside of  school.

I  want to get in a good college with good financial aid. My financial  status is relatively weak especially after Covid-19. My dad lost his job,  mother got sick. Sold a land already. Living on rent in valley. I doubt  my parents can pay for my college fee more than 80-90k per month for  first few months. This entire year my parents had a income of less than $5000, the loan money is only being consumed.

But  I don't blame them. I think it is my responsibility now as I've reached  18. So, from the internships I have, I am planning to pay for my SATs  and CSS fees. Also, some colleges require money to apply so, I might  have to use it as well.

Given my  financial status, what kind of colleges are fit for me. US certainly is  my priority but not my only option. I am ready to go to US, European  countries, Singapore, Japan etc.. but not China, India or Australia.

The  main thing is I am ready to sacrifice or fully utilize next 5-6 months  completely for college. I don't want to spend a single second useless.

But  where do I invest my time? I have my personal projects already, but as  they are coding related they don't occupy much of a time. So, I have a  lot of free time to myself.

Please  suggest some good things to do. Also, if any one has been in a similar situation in the past, lmk how you dealt with it. It  is difficult to be born in a middle class family when times like this  come. Some of my friends are rich enough to pay $20k-$30k EFC  guaranteeing them some colleges."

I recently graduated in March 2023 in business information systems and got accepted into grad school. I wanna study about data analytics. So far I've had had 1 internship which ended when I graduated. I got the Internship last year. I had to relocate over the summer but I worked remote afterwards and during my school year. 

I applied for a full time position with the same company with a referral from one of the operations directors who was like a mentor. But bc I got I to grad school I wanna do another internship with the same company (different area) as I really enjoyed working there (especially in person) and I can hopefully gain more experience working with them and learn more skills. Another reason I'm going to grad school is cause my parents are forcing me to go but it is what it is.

For grad school I got a massive scholarship so paying isn't that bad of a headache.

Which path would be best? I really wanna work full time and come back to get my MBA after 1-2 years but since I got into grad school with a massive scholarship that's also on the table"
13k3ogh,3,2023-05-17,CS in SMU VS NTU Math + Data Analytics Double Major,_Alloy_,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/13k3ogh/cs_in_smu_vs_ntu_math_data_analytics_double_major/,"Hey everyone. I've been offered Computer Science at SMU and Math + Data Analytics Second Major at NTU. I'm having a hard time deciding between the two as they both have their advantages and disadvantages. It would be great to hear more perspectives on this since I haven't come across many discussions about the NTU Math + Data Analytics Second major.

Regarding NTU:

1. From what I've gathered, this Second major seems promising. I've read Reddit posts and explored the school's website, which mentions that I would only need to take an additional 7 modules to complete the Second degree. It's also reassuring to know that if it becomes too challenging, I have the option to drop it. Moreover, the degrees are interconnected, which is beneficial.
2. I'm quite uncertain about the career prospects associated with this Second major. I've come across information suggesting that I can pursue various fields within the IT industry, but I'm unsure if companies would prefer someone with a CS certification over someone with an NTU Math degree.
3. NTU has a wide range of facilities and resources compared to SMU. Which would likely contribute to better student life, and I guess it would provide ample opportunities to network with senior CS students.
4. If my grades turn out well, would it be possible to switch to NTU's CS program? Additionally, if I find that I'm not enjoying the course, would it be feasible to switch to a different one within NTU?

Regarding SMU:

1. I'm unsure about the course structure at SMU, particularly because it's relatively new. I've heard about a grading component called ""class participation,"" where a significant percentage of the final grade is based on active involvement in seminars. I'd appreciate it if there's more insight into this aspect.
2. I've heard that the professors at SMU are highly dedicated and enthusiastic about teaching. 
3. How does SMU support its students in terms of internships, job placements, or industry connections for Computer Science students?

I might have missed out on some other questions to be asked but if there are any other questions you can just let me know"

I am writing regarding the pros and cons of pursuing an academic position as a professor in chemical engineering.

My PI just had a conversation with me this morning saying that my preliminary examination committee was very impressed with my ability to explain my research. I really enjoyed TA-ing and got excellent student evaluations, and my advisor nominated me for a TA award for this year. At the moment I have 4 publications (2 co-first author) in very good journals, and I have presented at two conferences already. Based on this, my PI suggested me considering becoming a professor.

However, I am currently considering going to industry. The things that scare me about becoming a professor are:

* work-life balance: from what I see in R1 institutions, you have to work on weekends, long days, travel a lot. I would like to start a family and this seems hard to do if you are a professor. Industry would be a 9 to 5 with weekends off.
* I like research but I cannot see myself creating my own research lab. I am good at writing and I have written parts of proposals in the past, and I like mentoring undergrads. However, having to constantly rely on proposals for funding seems overwhelming.
* Doing a postdoc seems exhausting and so competitive.

Do you have any advice? What could help me decide?

I have considered doing an internship in industry, but my PI is on tenure track and they do not allow it at the moment. I am also considering becoming a teaching faculty because I really liked TA-ing. However, teaching faculty are treated not the same as professors with little growth opportunity.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

What can help me decide if becoming professor is right for me (vs industry); field: chemical engineering; current position: 3rd year PhD candidate in ChemE in R1 institution. Main cons: work-life balance; 2) finding your research direction; 3) need to do postdoc."

I went back school starting last January after years of mostly retail. I had no idea what to expect in terms of interviewing or what even I was actually looking for at times. I've been applying to entry level or internships almost daily for the last two months. 

I had never not gotten the job if I had interviewed, so the first couple times I did not get the job, it was not a good feeling. This community helped me keep my confidence to keep interviewing and pursuing this career. The interviews were pretty much what has been described here for internships. In the final interview I had, I asked the IT manager what the most important skill I could have for the position. She wanted someone who had customer service skills. Many of the questions were behavioral and the only technical question was about DNS, only because I had brought it up first. It really was more about fit and eagerness to join the field than it was about technical skills. I made sure to hammer home the eagerness and my customer service from my years in retail.

This morning I was offered an internship for something exactly I was looking for! It'll be mostly help desk and helping out where needed. It's at a decent sized company (fortune 1000) and the pay is 22$ an hour which I feel is a bit high, but I'm very grateful. More importantly, I'll be able to start honing my skills, gaining experience, and working towards some certs like A+ and Net+.

13k6jyz,44,2023-05-17,Thinking of overseas med? Life of UK doc (resident),oban4seafood,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/13k6jyz/thinking_of_overseas_med_life_of_uk_doc_resident/,"Heard from parent's friends that it is local med results time. Thought I would share my experience, might help anyone who didn't get into med and thinking of going overseas. I am a bit far removed from UCAS, UKCAT etc, might be better to ask someone in year 1 about specifics. 

I didn't get local med and applied for UK med schools in 1st year of NS. Did a 5 year course in a non London uni, now 4th year of working, second year of residency. 

Lots of ups and downs over the past years but generally happy with my life now and love my job.

Compared to my NUS friends, I had a lot more time all 5 years of med school. Budget European trips (£30 return flights), hiking mountains, trying new hobbies I would never do in sg. I did an elective in one of the big hospitals back home and could see students on clinicals finish super late and came really early. 

Clinicals in UK are a lot less rigorous due to understaffing which is a bit sad for learning as a med student compared to sg which has a very strong teaching culture. NUS finals were a lot harder than my uni's exams. Benefits of UK medical education are definitely the soft skills: bedside manner and communication skills, and the degree is well recognised if you want to work abroad.

In my first year it was quite a big change and kept comparing everything to sg, looked down on my small ish city and how it seemed a bit backward, things closing at 5 or 6pm, no shopping malls, eating out was pricy and public transport was nothing convenient like sg. When I first came to the UK I just thought I would get my degree and leave ASAP after 5 years but still am here now. 

Soon it got better as I settled in, made new friends, tried lots of new activities, usual uni stuff.

Later years got very used to it and enjoyed the outdoors a lot, cheap European holidays, work life balance and slower pace of life after being really busy on my elective in an sg hospital. Really enjoyed the diverse cultures, met people from all walks of life around the world, shaped and broadened my mind and thinking. 

Decided to stay on to work for more opportunities for residency as it seemed difficult at the time to get into the specialty I wanted in sg. Work life is much better here, you can't work more than 13h shifts while my sg friends easily clock 30h during on call shifts. Being a much bigger country I was able to get into a competitive specialty. I enjoy my job daily, enjoy mastering a craft, get good feedback from supervisors on how to improve and also impacting patients positively. Have lot of free time to go outdoors, relax, chill too. 

Most people find it hard to decide where to go after graduation. Most go back home, some go to Australia after working 1 or 2 years in the UK for an even better work life balance and much better pay. The caveat with going home is you need to either go back early or finish residency and be a consultant, there is no in between, so it can be a gamble.

The lack of bond and the degree being recognised and ability to do residency in UK are probably the big advantages. You could also do USMLE and go to the US. For instance becoming a UK GP (5 years post graduation) is a very easy ticket to getting a very well paid job in Canada and Australia. Working a year in the UK gets you easily registered to Australian medical council and you could begin your career there after, while I'm not sure how easy it is for Australian international grads to get internships nowadays. Post uk residency, depending on specialty you can work in the middle East, aus/NZ. 

It's not all roses, anyone from around the world can apply to UK residency these days due to a new immigration change - you could do your degree in somewhere affordable like India and work a year or two and apply, this has made things competitive for everyone.

UK winters can be dark and depressing, the fees have gone up a lot since I enrolled. NHS is always underfunded and understaffed. 

Feel free to ask any questions."

I am Taiwanese, I dont have other country's citizenship.

Xiamen University Malaysia: Bachelor of engineering in Computer Science and Technology CGPA:3.46/4.0 Medium of Intruction: English

Working experience:  
Only a 6 month internship at NXP semiconductor as a EHS IT intern

Master degree in my list:  
University of Sydney: Master of CS  
University of Melbourne: Master of IT (I got rejected for CS...Sad)  
UNSW: Master of IT

I hope I can work in Australia for a few years to accumulate the working experience. Migration seems like a nice idea, but its not a MUST for me. The worst case is going back to Taiwan as soon as my study in completed (I dont wanna work in Taiwan, at least not as a fresh grad, the environment there felt pretty bad when I was doing internship there.)

Tuition fee is not a factor, I probabily just going to use student loan to cover it.  
And I dont think I can get a scholarship with my grades as well.

I checked the handbook for all programs, Melbourne and Sydney do provide internship as an elective course, while UNSW doesnt. But I saw alot of people saying that all the tech companies want student from UNSW. So I am kinda struggling to make an decision.

I got the following questions, please rank the Uni I mentioned (if it is possible).

1. How easy is it to find Jobs in Australia

13k89u5,3,2023-05-17,My [23F] mom [56F] wants me to study med school in the Philippines but my partner [24F] wants me to study med school in the US. Which do I choose?,GodsFavAsn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13k89u5/my_23f_mom_56f_wants_me_to_study_med_school_in/,"So I \[23F\] am Filipino and I lived in the Philippines for 12 years. Afterwards I moved to the United States where I went to middle school, high school, and university. My academic performance was above average until university, where my grades were not that stellar (unfortunately, my GPA is a 2.7) and I've incurred a student loan from university due to paying out of state tuition. However, I still want to be a doctor, and I'm willing to do anything for it: I've volunteered at a student-run clinic, gained leadership experience at a co-ed fraternity, worked as a medical scribe, worked as a caregiver and medication technician at a senior living home, and joined a research lab for a short period of time. I am currently studying for the MCAT and the only thing I haven't done so far that I know of is 1) Publish a research paper 2) Raise my GPA by going to community colleges and taking a master's program. 

Originally, my plan had always been to study med school in the Philippines upon completing my undergrad in the U.S. This idea was heavily influenced by my mom \[56F\], who had studied med school in the Philippines prior to immigrating to the United States. According to her, once I graduate my 4 years of medical school and 1 year of internship in the Philippines, I can take Step 1 and 2 CK and CS of the USMLE and do clinical rotations after returning to the U.S. to get into residency here. She also claims that my dad is friends with people who can sponsor me once I return to the U.S., as long as I work hard to get a good score on my USMLE. The benefits of studying in the Philippines include cheaper cost of living, cheaper tuition, and easier requirements to get into med school. I am told that the curriculum there is just as rigorous as the curriculum in the U.S., so I don't have to worry about my quality of education.  

I wasn't always interested in pursuing medical school in the United States. I only changed my mind after dating my now \[24F\] partner of 2 years, who has convinced me that studying medical school in the U.S. is the only guaranteed way of getting into residency in the U.S. This is why I spent 2 years after graduating as an undergrad on working to polish my resume, with the hopes that by studying for the MCAT and going to med school here in the U.S., that I don't have to maintain a long-distance relationship with my partner. Now, with my partner and I planning to break up in July, this is no longer looking like an option. The downsides of going to the Philippines, according to my partner, include losing my sense of independence (as I will be dependent on my parents financially), losing support for my mental health (I currently have a psychiatrist, therapist, DBT, and 4 medications here in the U.S.), and of course losing priority for residency in the U.S. due to being an IMG. 

So here's where it gets a little complicated. My partner insinuates that we are only breaking up temporarily so that I can work on myself, but in the end she states that eventually we will get back together once I am better and that I'm the one she wants to marry--ONLY if I decide to study in the U.S. However I've told her that it is possible to work on myself even in the Philippines, as there are many affordable and accessible therapists there and, according to a friend who works in the pharmaceutical industry, all my medications  are available in the Philippines to prescribe. 

I've asked for third party opinions about my situation from other people, but it also seems like a tie. My mom's friends and my relatives all want me to study in the Philippines, but my friends all want me to study in the U.S. My mom has a friend who studies at Stanford and a cousin who works as a financial advisor and both prefer that I study in the U.S. On the other hand, my dad's friends' children have taken the Philippine route and were successfully sponsored once they returned to the U.S.

I'm so confused because this decision will literally determine my future, and I feel like I'm walking the line between two worlds, and the longer I do, the more I sabotage both opportunities. So which do I choose? Should I go to the Philippines or should I stay in the U.S. ?"

I take night course to study HR and I’d like to work in administration/HR as I feel like an office job would suit me a lot more (I know, that’s apparently uncommon for people with ADHD but my experience has shown me that retail is literal hell for me).

I recently got two interviews for a part-time job as an administrative assistant and I really felt like I was gonna have it, but they just told me they chose someone else. It’s ridiculous because it’s only a job but I’ve been crying non stop since and I feel like I’ll never be able to get a proper job…(no shade to retail workers! I’ve only worked in that field and I just know it isn’t for me anymore.)

On the other hand I’m waiting for a reply from another recruiter but it’s for a full-time internship of 1 year, Monday to Friday 8am-5:30pm (so I’ll be outside of the house from 7am to 6:30pm). The salary (due to the fact that it’s an internship) is less than the part-time job I didn’t get and that depresses me. I’m also scared to death of working full-time because I won’t have any time for me and it’ll be impossible to see my therapist. I just don’t know what to do if they tell me I get the job.
I feel like to wait for an opportunity that suits me more, but a part of me judges me really harshly for not even being able of working full-time like a “real adult”. 

Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading me!

TLDR at the end

Please hear me out. 

I was abused as a child by my family. Physically and mentally. On several occasions I've had to be taken to the ER. 

Couple things about where I live - In my society, parents physically abusing children is normal practice, and even though it's against the law, it's not usually prosecuted by the police. 

Everyone from many of my teachers to my grandparents to my friends to even the doctors and local police department knew about this abuse. Nobody did anything. Nothing. I'd show up to school with wounds and scars but that wasn't special enough to take notice for the teachers. After all, so many kids showed up to school with injuries. 

At age 16, I was suspended from my school for being an atheist. My crime was that I'd openly claimed to be an atheist hence threatening the faith of fellow students. It was legal for them to kick me out for this reason as I learned later. 

About a year ago, I went to one of India's largest cities in search of an internship. I talked to at least 30 different landlords and I was denied accomodation on the grounds that I was not a vegetarian. I was told landlords routinely go through your garbage to see if it has eggshells/bones etc. and this is normal practice. 

Last month, I moved into an apartment in what's arguably the most progressive part of the country. My landlord lives just downstairs. To my horror, two weeks ago, I discovered that my landlord regularly beats his three year old child. I'd just assumed that the frequent screams I hear was just his temper tantrums until that point. I could see one day whilst the kid was playing outside that his legs were full of scars, just as mine were twenty years ago. 

So I do the morally right thing, and call the cops. I was furious. 

It was a bit difficult to get to the department that deals with child protection, but after about an hour of talking to different people, I get there. And the child ""welfare"" department advised me to don't make a fuss for my own sake since ""the landlord could kick me out"" of the apartment. The cop promises a welfare check that never arrived. 

I'm fucking done. Fucking done! I lived under the impression that society would gradually improve slowly but no, it's every bit as bad as it always has been. No, I will not live the rest of my life in this country. I will not subject my kids if I ever have them to this god awful society. I'd rather not have a life at all than have a life in India. 

Here's what I believe I have going for me : 

1. In about 6 months, I will have a bachelor's degree in Industrial design specialising in Furniture and interior design. I have built a design portfolio and didn't have much trouble finding work in Indian cities. I wouldn't know how I would fare in foreign job markets. I can share my portfolio if anyone asks. 

2. What I believe to be reasonably good proficiency in English.

3. About 2000 euros. It might be possible to acquire quite a bit more. 

4. I have spent one semester in Germany on an exchange programme. Maybe that'll look good on my resume? Those were the happiest days of my life. 

5. Ready to learn another language. 

What I don't have working in my favor:

1. I do not believe I can work in any major Indian city. I'm neither mentally nor culturally prepared for that. Even if were to work and save up in India, and even if I had a high paying job, it would take me years to save up any reasonable amount because the rupee is so weak. 

2. My university has a very stringent grading policy. This means that my grades when compared to students from other universities will look bad, even though they are pretty decent for my university. 

I need an out. Desperately so. Can I seek asylum in any country? Maybe I can find work in another country and emigrate? Maybe I can go to another country for further education and then stick around after graduation and eventually become a citizen? I would rather not live at all than have to live in this country.

Sorry if this post is too grim and perhaps spoiled your mood. I'm looking for advice. I just couldn't think of any less grim way to put my situation across. 

I'm sorry, kid. I can't help you. What can I do if even the police don't care? I can't save all the children being abused, but I hope to save my future children. 

Please help.

TLDR; Young bachelor's student who'll soon be graduating fed up with his country's conservative, regressive society desperately looking to emigrate as soon as possible."

I'm currently in my last year of Master's in business analytics, and I've signed a full-time contract starting from September at a chemical manufacturing firm as a Data Analyst. I thought it would be nice to do something in the meantime, so I applied for some summer student jobs & internships. BTW I'm based in Europe where internships are pretty much unpaid. 

Right now I have two offers to choose from: student job at a bubble tea shop, or 3-month internship in Data Analytics at a Big 4. I never had any professional experience in full-fledged data analytics (dashboard, etc.) so I thought the internship is great for me to prepare for the job in Sept and get another big name on my CV (I've had an internship before but unrelated to data analytics). This internship is however unpaid, whereas the student job would give me ±4k after the summer months.

Which do you think I should choose? Do you think the internship at Big 4 is worth it career-wise, or should I go for the summer job where I actually get paid for my time?"

Completed bachelors in 2016, at the time, I was interested in Entrepreneurship and wanted to start a business venture. Tried for 5 months, won competitions, pitched to investors, participated in workshops but couldn't raise funds. Then I got an employment offer from my University as I did an internship during my studies. It was an administrative job that slowly evolved into reporting but it didn't work either and I was let go in Dec of 2017. 2018 started and I resumed my entrepreneurship project, took me 8 months but I managed to launch the business and scale it on a good level. But then Covid came and I had to stop everything.  
  
In 2021, I launched a digital agency with some friends but the partners weren't good so halfway through 2021 I had to leave. For the meantime, I resumed by business because the lockdown was lifted and I scored a gig for content production. By then end of 2021, I was managing my photo booth company, content production projects and freelance consulting which brought me back to startups. So I end up working as a generalist for a startup from Jan 2022. We were about to raise but due to a disagreement between the founders, the opportunity blew and I had to leave the company in Sept. Took me a couple of months but ended up in a Software house.  
  
It has been 5 months now and I haven't been able to find my footing. I am interested to work as a remote closer and exploring opportunities, as I see it as a potential fit for me. But it's conflicting with my job at the moment. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to produce any results. Due to a number of reasons that are genuinely beyond my control. I am trying my best, I do see good growth opportunities but I am not sure it aligns with my values. I feel like there is too much to compromise including my integrity. Yes I am thankful to my employer for helping me out and finding me a place in their organization but it eats me that I haven't been able to show anything for it and that the culture and the practices are in conflict with my values.  
  
I am 30, and professionally as a generalist and founder, I have gone through much. I don't mind working 9-5, under a boss. I am just not sure and uncertain about where am I gonna end up!  
  
TBH I have lost motivation and hope, economic conditions are getting worse, so getting a paycheck is still considered lucky. I do have a job offer from another company but I haven't explored the opportunity yet, just don't want to stuck from one place to another. I feel like it's tiring, I am low on energy and most importantly, I am uncertain as to where do I fit in!"

As my LL has not received any rent relief yet, they reached out to my guarantor company, who informed me that if I have not paid x amount by May 25th then they will commence legal action against both me + parent. My prop. mgmt stated they will not renew my lease unless I pay the full amount due by May 26th. Prop. Mgmt and LL have both emailed to tell me that ERAP will only cover one month’s rent, though every time I speak w ERAP they state a decision has yet to be made. 

I’ve managed to scrap together the x amount minimum as stated by guarantor company, but am unable to complete the full balance atm. I spoke w a coworker who is familiar w ERAP, and they confirmed that it is unlikely that ERAP would only provide 1m of rental relief - particularly considering how long ago I applied. My primary worry was legal action from the guarantor company, so I’m somewhat less stressed that I am able to fulfill the minimum payment requirement. What I’m trying to figure out is if my PM/LL is continuing to bluff, or if they know sth that I don’t? 

I have had multiple people advise that I explain my situation (had to complete a 600hr/20-30h per week unpaid internship that is required for my degree, which I will be earning in the next couple weeks + my primary job has been continuously cutting our hours + I am actively applying for FT post grad positions) and hope for compassion. Though I don’t put much credence into this suggestion…

My parent has provided as much aid as they can. I have outsourced, created a GoFundMe, and applied for emergency assistance via my school. Would v much appreciate any advice that can be provided! Pls feel free to ask Qs if I’m missing any pertinent info."

In the summer of each year, we are required to do an internship.

\- first year an internship of 6 to 8 weeks to get acquainted with working in a professional environment.

\- second year an internship of 6 to 8 weeks to work on a project.

\- third year an internship of \~6 months to work on a thesis for graduation.

(I am not us or Europe based so I don't know if that is the norm or my country-specific)

In the last few days, I came to know that my uni offers a summer internship where they chose students to coach small children in simple programming tasks over the summer. this internship is convenient for me and has limited places to apply and the clock is ticking.

so my question is the following: do I apply for the school internship or do I look for one in an outside company (a professional work environment)?

which one would look better on my resume when applying to the second and third-year internships  
and later on when looking for jobs?"

During this time, I've gained hands-on experience in various areas such as backend development, mobile app development, and DevOps. I've had the opportunity to work with different languages and tools, and I genuinely enjoy the work. Plus, the compensation is pretty decent at $30/hr, along with some equity.  
However, I do have concerns about the potential resume value of this job compared to interning at well-known tech giants like Google or Microsoft. Since it's an early-stage startup that hasn't gained much recognition yet, I worry that it might not carry as much weight on my resume.  
So, here's the question: Should I invest time in grinding LeetCode and start applying for internships, or should I stick with my current job until I feel like I've reached my limit? It's important to note that I didn't have to go through a technical interview to secure this position, so my interview skills are not as polished as they could be. The extent of my DS&A knowledge is primarily based on the Data Structures course I took last semester.  
I'm seeking advice on whether pursuing internships at more prominent/reputable companies would be a better option or if I should continue with my current role. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

My first IT internship was with a charter school, where I imaged laptops, repaired them, set up accounts for new teachers, worked on help desk, and provided support whenever possible, from remoting into staff computers to changing things in Active Directory. I did this for 4 months during one summer. Right now, I'm currently in another internship with my city's department of education, started back in January this year. I'm more or less doing the same thing, although I haven't been granted access to things like Active Directory and don't have direct access to the help desk because my supervisors don't want mere interns messing around with any internal systems. Because of this, most of my support has been onsite, troubleshooting wherever I can. My internship's going to be coming to an end soon, so I've been searching for a real full time IT job for the past few months, applying for jobs like a madman. Problem is, I haven't gotten any hits so far. No interviews whatsoever. I already have my degree too. Am I doing something wrong? Did my internships not give me the right experience?

I am a Master’s Student in Europe. I did a BSc with a major in CS. I am a first generation college grad (my parents didn’t go to college). I have scholarships.

While I had very good grades during my 2 first of Bachelor, I had health issues that kept me away from campus, but was still able to validate the 3rd year of Bachelor and 1st year of Master. (Bachelors are in 3y in Europe)

Following that, I did a Research Internship at Stanford Medicine with an Associate Professor there, followed by another Research Internship at Harvard Medical School. Both went super good, and I have reference letters.

I want to apply to a Master’s degree at Stanford (or Harvard), but I suffer a lot from self censorship as I’m the first one in my family to attend college. The main problem here is that I think a lot about my GPA during the time I was sick : it went down from 4.2/4.33 (for two years) to 3.2/4 for three semesters. I have letters from my university saying that indeed I was sick and that I did my best to follow courses.

I know going to Stanford or Harvard for a Masters degree is very competitive, but I’d like your thoughts about my chance to get it with those elements.

For context, I am a rising junior going from community college to a T30 school. I have one past IT internship and am doing a defense SWE internship this Summer.

The internship this Summer is for a government base and is also a pipeline program into FTE; essentially I already have a guaranteed job out of college making about 70k. In addition, they have good benefits which I can reap starting now and they pay 50% tuition. 

All sounds good on paper, but the issue is I really don't like the place. It is extremely remote, uses a lot of old tech, I don't care for the people, and I am afraid that the career progression is fairly stagnant. In order to get the tuition assistance I have to sign on for 2 years of FTE after graduating.

I really would like to work at a company that fits my personality more and is in a bigger city, but from a financial perspective the government internship is quite good.

Regardless, I plan on applying hard this Fall and see what happens. Obviously if I get nothing else, I will return next Summer. But if I get something else of similar pay, I'm really torn on what I should do, especially in this market where jobs seem hard to get - a fulltime job guarantee as a sophomore is really stress reducing regardless of how much I dislike the place.

I'm quite new to freelancing so I'm not sure if this is normal.  
  
A few weeks ago, Company X discovered my work on Dribbble and reached out to me regarding a potential job opportunity. I was really excited since they pay is good. We had a conversation, and scheduled an interview. Then after a week the interview came and to me it really went well, I was able to justify my 4 month internship experience and I proved my portfolio speaks for my work. They added me to their Slack, their portal, signed a terms and conditions to be a part of their freelancing agency and it seemed like everything was progressing well. I thought its a bit fast since it was the same night the interview concluded but hey im hired so whatever right?

So we get to talking in slack, I asked as a freelancer i dont see a clause banning me from other clients outside their company, they said yes since ill only be working part time whenever a project comes, they asked me my CV and I provided it.

Here's where things get strange, just a day later, I received a message saying that their hiring manager ordered them to remove me from their system and they wished me the best in my future endeavors. I'm completely taken aback by this sudden dismissal without any explanation.  
  
I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. Could it have something to do with my CV and the relatively short internship experience? I really thought they are hiring based on portfolio and I'm really confused about the whole situation and would appreciate any insights or similar experiences from you guys.  
  
Have any of you had similar encounters with companies where things seemed promising at first but then took a sudden turn? Is this a thing as a freelancer? What steps would you recommend I take to understand the reasons behind their decision and how to move forward from here?  
  
Thanks in advance for your support and advice.

Sophomore year I got into a relationship, became incredibly lazy and shitty/unethical, and GF left me. I was incredibly needy and codependent/anxious avoidant attachment. I grew incredibly depressed for months on end, and pulled myself together again at the start of junior year and after a summer going to visit family.

I kept getting involved with girls and useless extraneous shit for fun and lost the incredible self-discipline I once had. Also had incredible hubris and overconfidence that I could get stuff done at the last second, and ultimately did terrible on exams.

\- LOR 3 from Doctor I shadowed - 8.5/10 - He's a family friend so the letter should be decent. I've known him for a long time outside of shadowing, so he may mention some of my personal qualities.

Essays:  
Either through supplementals or the common app essay, I want to write about how OA is extremely genetically prevalent within my family and how it has affected the people around me, even leading to a complete loss of mobility for some of my family members.

Yeah, I know... It's a lot of schools. I aim to cut down my list to around 30 schools, but I'm in a situation where I don't qualify for aid and my parents will not contribute anything (unless its a BSMD) because I already have the Florida Bright Future Scholarship that will allow to me attend any in-state school for free. I really want to go out of state, so please give me some suggestions for schools that give decent merit scholarships.

13kobh4,26,2023-05-18,Passed Security+ !!,King_Ananas,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/13kobh4/passed_security/,"Hey all! I just passed the SYO-601 with a 783 and wanted to give my input on resources I used and thoughts on the exam.

**My background**: I have an A+ cert and a JAMF 100 cert. I'm starting my senior year of college for Computer Engineering Technology. I work in IT as an intern helping manage end devices on the back-end (nothing too technical though). I've also been into computer building and repair for years.

&#x200B;

**Study Resources and thoughts**:

* Gibson's Get Certified Get Ahead (GCGA) Book: Great book for a general introduction on the topics. It receives high praise and I understand why. BUT, you may need to dig deeper on concepts you are less sure about. Also, since it's a book, it may be a bit harder to focus on. I know I had to break it down into 1.5 weeks (\~1 chapter/day). My only genuine complaint about this book is that the topics are all out of order compared to the CompTIA objectives. I wanted to follow along with Messer's videos while I read each chapter but it was very difficult. I'd have to watch like 1/4th of a video to keep on track. Unrealistic to do it this way IMO.
* Messer's Security+ Playlist: Good, classic, and worth the hype. He goes over almost everything you need to know and doesn't fluff his videos. This does however mean you are going through a lot per video. But, the exam has a lot so you can't complain. Again, you may need to look into things if they confuse you.
* Messer's Security+ Notes: Great to follow along with as you watch the videos. Bit difficult to read standalone as much of the context is missing if you don't watch the accompanying videos.
* Google: You'll need more info on stuff no matter what resource you use. Some things will make less sense that others. Just be careful to not fall down a rabbit hole of information not required for the exam. Remember that this is an ""entry-level"" security cert.

&#x200B;

**Practice tests**:

* Messer(practice tests and study groups): Great for measuring your readiness. Found the multiple choice to be very similar to the actual exam. Though the PBQ's were a bit simplistic compared to what I got on the actual exam.
* Dion: In my experience, terrible for confidence but decent for learning. There is a lot on his exams that is not listed in the objectives (taken from other certs). Scored lower on his exams that Messer's but felt that it was under-representative of my knowledge. Also, VERY wordy compared to the actual exam. But it will help you gain a feeling for the vague-ness of a CompTIA exam.
* GCGA end of chapter quizzes/final test: Decent wrap-up of things you just learned. Questions are asked very specific to the book and not the question style of the actual exam. Not to say these were bad; they are just not very good practice tests to ready you for the style of the exam. Just how well you absorbed info from the textbook.
* ExamCompass: Good for knowledge but WAY too in depth and technical. Actual exam will not be this direct. Feels like trivia more than an actual practice exam. But, it's free so you can't knock it too hard. 

&#x200B;

**Scores on practice exams**:

* Messer: 84/93/89. Got almost all right answers on the study groups.
* Dion: 71/72/78/77/85/86
* ExamCompass: 80-90 on almost all of the exams (some lower some higher).
* GCGA: 13-14/15 on most end of chapter quizzes. Mid 90's on the final exam.

&#x200B;

Final thoughts and tips:

* Base your readiness on the objectives. None of the practice exams were perfect. How confident you feel about the objective topics is a good indicator of how ready you are.
* Be ready for context-based questions. There will be no direct ""What is X term"" but you will need to know what X term is to answer the question.
* Find good PBQ resources. I kind of felt lost on the PBQ's. None of the practice exams prepped me too well. But that could have been bad luck since there's a large pool of questions.
* Learn to read logs at a bit more of a technical level. Basic ""well if it has '..\\..\\... its a directory attack"" won't be enough. Know what to do to protect against those attacks as well as what they actually do.
* Don't spam practice tests. Use them sparingly as it's very difficult to retake them without just remembering the correct answers. Use one, go back to the objectives, take another, go back to the objectives, etc. They are good to plug gaps in knowledge though.  

* In my experience, like many others, I felt like I was failing the entire time. This seems to just be a trend in CompTIA's mysterious grading system. 
* Try to relax(duh). Easier said than done, I know. But freaking out will make you second guess yourself and make dumb mistakes. Finding a good way to relax for before and during the exam.
* Try to focus on moving through the exam instead of being 100% sure of each answer. The PBQs take up A LOT of time and you can always flag for review at the end. 

&#x200B;

I wish everyone luck through their journey! I'd be happy to answer any other questions."
13koz3k,1,2023-05-18,Looking for internship,ArtisanWinds,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/13koz3k/looking_for_internship/,"Hi.

I have been learning webdev on my own. I have learned a good deal of html css and Javascript using the resources available online (odin project, freecodecamp mozilla javascript reference, codewars (kyu 3 in javascript)).

Why a internship and not just crrating my own projects? I am the kind of person who needs pressure and be held accountable for tasks. I won't go very far on my own or ""freelancing"" just yet. So i need to work for someone else's project and not my own, just yet.

So if you have something to offer, or know of an opportunity like this, I would appreciate if you point me in the right direction."

13kqlvh,5,2023-05-18,Coworkers making jokes about me being quiet,ronnieveroni,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/13kqlvh/coworkers_making_jokes_about_me_being_quiet/,"I've progressed a lot the last year regarding my social anxiety. I'm trying so hard to accept who I am, not be worried about my personality and how others see me.

I am not as anxious as before, but still, when I'm with new people I don't open myself up right away. It's like I'm assessing what kind of a person they are and if I could be comfortable around them. Therefore I'm more quiet than usual, than with my friends.

Anyways, I am currently doing my internship and I work in an office with 3 older men (around 40). I don't have a lot in common with them and I don't find most of their jokes funny. And frankly I'm not good at banter with anyone for that matter, I just don't know what to say back. I've talked about myself a bit and asked some questions, but I don't really instigate conversation, because they drain me and I already have to be there for 8 hours. And when it's quiet for a long time, it feels like it's my responsibility to be entertaining. Next to them, not feeling comfortable the whole time, like I can't relax. It's exhausting.

So today, one of them said sarcastically (in a joking way, didn't say it maliciously): god, you are so annoying, you are always talking, always asking questions. He meant the exact opposite. And I don't know if I should take it in a good or a bad way. Because to me being quiet is bad.

I feel this guilt for not being more proactive, but I'm not used to asking questions. I don't even know what to ask (because I'm very self critical and have suppressed my thoughts and emotions for a long time, that's a story on it's own), let alone want to voice them. I frankly don't even have a desire to interact with them, I am working on an assignment they gave me and  I just want to do my thing.

And I truly want to learn and get new experiences and connections, that's why I'm doing an internship, but when I'm here all I want is to leave and have all of this be over with. I have one more week.

Anyways, I'll be fine, it's just frustrating and confusing sometimes."

I’d greatly appreciate it if anyone who’s familiar with the international experience, be it personally or from a friend, could shed light on this matter. 

Since the biggest appeal of Waterloo to me is the job placements, if this turns out to be not as good for international students I might consider attending university elsewhere before trying for postgrad in the US. Thanks in advance!"

I have recently started looking for internships. During my 2nd year in college, I did an internship at a company as a Android developer, and then after that I stopped looking for new opportunities because I had planned to learn more computer technologies in my 3rd year.

Now that my 3rd year has almost come to an end, I am looking for opportunities to work, and I got a text message from my previous boss (from the last company that I worked for). I am a little confused whether I should accept the offer or reject it.

My main doubt is that if a re-join that company as an Android Developer, would it be beneficial for me in my career in the long run?

13kwtvc,4,2023-05-18,MEng or MSc for not-so-rich folks,Wide-Bit-9215,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/13kwtvc/meng_or_msc_for_notsorich_folks/,"Hello everyone! Sorry for the long post. I’m a first-year international student from Kazakhstan, studying at the University of Bristol and pursuing an MEng degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Currently, due to my international fee status, I’m paying £20k per year (with a scholarship) for my education, which poses a significant financial burden for my family. Although we can afford to cover the costs of my course for the first three years, we will have to sell some of our property to pay for the final year (we have already sold some to cover my first year). This is the reason why I’m considering switching my course from MEng to BEng and then pursuing an MSc/MRs degree at a more renowned institution (potentially) with a full-ride scholarship (not guaranteed but possible). Since I will receive no more financial aid for my undergraduate degree, going for a postgraduate degree makes additional funding possible.

On the other hand, I have the opportunity to embark on a year abroad or a year in industry during my MEng years. These options would reduce my tuition fees by 50% and 75% respectively. Choosing either of these paths could greatly alleviate my financial predicament and enable me to cover the entirety of my four-year tuition.

I have no intention of pursuing academia, and I'm certain that if I secure a position in a reputable company during my BEng years, I won't pursue a Master's degree. The only reason I want to obtain a Master's degree is to increase my chances of landing a job after graduation. Therefore, I am seeking answers to the following questions from Redditors:

1. In the engineering job market, how valuable is a Master's degree? Is it possible that I won't need it at all?

2. Are there significant differences between MEng and MSc in terms of job prospects?

3. For a well-rounded international student with a first in each year, some decent projects and internships, how difficult is it to obtain a full-ride scholarship for a Master's degree at a top 50 university (using QS ranking as the primary metric to provide a general idea)?

4. Finally, should I stay on my current course (MEng) or go for a BEng/MSc combo?

I appreciate your help! This is very important to me :)"

I too like many other CSE students made the mistake of taking the easy route to development and learned the MERN stack. Now I'm having difficulty finding internships due to the sheer competition in MERN. 

One of the reasons my applications get rejected is that my projects are not strong enough. Almost everyone has the same E-commerce website, XYZ clone, or a basic CRUD application. What can I do make myself stand out?

And if your advice is to build higher quality projects with the same ideas, could be so generous as to point me to some you know? Or at least elaborate what features a high quality project has.

Also, if there's any particular project that got you hired as a Web developer, I'd love to know about that."

I have two DS internships and a few years experience as an analyst. 

My boss seems to have a lot of faith in me and has been very pleased with my work during my tenure here, which is great. I enjoy being relied on and feel a sense of pride knowing I’m a team member my boss goes to when he needs a reliable person.

I have been asked to sit in on meetings with other team members of similar seniority as a means of making sure projects are going smoothly and others are not steering a sinking ship. I am also responsible for scheduling and leading meetings independently with stakeholders while leading certain aspects of projects.

Like I mentioned before, I enjoy this level of responsibility and it has definitely helped me sharpen my skills as an IC, but it is starting to feel as if the responsibilities and tasks that are asked of me exceed those of someone with a junior title.

I’d love to hear thoughts on this from people who have dealt with moving through the stages of junior DS -> DS -> senior DS and so on, and also managers who have an idea of what is expected of an IC at each stage.

Should I take note of all of the responsibilities and tasks given to me that might be exceeding my seniority level/pay grade to leverage a possible promotion (or at least size-able raise) towards the 1-year mark of working in my current role? Am I completely wrong in assuming these responsibilities and tasks are those of someone with more seniority?

Side note: my boss has explicitly stated to me that I am more reliable and talented as a DS than a recent hire onto our team of someone with more seniority than I (although we both report directly to the same manager). This new team member claims to be a senior DS, but I am unsure of what the internal title is, and they also have a higher salary than I (the DSs on our team discussed our comp packages recently). 

I appreciate any feedback!"

I started my GIS career in the late 90's with a paid internship and then in 2000 I started my first job as an Analyst.  The pay back then was in the $40K/year range.  Six years later I left the private sector to enter the public sector where I made a very similar salary. Since 2006, my salary has increased 156%, which is I'm extremely grateful for.  

I am employed as a GIS Analyst for a City in the South that has a population between 250-300K. Aside from my GIS role, I also build and maintain an array of databases for our management staff.  

My questions to you, if you are willing to participate, are, what is your salary, what is your role and how long have you been employed in that role and what part of the US, or world, you live in?  Also, and most importantly, what sector, private or public.

Just trying to get a sense of what salaries are like around the country and who pays more, public or private.

Some info about me:

**Education**: 

* BS in a branch of engineering
* MS in a branch of physics
* (Soon) PhD in a natural science, but research is very physics/math heavy 

**Programming experience:** 

* \~10 years of Python, MATLAB, and R but Python is the one I use the most
   *  I have mostly used it for basic data analysis, plotting, etc. but have also co-wrote novel algorithms to model complex physical processes. 
* Recently took a grad level course in machine learning and became familiar with
   * scikit-learn for PCA, linear/logistic regression, clustering algorithms, random forests, SVM, etc.
   * PyMC3 for Markov chain Monte Carlo
   * Tensorflow for very basic neural networks

**Other experience:** 

* I have dabbled in SQL to get some exposure to it
* During my BS I did a summer internship doing back-end web development in Django. I'm definitely not very interested in doing web dev but I really love working with data - from cleaning it to processing it and gaining insight from it, its definitely been my fav part of graduate school. 
* In the current lab I work in, I am (informally) the ""data guy"" and have written a lot of scripts to get data from our instruments into forms that the professors/grad students can easily work with. Before this, they were reducing everything by hand using Excel (which takes hours) so this is work that I feel proud of. 

I feel like I may be able to make the transition into Data Analytics from here but some people have told me I'd be overqualified for DA and should for DS positions instead. A lot of the job listings for data jobs are really vague (and I've heard the same job title can be vastly different from company to company) so I am not sure what I would qualify for. 

Any thoughts? Should I try to get some postdoctoral training through something like Insight Data Science or Data Incubator? Or would I be ok to just brush up on statistics and learn SQL/Tableau?"

I have always been bad with being in tune with my emotions (get it from my mother) and this week has been so heavy hitting and I am worred that I am not able to perceive the full caliber of the situation and what I feel. I have made it a goal to embrace everything and I have cried more in the past few days than I have in years. Damn does it feel so so good yet so so bad. Will be indulging in this action more often....

We are terribly worried for my Grandma, and if she does not recover, neither will my dad, who is already in a very sensitive state. I talk and cry with him almost every day, and I am worried that I will have to drop out of my last year of college in order to care for and make sure he doesn't do anything harmful. 

Without getting into context, I broke up with my GF last Spring Break, and I was okay until I wasn't. I saw her the day after coming home and it made me so angry and I couldn't deal with what I felt and exploded. I feel bad because I saw something she made for me as a gift for our 1 year and I tossed it away in my closet and I think I broke it. I don't want to retrieve it for the guilt I would feel if I were to see it in pieces. 

My mom told me out of the blue that they were getting a divorce and while I expected it coming, I never thought it would actually play through. We are all still living together and it is so hard actually facing the reality that this is the last month I will ever be under the same roof with both my parents for the rest of my life. Seeing my mom act like everything is fine, while my dad is just clawing up a cliff to stay sane is horrifying. To see someone so tortured and the other so benign is far worse than anything I have experienced in my life. I used to be like my mom, but I will NEVER let that happen again in fear of my partner entering the state my dad is in. I do not hate my mom by any means, but I will never become the hollow shell I perceive her as. 

&#x200B;

I am seeking guidance from this subreddit on how to deal with all of this. What are some of your experiences and anecdotes? I am doing well right now and am forward-looking with self-development and an internship starting soon. I am going to be more honest with people about my emotions and less leissez-faire about how I feel, and when I want to cry, I am going to cry."

I previously posted this in r/homelab and was advised to try posting here.I'm presently doing an internship with a small company (3 permanent employees) working in AR and immersive experiences. As a project, they have tasked me with building a NAS for their company. I'm a little out of my depth as my studies were mostly in IoT, so backend server building is not in my wheelhouse.

As a quick overview, budget is below 1500 CAD. Current available speeds are 10Gb/s LAN and 2.5 WiFi. One of the main issues I'll need to tackle is fast writing to the NAS so that large video files may be quickly shared throughout the office. In my opinion, this solution will require both SSDs as a first layer of memory, and HDDs for long term storage. (As an aside, the HDDs will also sync with Google Drive for additional memory safety.) 

I intend to use TrueNAS Scale to make this happen, but I've been advised that an Entreprise solution would be peferable as there'd be more support.

As such, I've put together a BOM that would be comparable to a high-end homelab, though it also seems like used Entreprise level hardware would be a better bang for our buck.

**What I need is a bit of input on the NAS build I have thus far, information on how best to set up the SSDs and HDDs for quick write speeds, but also opinions on alternatives, whether ECC is worth it, and how long term support after I've left will be best taken care of.**

Here is the build:

* Motherboard: ASUS Prime B550-PLUS AMD
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5600 (Will make sure it's the CPU and not APU)
* Power Supply: SeaSonic G650 80+ GOLD
* SSDs: WD Blue 3D NAND 2TB Internal SSD x2 - These will connect to M.2 (Was advised to get Entreprise Spec SSDs, and to choose between one of the other)
* HDDs: WD Red Plus 4TB x4 - These will be mirrored and striped
* Case: Antec Value Solution Series VSK4000E-U3 ATX Mid-Tower
* RAM: NEMIX DDR4-3200 PC4-25600 ECC Unbuffered 2Rx8 x2 (Was advised to drop the ECC requirement and get more RAM)
* Fans: Noctua NF-A9 (Was advised against these as they're not powerful enough)
* Network: Asus ATX11000, so up to 10Gb/s"

I can extend my graduation and do a boot camp but that will take an unnecessary long time (a semester in WGU is 6 months and the classes are self based progress so doing a boot camp while working on my degree will be hard), doing an internship will beuch easier and more practical for my situation, is there anyway to find companies that has internships or anything I should do more?

13ld1r4,1,2023-05-18,Am I lazy or just stupid?,neis_guy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13ld1r4/am_i_lazy_or_just_stupid/,"I (26M) recently got a job in the tech industry and moved to a completely new city. I’m fairly introverted and have always had problems with social anxiety, so after the move I haven’t made too many new friends. The job hasn’t been very busy either so I’ve had a lot of time to reflect on my life.

Backstory (this may be long) -
I first went to college to get a degree in aviation. I have a few pilots in my family, and as a kid that was always my answer to “what do you want to be when you grow up?” I knew right away though that my heart wasn’t “in it.” But I also knew that a lot of people weren’t always happy in their jobs all the time, so I decided to try and stick it out. After two years it became too hard for me to keep up. I was starting to sleep through classes and miss flight blocks. The material I was learning just didn’t seem to stick. I got to the point where I needed to apply all of the classroom learning from the previous few years in order to get my commercial license, but it felt like my mind was drawing blank after blank. It was like everything that I had learned just dropped out of the back of my head. Eventually the failure became to much for me, and I didn’t think it was possible for me to ever excel at it, so I dropped out.

I ended up transferring to a new college the next year. The first semester at the new school I took a variety of different subjects to see what piqued my interest. Intro to nursing, horticulture, philosophy, and media production. I chose media production, a decision I’ve come to regret. I somehow thought I would magically become this world renowned writer/director, but I never actually finished any polished script or worked on any projects outside of what was required for class. And what I did complete, I was never that proud of, so I never showed it off to anyone or submitted it to any kind of festival. I graduated with an overall gpa (including the first college) of 3.2. So I thought I must at least be somewhat capable. But I never did any internships or anything like that to make myself stand out in any way. There was a chance I could have worked on a pretty legit film with one of my professors immediately after graduating, but since I graduated in the spring of 2020, that got scrapped.

During the pandemic I moved back in with my mom, since I had no job and very little promise of getting one. I tried doing my own freelance multimedia work, but since I didn’t have a reel to show off, practically nobody would hire me. I started doordashing to make some extra money, but most of my days consisted of wallowing in existential dread and numbing the pain with alcohol. But I stayed passably optimistic, because I had a lot of people around me that supported me.

About a year later, I heard about software engineering bootcamps. This initially appealed to me because I thought it would be cool to live the “digital nomad” life and travel around in a van. And most of the bootcamps promised well paying jobs at a pretty high placement rate. I got into the first one I applied for, and did relatively well. Last June I got my first job offer and took it right away, but they required me to move to a different state. Which catches us up to where I am now.

The job has been a joke. It’s consulting, but I’m salaried. I haven’t been placed on a project yet. So basically, I’ve been getting paid to do nothing. Well, not “nothing” exactly. They offer trainings to grow your skills, and the end of last year they had required ones for me to take. But since the start of this year, it’s been really open-ended. I’m kind of left to my own devices and trusted to continue to learn. And that’s where I’ve started to realize what a POS I really am. I’ve barely spent a single full day learning anything new. I mostly just smoke a bunch of pot, play video games and go to the gym. I started relearning guitar, but I even got burned out just on that.

My job finally got a little more organized recently and set a couple of goals for those on the bench like me to hit. Basically I need to take a series of certifications based off of the stuff I should have been studying. After taking and failing the first one, I’ve come to an unsatisfactory conclusion about myself.

I’ve finally realized that this is just the cycle that I go through. I show some small amount of interest in something, try to start learning about it, but get too frustrated/lost that I give up. I went to a psychiatrist a few years ago and was diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve been taking adderall ever since, but the underlying problem still seems to persist. I started seeing another psychiatrist this year because the depression of this realization hit me pretty hard.

I’ve never had a girlfriend, never stood out in any crowds, lived with my mom for a big chunk of my 20s, and have squeaked by in life by being “passable.” Everything I try, I somehow feel like I’m simultaneously doing the bare minimum needed to “pass” but also giving it everything I’ve got. I look back on days where I didn’t do much other than zone out for hours on end and I still feel exhausted. Like my tank is empty but the gauge says full. I wish I had the motivation that some people seem have to learn. Maybe I just don’t care about myself enough. Nothing seems to really excite me enough to stick with it. And what makes me feel worse is that I’ve had all these opportunities to excel, but failed at every single one of them.

My entire life has felt like that feeling you get when you read a page of a book then realize your brain wasn’t actually retaining it, only I don’t have the option to reread it. I’ve tried to blame it on lack of motivation or mental illness, but I think the truth is I’m just stupid. Or maybe I’m so lazy that I don’t even realize it. Has anyone else felt like this, and have you found a good way to get out of the rut or even just accept yourself better? I’m tired of this feeling that I’m just letting life happen to me, but I’ve never seemed to have it in me to really right the ship and take control of my own destiny."
13ldrzt,1,2023-05-18,Should I quit?,AbbreviationsDismal2,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13ldrzt/should_i_quit/,"I think I hate my job

I got a government job as an intern through my local college in November, and ever since then I've become a depressed insomniac. 

This job pays well for where I live. When I first got this job, my parents were very proud and told me how jealous everyone is (I hate that response) because it's so hard to get ""in"". I'm always told ""you can retire here"", and I feel quite literally sick when I hear that. 

I only work 2/3 days a week, yet I am bored 80% of the time. I sit all day at a computer. No one I work with is my age. It may be my own negativity, but I swear my boss treats me as if I'm incompetent. I use to work 4/5 even 6 days weeks at all my previous jobs - they were all more physically/mentally demanding too. Something about this job literally keeps me up at night. 

I'll go to sleep by 10, and I will be up every two hours until it's 7am and I have to get ready for work. It's exhausting, to say the least. I'm taking sleep studies with my doctors, but I think the underlying issue is that I'm not happy as an accountant intern. 

I'm only 24 but I feel so anxious to leave a job I've barely been at for a year. 

Does anyone have any advice? I think I already know what I need to do, but sometimes having a stranger's opinion helps put things further into clarity. 

Thanks in advance..."

13lgpqb,0,2023-05-18,Any realistic chance of getting into top math/cs master’s programs with multiple C’s and B’s junior year?,throwaway173738387,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/13lgpqb/any_realistic_chance_of_getting_into_top_mathcs/,"I'm a rising senior at a top US public school well-known for math. I'm getting ready to apply to master's programs in applied math/cs/biostats/computational science in the US and UK, but junior year did not go well for me.

Due to two health scares both semesters consisting of multiple doctor visits and hospital stays, my junior year looked like this:

First semester:

* Data structures and algorithms (C+)
* Probability theory (graduate level, C+)
* Honors analysis on multiple variables (B+)

Second semester:

* Complex analysis (graduate level, B)
* Nonlinear dynamics and chaos (B+)
* Stochastic processes (graduate level, withdrew. Would've passed with a C+ if I didn't lol)
* Math research class, few more details on this later (A)

My GPA dropped from a 3.83 to a 3.67 (math 3.86 to a ~3.5), which isn’t a bad grade but it’s definitely a big drop. I know I have an official explanation, but even though I’m fully recovered I’m afraid that grad programs will see me as a liability who isn’t physically fit to handle school. Also, half of the programs I'm applying to have deadlines before the end of my next semester, so I won't be able to show an improvement in my grades. Maybe it's worth noting I got A's in calculus, single variable real analysis, and linear algebra.

I'm only applying for master's programs, since I'm super passionate about the research I've done and what I study, but my interests are still very broad and I don't feel ready to commit to a PhD. This means that the programs I'm applying to are not funded. By top schools, I mean that the only schools my parents will pay for are (bruh):

* Ivies
* MIT
* Stanford
* CMU
* UChicago
* Berkeley
* Oxford
* Cambridge
* University College London
* Imperial College London

**Other aspects of my application that may or may not help**

* I am a domestic straight middle-class white male
* Did pure math DRP sophomore year, made me realize I don't like pure math
* This past semester I did a semester-long research program at my school in an applied math/cs field I'm interested in, being mentored by a postdoc. No publications but there was a poster session and final report (this is the one I got an A in)
* Recently published my first paper in another one of the applied math/cs fields I'm interested in but there were 7 other co-authors lol
* No paid math REUs
* TA for calc 3 for one semester
* Math tutor for calc 1-3 and lin alg since sophomore year
* Currently doing a Data Science Internship at a top investment bank
* Went to math club every week but had no leadership roles
* Launched a tech startup with some friends \~2 years ago, all of whom either dropped out or already graduated (except me lol), we've done 100k+ in revenue and are valued at 20M from VC backing
* Worked at a summer camp to teach sports to children during my freshman summer, maybe not relevant
* Rec letters will be very good from research advisor (He went to one of the schools listed) and nonlinear dynamics prof (even tho I only got a B+). 
* Will have taken 9 math/cs grad classes by the time I graduate, including the ones i screwed up this year lol

Please give me the harsh truth! I can take it because if I don't get into any of these programs I'll not waste my time on applications and just head straight to industry lol"
13lgsyo,1,2023-05-18,What is the average internship like?,muffinhater69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13lgsyo/what_is_the_average_internship_like/,"I'm a junior in high school planning to major in CS and become a software engineer. I know being a software engineer definitely isn't as glamorous as it's made out to be on sites like TikTok, but I'm wondering about internships- I hear people brag about paying tuition solely with their summer internship money, getting free housing when they relocate, etc. and I want to know how accurate that is. What should your expectations be when getting an internship (especially as say, a freshman or sophomore in college versus a junior or senior)?"

13lhpnk,1,2023-05-18,Continuous Improvement and Coping with ADHD: Any strategies for further learning of technical skills?,usa4cc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13lhpnk/continuous_improvement_and_coping_with_adhd_any/,"**TL;DR: It's difficult to improve my skills because most resources are oriented towards beginners. Furthermore, it's really difficult with ADHD when I don't have the structure of a book that I can follow cover-to-cover, or when my brain gets bored from one thing and wants to learn an unrelated technology.**

Hello. I graduated college a year ago with a computer science degree, and have since been trying to improve my software engineering and technical skills. However, I've run into a couple of hiccups and am wondering if anyone has any advice. A bit of background information about me:

Prior to my computer science degree, I was a self-taught programmer. I wrote my first line of code when I was fourteen, and shortly after read a couple of books cover-to-cover; the primary foundation of my software engineering journey: First, I read Bart De Smet's *C# Unleashed*, and then *WPF 4.5 Unleashed* by Adam Nathan. These were massive, well-written 1700 and 800 page books, and kinda covered everything from the standpoint of an advanced beginner or early intermediate.

In college, we went over the foundational concepts of computer science like Big O Notation, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs. We discussed various algorithms, like Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm, BFS and DFS, probably Nearest Neighbor heuristic, etc. I also took a couple of courses in software engineering, including Quality Assurance and Requirements. However, a lot of my University's computer science classes, while they covered a lot of the essential concepts, lacked the depth present at more prestigious institutions like MIT or Stanford.

Furthermore, most of my knowledge prior to University was in one specific now outdated technology; I lacked depth and even experience in a modern stack. The only other experience I have is a web admin position for a startup that used Wordpress, an internship from my last semester, and then a couple of jobs after graduating. The first job entailed a training program which included something like 144 video hours of learning Java as well as Java EE which is no longer used. Plus, numerous hours of software engineering concepts. I completed the training path, never even used Java for the position, and got a new job at the beginning of the year. In my current role, I have a lot of free time and with my manager's permission read *Clean Code* and *Clean Architecture*, by Bob Martin. I feel like it solidified my understanding of quality code both on the design and implementation levels. I've also taken a couple of courses on FreeCodeCamp throughout the past year, to improve my web knowledge and try to fill in some of the gaps. However, I feel like though I have a solid breadth of understanding across several technologies and languages, I lack the depth which I'd like to have.

In light of that, I have a few questions:

**First, should I try to spend more time focusing on Algorithms and Data Structures?** I bought Steven Skiena's *Algorithm Design Manual* and try to improve my skills when I can, but I certainly couldn't write out Prim's Algorithm, for example, from scratch.

**Second, upon covering the foundations of software engineering and/or a particular programming language, how do you grow your skills in that area?** It's difficult for me, because most of the resources out there seem to be courses for beginners. Every time I take two steps forward, I'm taking three steps backward, because so much of the concepts have already been covered. I want to work smarter, not harder.

This might be further complicated by my ADHD: a) it's really difficult to focus when I don't have structure. At the beginning, it was easy, because I could just read a book cover-to-cover. But at this point, there are less (well-written, extensive) programming books out there, programming languages and frameworks are constantly changing, and it's difficult to know where to go next when most resources are geared toward beginners. b) My brain gets bored and wants to focus on something new, like a new technology. This kind of lends itself to learning a bit of everything and furthermore, my brain goes into freeze mode where I don't know what to do next.

**So lastly, does anyone have recommendations or strategies for coping with ADHD in software engineering?**

Thank you!!!"
13likqe,1,2023-05-18,dads suck sometimes,pnpplkay,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/13likqe/dads_suck_sometimes/,"(for context, we’re south asian brits - i’m 20f and my dad is 57m. long rant & on mobile - apologies for those who read through to the end.)

i don’t want to resent my dad but he makes it hard not to. i didn’t want to go to university straight after college, but my dad would never allow a gap year. i didn’t want to do university at all really, i would have gone down an apprenticeship route, but my dad believes university is the only route to go down. i didn’t want to do law, but of course, i didn’t really have a choice if it wasn’t law or medicine. “do whatever you want …. but do law.” “sure we can go to this open day, but let’s leave after we attend the law talk.” he’s drilled into my brain to become a barrister from when i came out of the womb, so i kind of expected this. it was incredibly surprising that he allowed me to go an exchange as i’m an only child, a girl, and muslim, but then i realised why - it was for bragging rights.

he is very much the type of person to do things for the sake of appearances and what other people will say. he’s not rich but skimped and splurged on a nice car, and he loves samsung but uses an iphone, all because he needs people to think he has money.  i argued with him for months on end to let me get a job because i needed the money and he didn’t have it, and he wouldn’t allow any work unless it was law related because what if other people saw me working at a tesco? oh what shame it would bring to the family! which is how i got stuck at an awful law firm for two years. he recently got a new job purely because he didn’t want other people to think bad about his line of work for when i get married in the future (marriage - another concept he’s been forcing upon me since young.) so it wasn’t long before i came to the realisation that he just wanted other people to know that his daughter was studying in singapore, he doesn’t actually care beyond that. 

for the last few years he’s been constantly reminding me about the lpc/sqe (for non-uk/non-law oriented redditors, just consider this as law school you complete post getting your degree in order to qualify as a solicitor/lawyer.) during this time i’ve also been reconsidering what i enjoy in life and whether i want to spend my entire future doing law and i’ve decided to try and move out of it as much as i can. to the point of the rant: he asked me again yesterday whether i had applied for the sqe and i told him clearly that i wanted to take a year break - i’ve been in education for my whole life and graduate in july. i need and deserve some rest before continuing, especially as someone who hates and struggles to study in the first place. i also informed him that i hadn’t decided whether i was going to take it or not and i needed time to reconsider what i wanted to do. i wasn’t asking for his permission, i was just informing him. he shut it down completely and immediately - he’s not giving me a choice on whether i can do it or not, i apparently have to do it. he also refuses any time off, stating that he will not allow any breaks. 

i had to air the messages because if i responded i knew i would be mean, and i don’t want to be mean to him. i don’t intend on responding and should the conversation come up again, i just won’t acknowledge it. i can’t help being so frustrated. why do i need to be “allowed” to make decisions about my own life that affects no one but me? something that i have to do and no one else? something that affects my happiness? why don’t i deserve to make my own decisions? why am i only treated as an adult when i make mistakes but when it’s  decisions like these i’m too young and stupid? and for anyone wondering why i can’t just discuss the topic with him, i’m sure others can relate that there is no conversation when it comes to most south asian parents. extremely stubborn, entitled, and dismissive about what i have to say, even though this is about me. it’ll be a one sided conversation because he doesn’t know how to converse, only talk all over me and not listen or comprehend my opinions. he doesn’t believe anyone is correct except for him. same applies to my mum. i currently can’t talk to her about it because she’s ill and i don’t want to burden her further when she already has enough on her plate, but even if i did talk to her about it she wouldn’t be able to stand up for me. there’s no point in her trying because he doesn’t listen to what she has to say either - only when his sister or friends say anything he’ll bother to listen. 

i know i can’t blame him. he had a bad childhood and moving to england was his fresh start. he worked hard for me to provide me with a good life and has the immigrant mindset i can’t rid him of. i can fully acknowledge that while being angry and upset that he essentially wants my misery for the sake of looking a certain way to others or thinking that this is what’s best for me. i’m moving home in a couple of months and i’m dreading it because while i can do my best to avoid the topics of studying and marriage while abroad, i can’t avoid it when i’m home. especially now that his new line of work is a wfh role compared to his old one where he was out of the house six days a week. please wish me luck, i’m going to try and land some sort of internship or role. i’ll apply while i’m still here so i can have it ready for when i get back to england, and hopefully i’ll be so invested and successful in my work that i don’t have to consider doing law school. aghhhh"

New fall 2023 admit here! I was hoping for some advice with my course plan.

Some background: I am a May ‘23 CS grad starting a new job as a software engineer working on real-time software largely at the OS level for aviation. I am doing this program to learn more about CS topics that interest me, help support my career, and grow my skills for the new job, especially since working closer to hardware is a bit of an exciting pivot for me from my internships, both of which were doing backend and full-stack web development. 

Here are my courses that I thought could fulfill those purposes in a potential order:

GIOS 
AOS
HPCA
ESO
HPC
SICC
DC
AI
AI4R
GA

I was debating about subbing in ML or Mobile computing for AI4R or even possibly CV, but any feedback is appreciated!

Super excited to get started in the program!"

Hello r/MBA,

I hope this message finds you all thriving in your respective journeys. I'm currently wrapping up my first year at Sloan and, like many of you, am on the verge of stepping into my second.

I'm grappling with a situation, however, and would truly value input. Sloan, and MIT in general, offer a wealth of opportunities - from extraordinary courses to ground-breaking research projects, vibrant clubs, networking events, internships, and more. I can't help but feel that I'm barely scratching the surface of all there is to explore and learn here.

One of the solutions I've been considering is to extend my academic journey here at MIT (or another comparable institution) by pursuing a Master's in Engineering or another discipline (I mention engineering because of my background in it). The rationale behind this is twofold: firstly, to deepen my knowledge and expertise in a more technical field, and secondly, to give myself a larger window to make the most of all the opportunities on offer.

I see this as a possible path to cultivate a unique combination of business and technical acumen, which could potentially pave the way for future entrepreneurial endeavors.

However, I am also cognizant of the significant financial implications of this decision. While I am keen to extend my learning, I also have a projected MBA debt of $50K to manage. Extending my education would mean a delay in entering the workforce and starting to pay back this debt.

So, I turn to this knowledgeable community. Have any of you faced a similar dilemma? What factors did you consider? Do you think the added value of a more technical Master's degree and the extended access to elite-university resources justify the delay in income and the additional financial burden?

Any insights, experiences, or advice would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you for your time!"

I've always done great in my cs classes, but I have no personal projects and have only worked minimum wage jobs before.

There's also only 1 or 2 other woman who come into the office (the internship is Hybrid, 2 days in person and 3 days online), and I know the tech industry is like that, but it's just making me even more intimidated and worried about sounding dumb.

I'm from a good university in India, and I see the trend of most companies outright preferring female candidates over male candidates. I understand that the gender ratio in tech is pretty messed up, but why does a girl who knows nothing about CS and development with barely any interest in technology get a job/internship over me, with great ML and full stack projects? The companies I'm talking about are top tech/fintech giants from around the globe. (product based only)

Jealousy and negative emotions aside (NGL, I have a lot of them at this point.), I don't think this aids the advancement of Women-in-Tech. At this point, the bar is SO, SOOO much lower for women that it invalidates the hard work and efforts of the women (and men) who actually deserve the jobs.

I've noticed a trend after going through various hiring programs that when a guy is interviewing, the companies focus on tech and personality both, but when a girl is interviewing, the focus is significantly less on the former. For the same company, a male friend got an LC Medium B-trees question, while another female friend got an LC-easy (literally one of the first few every person does). Same bench of interviewers. The guy was able to explain the logic but missed a few test cases in the optimized solution, whereas the girl was (obviously) able to answer and got the internship. They guy had a history of UI/UX, Front-end web development, and Machine Learning. The girl was just getting started with HTML/CSS/JS, and had limited experience with data science (beginner). I have so, SO many more examples.

I know there will be people who'll just hate on me for commenting this (hence the throwaway), but I'm here with an open mind and would love to hear your thoughts."

I was forced to drop out before finishing my bachelor's back in 2015 and I've just worked in the family business ever since but not really ""officially"", so I don't have much verifiable experience in any field let alone IT.

Anyway, my financial life is in pretty bad shape and I want to go back to college now and finish a four year degree in some tech field, probably security. But the problem is when I look at all these current job offers for all different tech jobs, even for positions that are apparently ""junior"" or ""entry-level"", I see they all require like a year or more of experience, sometimes in very specific skills. The only ones that don't require experience are jobs that pay you like $15-$18 an hour, which really isn't what I'm looking for. I don't want to go back to college and then end up making the same wage I could get from a non-tech job that I can get today. I want to be able to graduate and get a decent job out of college, that's the whole point. Do I need to do internships or something while I'm getting my degree? I just don't know how to build this experience at this point in my life.

Am I gonna have to spend two years in college, and then also spend another 2-3 years (or maybe even more?) working for minimum-ish wage before I can get that nice tech job that everyone talks about? Even after I get the experience, I'm obviously not gonna be on the top of the application pile since I'd only have the minimal qualifications. It just seems like such a gamble to do this in my situation, like there's no security of landing a job whatsoever. Sorry for ranting a little but I have to explain my exact concern.

I have signed an offer for an internship at a good company (not well known, but has salaries at Google/Facebook level and I think the learning opportunity is a good one). The internship would start in July and last 3 months, with the possibility of receiving a full time offer if I perform well. I have also worked as a full time software engineer for a local outsourcing company during my last year of college, but left last month when I received this offer, in order to focus on my final graduation project.  
  
Last year, around this period, I had an interview with Google for a full-time software engineer (in another country). Weird that they wanted to interview me for full-time since I still had one year of college at the time, but anyway: I failed it at the time.  
  
To better understand the timeline, around 6 weeks ago, I emailed the recruiter because I saw some similar positions to the one I interviewed a year ago available at Google in my country, but got an automated email reply stating the recruiter is on PTO for a few weeks \*I attached my resume in this email\*. In the meantime, I have received the internship offer (after being in the process for 5 months and passing several rounds of interviews), accepted it and left my previous job at the oursourcing company. Today, the recruiter emailed me saying that she'll send my CV for review to a tech recruiter in my country.  
  
What should I do, considering I have an offer lined up? So far, I came up with these options:  
  
OPTION 1: Hide the fact that I signed another offer and if I interview and pass, renege the internship offer and take Google. If asked why I left in April my outsourcing job, maybe mention that I had an offer and the company reneged? (Thinking about a plausible answer to the question: ""Why did you leave your job with nothing coming up?"").  
  
OPTION 2: Email the recruiter mentioning my current status and send an updated resume. If I pass the Google interview, the results are valid for a year (this was mentioned by the recruiter), so I could ask if I can interview now, although I'm available to start only from October. This would mean that the current position I have applied for would be most likely filled and would have to pray they'll have entry level positions open in October.  
  
OPTION 3: Very similar to OPTION 2, email the recruiter, send updated resume and ""postpone"" the interview until, say September and see what positions are available then.  
  
OPTION 4: Update the recruiter on my situation but mention I would renege my internship offer for Google (I know, this sounds as a bad option, but it's still an option).  
  
Of course, if you have other options, I'm all years."

I applied 70-80 local companies in Indore, as no MNC is hiring and I thought I would have better chances this way , No luck from many of them , but I got 2 interviews and one of them went well but no response till now and has said to wait and other was disastrous for me and I am writing this now after coming out of the office.

They asked me to write SQL queries, design database,asked some weird algo which I haven't heard, asked my proficiency in react and told me they expect only someone who's already in good shape and don't need any training, said to come back after a month after learning it as they found my personality somewhat decent and matching to their culture, btw it was a small co/startup .

I am somewhat filled with confusion,guilt and frustration.

I did DSA and all interview related things with all my heart for 3 years 
But this shitty recession and pathetic luck killed me and my hopes.

I just wanted a job with some decent salary and a software developer role, so I can learn and be assured that working in this direction will lead to great heights 

But now I'm in a Fintech with some data analyst type of role , no development experience, dsa is getting rusty, and no hope I can ever switch to a SDE role in companies I dreamt of . I'm tired with learning and being in touch with DSA and interview related topics.

Please just give me advices to what to do now , I feel so unsatisfied within, I worked my best and now I'm feeling drained and but I'm still pushing myself from last 6-8 months.

And is the current tech I would be working on Python+ AWS+ something to do on data in a Fintech , does it have any future in comparison to SDE who grow exponentially ?? . And can I switch to a company in SDE role somehow given I can't start from 20-30k as I'm not powerful financially and my family would need my salary in coming 1-2 years."

Please help me. What can I even do?,SpirallingDownAgain,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/13lxnvx/just_got_my_bachelors_in_it_from_a_decent_school/,"I dropped out of school when I was 20 for a variety of reasons, namely that I wasn’t motivated. I failed a few classes too so my GPA was below a 2.0. But then COVID hit and I moved back in with my parents and decided to finally get my shit together. I reenrolled in school and switched my major from CS to IT, partially because it was easier but also because I got a D in data structures and couldn’t retake it. 

Since returning to school, I completed my entire major with a minor in critical intelligence studies without receiving a single final grade below an A. I’m not sure what happened in the past 5 years but school seems to have gotten a lot easier. Perhaps I’m just more driven. I developed a couple relationships with my professors and I have a couple potential networking opportunities via relatives, but ultimately I have no idea how to start my career. I took classes during all 4 seasons and moved over the summer so I wasn’t able to do any internships. I figured that wouldn’t be the end of the world but literally every single entry level job on the internet claims to require years of relevant work experience. Even call center requires at least one year of relevant internships despite requiring only a GED for education. How can I get a job if all entry level jobs require relevant work experience? I don’t want to waste time and energy getting discouraged by applying to a bunch of jobs that will automatically eliminate me since I don’t have experience. Please advise. Thank you.


Edit:
I checked out r/cscareerquestions and r/ITCareerquestions when I returned to school. I was worried this might be a problem since the consensus seems to be that employers want workers who know how to do the work, rather than employees who need to be taught how to do everything. And unfortunately, somehow, school or even certifications don’t really equate to work experience in this field. I did my best to give myself the best chance at success. Or at least I tried my best. I just want to know what my best course of action is from my current situation"

13m07jd,10,2023-05-19,Transitioning from CS to IT. You can do it!,TheBigBlack,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/13m07jd/transitioning_from_cs_to_it_you_can_do_it/,"I was a senior level undergrad student in a CS program at my local university. Over time I found that I absolutely hated software development. As a kid I grew up taking PCs and laptops apart and repairing them, sometimes even for extra cash and I really enjoyed it. When I got older my parents and mentors told me that I should go into compute science, not understanding that CS is more software development and not hands on. So unfortunately I went into college with the misconception that a CS degree was what I needed to pursue. I managed to do well in all of the math classes likewise in the programing courses but as soon as I took my first algorithms course, I knew it wasn't for me. I enjoyed the networking courses I took and  computer logic and after reevaluating I have decided to take my credits and transfer into WGU, or perhaps a state college that offers a online IT program, and get my Bachelor of Science in IT. 

Will this pay off in the long run? we'll see, but so far so good. It was very difficult to get internships for software development in my area due to so much competition. However in IT I was able to land a ""IT Specialist"" position at a healthcare facility in about 1 month. I plan on resuming my studies in the fall and will be filling credit gaps on Sophia learning over the summer. Maybe even will get my Security+ cert this summer to. 

I am already happier than I was in CS and I have learned a ton in my job, working ""hands on"" is so much better than just writing software imo. 

TLDR: If you are like me an are transitioning from CS to IT while in college, you can do it! I am much happier now than I was while doing software development."

I'm currently a 3rd year computer engineering major at well-known university in California (but I'm from Washington state). I was hoping to get some opinions on my chances of being accepted into Stanford or Columbia for a computer science masters with a specialization in machine learning. Anything about graduate school admissions is a mystery so any advice would be great. 

GPA: 3.8/4.0 currently, but by the time I apply it may be \~3.75 because of some specific courses which I anticipate will be hard. I may be overthinking it, but is a slight drop like this anything to be worried about?

GRE: Optional/not required. I don't want to take it lol

Experience: Worked at a medium sized company (\~3000 employees) the summer after my sophomore year. They manufactured airplane parts, and I created a prototype automated optical inspection (AOI) system for them. It was robotic arm with a camera that when given an airplane part it would take pictures of it from several angles and then return to the user where errors/defects were. This was done with brute force image analysis methods. Skills I acquired from this job are robotics and image analysis.

Currently I work at Amazon as a Jr. software developer. I work at AWS specifically. It's a part time job during the school year (16-20 hours a week) and full time in the summer. I started just a couple months ago. I really want to highlight this in my application because its more than just a regular FAANG internship. Skills I acquired from this job are cloud computing and cyber security.

Research: I currently work as a machine learning researcher with one of my professors. We are using face and name recognition models to analyze California faculty and see if there are trends/biases in who collaborates with who in academia. Nothing published yet but hoping to at least submit some of our work by the end of the quarter. Started in winter 2022.  Skills I acquired from here are machine learning models, web scraping, and data analysis.

Letters of rec: Probably will try to get the Director I reported to at my first internship, my current manager at Amazon, and the professor I do research with.

Other: Intramural softball (champion), intramural basketball, IEEE honors society, and some other personal projects I plan to fully invest in during the summer.

Final thoughts: I worry that since I kind of dipped my toes in a lot of facets of computer science I can't craft a complete narrative in my personal statement to why I want machine learning specifically. I'll definitely have to take time to figure out how I want to approach that.

Thanks!"

Wanted to ask for some advice. I currently work full time in medical equipment industry but there isn’t any room for growth here and my pay won’t ever really increase beyond better commissions. 

In January I enrolled in an Associate’s for cybersecurity. I plan on learning more as I’ve always really enjoyed things dealing with IT and I find every field I’ve checked out so far very interesting. 

My current concern though is the whole experience issue. I can’t really do any internships right now since I work full time and I have part time classes. The only way I could is if I quit my job, but I have bills and tuition. 

How else will I be able to get experience? Or do I just keep trying to earn certs along the way to get my degree and keep applying hoping somewhere will take a chance on me?"

Here are the pros and cons of each position:

Optum:

Pro: Better image, Remote, Live with Parents, and pocket most of the money. 29/hr. 

Cons: Recent layoffs makes FTE conversion unlikely, only 3 months. 

MindTree

Pro: FTE which is hard to get for a new grad in this economy, 

Cons: only 66k, in Bethesda, will be barely able to save. The client is with a hospitality company.

I have been searching for a month and MindTree is the only offer I got. I am wicked scared after Optum, I will not be able to find a FTE position if they do not give a return offer.

Both start around the same time, and MindTree is onsite so OE not possible.

I wasn't even given the opportunity to take technical tests or have a conversation with a human. However, I'm trying to stay optimistic, thinking that my chances might be better this year since it's an internship for the final year, and it's a six-month duration.  
  
I already have a portfolio website (self-hosted 😎) featuring three web projects, and I plan to make one or two more before the fall semester starts.

I tried to get a summer internship in a good company but wasn't able to. And I don't want to work in startup as an intern right now since frankly, on a resume, big company names give an edge and I want to improve my skills in this vacation.
So I decided to try internships in my third year.

So this summer, I plan to :
Learn Ai/ml and make one project in it
Complete my ecommerce website project(add to cart and other fee functions are remaining)
Participate in Girlscript summer of code (open source contribution)
Do 5 leetcode problems everyday (hopefully)

Aside from this :
Participate in a Cloud based Blogathon cause it has prizes and I wanna give it a shot
Participate in a online hackathon conducted by Microsoft I guess where we need to make a mini project

So I still feel this is too less. My brother says it's enough cause leetcode alone will take 4-6 hours per day.
So any suggestions what else can I add to this list? I have vacation till first week of July.

Any suggestions are appreciated!"

13m4clh,5,2023-05-19,Selecting a cloud storage+compute solution for a data warehouse. Advice appreciated!,Special-Check-4317,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/13m4clh/selecting_a_cloud_storagecompute_solution_for_a/,"*Hello everyone, aspiring data engineer here.*

I am brand new to data engineering, and to all of the modern tech like all of the AWS offerings, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.

I was hoping to get some pointers/general opinions on my use case and perhaps what may be a good idea and what simply won't work as well. (the use case is below)

I am an intern that has been tasked with implementing  the following process from start to finish.

Background: The company gets monthly batches of ""log files"" that are compressed, encrypted, and are in a proprietary format overall. They want to have a dashboard that allows them to query for any/all of the data to make graphs and troubleshoot.

Process:

**1.**Convert those log files into physical values (uncompressed, unencrypted, decoded) and do some extra processing. \[done\] I have created a python script for that, so now I just input a path to a folder and it searches for all log files, process them, and saves a resulting pandas dataframes as a csv files into a desired folder. I utilized multiprocessing, and other optimization techniques to make the processing time manageable. The script is ran on a work desktop with 48 cores.

**2.**Upload this data into a ""database"" (any cloud storage that would allow for fast querying). Working on figuring out the best solution for it now.

**3.** Connect the database to a dashboard/visualization tool like Grafana so the engineering team can visualize log files and all that. Not yet started.

 The current backlog of compressed log files is \~4-5TB. The test batch that I have processed and uploaded to a locally hosted PostgreSQL had a really large expansion ratio (from 1.61 GB compressed, to 18GB in a PostgreSQL table). That means that overall, I have to bulk upload \~50TB, with additional \~6.5TB each month.

&#x200B;

The current table structure in PostgreSQL is as follows.

`Table = device_name                   (there are about 30 total devices, so 30 tables)`

`Columns:`

	`timestamp TIMESTAMP[2]  (minimum precision necessary)`

	`signal_name VARCHAR(35) (name of the signal (~530 unique signals))`

	`Signal_value REAL                 (all values can be represented as a float / real)`

&#x200B;

**So overall about 2-3TB per table.**

I tried using SMALLINT as signal\_name\_id and having a separate table to reference SMALLINT to an actual name when querying, but that only reduced the size from 18GB to 15GB in the test batch. Plus, I've heard that querying large amounts when using a reference table can slow things down.

&#x200B;

The most common query is of type:

	`SELECT timestamp, signal_name, value FROM some_device_table`

	`WHERE timestamp > some_value AND timestamp < some_other_value`

	`AND singal_name = some_signal_name`

**So basically, engineering team wants to use the visualization tool to get some signal/signals of some device, over some period of time.**

&#x200B;

With all that known, does anyone feel like they know what cloud solution would fit well with these needs and this scale? I'm open to any tips of any kind! Thanks!

*P.S. I have looked into different indexing combinations for query performance, etc. But at this stage I need to decide what overall databse/data warehouse system to go with. On radar: AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, Google BigQuey, AWS Athena (let me know if there are others I should consider).*"

13m63nm,12,2023-05-19,27M unemployed for 3+ years and feeling hopeless. Need Advice.,EducationalGap3623,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/13m63nm/27m_unemployed_for_3_years_and_feeling_hopeless/,"**TLDR:**

I'm 27 and I haven't had worked in \~3 years. I would consider myself tech-savvy and would like something in the field or adjacent, open to anything remote. The pay/benefit isn't important but I would like to start as soon as possible. I just want something to work for so my day-to-day has some structure to it.

Where can I find/apply to remote jobs that require 0 experience? What are my options? Would really appreciate any advice.

  
**Background/ranting**

I graduated from high school in 2014, and against my immigrant parents' wishes, I dropped out just a few weeks into my first university semester to take some time off. In hindsight, it was a pretty impulsive decision, but at the time, I was feeling very lost, and burned out from a decade of weekend tutoring and after-school programs I was put into. I wanted some time to myself and figure myself out.

During this time, I worked a variety of part-time jobs, ranging from fast food cashier, retail, tutoring, to delivery service. I discovered so much about myself during this period. My favorite job was as a ""techie"" at a local geek shop where I sat in the backroom with headphones on, fixing laptops. I enjoyed the minimal human interaction and the freedom this job gave me. However, this break ended up being three years long, then seeing people getting internships and starting their careers I had a realization that there was no growth potential for me here, and I wasn't able to make a comfortable living off of it.

I decided to go back to college to get my degree in computer science. It was tough adapting to the academic life again, but I enjoyed the sense of growth and learning. I felt like I was working towards something I was truly interested in. It was around this time that I discovered coding boot camps, and after discussing it with my parents, they agreed to pay for my boot camp tuition under the condition that I complete my associate's degree first.

I began full-time boot camp in late 2019 and graduated early 2020. While transitioning to their 6-month career coaching and job searching program, the pandemic put an indefinite pause on everything.  I felt like such a failure every decision I made felt like the wrong one. Then losing a family member put me at wits end; I had no drive, no will to do anything, I was depressed. Just like that another 3 years have gone I've made 0 progress, and the tech job market seems to be getting worst and worst by the day. Therapy really help me regain a sense of self in the past month and I holding on to a glimmer of hope. At this point I just want to find something to change up my day-to-day and feel productive again."
13m69k7,1,2023-05-19,I need guidance regarding MBA and switching fields.,Niket___,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/13m69k7/i_need_guidance_regarding_mba_and_switching_fields/,"Hello! I completed my [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in Computer Science last year. (Graduated in 2022). 

My qualifications is as follows : 

10th: 8.4 CGPA  
12th: 92.5%  
[B.Tech](https://B.Tech) CGPA: 7.93

I had my first drop year when I passed my 12th standard, I wrote SAT for undergraduate overseas, but I couldn't commit to it because of sudden financial trouble in my family. Then, I did my undergraduate from India. After graduating last year I dropped an year because I was extremely confused what I wanted to do in life, I lost my zeal for development and hence didn't go for placements at all (on or off campus). I only have 3 months unpaid internship experience in a back-end role where I did fairly well and got a letter of recommendation and Certificate. (I don't think that this will count as work experience.)

However, I'm considering to go for CAT 2023 and write GMAT this year and get my MBA and switch to finance or consulting field. I have 2 drop years right now, one after class 12, and one right now (2022-2023). How will this affect me career wise, and is my qualifications good enough to land a decent college given I score well in my entrance examinations? 

Other than scoring entrance examination, what else can I do to strengthen my profile and increase my chances of getting an admit? I've done volunteering in bunch of NGO's in past and have certificates for the same, are they worth mentioning in my resume as extra curricular activities? Will they help increase my chances of getting an admit? 

Secondly, since I'm making a switch from my field, would it be wise for me to get some online certifications from CFI or Coursera regarding business, finance, and leadership skills offered by some management schools online? Will they be a positive addition to my resume and worth undertaking? 

I'm 23 male, and general for reference. Thanks for reading this far and I appreciate every input!"

Up to this point I've worked in a cell phone store and have been going to college. This is the best job I have ever had! $19 an hour to answer ~10 tickets/day and organize computer parts. I can work from home up to 4 days a week, I see my boss between 0-3 times/day never micromanages but is always there if I need help. I can take my lunch whenever and to top it all off the company gives us free soda, coffee, & tea. There is the drawback of no benefits but if they keep me on past the summer I will then be eligible parking is $65/month but the company reimburse half.

This feels really good, but maybe I'm just used to shitty jobs? Thoughts?"
13m6for,3,2023-05-19,I need guidance regarding MBA and switching fields.,Niket___,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13m6for/i_need_guidance_regarding_mba_and_switching_fields/," Hello! I completed my [B.Tech](https://b.tech/) in Computer Science last year. (Graduated in 2022).

My qualifications is as follows :

10th: 8.4 CGPA  
12th: 92.5%  
[B.Tech](https://b.tech/) CGPA: 7.93

I had my first drop year when I passed my 12th standard, I wrote SAT for undergraduate overseas, but I couldn't commit to it because of sudden financial trouble in my family. Then, I did my undergraduate from India. After graduating last year I dropped an year because I was extremely confused what I wanted to do in life, I lost my zeal for development and hence didn't go for placements at all (on or off campus). I only have 3 months unpaid internship experience in a back-end role where I did fairly well and got a letter of recommendation and Certificate. (I don't think that this will count as work experience.)

However, I'm considering to go for CAT 2023 and write GMAT this year and get my MBA and switch to finance or consulting field. I have 2 drop years right now, one after class 12, and one right now (2022-2023). How will this affect me career wise, and is my qualifications good enough to land a decent college given I score well in my entrance examinations?

Other than scoring entrance examination, what else can I do to strengthen my profile and increase my chances of getting an admit? I've done volunteering in bunch of NGO's in past and have certificates for the same, are they worth mentioning in my resume as extra curricular activities? Will they help increase my chances of getting an admit?

Secondly, since I'm making a switch from my field, would it be wise for me to get some online certifications from CFI or Coursera regarding business, finance, and leadership skills offered by some management schools online? Will they be a positive addition to my resume and worth undertaking?

I'm 23 male, and general for reference. Thanks for reading this far and I appreciate every input!"

We just had our initial session with both of these companies, cost wise they are both pretty much the same(EXPENSIVE). We have an aspiring CS major and because it is such an impacted major we are trying to hire college counselling service.

Has any one worked with these companies , if so how was your experience, did it really give you an edge in the college application process. We are only targeting UCs-no IVY. The internship program on Empowerly looks good-has anyone had a good experience in that?

Thank you all!"

He has been coding since 6th grade and was allowed to take Fundamentals of C++ in our local community college and has an A grade in it, he is also taking AP CS A via UC SCOUT and enrolled for data structures in C++ for coming fall. He does have community service hours of 50 so far with helping the marginalized community to code in SF. He is also taking machine learning course in the community college. Is there anything else he should be doing to maximize his chances

Are there any hackathons that are notable to compete in?

How can he go about applying for internships in tech companies?

He does lots of small image recognition projects on the side and talks about them in his blog, but not sure how he can showcase them.

Thanks all."

I graduated high school in 2020 & enrolled into community college in Fall 2020. In December 2021, I dropped out to take Google's UX design course from January 2022-July 2022 but haven't had any luck landing jobs or internships. On October 2022 I got my life insurance license in hopes of making 10k a month selling life insurance. I was wrong. I didn't make a single cent & I ran out of money to invest in leads (the agency i was working at was making me pay for leads). I had to leave the life insurance industry on January 2023. 

All of these months i've been searching for remote jobs such as data entry, virtual assistant.. etc.. but havent found anything. I got rejected from 3 B2B software sales jobs too. I applied to home depot 2 days ago and havent heard anything yet. I tried to search for jobs at Aldi, Planet Fitness, & Amazon, but there is nothing near me. 

My plan is to return to college in fall 2023 and get an A.S in information technology (I.T), but now i'm worried that I wont be able to find a job because IT is extremely over saturated, as a matter of fact, a few minutes ago i was on an IT subreddit and someone stated that these IT jobs were super full and receiving 400+ applications daily. Another career i had in mind was CAD drafting but the pay isn't excellent. 

It also doesn't help that I live in a high cost of living area. I live in Miami, FL. You need a high salary to make it here. I honestly dont know what to do anymore i'm tired of career searching and job searching and just everything that has to do with it."

13m9az8,0,2023-05-19,Where should i start my computer science Joruney?,Josepep7,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/13m9az8/where_should_i_start_my_computer_science_joruney/,"Hello everyone, Im Jose a 19-year-old Computer Science Student. I am only beginning the generals in my college education and i know I want to do computer science with some interest in cybersecurity, software engineering, and front-end development. I knew that i wanted to do computer science when i met with people in the same industry. Everyone told me the pay was great and had an amazing work-life balance. The work life balance is what really got me. Im also a great problem solver and the thought of being hired to solve problems is really interesting. AI sparks my interest. Being an ethical hacker seems really cool as well as i have always wanted to learn how hackers do what they do and how i could use those skills for good. Im a creative thinker and i am used to teaching myself how to do things via the internet (taught myself music software, instruments, photoshop, and content creation.), a skill that is a must in the industry. the only experience I have is teaching myself CSS and HTML because I'm planning to start a website-building business. Im taking Java next semester at school. The problem is that i dont know which discipline in computer science i want to specialize in because I dont have any experience and don't know where to start. How does one start hacking? How do i make an app? How can i make a software? I dont know where to start or how to start. And I cant pick my specialty if I dont know what Im best at. I was wondering if I could get some sort of mentorship from someone who has a career or has been in the same shoes as I am. Id like to get a start ASAP so i can begin looking for internships or entry level jobs. Id like to make a tech business one day or maybe do some tech philanthropy."
13ma22o,6,2023-05-19,[IWantOut] 19M Ireland -> anywhere,demolusion,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/13ma22o/iwantout_19m_ireland_anywhere/,"*Has anyone here spent a summer in Europe working? How did it go?*  
  
I(19m) have been working as a waiter for two years in Ireland and worked as a data engineer intern for seven months. This summer I want to take a break from the hospitality gigs and the stress of internships to enjoy what could be my last summer before heading off into the working world (I am entering my third year of university, and will have to spend next summer working an internship and after that I will be working full time)  
  
I suppose I have the funds to travel Europe without having to work my way through it, but that just doesn't sound very interesting to me.  
  
I want purpose while I'm out there, getting real interactions with locals and meeting new people!  
  
Preferably it would be going from country to country, working while picking up jobs for a while, just to give me this purpose while I travel, hell to be honest I would be content with traveling to one country and settling there for a while.  
  
I would love to hear any of your experiences!"

Advice needed!,Ok_Fox_7069,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/13mbkub/feeling_stuck_advice_needed/,"I am 22 years old and am doing an online distance learning program from Uni of London via coursera (Bachelors in Computer Science). It is my 2nd semester and I absolutely hate it. I thought I would be ok with studying on my own through recorded lectures etc. Cause I like to learn independently but this is not what I had in mind. I just feel like I am not doing much of a college degree. I am doing the bare minimum and getting decent to good grades (think As and Bs) but there is no actual passion or care in my work. Idk if it is the medium (online learning) or if it is doing CS which i don't think it is cause I actually like learning how to program and code (even though I sometimes daydream  myself studying drama or English literature or Egyptology)

And thinking of torturing myself with this for probably the next 2-3years is making me want to cry( I actually did cry and had a mini panic attack but I am fine now..I think) so I am here. Asking for help. Some guidance to be exact because I fear that whatever choice I do end up making will lead me to an even deeper dark hole that I am already in rn.

A) i stick with it and hope to get first with honors but my love for learning will probably be finished and I will be a burnt out mess. Also, would love to a masters and then PhD so getting generic boiler plate recommendation letters is not gonna be good (if I even get those in the first place). And the transcripts and my actual degree might come after a veryy long time so not fun at all. Plus having my Bachelors done from an online program is probably not going to go smoothly when I apply for higher education. So that is option A. Or just get a job and maybe rethink about going back to school...but I am barely getting good internships right now as I am international and need a work visa and so if I want to get an actual job...who is going to sponsor me. It would be much easier if I was on student visa and switched it from there but alas...


B) Transfer aka get the hell out plan. ...not too sure about this as well because I emailed a bunch of schools that I like and have good aid for international students and most of them said no since my credits were from an online program. Some were going to evaluate on a case by case basis. So..chances are slim. 

C) apply again. During peak covid I graduated high school. I applied 3 times to colleges. I got into some great colleges but couldn't fiance it. I couldn't go to my home country unis (the educational environment ucks here) cause I didn't take Alevel Math/Comp Science or STEM subjects which is a requirement if I want to pursue computer science (no one told me this nor was I wise enough to look this up myself).UK was the same plus their aid sucks. Other unis like Amsterdam uni (AUC) don't really have a computer science program..more broad and liberal do i wasn't interested. 

Anyways..applying again for the 4th time would be soul crushing. My GPA is 3.6 which is alright bur not as good as it can be. So I would need to raise my GPA up. How so? Re/Taking more o and alevel exams. Not super thrilled about that idea. And then taking the SAT. Got 1400s.. which is again not bad but not great either. So I have to retake that. And then essays and making sure my activities are on point. Sounds exhausting and tike consuming and also how the heck am I supposed to pay for all of this? But yeah this option exists..

D) do something else. Psychology maybe ..idk man
man or an apprenticeship which is unlikely cause my country doesn't have those and the one I really like..the Google one..it seems there will be some extra steps for me to go over regarding visa 

E) take a break. Find myself again. Be inspired.

So here are my options. Everything seems daunting right now. I am overwhelmed and numb which is probably my dperession speaking. So yeah. Let me know what u guys thinks. Thanks!"

I also have my Net+ and Sec+ certs, an internship, volunteer, extracurricular, and academic projects related to IT (mostly cloud and security). 

I have already been doing interviews but stopped about a month before graduating to focus on exams. 
Less than a week after getting home, my family is pressuring me to interview at fast food and other min wage type places. They just want me to quickly get a job. They dont think i can easily get an IT job. Which hurts my feelings a lot. But thats why im here, asking your opinion.

Should I stop focusing on projects, building my portfolio, and continuing my IT education to get a minimum wage job? Or should i wait until i get an entry level IT job?"

It would be much easier if I was on student visa and switched it from there but alas...


B) Transfer aka get the hell out plan. ...not too sure about this as well because I emailed a bunch of schools that I like and have good aid for international students and most of them said no since my credits were from an online program. Some were going to evaluate on a case by case basis. So..chances are slim. 

C) apply again. During peak covid I graduated high school. I applied 3 times to colleges. I got into some great colleges but couldn't fiance it. I couldn't go to my home country unis (the educational environment ucks here) cause I didn't take Alevel Math/Comp Science or STEM subjects which is a requirement if I want to pursue computer science (no one told me this nor was I wise enough to look this up myself).UK was the same plus their aid sucks. Other unis like Amsterdam uni (AUC) don't really have a computer science program..more broad and liberal do i wasn't interested. 

Anyways..applying again for the 4th time would be soul crushing. My GPA is 3.6 which is alright bur not as good as it can be. So I would need to raise my GPA up. How so? Re/Taking more o and alevel exams. Not super thrilled about that idea. And then taking the SAT. Got 1400s.. which is again not bad but not great either. So I have to retake that. And then essays and making sure my activities are on point. Sounds exhausting and tike consuming and also how the heck am I supposed to pay for all of this? But yeah this option exists..

D) do something else. Psychology maybe ..idk man
man or an apprenticeship which is unlikely cause my country doesn't have those and the one I really like..the Google one..it seems there will be some extra steps for me to go over regarding visa 

E) take a break. Find myself again. Be inspired.

So here are my options. Everything seems daunting right now. I am overwhelmed and numb which is probably my dperession speaking. So yeah. Let me know what u guys thinks. Thanks!"

**Essays**  
  
Personal Essay: 

Spent at most a week writing my personal essay because I was in a rush to make the Questbridge application deadline. This was a mistake because it wasn't written the best it could have been. I basically introduced my living situation growing up with a single mom and how I tried my best to contribute. Transitioned to diagnosed mental illness, then connected it to my favorite video game, Rainbow Six: Siege, and how it served as an ""in-game asylum"". Importantly, the growth and overcoming aspect I mentioned is how I no longer saw the game as an escape, but as something to learn from and apply to real life as I navigate mental health challenges. Ended by connecting it to medicine, specifically surgery, and how I hoped to ""Operate"" in the same capacity one day as being an Operator in-game.   
  
Could've been an incredible essay with better metaphors and vivid examples, but wasn't quite ready at the time of submission.  
6.5-8/10.  
  
Never changed or rewrote my personal essay despite not matching Questbridge, I probably should have but I had to focus on my finals.  
  
USC Supplementary:  
One of the very last essays I wrote for my long season of college applications, and took everything I learned from college essay writing and played to a specific passion/interest which was diversifying the healthcare and reducing minority/gender disparities in the surgical workforce. This was great because the major I was applying for was a unique one that was made for the internship I was already doing, which backed up my aspirations with experience and a shaped passion.   
  
**Decisions**  
  
Acceptances:  
  
University of Southern California - RD (Committed full ride with outside scholarships)  
University of Virginia - Questbridge RD  
UC Berkeley - RD  
UC Irvine - RD  
University of Washington - RD  
A bunch of safeties and state schools - RD  
  
Waitlists:  
  
UC San Diego - RD  
  
Rejections (oh boy):  
  
ALL RD:  
Stanford (Questbridge)  
Upenn (Questbridge)  
Yale (Questbridge)  
Duke (Questbridge)  
Northwestern (Questbridge)

UCLA  
Washington U. at St. Louis (Questbridge RD)  
Northeastern   
University of Notre Dame (Questbridge RD)  
NYU  
Case Western Reserve  
  
**Additional Information:**  
  
Procrastinated until the very last minute for every single application, often writing entire supplementary the day of the deadline. This did not prove beneficial when I was somehow selected as a Questbridge National College Match candidate, because my application for that process was extremely premature and not ready to be sent to my top reaches. As expected, I did not match Stanford, UPenn, Yale, Duke, and Northwestern. The QB application for those schools were deferred to the Regular Decision round. This caused me to panic and apply to an additional 15 or so schools because I was worried I wouldn't get into any. If any low-income rising seniors choose to go the Questbridge route, I would suggest starting on the application as soon as possible and completing requirements such as supplementary essays as soon as you can. You want to make sure that your QB application is the best version that it can be, because the moment you're selected and locked in, you can't modify or change it. I didn't play to a specific strong spike, I just did what I enjoyed in high school and wrote about something meaningful to me. I would say after a bit of research, USC EA is not worth it. Take your time crafting your RD application and try to stand out as much as you can."

I graduated last semester (December 2022) with a B.S in Comp-Sci and a Minor in Statistics from a top 30 U.S University (I am in NO way trying to brag, I'm at the bottom of the barrel starting from scratch and just wanted to provide context to my questions, I graduated two years late with a mediocre gpa at best and humbly admit the time and money spent towards the degree could have been put to better use).

After reluctantly sending job apps the past few months to SWE roles with only a three year old front end dev internship under my belt I realized I had absolutely no interest in writing and debugging code for eight hours a day. I have no idea what the future of software developers looks like given the emergence of LLM AIs like chatgpt and quite frankly don't want to find out. 

I decided to re-access my career options and decided that a career in IT/Cyber would be a far better fit for me. The only part of coding I truly enjoyed was scripting and automation. I loved watching videos outlining data breaches and mutahar's penetration testing. 

After maybe two weeks of trying to figure out what my first steps should be I figured it would be wise to reach out for help and see what the most efficient way to pivot into this field would be while HOPEFULLY being able to leverage my degree in CompSci.

Should I look into maybe finding an internship or joining an IT rotational program? I don't know if the fact that I have a four year degree would help me or if it's too late given I already graduated?

Should I start looking into studying for the CompTIA SEC+? I understand only having this certification will not land me an entry level role as a security engineer/analyst with no experience but I was hoping maybe having the degree would bolster my chances but idk

 Should I start looking into getting experience by applying to IT help desk positions? I currently have a part-time job as a computer technician at a non-profit that I really enjoy being at. I was hoping I could do this while I pursue a certification or entry level position/internship but if it'll help I will consider it?

Any advise would be greatly appreciated. I've been feeling stuck for sometime now and excited to take the next steps!"

So we meet online every other week, and I’m sure that me and them will put in many hours at home trying to come up with a solution.

But the question is- is this really “experience” that I can put on my resume? Can I simply put “Research assistant with (insert given research circuits problem), came up with solution (insert solution)”

Like I’d list it as part time, or contract? Or would I just throw it in volunteering because I never went to a lab and didn’t get paid?

Seeking advices from DevOps Engineers here.

Hello po. Graduating CS student here. I'm passionate about DevOps pero di ko alam kung itutuloy ko pa. Ever since nalaman ko about DevOps, ewan parang naadik ako naeenjoy ko siya aralin, a lot of eureka moments happened. On November 2022 I started learning about it. I was able to learn the culture and a lot of technologies such as containerization (Docker, K8s), ci/cd (GH Actions), IaC (TF, Ans), and cloud (AWS services and resources) while studying in college. Was able to create 2 personal projects regarding deployment utilizing the mentioned tools.  Pero kahit madami ako nababasa na ""it is not an entry-level role"", tuloy parin sa pag-aaral (tigas ng ulo eh no HAHAHA) hoping na sana maka-land ng devops engr job na entry-level to start gaining exp.

Pero eto na nga, may mga nababasa ako na may Data Structure and Algo (DSA) assessments daw sa companies pag mag-aapply for DevOps Engr roles. Kung totoo man yon, need ko po ba mag-grind ng DSA at leetcode? humina na ako sa DSA puro ChatGPT kase ako pag may coding tasks sa school HAHAHA hays. Mga 1-2 weeks grind siguro. Pero I also have this thought na pag every time na lang na lilipat ng company for DevOps role e may coding exam, mas maigi pa magfocus nalang sa coding (e.g. pursue a dev role nalang ganon), walang laban YAML configs ko pag coding exams na e HAHAHAH.

I have some questions:

1. For DevOps Engineers here, may DSA assessments pa rin ba kada lilipat kayo ng companies? Pashare naman po ng journey :)
2. If di talaga pede DevOps entry-level, ano marerecommend niyo na entry-level job for me para makapasok sa devops, a jr developer role or a jr system admin role? or mag-alaga nalang ako ng kambing namin sa probinsya jk lang haha.
3. Kinoconsider ko rin SRE or Cloud roles kung di palarin sa DevOps para magamit ko mga inaral ko, possible kaya to sa entry-level?
4. Started applying to very few companies using a resume with 1 internship and 4 projects (2 devops, 1 baby thesis regarding AI, 1 app dev).  Should I continue or stop muna and grind?

Opinions will be much appreciated. Thank you po and have a great day."

I attend a private liberal arts college & Im behind 9 credits shy of graduation. My parents are so damn proud that I'll be graduating in summer. It turns out that 2023 is going to be a depressing year after all the sacrificed time in high school & college trying to manage life & school I won't even be able to afford the remaining Fall semester If (realistically) that's what it's going to come too. I bombed an exam that's gonna tank my grade and possible hold me back to 13 credits. I asked my college's advisors about earning credits & they said the cap was 8 if I'm doing community college but even If I try to add my internship for credits (4), it still won't be enough. I just came so far uphill all for it to soon come crashing down. Why do I make things harder for myself? Do I really hate myself this much? Do I really want to see myself fail as If I deserve this? 

I'm a week away from signing a lease with the most awesome person I've met here (my fiancé, GF of 3.5 years) & possibly transferring to a state college or I may have to give her up If I'm needed to stay here for a year's lease. My parents are done paying for me & I just want to die already. I mean I wanted to apply to law school this Fall but now I gotta worry about whether I'll graduate this Fall or Next year sometime (doesn't matter to law schools where I get my degree from) . Even If was going to live here, I'd still look for a public college given the costs.

Honestly guys, I know you all are gonna talk me out of this but I'd rather get my degree & apply to law school with her, someone who's got my back rather than being by myself alone at home & possibly suicidal with my own thoughts. My current college and the one I'm thinking of transferring to would give me similar outcomes towards applying for law school

TL;DR may have to take an extra semester in Fall but can't afford. If I stay I'll develop mental issues but If I transfer to a public I may feel better but still feel guilty about my delayed graduation"

I started there right after high school as an intern when I was 18 so I just hit 4 years with the company.

 The intern program involved me working part-time and going to school for industrial maintenance with them paying for my school as long as I worked a set amount after I graduated. My non-maintenance coworkers and supervisor have told me several times that I’ve excelled since I’ve been there and that they are proud of what I’ve become. I usually brush it off and just say a quick thank you because I don’t really know what to say. 

Anyways, working the nights was okay until I met my now wife who works during the day. She didn’t always work days so we used to have more time together. We hardly get to see each other during the week and the weekends flyby so quick. I had a sit down with my boss and told him I’m probably going to be looking for another job on dayshift since one for my company probably won’t be available soon. He said that was unfortunate and he would hate to see me go but understood why I wanted a change of shift. I started applying to jobs the next day. The next week after he pulled me aside and said he could work something out but I would have to wait around 2-3 months. I talked with my wife and we both agreed to wait it out to see if they weren’t bullshitting. 

Fast forwarding to yesterday my boss told me that he and the manager of the facility basically want to make me the assistant supervisor of maintenance on dayshift without that exact title. I’m super excited to be finally going to days but I worried about what my coworkers are gonna say. I’ve always had a good/decent relationship with all of them but they can become very hateful and vindictive and they will for sure not be okay with this decision. I won’t have any employee management responsibilities so I won’t be commanding them but I will be above them in rank. 

I don’t know how I’m gonna be able to talk to them. I feel like I now have to prove myself because I’m so much younger when a week ago I knew what I was capable of. Am I letting them get to me too much already? Should I confront them when it’s announced in a week or should I just ignore them and hope it passes?"

Since my first year of engineering, I have been highly interested in computer science and have learnt CS concepts like DSA, DBMS, and OOPS. Additionally, I have a couple of projects to demonstrate my programming skills and have even published a research paper in a Springer publication.

I also undertook a 6-month internship at a well-known US tech company. Currently, I am working as a Java Backend Engineer at a US fintech company, where I have been employed for a year now.

I took the GRE two years ago and received a score of 162 in Quantitative and 155 in Verbal. I am planning to retake the exam and I am confident that I can achieve a score of 166 or higher in Quantitative, although my Verbal score may decrease.

My dream schools are as follows:

1. UMass Amherst
2. Purdue
3. Stony Brook
4. Rutgers
5. Virginia Tech
6. Georgia State

Could you please provide insight into my chances of getting accepted into any of these universities? Additionally, if my chances of admission for the Fall semester are not good, should I consider applying for the Spring intake instead?

Thank you for your assistance!"
13mmy87,1,2023-05-20,Need advice on underperformance in employee with workman's comp disability [UT],Ailyra,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/13mmy87/need_advice_on_underperformance_in_employee_with/,"I have an employee who is very senior on our team, pre-dating myself, but regularly and frequently underperforms.  By their own admission, they are slow to read, process, and write.   This causes them to need at least twice as much time as other team members to do a similar amount of work.  This has been timed and compared in a time study to coworkers.

They struggle overall with time management, having difficulty staying on task, and completing tasks within a designated window of time (that is reasonable for all other staff).  Typically there are many tasks they half-complete or don't start at all, but because they don't communicate this, these tasks may remain unfinished overnight or through the next day.  Some of these are mandatory for the day, some are mandatory within certain time windows .

They, and again they agree with this, struggle to remember conversations, decisions, or other day-to-day operational information that is necessary for their (and the team's) ability to meet the priorities and tasks of the shift.  This results in either repeated discussions/instructions many times, or them relying on other staff to take the lead/direct them and others throughout the majority of the day.  They are also a team lead, and some of the people they lean on are new staff they are supposed to be leading/managing.  Its not all tasks all the time, but anytime things change or get added to the day they struggle to either understand it or remember to do it.

They frequently make decisions that are inefficient, and raise questions or suggestions of possible area activities that are unsafe, typically because they do not recognize the safety risk or feel it is not as serious as others do (including myself and other senior staff).

They have made decisions that put newer people in unsafe positions, and claimed it was because they didn't realize it, despite protocols in place for years.

Additionally, a workman's comp injury has resulted in them not being able to physically support over 50% of the area's mandatory tasks.  This has been going on for a year.  Accommodations that have been implemented include some equipment modifications, but also for the last 6 months, me having to mandate they are always able to be accompanied by a second person, so they can perform their tasks.  The second person is required to assist them in the tasks they are performing, and/or the set up and tear down involved in these tasks (average task may be 10 minutes long).  The second person may be another staff, or an intern.

I have documented everything extensively and escalated to my manager.

This has resulted in us needing more staff (which we don't have) which has put a burden on the team, as they have to accomplish all of their responsibilities and tasks, complete all physical tasks this person physically and medically cannot, and if interns are not available, physically stay with this person and facilitate their work, which is in addition to and in conflict with their own work, tasks, and goals.

Assume my HR is limited, and so far, unhelpful, as is my supervisor (who feels this person needs to be removed from my Dept but also won't do anything, I believe because we would need to convince the CEO).

What options do I have?  What would you recommend to deal with this situation?  My team is exhausted from the extra workload, in addition to being frustrated by the continual underperformance that also puts more weight on the others.

Tl;dr: Senior employee consistently underperforms.   Also has a workman's comp related physical limitation that for over a year has prevented them from doing 50% of mandatory work/tasks.  How do I convince a CEO that I need to take serious action?  What action would you suggest, and how would you go about it?


Thanks!"

I have been researching about what universities, which country, cost, opportunities after finishing masters and mainly what subject I should apply for. I could not get much information about European and Australian universities, a lot of Canadian universities websites say 'above 3 gpa in last 60 credit hours' and I might qualify for that but the fees seems to be expensive.  American universities that accept say they accept GPA below 3 turns out don't actually accept for tech related subjects.

Please suggest me universities that accept students with below 3 gpa mostly in European countries."

If you've pursued an economics or a similar degree, what kind of placements did you apply to? How did you search for placement opportunities?

&#x200B;

Additional personal questions:

I self taught myself sql through a udemy course which I would put under the certifications section in my cv. Is it worth to create a sql project to list in my cv under a projects section?

Should I talk about a excel project that was completed as part of my BTEC Level 3 (A level equivalent) ICT course to show that I have an understanding of excel? The excel project was done completely independent.

Should I apply for internships in addition to placements? This would be a backup plan in case I don't secure a placement.

Is there anything I can do during the summer to improve my cv?

Some background information about myself:

First year student studying economics and finance at a mid tier year university. Have a 79 grade average in semester 1 which is likely to fall down to a 75+ grade average.

13mvsn8,274,2023-05-20,A message for teenage men,Tailor-Equivalent,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/13mvsn8/a_message_for_teenage_men/,"1. **Pick your friends wisely:** I cannot stress the importance of choosing the people you hang out with. They influence the way you think, the decisions you make, and the habits you pursue. The biggest danger is that most of the time, you are unaware of this influence. Pick your friends wisely. Pick friends who are ambitious and who push you to become a better person. My parents were right on that one, and I wish I listened.
2. **Don’t focus on women:** When you're young, women are typically the center of your attention. Nothing wrong with that, we've all been there. But, if you want to get more women, don’t focus on getting women, focus on becoming the best version of yourself so that women have no choice but to be drawn to you. The way I always advise people is to improve in these four buckets: Physical health, Mental health, Work/School/Profession, and Relationships. Your time should be focused on improving in all of these four buckets. When you're fully focused on yourself, you come across as less needy, which is the number one trait that women are attracted to.
3. **Step outside your comfort zone:** Growth happens when you step outside of your comfort zone. Go to that party even if you don’t know anyone, ask your crush on a date even if it's uncomfortable, and step up to volunteer for an event even if it's scary. Put yourself out there. The biggest regret people usually have when they get older is not having the courage to try out different things.
4. **Become Self Disciplined:** Do hard things even if you don’t feel like it, don’t indulge in bad habits, and don’t do things that you know are wrong. Self-discipline will set you up for life's challenges that will inevitably arise when you get older.
5. **Avoid overstimulation:** We live in a world where we are constantly overstimulated and many things are competing for our attention. Instagram, TikTok, Video Games, Porn, etc. The reason why overstimulation is bad is because you get used to instant gratification and it becomes hard to practice delayed gratification habits like studying, working out, reading, etc. The more you limit instant gratification, the easier it is to do things that are hard now, but beneficial in the long run.
6. **Looks matter:** This is the harsh truth that people have a hard time accepting. Good-looking people get more opportunities in life and this applies to both men and women. The biggest thing you have control over is your physique. Even if you are not the best looking guy, having an incredible physique will put you in the top 10% of men in terms of looks. In addition to that, don't neglect the small things which can make a big difference like Acne, Teeth, Hair, Hygiene, etc.
7. **Learn Martial Arts:** This might seem controversial, but I cannot recommend this highly enough. Every single man in my opinion should learn martial arts. The world we live in is violent whether we like it or not and especially among young men filled with testosterone. Learning martial arts allows you to have the confidence to stand up for yourself, stand up against bullies, and in general, be comfortable in your own skin. I'm not advocating getting into street fights, in fact, the first thing you learn in Martial Arts is to avoid street fights. But when you're forced to protect yourself or your loved ones, you know you're more than capable of doing it.
8. **Become good at something:** You should devote a big chunk of your teenage years to becoming good at something. It can be a sport, a profession, a hobby, or anything else. Whatever it is, become good at something. Trust me, you will thank yourself later.
9. **School is important:** It seems that lately, everyone is bashing education and advocating for dropping out and not going to university. I do agree that our education system sucks, but as I always say, we are in the game, you either learn how to play the game or risk being left behind. The game is that those who get good grades in school have a higher chance of getting into top universities. And those who get into top universities have a higher chance of ending up in a high-paying job. This is reality. Are there exceptions like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and others who drop out and end up becoming billionaires? Of course. But making such a drastic decision at a young age is dangerous, in my opinion.
10. **Get a job:** Yes, even if you're young and still at school. Look for opportunities to work even if it is part-time or an internship. While school is important, it does not teach you anything that is transferrable in the real world. That includes customer service, dealing with people, negotiation, managing your money, and many others.

I truly hope this helps."

Most of my days were met with studying, work as an RA, and just spending time to myself like reading or playing video games. I am not a party person and I do not drink out of personal reasons. I know its not bad, but I feel like I missed out on a lot of social gatherings that could have helped me connect with my classmates more often.

I am not sad over this, but when reflecting on my college years I feel like I could have done the social aspect of it a bit better and thrown myself out there more. I feel like at times I am very reclusive when it comes to social events held by my international studies and Chinese programs. Even when I do try to fit in, it mainly consists of small talk. Afterwards, my peers happen to see their friends and hang out with them. It does not make me sad, but it does tell me that I need to up my game in connecting with my classmates more often. When I was beginning college, I made a mental note to focus on grades, getting an internship, and my health so that I can have a good start for my career after graduation. Now though, I realize that connecting with classmates a little more can help out with that and I feel like I sort of failed in that department.

I have one year left at my college and then I move on to Capstone for my Chinese Flagship program. So it might be make or break for me. It also does not help that I am working on my thesis during that time, but I do plan on working on it throughout the summer to help ease the pressure.

TL;DR Did not connect with my classmates a whole lot throughout college and I sort of failed in the social department.

I saw a post on here and the OP said the the IT industry is over saturated and hyper-competitive at the moment.

The good one (20F) and the bad one (24F). Our lease is up in August and we all will be going our separate ways. Me as well as my good roommate have 1 year of college left, while the bad one just graduated. I call her the bad one for the following reasons:

Fills the freezer, leaving no room for everyone else
Doesn't do her dishes
Eats expired food after me or my other roommate throw it out
Leaves all of her stuff on the dining table and living room couches (both of which are not hers)
Leaves dirty pots and pans on the stove
And the worse: likes the apartment to be at 77°

We have confronted her about all of this many, many times. We live in Florida and it's summer. It gets extremely hot and my room gets the hottest (i asked to trade rooms but she doesnt like the view of mine). I would like the apartment to be 73 all day and night. I can sleep well through the night and be comfortable during the day.
After many arguments, we agreed to have it at 75 during the day and 73 at night. If the good roommate and I are out, she can set it to whatever she wants. None of us are happy with it, but it's the best thing we can do.
I stay up until around 2am every night and wake up at around 10-11am, as my full time internship starts at 12. My good roommate goes to bed later but she doesn't mind the apartment being a little warmer, but cannot sleep when it is over 74. 
My bad roommate will wake up at 7am for work, set the ac to 76, then leave. I wake up sweaty and enraged. When I turn it down, I'm already in a bad mood and I can't go back to sleep. During the day, she will set it at 77 and my room will heat up a ton and I'll be sweating, working on hw. She will do that, knowing we are here. I don't have a car, so I can't just leave. 
We have politely addressed her about it, but she either walks away without saying anything, is on the verge of tears talking about how she is so stressed (digital media major with no job, while I'm a cs major who worked a part time job during fall and summer and now doing a full time internship with 3 summer classes), or say that she will agree but doesn't do anything. 
She will complain, saying she should pay less for being uncomfortable, but she's just cheap. I thought about offering to pay $5 of her bill so she will stop changing it and maybe we can keep it cooler, but I feel like she would just find an excuse to change it. I have also thought about buying a lockbox for the thermostat, but she may brake it. I have 2 months left with her, but I just can't with it anymore and I want to do something now. If I have spent almost 2 years dealing with her, she can spend 2 months dealing with her other two roommates. I already sleep with 3 fans on but I'm sick of it.
I don't know if it's a seniority thing or whatever, but we all pay for 1/3rd of everything, so she needs to stop acting like she owns the place. 
Is there any advice on what to do?"

I am a grad student of cybersecurity and had a behavioral interview for the Cybersecurity Internship position on March 16th, 2023. Since then, I've been actively following up with him every week to express my continued interest and inquire about the hiring process's current status.

During the interview I had a fantastic discussion about my background in Security Operations Center, Digital Forensics, and Incident Response. Interviewer even mentioned that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to the team and I was really excited about the opportunity. I kept following up weekly because I am so much interested in this position as my 2.11 years previous experience directly matches with this position and I know I can add more value to this position. In following up mails I even mentioned that if given the chance, I'd be more than willing to shadow senior members of the team and provide detailed reports on my observations to showcase my commitment. I reached out to members who already got this internship offer on linked in and they said that there is a technical interview as well and then you get an offer. There was was no decision uptill now.

Upon following up the HR guy who set up the interview was out of the office till May 22, and will be which prompted an auto-generated email instructing me to reach out to another emailID which I guess is mostly overall recruiting dept of their company. I promptly emailed them and got a reply from same company but with different location HR stating that we’ll let you to know the decision. After 2 days I received an email invitation for a webinar stating “how to get most out of an internship”. I did registered for that as well. 

I'm seeking your advice on how I can turn this follow-up into a positive outcome and potentially secure an internship offer. I'm extremely passionate about this field and have a strong desire to continuously learn and develop professionally. 

How can I Stretch this possibility secure an internship offer?"

A) i stick with it and hope to get first with honors but my love for learning will probably be finished and I will be a burnt out mess. Also, would love to a masters and then PhD so getting generic boiler plate recommendation letters is not gonna be good (if I even get those in the first place). And the transcripts and my actual degree might come after a veryy long time so not fun at all.

Or just get a job and maybe rethink about going back to school...but I am barely getting good internships right now as I am international and need a work visa and so if I want to get an actual job...who is going to sponsor me. It would be much easier if I was on student visa and switched it from there but alas...


B) Transfer aka get the hell out plan. ...not too sure about this as well because I emailed a bunch of schools that I like and have good aid for international students and most of them said no since my credits were from an online program. Some were going to evaluate on a case by case basis. So..chances are slim. 

C) apply again. During peak covid I graduated high school. I applied 3 times to colleges. I got into some great colleges but couldn't fiance it.

Other unis like Amsterdam uni (AUC) don't really have a computer science program..more broad and liberal do i wasn't interested. 

Anyways..applying again for the 4th time would be soul crushing. My GPA is 3.6 which is alright bur not as good as it can be. So I would need to raise my GPA up. How so? Re/Taking more o and alevel exams. Not super thrilled about that idea. And then taking the SAT. Got 1400s.. which is again not bad but not great either. So I have to retake that. And then essays and making sure my activities are on point. Sounds exhausting and tike consuming and also how the heck am I supposed to pay for all of this? But yeah this option exists..

D) do something else. Psychology maybe ..idk man

2 as a Sr. IT BA in PMO team (current)
3 as a IT Data Analyst

Both in the construction industry within the IT departments.

B.S. in Cybersecurity from a state school (nothing special)


Work dilemma:

Working about 25-30hrs a week (I get my assignments done really quick compared to peers). Great WLB, however no clear growth path within the company which is driving me insane. 

I'm really hungry for more and feel that I'm wasting my young years. Should I bide my time hoping for a growth opportunity to appear or pursue an MBA to pivot into consulting in DC (MBB goal, and yes I am fully aware of the impact on WLB, I am aware and committed to take on the demands of consulting).

Also to answer how I’m 24 with 5YOE. I was given the opportunity to work full-time while achieving my UG degree online. Internship turned into full-time position due to me exceeding expectations of senior management.

I kept following up weekly because I am so much interested in this position as my previous experience directly matches with this position and I know I can add more value to this position. In following up mails I even mentioned that if given the chance, I'd be more than willing to shadow senior members of the team and provide detailed reports on my observations to showcase my commitment. There was no decision uptill now.

Upon following up the HR guy who set up the interview was out of the office till May 22, and will be  which prompted an auto-generated email instructing me to reach out to another emailID which I guess is mostly overall recruiting dept of their company.

I'm an incoming freshman at Lehigh University in PA. I've decided to major in finance, but have a couple basic hardware questions and how it relates to the major.

As a birthday gift a couple months ago, I was bought a M1 Macbook Air. I was ecstatic, but Lehigh recently sent me some mail which included computer recommendations. They noted how finance and business in general was geared towards the Windows OS. They said that many of the professors assigned work with Windows OS in mind, and Mac Book users may struggle as a result. 

I've been doing some research, and I've found that I can run both OS's by using Parallels for Mac. I've heard that there's some limitations however and so I wanted to ask whether it was a worthy investment. 

Will I be able to use excel and any other software necessary for my school/career at the highest level? Or will my career/school be hindered until I can get an actual pc or windows laptop. 

Additional offshoot question, how is the prestige for finance or general business at Lehigh? I'm a typical high school overachiever, and my dream school was Columbia. I chose Lehigh however because of financial reasons but still want to aim as high as possible. Will employers recognize the name in the NY/NJ area? And will it help me secure jobs? 

(Of course, I already know prestige isn't everything. My internships, GPA, and awards will be the biggest impact for future employment, but will the Lehigh name still contribute?)

As an international student with shitty currency in my home country, this financial aid was crucial, and I’m guaranteed to go there if everything else fails, However, I just got accepted into a much higher tier uni after getting off their waitlist. The problem is that scholarships for international students in this uni are extremely scarce and my family cannot cover the full tuition alone. However, depending on how much summer internships pay, there is a chance I’ll use the money to fund the rest of the tuition. That’s why I’m asking: what’s the average pay for a summer intern, be it in a local company or even FAANG? If it matters, I’m already studying full stack web development and hope to have a grasp on React by the time Fall rolls around, and already had an internship at a local company during High School."

 - **ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT'S ME, MARGARET - Movie Theater Tickets**  I have 2 codes available.  **Mods approved** me being able to sell these here. These are up to $8 off the new ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT'S ME, MARGARET movies ticket. If the theater you are going to charges more, then you pay the difference. Tickets need to be purchased on Atom Tickets for this promo. Codes expire on 6/15/2023 or lose value when they aren't in the theater anymore.   $2 per ticket.

 - **iTunes** - Not Verified so have a backup planned. Some of these movies are from back when you used to need both the digital disc and the code to get the movie. You no longer need the disc to redeem these but they will probably redeem in SD quality. There are also a few codes that are the split portion from a Paramount, Lionsgate or Universal slip.  If you need an iTunes code because you don't use UV, a lot of the codes in the MA section above have the ability for direct redemption on iTunes. Let me know if that is something you need more information about.

I am an international grad student pursuing MS CS in USA. I don't have any internship offer and initially I had the plan of grinding only leetcode and nothing else during whole summer. But while scrutinizing my resume I felt that my .NET experience may be a reason I didn't get many calls for internship. I really don't want to pursue my career again in .NET technology but have interest to pursue in JS especially react or in general front end dev under JS framework. 

With current US market condition, with less openings in MANG. Is it worth only grinding leetcode without any dev exposure. I feel my previous experience is just name sake and I haven't learnt much out of it. I have decided to modify my resume completely with in-depth react knowledge predominantly focusing on front end stuff so that at least any mid level companies where leetcode doesn't have much impact rather experience matters a lot may give me more  interviews atleast. I do grill leetcode but more focus on frontend experience.

Any suggestions guys will be really helpful. Atleast I should land with one full-time offer and shouldn't be in a position right now without any intern offer."

For a majority of my university career, I have held co-op positions or part-time positions based on the nature of my course load. Essentially, I am down to my last 10 courses, 5 courses a semester.

Overview of my projected expenses:

Living Expenses: 
$620/ month for 7 months rent ($4,340)
$100/ month for 8 months internet and phone bill ($800)
$900/ month for groceries and miscellaneous expenses ($7200)
Total Living Expenses: ($12,340)

Tuition:
Projected to be ($7500) for the year 
Networking Conference for my career prospects after graduation ($500)

Total Expenses: Just over 20k ($20,340)

I am currently working a full-time internship and tutoring on the side, I am confidently projecting to have this amount at the end of the summer before school:

Savings: $14,000
Emergency Fund: $1000
Total: $15,000

So overall I’m falling short by a couple thousand. I currently owe OSAP $8,300 and recently, whenever I apply for OSAP I get close to no money (due to significant increase in family income.) My parents refuse to support me financially for University and it’s sort of a ‘figure it out on your own’ situation. 

I was wondering what is the smartest way I can tackle this and afford to come out of this situation debt-free, or close enough. I always get anxious about owing any money (I am aware that I will owe money in the future for housing and cars, misc monthly payments, but as of right now my objective was to graduate debt free to give myself a head start.) 

How should I try to proceed—?"

I’m a freshman at uni and it’s honestly ruining my life.,Advanced-Airport6574,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13nhh0n/how_do_i_become_less_controlling_im_a_freshman_at/,"I (18F) started university in February (I major in Business) and there are A LOT of group projects. And I mean A LOT. 

To be honest, I’ve always been controlling when it came to my personal life, but I’ve always managed to keep it together during high school. 
I think that’s because the school I went to, was one of those very strict, results-focused private schools, and I NEVER had group projects, it was like an “every man for himself” environment. 

Anyway, there’s that, and the fact that I’ve always had a “predisposition” to being that way too, so I thrived in high school. The thing is, I realize most people aren’t that way, but I can’t help myself. The idea of failing because of other people is my worst nightmare, so whenever I have group projects, I freak. 

Needless to say, I don’t have many friends at uni, and the worst thing is, I don’t even want to. I realize should, but I can’t get rid of that “every man for himself” mindset, and I just want to at least have allies (I’m an asshole, I know).

Anyway, what do I do? Everyone already knows that I’m terrible at working with people and I simply cannot change. What advice would you give me to at least pretend I’m not a complete asshole and be less stressed when people don’t work as hard as I do or don’t think like me? 

Oh, another thing! There was this internship (it was a 3 MONTH selection process internship that would look very good on my résumé) and I made it to the very last fase but didn’t get in because, according to my mentor at the company, I “need to reconsider my behavior when working with other people, show more vulnerability and give into other people’s ideas more” (they were all objectively stupid, like objectively WRONG, it wasn’t an opinion thing, they were just objectively BAD, I swear)
ANYWAY. I know I may seem like an arrogant person, but I’m just as harsh with myself as I am to other people, so at least I’m not a hypocrite, right? Lol.
Please help me."

Hey, fellow Redditors! I find myself at a crossroads after graduating from college and could really use some guidance in figuring out my career path. Here's a breakdown of my situation:

I recently completed my degree in gender studies and now that I'm out in the real world, I'm feeling lost and unsure of what steps to take next. While I thought I had a clear plan during my college years, the reality of finding a job in my desired field has been more challenging than I anticipated.

I've sent out numerous job applications, attended interviews, and even done some networking, but I'm still struggling to secure a job that aligns with my interests and qualifications. The rejections and lack of responses are starting to take a toll on my confidence, and I'm beginning to question if I made the right choices during my college years.

I'm torn between the desire to pursue a career in my chosen field, even if it means starting at an entry-level position or taking on internships, and the pressure to find any job to pay off my student loans and support myself financially. The fear of making the wrong career move and getting stuck in a job I'm not passionate about is paralyzing.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have navigated similar situations or have experience in the job market. How did you find your career path after college? What strategies or resources helped you secure a job in your desired field? Did you face any challenges along the way, and how did you overcome them?

If you have any recommendations for specific industries or job search platforms that I should explore, please let me know. Additionally, if you have any tips on how to stay motivated and positive during this uncertain phase, I would be grateful to hear them.

Thank you all in advance for your support and wisdom. This community has always been a source of inspiration, and I'm hoping to gain some clarity and direction as I embark on this career journey."

I am currently a rising senior in college. I just closed out yet another spring semester and as the title suggests, I feel utterly helpless. Growing up, my parents pushed me to focus solely on my education. In high school, when several of my peers began picking up job shifts after school hours or on the weekends, I was not. School was always my first priority, and upon transitioning to college, my parents have continued to support me financially and have encouraged me to focus on my studies rather than a part-time job. Therefore, I unfortunately have little to no work experience. I also have not landed any internships during the summers I’ve spent away from school so far. Matter of fact, last summer I was taking summer classes to catch up with my degree and I may be doing this again this summer as well. Keep in mind I am pursuing a degree in marketing. I’ve reached a point in which I am not passionate about it, and I don’t exactly have an idea of how my future will pan out (nor do I really want it to be working a general 9-5 marketing/corporate job 🥲). But, even if I did suddenly feel somewhat of a pull towards the corporate world, what employer is going to want to hire someone with little to no work experience, especially during the crucial years for work experience that is college? All in all, I feel extremely lost. I feel like in college I’m constantly surrounded by people who are effectively preparing for their futures and actually have an idea of what they want to do, yet here I am just trying to get by without a clue in the world of what it is I want to do or how to get there. The fear of regretting whatever decision I’ll eventually choose to make looms over my head lately like a dark cloud. I know I’m not alone in this, but it truly feels like I am. If anyone has had a similar experience and could provide some insight or even just some kind words, I’d greatly appreciate it."

I would like all of you to evaluate my profile. Thank you in advance!

Education: I have a degree in Electronics Engineering  (took courses like real-time operating system, microprocessor architectures, etc.) from a lesser-known college affiliated with Pune University. I have an 8.51 GPA and was among the top 3 rankers in my department.

Since my first year of engineering, I have been highly interested in computer science and have learnt CS concepts like DSA, DBMS, and OOPS. Additionally, I have a couple of projects to demonstrate my programming skills and have even published a research paper in a Springer publication.

I also undertook a 6-month internship at a well-known US tech company. Currently, I am working as a Java Backend Engineer at a US fintech company, where I have been employed for a year now.

I took the GRE two years ago and received a score of 162 in Quantitative and 155 in Verbal. I am planning to retake the exam and I am confident that I can achieve a score of 166 or higher in Quantitative, although my Verbal score may decrease.

My dream schools are as follows:

1. UMass Amherst
2. Purdue
3. Stony Brook
4. Rutgers
5. Virginia Tech
6. Georgia State

Could you please provide insight into my chances of getting accepted into any of these universities? Additionally, if my chances of admission for the Fall semester are not good, should I consider applying for the Spring intake instead?

I got rejected from 7 universities in US, Canada, and Europe. Even though I still have a couple of unis to wait from, I think they'll be rejects too.

I don't know the reason, but here's my profile:

1. GPA: 3.43
2. IELTS: 7.5
3. GRE: 311
4. Experience as an RA 2 times
5. LoRs from the CEO of a startup I worked at, from the CS department chair and Ph.D. professor, and the last one from an MS senior lecturer.
6. SoP is good too, I think
7. Also founded a startup that was accepted into an incubator and had a few hundred of downloads.
8. I also have \~3 years of experience as a Software Engineer. I started doing internships and working after the 1st course. Nothing fancy, no FAANG companies so far, just startups and medium-size companies.

Applied to Gatech, UCLA, UBC, Western U, UCL, and a few more.

&#x200B;

So my plan for now and for the future is to have some rest, prepare even more for GRE and apply for MSCS at Stanford, as that's my ultimate dream school. You might think that's too ambitious, but I do really like the school, some profs that are working there are amazing as well, so why not try once more?:) I want to study AI there and explore their startup community, as I'm really into this. I hope to apply for Fall 2025.

My questions are:

**1) What should I consider?** Obviously, GRE and IELTS are first, but is there something more to consider that I might be missing?

**2) How can I improve my application?** Unfortunately, I won't be able to fix my GPA, so I need something to counter-balance it. I could also take a GRE subject if that helps. I could search for AI profs to work for, and do some AI projects as well. Is there anything else I could do?

&#x200B;

I'm ready for **any** kind of advice or criticism.

Peace!

13nlkm6,4,2023-05-21,Need feedback on whether I have a shot at MS,kyolichtz,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/13nlkm6/need_feedback_on_whether_i_have_a_shot_at_ms/,"Bit of background about me (25M from India),

I am the sole person to complete a bachelor's degree among my family/relatives - landing a good job post that made elated and have been here for the past 3 years full time as a Machine Learning Engineer at a US MNC which also frequently hires from top colleges like (CMU, GA Tech)

My university degree is in Information Science and Engineering (Equivalent to CSE) but GPA is bad, 6.54 CGPA/57.9%. However, the grades were mainly due to the subjects we were forced to take in the first 2 years like Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering which I disliked and tanked my GPA hard. The college advisors back then suggested not to apply for MS when you had a CGPA of less than 7/10, so I didn't.

The plot of my GPA would most likely be an inverted normal distribution due to the above as my grades did improve significantly post those years.

Mock GRE scores showed I could score 320, I haven't prepared too much yet so I could try for 330.

As for LoRs, I can get a very strong LoR from my university dean as he was the sole guy who believed in me regardless of my GPA and was a great mentor. Additionally, I could get a LoR from my current company's senior director who I regularly work with and also graduated from a top uni.

I have also built a large portion of the ML architecture here and have been awarded numerous times due to my performance, so I can leave on good terms with my employer and potentially come back as an intern or full time hire during my MS.

I also don't have any research papers published yet and have completed 2 internships aside from my work experience.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to try for any top uni in US keeping in mind the above?

========

TLDR; Bachelor's degree grades 6.54 CGPA/57.9%, will get at least 320 GRE, strong LoRs from university dean and senior director at a close to 1 bil $ revenue publicly traded corp - do I have have a shot at a good uni in MSCS or MSDS (preferably top 20)?"

I'm a 23-year-old male who recently landed a research intern role for two months at a company focusing on deep learning (specific details are intentionally vague). Despite having a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, my interest in computer science has grown significantly. I cleared the GATE examination and secured admission to a top college. (currently in my first-year summer break)

Although I lack industry experience, I plan to participate in the upcoming placement season later this year, hoping to secure a job in a research-oriented field. Coding still brings me joy, but I couldn't take many systems courses due to constraints during my academic years. However, I am actively preparing for coding interviews and keeping myself engaged with platforms like LeetCode.

Unfortunately, I don't have any practical experience or impressive projects to showcase. The resume that helped me secure the internship included a few deep learning-based case studies and a small front-end project, mainly to have something to discuss during interviews.

Since my master's thesis project will be in a similar domain, I am keen on finding employment in a relevant field. I am seeking guidance on navigating my career from this point forward. I feel a strong sense of control over my career for the first time, and I don't want to miss out on any opportunities.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you can give me.

Exactly that. She has taken pictures and documented everything she can. Any ideas on what she can do and get compensated because all her items are now compromised and me and her both are not at all financially well. We do our absolute best and it’s barely the minimum and this internship was her path to being able to get out of this situation. She is in debt because she just needs clothes and food she does cook for herself and all that food was compromised she bought a hot plate that had roaches on it. She had bought bed sheets and blankets because she wanted to make sure it was clean clean since the reviews all said bugs were there in the past and now that’s compromised. She brought her clothes. And she hasn’t found anything on them luckily but she is scared that there may be eggs and everything in them. It’s basically her only clothes too. We just think there should be some form of compensation but not sure who from at this point because the company told her the hotel and the hotel should also keep up with standards and inspections. Any help is very appreciated thank you."

I wanted to seek some advise regarding a dilemma I am facing w.r.t pursuing grad studies. 

I am currently graduating with a Btech degree in Computer science (with a specialization in AIML) from a Tier 2 college. I am currently placed at a very good MNC (will be joining in a few months), although not in an SDE or a research based role. The role is at the intersection of SDE and management (hence the remuneration is lesser as compared to top tech roles like SDE, RnD etc). 

I always had the ambition of pursuing an MS degree at a good US university, but now I am unable to decide when would be the right time to do it. 

Here's a little context - Since my current role at work is not a very handsomely paid one (besides my curiosity about the unique intersection based work, some extenuating circumstances led me to accept this role) I do not want to continue this role for long. But working in this huge MNC has also been my dream since childhood, so I want to work here for at least a year. At the same time, I have a feeling that shifting from a huge MNC to any other company (for an SDE role) might create a negative impact on my career profile. (This makes me feel shifting jobs might not be a very promising addition to my profile in terms of corporate brand value of companies, although I might earn more money). 

Hence, this leads me to think that after one year in my current job it might be an appropriate idea for me to pursue an MSCS program (Fall 24). As it is I am not sure I want a 6-7 years of gap before doing an MS. Now, throughout my undergrad I did not gain much experience in dev work (0 dev internships), I ended up doing more AI and research based work. (2 research internships). This makes me a little skeptical, because I want to do a thesis based MSCS program involving AI research which I am aware will steer my career in that direction. I am confused about having less knowledge about dev work and hence not knowing if in some later years, I end up liking dev over research work. Then all the (huge)investment made in the MSCS program might go to waste. And if I apply for Fall 2024, I will barely have 2-3 months in my current job before I start applications - which I am afraid might not be enough time to understand what I like better out of dev and research. On the other hand, with the exponentially increasing competition to secure MSCS admits, I am afraid the option of a few years of work and then applying, might make the chances even more difficult as while trying to explore dev domains, I will lose touch with my research work. This I guess will make it difficult for me to validate my credibility when I approach professors for thesis later on.

Thus the fork at which I find myself is this - given the context, I have three options, one - to apply for MSCS (thesis) Fall 24 while working for one year, two - to change to tech intensive jobs (SDE) irrespective of corporate values of present and later companies and then apply after 3-4 years, three - to remain in this role for 2 years, gain the experience of being a part of a huge tech giant, and then apply in Fall 25?

I am aware that an MS degree is a huge investment, hence I want to be sure of the choice that I am making for myself. Also, this being my first post here, please feel free to correct me if I made any mistakes in expressing my thoughts. I wish to seek advise and guidance on how I can resolve this dilemma. 

Thank you everyone for your time!"

People have told me to just pick one of the languages (leaning towards Python) and dive in right away. Thats how you pick up most things.

I'm 20 from western Europe. I have a college degree in Software Development and recently completed an internship at a digital ecommerce agency (as an intern application developer & intern web engineer). To not get too deep into it, this job showed me that I am (atleast skill-wise) capable of working in a medium sized company. I had quite some important tasks and projects all to myself.

I'm not 'rich'. I've always made money to pay for most things I needed (clothes, snacks, etc.) since I was 14. Ever since I turned 17 I'd say I pay almost everything for myself.

I make decent money online, I've had multiple small businesses I've set up online over the years which have made me enough to the point where I don't need a job.

Now the last two years it's been going south. At my peak I was probably earning about 10k a month (for 2-3 months). I have very bad money habits and a lot of my money basically gets thrown into:

* Eating out
* Travelling (this is actually a good use of my money in my opinion)
* Weed
* Gambling
* Shopping

I've always known I had a problem with my value of money, I don't think twice when spending 200-300 euro on something like a pair of jeans. I always thought 'as long as I make it back it's fine'.

Today I gambled away about 1000 euro and with that is the end of my horrendous money use. I want to start saving money and get my value back. I would like to be able to be more satisfied with what I actually have and stop needing more all the time, however I have no clue where to start to change myself."

Hi everyone!

I’m a current undergrad student majoring in Geosciences (with a geoinformatics track). I was wondering if doing a double major in Computer Science would be advisable?

I’m currently an intern that’s writing a lot of code for earth related problems, more specifically hydrology, and I feel like taking some programming classes would be really beneficial for me now and later down the line.

I am aiming to get a MS in Geophysics (or maybe just geosciences, I’m willing to bend around the title as long as I can work in this field), and some of the programs I was looking at have computational geoscience as a track, or environmental data analysis. I would consider dual majoring in Data Science, but my school doesn’t offer that.

TLDR; Should I double major in CS if I want to pursue computational geoscience or is my geoscience degree alone enough? Would a minor in CS suffice or would a dual degree be better? And if the CS program is a BA, would it be viewed as less worthy compared to the BS? 

Thanks so much!

Oh, and another question, does anyone know what are some good graduate programs for geoscience/geophysics in the US? I’ve been looking at the Stanford program the most, but definitely feel like I need backups."

I'm nervous though, because the company works with a lot of languages I have no experience with. I tried to brush up on these languages before the internship starts, but the semester has been overwhelming with schoolwork, so I haven't been successful. I'm a hard worker and I always strive to get the job done, but I'm not as good a programmer as others in my major - far from it. 

I guess what I'm looking for is some reassurances that I can be a shit programmer right now (but a great Googler) and make it through this internship alive and well."

Basically i am doing an internship in the field of aircraft performance and i want to optimize the takeoff and landing trajectories so that both the power demand and energy consumption are minimized. 

This is quite tricky because both of these variables depend on a large number of input parameters (accelerations, velocities etc). So what i did is first conducting a DOE to identify which input parameters influence the outputs the most, by means of partial derivatives and plots. I identified three parameters for the energy and three for the power demand. What i have is two spreadsheets, one for each output, in which each unique combinations of input parameters corresponds to a unique output. Basically what i would like to is to conduct an optimization so that both output parameters are minimized and therefore the ""optimal"" trajectory can be defined. It's challenging because the optimum for one parameter does not necessarily correspond to the optimum for the other.

I'm still a student and this is my first professional experience so I would really benefit from your guidance and tips. I'm not looking for someone ""to do my homework"" but rather trying to understand how to approach such a problem. I've been looking into pareto front analysis but don't really know how to apply it to this specific case."

I haven’t decided on a career path yet but am leaning towards the software engineering industry. 
Please give me some advice and help me pick!

UCSD DS pros:
Prestige, high ranking (for some reason this means a lot of me, maybe bc of my ego. But everyone’s telling me experience and skills > school’s ranking)
Better college life 
Big campus :)
Can do research

UCSD DS cons:
Less DS job opportunities compared to CS
If I hope to pursue swe, I need to take CS courses outside of school at a cc or online course
Might be hard to get tech internships
Heard news that data analysts jobs will be gone due to AI
Realized that data scientist jobs don’t put ds as their degree requirement but put cs instead, so I’ll be competing against the cs major students.

SJSU CS Pros: 
Lots of job opportunities (very important factor)
Decent program overall?
Practical cs courses to prepare for career
Save money by commuting 
Has a 4+1 BSMS program 

SJSU CS Cons:
Less college life (not concerned abt it)
Can’t do research
Less prestige (even though I heard sjsu is well regarded in the Silicon Valley)



Currently, I’m leaning more towards sjsu cs because I’ll have so many job opportunities. But I want to know how much UCSD prestige matters."

Am I overthinking this?,WorriedEbb385,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/13o00vk/trying_for_l1_help_desk_am_i_overthinking_this/,"TLDR: looking for a T1 help desk role and afraid that I am ""overqualified"" and will be expected to over perform with no experience. 


I currently work in healthcare but recently got a BSIT within 13 mos from a uni that allows acceleration. I have A+, Net+, Sec + Project +, AWS CCP, LPI essentials and ITIL. After accelerating through the program, I was kinda burned out and decided to take a break. However, that break ended up being 6mos. Now that I've finally started looking for a help desk role, it feels like I've forgotten everything :( !!!

I'm in the process of reviewing and relearning concepts but I'm getting overwhelmed and think I may be overdoing it? People get hired with no experience for L1 and they teach them..... However I have a degree so I SHOULD know. I'm terrified that I'm going to interview and they are going to ask difficult questions and I'm going to sit there clueless. They will classify me as someone who has certs but knows nothing (which is honestly kinda what I am at this moment. DONT GET ME WRONG THO before each cert exam I would EAT, SLEEP & BREATH the information and knew the ins and outs of most things. I even did most of the labs for practice. I am incredibly mad at myself for not looking for roles sooner or trying to get an internship while I was still getting my degree) 

I recently reformatted my resume and put it out on a few sites (dice, Robert half, v recently hired.com) and had some recruiters reach out with roles (granted they are low paying, but I don't think Im ready yet to interview. Online, I see varying degrees of technical questions being advertised as L1. They make me feel like I need to study more before I apply.
THEN I see posts where it takes hundreds of apps to just get an interview.... Which feels like I'm shooting myself in the foot by not applying. 

ALSO I heard that if candidates are ""overqualified"" they don't like to hire them because they know they will job hop in a few months.

Any advice? Can anyone shed some light on how technical a T1 interview is? What should I expect? Should i continue to put off applying to get back to a place where I know everything off the top of my head? Any study resources/ quick review recommendations? (QUICK REVIEW would be the most helpful because atm it really feels like I'm retaking the courses from the start and it's eating a lot of time. So far I'm focusing on A+ and Net+ since they are the bread & butter) Any sites you recommend for jobs? (I'm on dice, Robert half and just recently signed up for hired.com). Any recommendations for homelab tasks? (Active Directory is already on my list!)

I'm just finished my first year at the university of Tennessee at martin, and am 50% done with my major in computer science with minors in math and electrical engineering (I took quite a few classes in HS).  My favorite thing to do is programming and I'm quite good at it, been working on a lot of projects.  What I'm particularly interested in is low level programming, mostly OS and embedded systems and firmware programming, as well as graphics programming (I love making video games from scratch in openGL).  My main languages are C, C++, rust, and assembly.  Someone told me I should instead switch to computer engineering, which I used to be in.  However, I switched to straight up computer science because I like programming alott and I would graduate much faster.  This summer, I've been reading some textbooks on linear circuits and embedded systems though, and I like it a lot.  So this got me thinking, maybe I should do computer engineering.  Problem is, I don't want to get stuck in a job mostly doing hardware.  And likewise, I don't want to get stuck in a web development or data science job (not anything wrong with those, just not my thing). So I'm at this weird crossroads where I don't know if I should do computer science or computer engineering.  Here is a list of pros and cons based on my interests:

Computer science: pros {
-Much more programming and software engineering
-graduate almost 2 years faster, time to pursue masters/PhD
-still includes vast knowledge of computer architecture, OS, firmware but more on software side
-more math related knowledge
-can still pursue minors in EE and math without any penalty
-much more focused coursework, ability to make myself better in field instead of spreading it out
-my college has a good cs program
-remote internships and jobs are way better for my current situation
}
Computer science: cons {
-more competitive job field
-I'm not super interested in high level programming (like python, js, c#) or things like AI, data science, abstracted theory
-way too much focus on web development in today's job market, most people end up there (I'm not a big fan of webdev)
}

Computer engineering: pros {
-much more practical knowledge of how computers work
-combine electrical engineering coursework and computer science
-more focus on extremely low level systems
-be able to troubleshoot at the lowest level
-workonn supercomputers, etc.
}
Computer engineering: cons {
-perhaps too hardware focused
-much more time in school
-must take the engineering test at the end
-most likely will have to wait on a masters until later
-newer and (supposedly) not very good program compared to cs at my college
-jobs will most likely be more in person
}

These are just my personal thoughts that I typed up real quick, but it would be really nice if any people experienced in one or both fields could help me out a little in finding out what I should do or if there are any flaws in any of my above arguments.  I would love to hear some feedback, thanks guys!"

I took a “gap year” which turned into 2 with my savings, and have now been working a manual labor job for 12$ an hour for the last 6 months. I actually enjoyed this job for a while and didn’t care about the money, but my parents have run into financial troubles and I need to get back to using my degree to be able to help them out. 

About me: I am in my mid 20s, graduated from a great CS program in the PNW with a couple of internships under me (one a big blah blah company) and went to work at another big blah company for 1.5 years after graduation. I’ve only done backend development besides my very first internship freshmen/sophomore year.

How do I break back into the industry? I know the market isn’t hot right now, but I feel I definitely have great experience for essentially a junior-mid level engineer and know I would be doing great without this massive black hole sized gap on my resume.

I hope whoever reads this is well :) I am an international student aiming to apply for PhDs in the US/UK for the upcoming academic year. I wanted to share a small background on my profile so far and had some questions regarding my applications. I tried searching some on Reddit but wasn't able to find concrete answers so would really appreciate this x

**Background:**

I completed my undergrad in bioinformatics back in 2019 with cum laude honors - 3.63 (just not smart academically). I was quite active during my undergraduate. I completed 3 internships in various fields of both wet and dry labs. I was also able to get some travel grants and a paid bioinformatics internship which led me to present internationally at a conference in China (I was the only undergrad invited). I got to add my name to 2 publications. I also worked as a lab assistant and TA for major courses. After graduating I also worked as a junior teaching fellow at my alma mater.

In 2020, moved to the UK and won a scholarship to study cancer immunology masters. Did well the first semester then homesickness, isolation, and depression hit my academics hard. Just barely graduated with a pass but luckily earned a merit on my master's dissertation. Had a horrible experience as I didn't get to have much experience in the lab and my supervisor was non-existent. I realized I wanted to get back into bioinformatics.

I worked at a covid testing company for a few months (got some experience working with NGS and identifying covid VoCs.) Currently in Oxford, worked my way up from research tech to research assistant. The project is mostly involved with COVID infection surveys and with automated ELISA screenings. Not much coding or genomics. I recently started a new role as an RA in a structural biology lab and they promised me the opportunity to explore potential bioinformatics projects. So fingers crossed.

*I was away from school so had to relearn Python through an online boot camp and aim to specialize in machine learning. I was the first to graduate in bioinformatics from my uni as it was a relatively new major and was severely underfunded and lack of teaching resources. I had to literally learn on my own.*

**Questions:**

*Schools:*

Based on my profile am I being too ambitious to apply to places like Harvard/Stanford and Oxbridge?

1. Harvard's Biomedical Informatics and Genomics Ph.D. program
2. Oxford's Genomics Medicine and Statistics
3. Cambridge's Sanger Institute

*Transcripts/Grades:*

I had to retake some courses in my master's which affected my grades. I am extremely embarrassed about that. I don't know how can I overcome that on my application.

*Supervisors or PIs:*

1. Should I email professors before applying? Especially for general admission programs?

*Recommendation letters:*

1. I need 3 references and I am torn as to whom should I choose. In my current role even though it is research, it is just routine work. It is led by a project manager, not a PI. Can I add him as a reference? The actual PIs are big shots and hardly know us.
2. My new role is more research focused but by the time applications begin it won't be enough time for me to work on them.
3. I could ask my MSc supervisor for recommendations but I am scared he will forget or ignore me as he did with a friend of mine who lost 2 PhDs.

*CVs:*

1. Apart from research roles, should I add my teaching experiences as well?

*Personal Statement:*

1. I have no idea! Completely lost and need help with writer's block! Any resources would be extremely helpful!

GREs:

Most of these programs mentioned GRE as an optional thing. I don't have the time or the money to invest in it. Do I still take it?

Thank you for reading such a long message. I am really feeling down but also have this intense desire to get into a PhD program (Fall 2024). I would really like some honest suggestions. Thank you."

13o7sqe,6,2023-05-21,Copying a diagram and using a new source automatically,thefantomist,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/13o7sqe/copying_a_diagram_and_using_a_new_source/,"Context:

I am currently creating a project management tool in excel during an internship. I want to have one big excel file with a main sheet for a quick overview and another sheet per project. There should be a template for the project sheets that employees can copy to create another project. One element of this template is a gantt diagram which pulls its data from a table on the same sheet.

Now the problem:

Because I want the diagram to dynamically change, depending on how many lines there are in the table, I had to define a name for every column and made that the source. If I now copy the sheet, a new name gets created, but the new diagram uses the fixed cells as a source, rather than the names. How do I change that automatically?

I use Excel in MS 365 on desktop, am open to VBA solutions."

13o94ss,1,2023-05-21,help prioritizing summer ecs,elementnotfound001,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13o94ss/help_prioritizing_summer_ecs/,"Hey! I currently am having some trouble planning out my summer and making sure I don't get burnt out in the process. Currently, I have the following opportunities and want to know which ones would be the most beneficial for the admission process.  


1. ML research in health tech---this is a 10 week remote research program with a mentor.
2. Unpaid internship @ small CS company---not sure about the details yet but it is unpaid, remote, and I would learn about programming methodologies and utilize my skills.
3. Paid TA for college's hs summer camp---would be a TA for a T10 university's summer camp for high schoolers---afaik no other hs people were selected.

I'm having a hard time deciding which ones to do. Each one has it's pros and cons. They all seem interesting and something I want to do. However, I've had issues with burnout in the past and want to make sure I'm choosing ones that will benefit me the most. (I want to major in CS btw)"

13oaeth,0,2023-05-21,Did my (M32) legal problems actually just disappear?,FastandFortunate,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/13oaeth/did_my_m32_legal_problems_actually_just_disappear/,"TL;DR: I never appeared in court for speeding 10+ years ago, moved back and got my license restored. Where did my problems go?  
In 2010 I was a 19 year-old college student with a penchant for cars. Because I was a poorly adjusted 19 year-old college student with a penchant for cars, I indulged in behavior best described as “Fast and Furious-adjacent wannabe”--but the first F&F movies before they started going to space.  
Shortly after returning to California after my sophomore year, I was pulled over while racing a random guy down the highway. This came as a shock to nobody, including me. The CHP did not find it as cool as I did when they wrote “110+”  in the “speed” section of the ticket. The CHP cuffed me and threw me in the back of the car, but I was released because there wasn’t a flatbed tow truck available to deal with my sister’s 4-wheel-drive car. Instead I was ordered to appear in court.   
I was given a deadline to schedule my court appearance and had to report to a local office to do this. Instead of doing this, I went to the office and requested they delay the deadline for scheduling my court date. And like the garbage person I was at 19, I didn’t bother showing up to that second scheduling deadline because the summer was over and I was headed back to school across the country. Court would be a problem for future me.  
One day, while I was abroad for part of my junior year, my mom called to tell me that a police officer had come by the house looking for me. She told them I was abroad and the police left. I finally confessed the situation to my  parents and told them I would handle it when I came home. But I never came home. They moved out of the country before I even finished my junior year.   
What transpired next isn’t particularly important. I got an internship in that same country after my junior year ended. I knew by this point my license had been suspended, I believe for “failure to appear,” but I was on the other side of the world and didn’t care. After college I got a full time job at that same company. I hadn’t needed to return to California since. I only returned once to the US and the fact that I might have a bench warrant became so inconsequential that I forgot about it entirely.   
Three years ago, my company was bought by a US-based company and I was contacted by Payroll a few months after the acquisition because they received an inquiry from California where the company is based. Payroll said I should call a number to deal with it because it’s often the “first step before wage-garnishment.” For the first time in years I remembered my situation. I called the number and explained my situation. After hearing me out, the man on the phone kindly said something along the lines of “sir, this is just payment processing. I don’t even know what the fine is for.” He took my credit card info, I paid roughly $500 USD and that was that.   
Soon after, I forgot about the situation again. Years passed.   
In December I was contacted by a headhunter about an incredible job back in California. I didn’t think I’d get through the first round of interviews but by February we were negotiating compensation. It all seemed too good to be true. It came time for my background check and I explained to the hiring manager that I had this outstanding issue. She said not to worry because my background check came up clear. “What? How?” I thought.   
I got the job. I moved back. I explained to HR and to my boss the situation before I accepted and they told me that the company provides legal insurance to employees to deal with problems like these.   
I accepted the job. My wife and I moved across the world. We rented an apartment, we bought a car (in my wife’s name)–she’s known about this issue but until now it had no impact on our lives.   
She went to the DMV to register the car and asked “hey what does my dumbass husband need to do?”–my wife’s charm still amazes me even after 10 years together.   
According to the person at the DMV, I needed to pay some kind of fee (a fine?) of about $100 USD and then retake my written test since my license expired. That was it. No court. No cuffs. No massive fine and deserved community service. I couldn’t believe it. I had planned to contact a lawyer as soon as my insurance benefits took effect but now it seemed to be moot.  
The next week I went to the DMV fully expecting I was walking into a trap, I just knew I would go to the desk, the person would say something into the phone and I’d get tackled by the police. But no. I walked in, paid the money, took my test and walked out with a piece of paper, my temporary license. Two weeks later my official license arrived. 

10+ years ago I was lucky I got pulled over instead of killing someone. I paid a few hundred bucks and I’m just back in the game?  
Where did my legal problems go?  I'm curious to know why and how this happened."

I'm about to graduate from a university in the United States with a major in Statistics and a minor in computer science. I've been entertaining the idea of relocating to Germany for a while now, and I am now ready to make that leap. My reasons for this move are diverse, but mainly, I'm drawn to the country's rich culture, quality of life, and the promising tech industry.  
  
I'm particularly interested in a couple of specific topics that I hope some of you may provide insight on:  
  
Studying Online from Germany: I intend to continue my studies online via a US-based university while visiting Germany as a tourist. Is this legally permissible? Will I face any significant hurdles when it comes to taxation, visas, or any other legalities that I need to be aware of?  
  
Internships for Non-EU Citizens: As part of my professional development, I'd like to gain some hands-on experience in my field through internships in Germany. I'm aware that the job market is relatively welcoming for tech professionals, but I'm uncertain about the availability and legality of internships for non-EU citizens like myself. If anyone has experiences to share or guidance on how to navigate the German internship scene, it would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Additional information that might be useful: I have a basic proficiency in German (currently at B1 level) and plan to improve further. I also have some savings to facilitate the move but would ideally like to become financially self-sufficient as soon as possible.  
  
Any help, tips, or shared experiences would be invaluable to me at this stage. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I look forward to any advice you all might have!  
  
All the best!"

I am currently doing a 2 year programming diploma from a college in Toronto, I'm really worried it would be very difficult for me to secure a job after completing the program. I have a couple of questions:

- What are some fields that I could move into that would not be affected too much by AI and over saturation?

- Do you think it is better to move into IT rather than software development in terms of job security and demand in the future?

- Is there anyway to increase my chances of getting hired since I don't have a degree. I'm thinking of doing Azure/AWS certifications since my internship team is using those technologies at work. I can't afford to complete a degree right now.

-Do employers hire co-op students after graduation? I am currently in an 8 month co-op and only have 4 months left to graduate from the diploma. Any tips?

(I am in Canada but I would appreciate any feedback in general)"

I need major advice Help please!

I’m a junior in college I just started a new internship. There is a fellow girl intern who is pretty out of my league, however she is kinda flirtatious with me. For example she goes out of her way to talk to me she walks up to my car before work to talk to me, and we playfully insult one another elementary school type 😂. So we went to a non work event with some fellow interns me and her happened to sit beside one another she talked to me the whole time and had a few drinks with me she became kinda touch nothing crazy so I just assumed it was the drinks. This weekend we were going to go to a voluntary work event to hang out with our bosses we both showed interest in going so she texted me to go with her our bosses weren’t there when we got their we walked around for a little bit just casually talking. We then both went our separate ways a part of me felt I should of asked her to do something else but I let it slip. I’m feeling something with her but have no idea if she’s feeling me but I am starting to catch a vibe. I don’t wanna fumble the bag or get sucked into the friendzone so advice is welcome!"

13ogm9z,25,2023-05-22,"I'm really embarrassed to make this post, but I'm a jobless 2022 grad...",WagieFromThirdWorld,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/13ogm9z/im_really_embarrassed_to_make_this_post_but_im_a/,"Graduated at the end of last September. Seeing my juniors (2023, 2024 grads) getting their jobs is just a soul-crushing experience. Yes, I had an internship last November, but I quit at the end of January because I hated how chaotic and unorganized the software engineering process was. Now, I'm not getting any call backs from any of the startups in [wellfound.com](https://wellfound.com).

I blame this on myself, if I had to be honest. Maybe I should have stayed with one domain, but I kept jumping between ML/DL, web dev, blockchain, graphics programming, system programming and now finally back to web dev, which I hate: I hate React, I hate JS/TS, I hate testing API, I hate all of it (except writing the backend, I guess, which I neither like, nor dislike) , I spent two weeks playing with Vulkan in C and regret not knowing about this before, but now I am forced to choose good old web dev because it is easier, not some niche tech, has less concepts to grasp and possibly my only chance at escaping unemployment."
13ogo2y,6,2023-05-22,All the negative things I hear about being a teacher make me nervous as a soon-to-be student teacher,idk_honestly24,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/13ogo2y/all_the_negative_things_i_hear_about_being_a/,"Hello! I would first like to mention that I am new to Reddit.

I just finished my freshman year of college so I haven't had much experience in an actual classroom yet- this will start next semester. I'm majoring in early childhood education. I took a class in high school which involved a little internship in a kindergarten class as well as a class during this last semester called Foundations of Numbers- it was an intro to teaching kids math.

I've been planning on becoming a teacher since middle school and while I'm excited, I'm also very nervous. Between reading through this sub and hearing things in general I have a lot of worries now. Worries about dealing with behavioral issues, parents, admin, stuff like that, also all the school shooting stuff terrifies me.

It sounds way harder than I anticipated especially now that I'm in college and it's becoming real. It's my absolute dream to teach elementary but what if I can't do it? I've always been sensitive and I've heard so many things about parents/admin/coworkers being a pain. Or what if college doesn't prepare me enough?

Feeling stressed. Any advice or positive experiences would be greatly appreciated."

13oibdy,14,2023-05-22,For Incoming Engineering Transfer Students,Sprinkles98899,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/13oibdy/for_incoming_engineering_transfer_students/,"I’m a current student at UCLA studying mechanical engineering, and I transferred in from a CC Fall of the 21-22 academic year. I’ve replied to a few questions posed by prospective transfer students in the UCLA sub, and have had a number of people DM me with further questions about my experiences as a transfer student. I’ve enjoyed answering these questions, and wanted to offer some general insight here, specifically as an engineering transfer student. Others are welcomed to pose further questions, and to share your own experiences.

&#x200B;

1. How’s the quarter system?

10 weeks + 1 week for final exams. My short and sweet is: if you’re not buckling down with the work on day-one, you’re falling behind. This is something that took me a few quarters to get used to. Having come from 16-week semesters, I do prefer the quarter system, as it’s nice to have your schedule refreshed more frequently, especially when you’re taking a class that you’re not enjoying.

&#x200B;

2. Is graduating in two years reasonable?

Having had all of the required courses at UCLA completed upon transfer, as well as the “recommended” Chem courses, I am on track to conclude my time at UCLA in 2 years + 2 quarters. This is with 3 courses per quarter, and very occasionally 4. Having more courses completed at your CC, Summer sessions, and/or committing to 4 courses/quarter are ways to get this done more quickly. 2 years can definitely be done, but an extra couple of quarters or year is quite common, given the demands of engineering courses.

&#x200B;

3. Are classes hard to get into?

I get the feeling that undergrad students knocking out lower-division courses have a harder time with course availability. I’ve been able to secure every course that I’ve set on my plan, although it wouldn't be unheard of to have to petition to enroll in a full course, or wait until another quarter when your registration priority improves. Worthy of note: you will have priority registration for your first quarter, so no stress on day-one.

&#x200B;

4. Internships?

UCLA hosts hiring events for engineering students. The biggest one of the academic year is held in the Fall (October?) so keep an eye out for that. Many companies are in full intern-hiring-mode in the Fall, although intern hiring activity runs to some degree year-round. Also, engineering internships are definitely paid, or at least, I’ve never heard of one that wasn’t.

&#x200B;

5. General Advice?

If you’ve committed to UCLA as a transfer, and are looking for a way to hit the ground running your first quarter, keep an eye on your email for info about the “Summer Accelerator Program”. It’s a series of zoom workshops offered to incoming engineering transfer students in which you can learn a TON of valuable info, including how to make the most of your time at UCLA. They also offer hands-on technical skills workshops for SolidWorks/CAD, C++/python, HTML and basic circuitry. There’s also a hackathon in which you will build and program some sort of robot as part of a team, which is an excellent project to include on your resume. I took full advantage of all that the Summer Accelerator had to offer, and I can’t speak highly enough about this program. It’s also where I made pretty much every friend that I have on campus nearly two years later.

I hope this info is helpful. Welcome UCLA Transfers!"
13ojxbv,7,2023-05-22,im concerned about my mom's mental health,dis_is_yash,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13ojxbv/im_concerned_about_my_moms_mental_health/,"so lets get straight to tha point, last year, in November December, my mom said, shes ""hearing"" some stuff, and she thought that me adb my brother are being controlled by ""phone"" and ""earphones"", she thinks that our phone is hacked and is is hacked hy our ""taiji"". so taiji is not a good person, she lost her husband, and she blamed us for his death and said we did ""black magic"" and stuff to kill him, which is completely false. So she said very bad things to my father and mother, we live in the same house, us on groung and taiji on 1st floor, we have a small house, 2 room, 1 occupied by my granny, and in other, me, mom dad and my brother, we all live.

My father lost his job due to covid in 2021 and from then, its been too hard for us, we were struggling soo much, just to get decent food, my father had an accident, his left leg is a bit short, so he didn't got a job, anyways so we were struggling.

But  in November my brother got an internship in a company, and, now he is permanent there, he has work from home, so hes has to sit on laptop for almost 7-8 hours.

Back to my mom, shes sometimes do wierd and irritating stuff, due to which we all get irritated and shout at her, so she thinks that ""dekha, control ho rahe ho"" and its gets us mad, now due to this, nov, dec and jan, been so worse for us, we had fight almost daily and is was so depressing, but fortunately in January she started behaving decently, Normally until now, a day before yesterday, she again started acting weirdly, and started saying those shit again.


Now if i tell her to go to a doctor, she thinks that ""ye muje pagal karna chahte he, and mujhe pagal khane bhej ke, mere baccho ki zindagi barbaad karna chahte he"" im very tensed these days, she dont listens to us, now, we started ignoring her a bit, and this makes me feel bad as shes my mother and shes in a bad state and i cant do anything to save her 

Ive passed 12th and im going to give my college test, CUET and im so much tensed now, i cant do anything, my borther is so fed up by mom ans dad's fight, that hes really dont give and fuck, and says that he will leave them and they will live alone forever, after he pays my college fees. this makes her believe that my brother is getting controlled.

Huh, im really really glad that if you read it till here, i just wanted to share and you can comment if you have any solution,.thank you guys."

Posting this to look for ways to break into software engineering but also just general life advice. 

I’ve had my struggles over the past decade. I’ve lost jobs and been kicked out of groups. I should also mention I was just diagnosed with autism a year ago. I have professional support. I’m still single and working on myself as a person before getting into a relationship.

Now I’m leaving my PhD program as I would like to start earning ASAP. My supervisor and I have decided not to move forward with our project.

I need to start earning. I only have about $10k in savings and living with parents now. As I’ve been working in academic/research jobs and internships for the past several years, it’s been tough saving money, but to be frank I haven’t been making the most frugal decisions at times. I would like to retire someday of course at least somewhat comfortably. 

I'm doing a software engineering BootCamp that starts next week, and hopefully, I can follow it up with a Master's in Data Science (if needed) eventually so I can break into more upper-level positions. 

I have skills including research, programming (many languages in areas of data science, maths/science research, engineering, virtual/augmented reality, game development), writing (I used to be a journalist actually), some artistic skills (3D art and animation, design for UI/UX and graphics, data-based animation). Not that it’s job-relevant, but I also enjoy running and cosplaying. 

Looking for any sort of general advice/guidance. Financially, personally/psychologically, career-wise, or even in terms of relationships."

Sunt student in anul 3 la FEAA pe specializarea de informatică economică. 

In prezent îmi caut internshipuri, și aș vrea să îmi duc cariera spre informatică, nu economie. Știam din start ca facultatea va fi un mic dezavantaj comparativ cu cei de la info sau poli, însă la cât de în vogă era toată bula IT și cum se faceau angajări in prostie, plus discuții cu 4 recruiteri, am decis că îmi voi asuma acest dezavantaj.

Acum evident că situația sta mai altfel. Am aplicat la mai multe poziții ca developer și am fost respins, însă Bosch m-au sunat sa imi propuna un internship pe ""controlling"". Nu am reușit să aflu exact ce înseamnă asta, însă din requirements m-am prins ca nu e programare, ci doar ceva office job și în zona financiară (cerea studii in management, administrative, economy etc).

 Dat fiind faptul ca am nevoie mare de un internship, am acceptat un interviu. In urma acestuia, am aflat că desi e in zona financiară (direct buying mai exact), au inceput sa foloseasca tehnologii precum Python si SQL pentru automatizări (fix ce am eu un CV, probabil de aia mi-au propus interviu) si au spus ca aproximativ 50% din ce fac e automatizarea.

Acum as vrea păreri... 

De acceptat as accepta oricum dacă imi dau ofertă, dar sunt curios cat de usor sau greu ar fi ca pe viitor sa tranzitionez pe ceva in domeniul informaticii, dat fiind faptul ca as lucra totusi macar superficial cu unele limbaje/tehnologii?

Și daca nu primesc ofertă, ce ar fi mai inteligent sa fac? Sa astept până primesc ceva direct pe IT, sau să ma orientez mai mult spre poziții precum aceasta, ca să incep cat mai rapid, cu speranta ca tranzitez ulterior? 

De menționat că de job am nevoie 100% in urmatoarele luni, fie el in IT, financiar sau casier la Profi.

TLDR: Sudent anul 3 la FEAA, informatica economică. Vreau sa lucrez in viitor in IT, dar concluzionez că mi-ar fi mai usor sa primesc un internship in domeniul financiar, sales etc in care să folosesc totuși și anumite tehnologii precum python, power bi, sql etc (pentru automatizări de ex). Ar fi ok sa ma orientez spre un astfel de internship in ideea ca incep mai rapid si pot face apoi tranzitia spre IT? Am nevoie de job indiferent ca e informatică, economie, sau casier."

Interviews

(Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)

Funnily enough, I got rejected or waitlist from every school I had an interview and only got into schools I didn't interview. But to list the schools below:

MIT: 8/10, the interview ended 20 minute early lol

Stanford: 10/10, favorite interview of the entire process

Princeton: 9.5/10

Yale: 10/10, really interesting to talk with another poli sci major

Dartmouth: 9.5/10, interview lasted almost 2 hours 

Essays

(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)

Early Round Essays: 7/10. I spent a lot of time writing and started from last summer, but the essays weren't detailed and didn't reveal a lot about my personality. 

Regular Round Essays: 8.5/10. After my early round deferral from a T5, I completly  revised main essay and grinded supplements over winter break. In general, I spent less time in the regular round as I only usually had a couple of days to write a school's essays, but I never had to write to the deadline(except in certain cases)

Rejections(this is a long one):

Additional Information:

Overall, I would have to heavily emphasize the importance of writing quality essays, as I think I ultimately messed up my chances at Princeton with a crappy main essay. In addition, I would have probably ED'd or used the early application more smartly and not blindly throw REA at a t5. All in all though, it worked out in the end."

Hello people 

Many people here do oppose getting a degree with Game in it and many suggest to get into one if you have the money to do so. And collectively all say that its not the degree that matters but the Portfolio and I strongly agree with that.

While researching Pros and Cons I talked to many current students and Alumni of different Game related programs. They say the degree was helpful and if helped with making connections and the co-op internship also helped.

While I do plan to go to University/college for a degree I have already started learning basic animation in my HS and coding through freecodecamp. ( attaching my first work on Adobe Animate made last week) 

My current situation is that My family is well off to pay for the degree and I if I don’t directly get into the Game industry I will try getting into related industries through my portfolio. And have a Family business as a backup until i get a job.

Lastly this is the list of Schools I plan to apply to

Sheridan - Game design ( animation too but ik not easy to get into)

York university - BA Digital Media ( Game Art specialization)

Brock University- BA Game Art & Design 

Emily Carr University of Art & Design - bachelor Media Arts ( 3D computer animation) 

If you know about the school or have studied there please tell me about the good and bad of the course and any other important information.
Also give other School suggestions if you have any in mind.

And would love another perspective on my opinion and thoughts. 

Thanks and sorry for such a long post."

I am a rising senior who has CS declared as a major and almost done with my requirements. I am thinking of changing my major from CS to math for several reasons - I like math way more than I like CS, I get much better grades in math classes, and our CS department is absolutely the worst while our math department is absolutely the best. If I switch, I would have to stay an extra semester (still with financial aid) but I will have a chance to improve my GPA with that extra semester. 

I am doing a SWE internship over summer so a lot of things on my resume are already CS-oriented and I still have take a lot of classes in CS and have my minor. 

Do you think I could do that and still work in the industry? Will there be a disadvantage because I don’t have a CS major?"

As such, UTSG Math and Physical Sciences looks like my next best option. I'm looking to work in Data Science, and maybe quant finance in the near future (if that's even possible), and I was wondering if this program would be a good fit considering I can't go to UW Math. I have a couple of questions about the program.

1. What would be the best specialization for my intended career path? Right now, I'm looking at Specialist in Statistical Science: Methods and Practice as originally, I wanted to double major in Computational Math/Combinatorics and Statistics at UW, so is there anything that would be roughly equivalent at UofT? How hard are the POST requirements to even get into this specialization?
2. What's ASIP like? Will I still be able to get decent internship opportunities at maybe the banks in Canada or even companies in America? How hard is it to get into ASIP, and would it even be worth it, or should I just try to get internships on my own? Also, how big is the gap between UW co-op and ASIP?

13p0r9d,1,2023-05-22,How do I break into a friend group?,DoctorMore7108,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13p0r9d/how_do_i_break_into_a_friend_group/,"I (25M) recently moved back to the city I went to college with after about 3 years. I went home for most of Covid because that where my job was, and also for year internship in my home  town. I moved back up for a few reasons, but the main reason was to see my friends again, and to be able to keep in touch with them more easily. 

For some context all throughout college I didn't  have a specific friend group I was part of. I floated from group to group and had lunch, went to parties etc with everyone. There are 3 or 4 main groups within my class and I got on with all of them. 

There was a group of 4 friends I wasn't necessarily closer too, but I was probably perceived closer to by other friends. That group fell apart during covid for a number of reasons, mainly because there was one girl calling the shots, and she was low key a bit of a bully. I had panic attacks with her on holiday, which she responded very poorly to, she body shamed me, often condesendinly overexplained, excluded me and another girl etc. As a result I'm not comfortable around her.

My problem is that although I am now closer to my friends, I feel like people think I'm being invited to other things by other people, and thus excluding me. Not purposefully, I'm aware there is no malice in the exclusion, in most cases. 

This all boils up to me trying to organise a party for my  birthday on a bank holiday, only to find everyone had organised trips out of town with their respective groups, and I ended up alone on my birthday, which was a shitty feeling to say the least.

I have resorted to trying my best to break into another group  but I'm struggling to find reasons to ask them to hang out. I'm not close enough with all of them to ask them all to do something and the friends I am closer with all have been extremely busy over the last few weeks ( I know that this is true and not an excuse). The loneliness is really starting to affect my mental health. 
Any suggestions??

TLDR I want to reconnect with old friends who are part of a tight knit group and don't know how."

13p1prm,2,2023-05-22,Just took my last final for the semester. Semester recap from Computer Engineering Major,TheMatrixMachine,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/13p1prm/just_took_my_last_final_for_the_semester_semester/,"It's been a rough semester. I realize that I definitely overloaded. That is, my expectations of myself were too high and it bit me in the ass later. I got sick twice during the semester as well. I've noticed I tend to get sick when stressed out so that's probably further evidence of overload. 

I started the semester with 5 classes (linear and differential equations, digital circuits I, operating systems, software engineering I, advanced algorithm design), a part time job (8-15hrs/week), robotics club, and treasurer on a car club.

Around mid terms, I realized it was too much. I quit the job and left on good terms so I could come back later. My manager agreed to take me back this summer. I realized that it still wasn't enough so I withdrew from digital circuits class.

It's very uncertain whether I'm passing many of these classes. Software engineering, operating systems, and linear and differential equations all have median exam scores around 60% but I expect some of them will get curved. Professors are just now grading homeworks. My operating systems mid term (March) wasn't graded until last week.

I basically took an L on the 2nd linear and differential equations mid term since the final mid term score replaces the lowest mid term score. I got 88% on the first mid term. The exams for this class are hard: no calculator or notes allowed. You need to memorize all of the math. This professor will probably not curve the tests. Web assign homework and a zoom lecture. Professor doesn't even grade the mid terms himself. If I wasn't so busy earlier in the semester, I could have maybe distributed studying better. I think I got half the questions on the final exam completely correct and I'll get partial credit on the rest of the questions. 

I feel very uncertain about how well I did in classes. I know I could have done better if I had taken less. It would have taken little effort to do better on a few tests and assignments than I did but I lacked the time to do that properly. 

If I had to do it again, 4 upper division classes is probably what I'm comfortable with. I enjoy having the job and club activities so I'm not in my apartment all the time. The robotics club also has some career opportunities since a lot of alumni are involved there including people at Google, NASA, and Intel.

Moving forward, my goal for the summer is to work 4 days a week (hopefully consequtively) (~30hrs/week) and leave 3 days free. During those 3 days, I will be studying data structures since my failure to pass assessment skill tests to get internship interviews is attributed to lack of practice with the data structures. I also have a lot of work outlined to do on my car. I think it is reasonable to expect I can accomplish these things and have some time for whatever miscellaneous activities I want to do during summer.

My gpa is still hurting. I'm at ~2.9 right now but it may drop this semester. I think my study efficiency has improved since last year. The bottleneck this semester has been overload. If I'm more careful about that, I think my grades will improve. My goal is to finish with >3.0. I'm 23 years old and I've been in school for 5 semesters now. I have about 2 years left. I actually don't know anyone who managed to graduate in 4 years. Most people need 5 since classes are pre requisite all the way up and failing one pushes graduation a semester out.

Hopefully this helps someone out with understanding what it's like to be in an engineering program. Feel free to share advice too."
13p1ulj,1,2023-05-22,How would you market yourself as a former overachiever looking to jump-start your career after squandering two years after college graduation?,beeemperor0810,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13p1ulj/how_would_you_market_yourself_as_a_former/,"&#x200B;

Behold: some exhaustive, arguably excessive context.

I’ve been an overachiever for as long as I can remember. In grade school, I was a prototypical gifted kid: intellectually under-stimulated to the point of nuisance, even in the most advanced reading group or the accelerated math class. When my teachers (rightly) deemed my presence in the classroom insufferable, I skipped a grade under the guise of an “insufficiently challenging curriculum”. I excelled in spelling bees, chess tournaments, and math competitions. Every standardized test I encountered, I made my bitch. I got excellent grades in the most advanced classes, and I was almost painfully involved in extracurricular activities. Shortly prior to graduating second in my class, I accepted a full academic scholarship to a nearby state school.  
  
I maintained this momentum in college. I still didn’t find the curriculum particularly challenging, which allowed me to apply myself to extracurriculars. Each semester, I juggled at least one internship and half a dozen on-campus organizations, in addition to the maximum course load my academic advisors would approve. I wrote my classmates’ papers for some extra cash. I wrote 5 capstone thesis papers just to feel something. When there were no more capstone classes left to take, I launched an accredited academic journal, for which I served as editor-in-chief. I graduated university in three years with a 3.99 GPA and distinctions in both majors. I was 20 years old.  
  
I planned on attending law school straight out of undergrad. However, due, in large part, to my then-undiagnosed ADHD, I had applied in the last week of the rolling admissions cycle. As a result, I had gotten into a few safety schools, but found myself waitlisted by 11 of the 12 top-20 schools I had applied to. Devastated, I reached out to an advisor, who reviewed my materials and reaffirmed that this outcome reflected my inability to stay abreast of deadlines, rather than any fault inherent to my application itself. He urged me to re-apply the following cycle. Apparently, waitlists from those schools so late in the cycle spoke to the caliber of my application. I could reasonably expect get into a few of my top-choice schools – assuming, of course, that I applied in September and not March.  
  
I figured I would do just that. Granted, it was a shame to have misused all that time dawdling over submitting my applications, waiting to hear back, and then waiting to see if I would be offered a spot off the waitlist, but I would learn from the experience. My failure would fuel me to do better the next time around. In the meantime, I would start belatedly looking for a full-time job. Maybe I would even look into addressing that pesky little executive function disorder my friends and mentors keep alluding to.  
  
I moved back in with my parents, and I didn’t rush to find a job. I concocted plenty of justifications I’d spout off to anyone who asked: I felt burnt out, I wanted to spend more time with my loved ones, I needed time to focus on my professional school applications. Besides, I had a part-time job at a restaurant, in addition to plenty of gig opportunities. What I lacked was an externally imposed deadline.

I thrive under the burden of expectations, you see. Strict, nonnegotiable deadlines kick my ass in gear. In their absence, I struggle with severe difficulty initiating tasks. Hence, the self-sabotage.  
  
I could feel momentum waning and inertia setting in. I knew I wanted a to earn a salary, to keep regular hours, to advance my career. I wanted to move out. I acknowledged my apprehension about my unfulfilled ambitions, but still found myself too complacent to make a change. The ensuing consequences were not immediately acute. 

I developed a complex about applications. The ensuing angst, in addition to my lack of a career-related job, contributed to me neglecting to submit my law school applications in a timely manner for the second time. I feared that an employment gap would render me a less desirable applicant than I had been the first time around, in my last semester of undergrad. Anxious and despondent, I further neglected job hunting. Creeping dissatisfaction ultimately escalated into self-loathing. I had wasted precious, pivotal time in my personal and professional development.  
  
I finally broke the cycle by seeking help for my mental health. Alongside my newly acquired ADHD diagnosis, I picked up some coping mechanisms to compensate for my deficient executive functioning. I picked up some Adderall while I was at it. Through therapy, I learned to better manage my anxiety, and I came to terms with being both my own biggest obstacle and my only solution. 

I want to move on with my life and career, and I would appreciate any advice to that effect.  


I'm have a BA in the social sciences and I'm considering a wide array of positions. I excel in research, project management, and verbal communication. I have reasonably impressive experience for a recent graduate, except that I graduated two years ago and have had little to show for it, insofar as my career is concerned. I’m sure employers will ask about that employment gap. I initially planned on citing a “health emergency” and volunteering no further details. Is there a more constructive spin I could put on this? I’m willing to prevaricate, within reason.

I'm currently on Indeed, but I don't have a flesh-outed LinkedIn profile. I'm inclined to believe that my lack of recent experience would preclude me from making the most of LinkedIn. To be honest, I'm also too embarrassed by my lack of forward momentum to connect with old contacts. I'm looking on Google and employers' websites, as well. Would contacting a recruiter be a worthwhile endeavor for someone in my position?  
  
Additionally, my references are outdated at best. Though some former professors would speak highly of me, I feel awkward asking for recommendations for work two years down the line, especially when my go-to professors had already written letters of recommendation for law school (that I'm not attending). Beyond former professors, my luck isn’t great. My current boss at my food service job is mercurial and inarticulate, I cannot reasonably ask for references from people whose plagiarism I abetted, and my last internship coordinator recently died of COVID-19. My prior internships and summer jobs predate the pandemic. Should I be upfront about this? To what extent would leaving reference fields blank disadvantage me - would that be better than a lackluster reference, or would I not even be able to get a foot in the door? 

Based on prior feedback, I believe I would make a compelling impression in an interview. It's getting an interview in the first place that worries me, between the lack of quality references and the eyebrow-raising time capsule of a resume. Is there any way to offset the previously mentioned shortcomings on resumes or cover letters? Would you recommend that I still list my education at the top, as only the most recent grads should?  
  
I’m still set on law school. Ideally, I would like to rely on my employer for a recommendation. However, I’m not sure how to navigate this during the interview process. I don’t want to explicitly tell potential employers that I plan on resigning by the following schoolyear – that would do me no favors – but I’m unsure how much information to disclose. I’m leaning towards mentioning my legal aspirations while feigning uncertainty about the anticipated timeline. Is this a prudent way to tread the line between my own self-interest and the honesty I owe potential employers?

I'm looking for guidance both specific and general, preferably before inadvertently shooting myself in the foot during the application process. Thank you kindly for indulging my verbal diarrhea. :)"

I currently have a 3.9 cumulative GPA, with an internship in a manufacturing industry last summer and a more corporate and technical engineering internship that I am currently doing. I am also a high school wrestling coach and am on the board of an engineering organization at my college.

Since I started applying for internship positions in the middle of my junior year, I have struggled with getting interviews or even hearing back from any companies that I apply to online. The position that I took last summer was my only interview/offer and my position that I took this summer was only 1/2 interviews that I got and the only offer I received. Both companies that I have worked for have expressed that they are looking to hire full time after I graduate if I am interested, but I have not felt that either was the right fit for me.

My question is, going forward how can I market myself better and land more interviews as I search for full time roles? I don’t like the feeling of having to take a position because it is my only option, and would really like to actually “interview” a company to see if they are right for me. I am not sure if I do something wrong in the application process or if my resume is not up to standard, but I feel as though my knowledge and experience thus far would make companies more interested.

TL;DR - Can’t seem to land any positions I’m interested in, what can I do outside of having connections to get more interviews?"

General Biology in Rutgers is going to take a lot of work. It's not an easy A, but it's also not impossible. With the right amount of effort, you'll be okay lol.   


LECTURES:

* I do recommend you show up to lectures, take notes, and pay attention. Granted, this isn't going to happen all the time, and it won't make or break your grade, but it does help. Attendance is not mandatory, and someone will inevitably  upload slides/videos of lectures to some shared Google Drive. I'd still show up and take notes. I was always much more confused and it took a lot more effort to catch up and understand material that was covered during lectures I skipped. 
* I've had friends who typed notes on computers, handwritten on iPads, and written notes with pencil and paper (me) and we all did similarly well. There are studies that show that you retain more information by handwriting on paper, but I don't think it matters in the grand scheme of things. Sometimes slides go fast, and if you aren't confident that you'd be able to record all the information go ahead and type it. 
* Just write what you see on the screen, you dont' need to summarize anything at all. 
* If you sit in the front and answer questions, it'll keep you from falling asleep because the teacher's staring at you lmao

BiOs FORMS

* it's okay its confusing it looks something like this:  


https://preview.redd.it/rziysnrnug1b1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2dc3c351b3d653340f4bc71002e4aeae2f86aece

* You need to fill out the first five columns before workshop (recitation). This will be explained to you. Topic is the lecture topic (Metabolism, Origin of Life, etc).   
1st Level of Outline are the headers for lectures and 2nd Level of Outline are subheadings (these are all given to you). Outcomes are also given, they are objectives you should take away from the lecture, they are given on the first slide before every lecture. Your job is to write them where they belong within each Outline Level category. They will start with action words such as Compare/Contrast or Sequence. CC= Table, SEQ = Flowchart. You write the organizer needed for each Outcome in Organizers.   

* If that makes absolutely no sense at all you can dm me I'm so sorry lol 
* Don't worry about the other columns. I promise  
RECITATIONS:  
These are called Workshops in Gen Bio.
* If you type/write notes on your tablet, print them out. TAs will check for physical copies of notes and physical copies of BiOs forms. 
* During Workshop, you will need to work with team members to create organizers based off the Outcomes given during lecture (same one on BiOs forms). Then you will present it in front of the class. There are multiple opportunities for your group to do this, and I recommend doing it at least once per workshop to get the maximum participation grade.
* After workshop, you have until 11:59 PM to do a five question quiz. SET AN ALARM FOR AT LEAST 10:00PM THAT DAY TO MAKE SURE YOU DO IT!! THEY ARE WORTH A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF POINTS!! IF YOU MISS SOME YOU ARE FUCKED. THERE ARE NO MAKE UPS FOR THESE!! Anyways, you get 10 mins to answer them and you can't go back once you answer a question. These questions are example questions that would be on the midterms and final so pay attention and actually try. 
* If you think you're going to remember and don't need to set an alarm, that's what I thought too. Set the alarm. 

MIDTERMS AND FINALS

* Surely if you ask around someone is going to have old copies of the midterms. These are great practice. 
* Nobody has copies of the old finals, they don't hand those back. You'll still be okay. 

HOW I STUDIED

* They literally tell you how to get an A and give you all the tools to. It's up to you to follow through. 
* GO TO OFFICE HOURS LMAO it's like a small group and the professor would answer questions and go through organizers with you to clear up topics you don't understand. Write those organizers down, copy them in your notes or in a little book.
* Using the outcomes given and the organizers needed for them, sort your notes into tables and flowcharts. Rewrite the organizers over and over again until you can completely recite them from memory.

13p7qrl,1,2023-05-22,Should I quit my job?,tbh-throw-it-away,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13p7qrl/should_i_quit_my_job/,"Throwaway account, since my workplace is very small and I could be easily identified by my co-workers. 

I (F23) am currently employed at my first 'big-kid' job after getting my Bachelor's. I work at a non-profit organization with five paid staff, myself included, and a few rotating unpaid interns throughout the year.  I was hired in the fall of last year, and I love the work that I do and I love the people that we serve. I saw myself being at this job until I complete my Master's degree in late 2024 or even beyond. 

However, lately, I have noticed some very unethical/illegal patterns of behavior that make me very uncomfortable. These include not having HR, all of my coworkers being close friends/family (besides me), significant gossip (about each other, former employees, other community organizations), having my job threatened regularly in a joking way, etc., and I have been trying to put these aside because I know all NGO's are going to have their issues. 

Last week, our Executive Director (my direct supervisor) designated just over 45 minutes of our weekly all-staff meeting to an open-floor discussion about me. Everyone, including interns and our part-time contractor, were present, and many of the contributions were false, contradictory, or outrightly hurtful. For example, I was called a white supremacist for taking initiative and helping out around the office, called ""restrictive"" for honoring someone's boundaries, and told that I do all of my work for my own ego and for accolades, among others. It was rough enough that I was shaking, went home early, and immediately started crying. I'd never felt more unheard and unappreciated.

For context, my role involves connecting marginalized people with local resources, acting as a program manager for two of our health programs, alongside occasional office work, crisis intervention, and event prep. I don't get paid necessarily well, and the benefits are minimal. 

Like I mentioned previously, I love the work that I do. I help out because I am naturally a helpful person and just want to make peoples' lives easier, not because I have negative self-interests. I don't know how to explain this to my coworkers, and, after this meeting, I feel as though I am damned if I do, and damned if I don't. 

I have been being urged by my friends, husband (24), family, and therapist to get out as soon as I can. I agree that this isn't a healthy environment anymore, but I also don't want to leave and screw over the people that use our organization for life-saving aid. The workplace is small enough that no one would be able to take on my workload, so everyone in the programs that I supervise would have to go without until my office find someone new. 

I know I should take care of myself, but I really don't want to have our local community suffer because my coworkers and boss were unkind. 

All that said, WITBA if I quit my job?"

If I can't do so, I feel as though the responsible decision would be to go to UTSG Math because commuting will offload a significant amount of my expenses, and even so, I might still be able to land internships on my own, even if they might not be up to the calibre of what UW provides."

I recently had my assessment centre for audit at EY (Australia), and had an incredible experience there. Really enjoyed building a network and connecting with the other candidates, as well as the staff, managers, etc. I am hoping I can stay connected with them through linkedin or whatever.

Unfortunately, I was not chosen for the final offers. As bummed about it as I am, their feedback was that I was almost flawless in the interview and group activity. The reason I was not picked was that they felt concerned I was not as passionate about audit relative to other candidates. I come from an economics and finance background fyi, and I had mentioned in the interview that transactions was another service line I was quite interested in (maybe that was my downfall!). They assured me that if there were more positions, I would have been a high consideration. 

Now when the recruiter called to give me the news, I did also ask if I could be considered for audit should other positions open up, and she was kind enough to say she will let me know for that. I desparately want to start working in the field as soon as possible and would love to be involved with EY, so I also asked if there were positions available in transactions and tax that I could also try for. She said she can contact me again later this week about it after consulting with their teams.

At this point, most grad opportunity applications have closed, there are a few still but in terms of the big companies, they seem to have filled their positions in my location. Now, if nothing is available from EY, what would your recommendations be? Just keep looking? Find internship opportunities? Any advice would be appreciated."

For one thing, I'm pretty interested in A.I. and machine learning stuff. ig overall, just the more theoretically parts of CS and may be interested in going for a masters at some point in the future.

From what I understand, Cal Poly SLO is considered to be the most prestigious out of my choices and will help me the most in securing a job (if someone knows more about this, please let me know!). 

Some disadvantages (specifically for me and what I'm looking for) I think would be that they're known for being more ""hands-on"" as opposed to more theoretical. Does anyone know if they teach less of the theoretical components or if they just emphasize the hands on approach more? If I graduate from Cal Poly as oppose to UCSC, will I know less about the more theoretical side of things?

I'd also appreciate it if someone could give me some information on internships and stuff. Specifically internships as they relate to machine learning and AI. I've heard that cal poly is really good when it comes to internships (better than UCSC and maybe as good/better than SJ), but the internships are less research based. Does anyone know how hard research internships are to come by?

This last thing is kind of related to my previous question, but would UCSC be better for me if I plan on going to grad school? Even though cal poly is considered more prestigious, would the lack of internship opportunities that are specifically research based (assuming that getting these is easier at UCSC) make getting into grad school afterwards harder if I go here as opposed to UCSC?

Thanks in advance. If someone could give me insight how much better/worse each of these things are at SJSU when compared to cal poly that'd be appreciated. I'm on the waitlist for UC Irvine and UC San Diego for CS so if I end up getting off of either of those, I'll probably end up going there."

De curând am aflat că am fost acceptată la acest internship, pe partea de baze de date SQL, oferta primita este foarte buna, însă as dori sa știu ce tehnologii și limbaje se utilizează, daca exista program flexibil că junior ( adică să țină cont că avem facultate după terminarea internship ului)  și dacă chiar se învăța ceva, pentru oricine a participat sau știe ceva informații.

Specifically at this art venue. The event/creative manager there is really nice and the first time I volunteered there she made me a list of places I might like. 

The second time I volunteered I was there at the event for quite a quite and she did a lot of trying to help me get out of my shell via light teasing, trying to introduce me to people, encouraging me to do things and to stay. During the night there was too many volunteers(most interns) and she would let them leave but ask me to stay be ""she liked holding me hostage"" or encouraging me to do karaoke by just going on the stage and stare longingly and stuff. She also mentioned she liked my vibe and little things like that. 

The next event I volunteered at, she tried introducing me to her friends (though I botched it) and I wind up leaving early before the after party bc I got too anxious and didn't want to bother. She texted me later saying sorry she lost me.

So I texted later saying sorry and I hope did didn't leave a bad first impression on her friends, and she said no, they loved me and she mentioned shed set up a group hang out soon.

So she invited me to their next event, but told me to just come as a patron, just come to chill and not volunteer, and to the after party later. I said I would and that I would bail like before. So I get there and she comes up and says hi and it's good to see me and how i've been and all that, and I don't say much...and she told me to let her know if I had any questions or anything and that she was at my service. Then...I pretty much avoided her the whole night and never spoke to her again bc I got too anxious and avoided her bc I have a bit of a crush on her. I stayed util like and hour before the after party but then I bailed...again...without saying a word. There was just too many people there and I couldn't approach anyone to talk to them so I just felt too alone and anxious. I texted the next day saying why I bailed and that I hope the after party was fun, but that i didn't want to bother her all night....and she hasn't replied at all....

I feel like I'm over-thinking this bc I have a bit of a crush on her, but objectively, she was being really nice trying to help me meet people and I blew it...twice. Should I just cut my losses and stop volunteering there and not contact her again?  IDK it seems weird that she wouldn't reply at all, but I guess I didn't ask a question"
13prl5f,2,2023-05-23,Passion and skills don't match,Able-Treat-7429,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/13prl5f/passion_and_skills_dont_match/,"Hello guys, my bf decided to switch his career to IT after 1 year working in non-IT sector. He told me that he got inspired from me working as a SE. Then he took a few online courses and applied to many companies.

He had a few interviews but none of them led to anywhere, it has been 8 months. Watching him keep failing really hurts me. 

As a developer, I feel like he isn't fit to IT (his personality and logical thinking). He has full of passion but lacks of abilities. To be honest, if my team ever recruits him, I would guess someone will lose patience on his skills at some point. Even if he gets a job, that doesn't guarantee that he will keep it. 

These days people are prone to depression. I don't want to see him suffer from it when things go south in the future. But telling him directly my thoughts doesn't sound like a good idea either. I really need some advice.

Edit: he is applying for a web developer role as an intern. No certifications yet, he took some Udemy courses and a bootcamp syllabus and completed them. But, let's put it this ways, it took him a bit slow to go through these courses."
13psb5p,0,2023-05-23,Corporate internship or Leetcode in summer?,Complex-Spirit6123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13psb5p/corporate_internship_or_leetcode_in_summer/,"So today I had a talk with few of my seniors.
I'm trying to find an internship using referrals in a big company. I'll be honest, I don't wanna work in startup cause I just want that 'tag' in my resume that I interned at a big tech.(don't judge lol)

So I talked to few of them and I realised, everyone's response was totally different. I'll summarise :
1) Internships in vacation are great. The name of a big tech company in resume gives you an edge during interviews cause it's difficult to get into those companies. Working for a startup too shows you know a lot about your field.
2)Just practice leetcode everyday instead of internships cause cracking the coding round is the biggest hurdle. Internships won't matter at all if you don't get to the interview round. Instead learn more skills and highlight projects in your resume instead of experience.

So, what do you all this is idk, the correct advise for a uni student?"

Since then, I've been applying for every internship, trainee, or junior engineer job that I can find(not a lot, since my home country is going through a political and economic crisis). I also don't have a high CGPA, so I don't even make past cut-offs of some of them. For some, I gave the written test and performed kind of average/above average. Now I'm waiting (pessimistically) for whether they call me for the interview or not.  
  
**My journey so far:** In the meantime, I decided to start learning programming, particularly C++, to either create a side hustle or potentially switch fields if I can't find a job in Mechanical Engineering. I've grasped the basics quite well, including syntax, loops, conditionals, and so on. Currently, I'm focusing on learning data structures and algorithms for leet coding.  
  
**The dilemma:** Everyone on the internet says to create projects for creating a portfolio etc. I get it, but the issue I'm facing is what projects should I do. Most of the information I come across is about web development, nothing wrong with it but I feel like it may not be my thing. I want to stay true to my Mechanical Engineering path even if change my field to programming(I hope it makes sense) like programming in robotics, aeronautics, aerospace, etc.  
  
I come across beginner projects like a text editor, calculator, or creating a simple game using Unity, etc. I don't know if doing those projects is going to help me achieve what I want. Life has served me with pretty bad hands in the past that's why I'm pessimistic about most things even if I put in the hard work and time required.  
  
I decided to dive headfirst into programming because I knew if I think a lot about it, I might end up not doing it at all.  
  
**Conclusion:** I'm reaching out to you guys on what should I do, what path should I follow, what projects should I do, or any general advice. Thank you all in advance for your help and support."

I know of the Comptia ITF+ and A+ but I am sure there are others I am not aware of currently. Overall, I forsee myself beginning my professional IT career as a help desk or IT support speciliast.

So overall, my goal is to be a back-end software engineer. I am also a soon to be junior in college with only an IT Internship under my belt.

My university’s program was horrific so I am transferring to one of the top 50 CS schools this fall. I’ve basically only learned C++ and python through data analytics and Udemy bootcamp by Angela… To help you understand my knowledge level, the courses I have completed in college between spring 2022 and spring 2023 were: 

OOP 1 and 2 in C++, C# with Unity (don’t even know why this was a prereq to c++ programming), Networks and IT, Info Systems, HTML and CSS, and I took an elective in data analytics intro since there was only one CS class available for the spring. (there were only a total of 8 courses available for the spring and I had already taken all 6 with one course meant for seniors).

Currently this summer, I am spending most of time doing a couple things:

1) reading about DSA using grokking and maybe the algorithm design manual, but I try to pick something with python since it’s my most proficient language 

2) Leet Code - self explanatory 


3) Odin Project - to build a portfolio website while also learn about html, css and JavaScript.


4) after done with the above three, I’ll finish the Udemy bootcamp in Python from Angela Lee???


What do you think of my current dilemma and should I also learn Java? 

Feel free to give any answers or advice that doesn’t pertain to my question 


Thank you! I will answer all questions you may have to the best of my ability."

Now coming to the “problem”. I’ve basically thought of quitting because of how demanding it is on me partly because I think I havnt worked in a long time and I’ve been at uni chilling a lot. The other part of me wants to work because of the pay and thinks I’ll manage and will be able to do the 2 assignments and the little bit of weight loss I need for graduation. 

I wanted to add the reason I think I won’t be able to do my work properly and weightlosss while working is because I feel I’ll eat bad not go to the gym and everything else 

I’m basically conflicted on which to pick as in 3 months I’ll be travling to another country for a internship so this job is a temporary until there.

Ever since January I've been applying for jobs, and working through my data structures and algorithms on leetcode, but call backs have been fairly non existent. I just graduated with my bachelor's degree last June, and during school I had no problem finding job opportunities or getting interviews, but now they seem non existent.  
  
Lately I've been feeling pretty directionless, I'm not sure what I should focus my energy on next. I've looked into contributing to open source projects, looked at trying to learn new frameworks and languages, try to create projects but it all seems pretty pointless. I have also been looking to apply to some masters programs to try and bolster my resume and get another shot at getting internships and expanding my knowledge.  
  
For those who have been in similar situations, what did you prioritize and work on to get yourself back on your feet? I feel like I am lacking a plan, and that is due to not knowing what direction I should go down. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I have some software side projects independently and some pretty in depth hardware projects associated with school that Im hoping, combined with the degrees and the school are worth atleast something. 

What Im curious about is when a reasonable time to start sending apps in would be? I just want to have something so I dont have to think about it anymore, but obv cant start until June 2024. Do what I have so far seem like I have a good shot? My confidence is pretty low from almost never hearing back from anything so far.

Apologies if this belongs somewhere else I couldnt find the weekly thread"

13q10qh,212,2023-05-23,MD at a bank told me I’ll probably never land a job in IB. Now what?,ThisIsABurner4207,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/13q10qh/md_at_a_bank_told_me_ill_probably_never_land_a/,"I had two really good calls today with a MD and VP at an upper MM bank. I reached out to speak with them about their experience and just to make a connection (we went to the same undergrad). The MD was blunt but nice about it. He asked for my gpa which I had left off my resume (3.1… yes I know it’s bad), and basically gave me the run down that I’m forever going to compete with target school 3.5’s and up, or with non targets with connections, high gpa, internships, etc. (for context, I graduated 2 years ago and didn’t have any internships. I worked tech sales for a year and now I’m in commercial banking at one of the big banks).

The VP was more positive. He said he knows many analysts who came in without previous internship, had come from non targets (like himself), or even commercial banking. We never spoke about gpa, but I assume had it come up maybe he wouldn’t have been so optimistic about me getting a job in IB.

I was very lucky to have these calls in the first place, and even luckier that they both took time to talk about what I could be doing in the future. The MD kept saying I should pursue an MBA so make up for my lacking resume, and he also suggested I look into private credit (I work in commercial credit). The VP talked about opportunities outside of IB at places like Barings, Ares management, KKR, etc. 

I’d love to learn more about the opportunities that the Vp talked about, but I’m not sure what to even classify them as. And are the opportunities compatibly lucrative? Are they harder to break into?

Anyways, I’m glad I was given a bit of reality. I’m still going to try networking and I will consider an MBA."

- College: Tier 1.5-2 (spells almost same as a famous korean pop band) 
- Branch: EEE
- CGPA: 8.5+
- Skills/Exp: Android Dev, Java, Cpp.

With the hiring freezes and recession rumors floating around, the situation looks grim. As per my experience in the Summer Internship drive, many companies had a very random selection process (Amazon, solved all in under half the time yet rejected, some solved few with not all test cases passed yet selected), which has made me question myself. 

Advice pertaining to any part of the hiring process would be invaluable:

1. Resume (What kind of projects/skills/tech stack would make me stand out)
2. Coding Round (What else apart from the usual leetcode grind)
3. Interview 

Humble request to the people who are directly involved in the hiring process, like ones who take interviews or ones who are recently placed to guide me in the comments. Thank you !"

13q2eee,2,2023-05-23,Slightly confused about what I should do,FineProfessor3364,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/13q2eee/slightly_confused_about_what_i_should_do/,"Quick background on myself:
23 YO, Business undergrad with a specialization in marketing.

I loved marketing in my undergrad and did v well but was always told its a crowded space with v little ability to make money unless you're in the upper echelons so I never got a full time job in it, well it was true cause all entry level marketing jobs paid absolute peanuts and money is an important factor for me. I did a few marketing communications and digital marketing internships starting when I was 18 which I enjoyed but not enough to give up on money.

I interned at a big 4 consulting firm as a research analyst for a massive operations project for 6 months and an HR consulting firm as a consulting analyst for another 6 months. I developed some technical skills with a rounded perspective of a business before committing to a full time job, something just simply didn't make me commit to a full time role (though I had the option to). In retrospect, I did this cause I believed any true business leader should understand all the different functions of a business (plus I was young and thought the best leaders are generalists but now feel like jack of all trades master of one is what I want to be)

I then ventured into software sales for a global MNC and got a full time job as a SDR (Sales Development Rep) which iv been doing for a year now. But I'm thoroughly burnt out and have developed a desire to get into marketing as I worked closely with the product and marketing teams as an SDR. I thoroughly enjoy strategy work and though the trenches have taught me imp lessons in the ground realities of sales, I think I'm more useful in ideation, strategy and delving deeper into the numbers as I feel like I have a good blend of analytical and creative ability (from what I've been told by peers and coworkers at least)

I plan on pursuing my master's in analytics and wish to take some time off work to prepare for it as I wish to build on my current technical skillset. During this time, I want to really decide if a career in marketing is genuinely for me and if I wish to commit to it.

TLDR: Have experience in multiple domains as a generalist but now wish to specialize, unsure if marketing is the specialization I should choose."
13q2tec,2,2023-05-23,Graduated 2 weeks ago and just started a marketing internship… and I’m really struggling,Euphoric_Habit_954,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/13q2tec/graduated_2_weeks_ago_and_just_started_a/,"I just graduated with a major in advertising and graphic design. I was really having a difficult time with finding paid internships/jobs in my field and was either ghosted by a bunch of people or didn’t apply in time. I heard back from this paid marketing internship my last week of school and took it on a whim because I gotta have some sort of income related to my field at least. It’s a 9-5, I commute 40 mins, and the team is made up of about 25 people all about 20 years older than me. I just finished my 2nd day and I already hate it. On the way back home I was crying so much and questioning my major, career choices, and what I actually wanna do in life. 

I knew that life after college would be an adjustment but DAMN it’s rough. I’ve been looking into other jobs or internships over the past month and it’s so discouraging seeing the absurd requirements, number of applicants, and amount of places not wanting to pay or only minimum wage. The market isn’t looking great with so many over qualified people applying for entry level positions. I also have tons of experience from past internships and still working on my portfolio site (I’m struggling with wix lol), but feel like I can’t apply to more places till I perfect it. 

This B2B marketing internship is fine I guess, but it’s not even the type of marketing I’m interested in. I feel so out of place there and it’s definitely not something I’d want to pursue in the near future. Ideally I want to work at an ad agency or even for a smaller business on the creative side, but I’m horrible with networking and honestly I’m a bit shy in interviews which I’m sure doesn’t work in my favor. I’ve been so tempted to go back into the restaurant business because at least I had friends at work and made more money with less hours. 

It’s honestly just terrifying thinking about how fast college flew by and the fact that I’ll probably now be working a 9-5 for the rest of my life. Sorry for the rant, but I just need some advice or at least know I’m not the only one. 😕"

Although I can graduate in 3 years, I wouldn't want to spend the tuition and rent just taking 1 class in the spring. I am planning instead on saving that money and traveling. However, I have no formal internships at any companies and with the current state of the economy I am lost on what to do. I applied to 150+ internships for this summer and did not land anything. Instead I am spending the summer Leetcoding, working on my personal projects, and taking summer classes. Should I be applying for new entry level SWE jobs? (would I even get hired with no internships)? Continue Apply for internships? Or I could return to my college in FA24 and get guaranteed admission into the Masters of Computer Science program where my tuition is covered with TAship?  I am new to the corporate space as I am a first generation student and have no family or experience with corporate. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Also, the company culture is good. I get to work from home atleast 3 days a week (sometimes the entire week from home). When I'm in the office, the company generally buys lunch for the entire office. As for the job itself, I'm working on interesting and cool projects as well.   
  
However, I'm barely doing any work. It's been a month and my workload is very minimal. I want to prove to my manager and team that I'm worth having. I'm able to complete all my task within like an hour. I need to complete an internship for my program to graduate from school too. I'm afraid of getting fired due to a lack of performance.  
  
Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?"

could we get some information on the differences in these programs? how are they both like, how do co op opportunities differ, is the workload similar, etc. which one offers more opportunities (and what kind - research, jobs, internships, etc) both during education and after it? And if necessary, how easy is transferring within the universities from these programs? 

(since this is the uoft subreddit we're expecting less of a comparison and more of just information on comp eng at uoft, so dont worry)

- not entirely sure what she wants to do (in eng), but thinks comp eng is a decent idea
- co op in both
- commute is about the same
- no free choice at mac, but would aim for comp eng probably; is sort of worried abt getting a choice she likes
- prefer mac campus

Any experiences or advice in general is welcome. Thanks!"
13q53f8,18,2023-05-23,Is it okay to leave consulting after 8 months to pursue a fully funded masters program?,hellopotato918,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/13q53f8/is_it_okay_to_leave_consulting_after_8_months_to/,"I joined a big 4 firm this year, and this is my first full-time stint in management consulting. 

While I was applying for consulting firms last year, I also applied for Yenching Academy(YCA) at Peking University under the Economics and Management track just to see if I would pass, and I did. So, right now, I am contemplating whether to pursue this or not.

I am currently on my fifth month at my job,  and so far, although its demanding and a little stressful, I am really liking the experience, the opportunities and the network I am making. On the other hand, I feel YCA would be a fun experience, and I get a masters degree as well. And I dont have to pay for anything. I was thinking that if I pursue YCA, I can try to take internships at consulting firms, then get back into full-time consulting (hopefully) when I finish the program.

From the perspective of hiring managers, would it look bad that I only stayed for 8 months? I definitely want to work/stay in consulting at least in the medium term (next 5 years or so). Hence, I am wondering if this will reflect badly on my profile. 

.
.
.

P.S. One of the options I'm seeing is to forfeit YCA, and apply to their rival program in the next school year at Schwarzman Scholars, so I can stay longer and maximize the opportunities from this job, but then again, it would be risky because its not guaranteed I will get an offer. And I am turning 27 this year, so I only have one more shot at this if I choose to forfeit as they have an age limit of max 28 years old.

Would love to hear some insights and guidance!"

I am trying to keep it real with myself by saying I can’t do much better than a full ride to a state school (which is still good!). Anyway tell me who you think is right here.

Demographics: white girl majoring in environmental science (save the turtles 🤪🐢). From Arkansas. idk how much I make because my parents are divorced, but probably not more than 50k. My dad was in prison for a few years if that matters. From a small public school in the middle of nowhere, <70 in my class. I don’t think a single kid from my school has ever gotten in to an ivy, most go to community college or trade school, so I’ve never expected it for myself. Don’t know if I have a hook? Would probably play into the small town girl, low income, hard life, no resources, ❤️ nature thing tho. 


GPA: UW-4.0 W-4.0 ☹️ (DE classes are not on a 5 point scale at my school)

Rank: UW- 1/65, W- have no clue but probably not 1 considering DE classes.


Coursework: I took 6 Dual enrollment classes with a four year school, and plan to do 2 APs next year. My school only offers like 5 aps and the teachers suck so I didn’t take them (word searches are a core part of APUSH 💀) but we got 2 new science teachers and imma give ‘em a go next year.

ACT: 33 comp., 34 superscored. 
29 math 😞
35 science
36 English
36 reading
took it twice.

ECs: 
Paid internship at a fish hatchery with the USFWS for 8 weeks over the summer after sophomore year.
Like 300 or more community service hours.
Volunteered with the Arkansas blood institute and orchestrated multiple blood drives in my community. Will likely be receiving a scholarship for this btw.
Created, volunteered, and donated to multiple donation projects towards homeless shelters, food banks, and domestic violence shelters.
FCCLA (leadership and community service club)- member for 6 years, officer for 5 years, President for 2. Was also a regional VP for a year, presided over ~20 schools.
FFA( yee yee club 🤠)- member for 5 years, officer for 1.
Participated in forestry and land judging competitions for 5 years (I know it’s weird but at least it’s related to my major) placed first at multiple competitions and competed at nationals.
Volunteered at a “fish camp” (also through the USFWS), taught orphans and foster kids aged 5-12 about fish species and how to fish for trout. 
Tutored my peers on ACT and algebra practice. (Kind of a stretch tbh I helped like 3 kids.)
I guess I could mention piano but I’m not very good lol. I “practice” (play Minecraft music) for MAYBE 1 hour a week.

Awards:
Rural/Small town recognition award from college board
9th grade English award
Algebra 1 award
Algebra 2 award
Physical science award
FACS award
Food safety and nutrition award
OSHA and ServSafe manager certified (I have 0 idea if this is relevant but hey) 
2 school spirit awards

LORs: honestly don’t know who I should get to write these. I’m going to try and get my principal to write one because she likes me so that’s good. Other than that idk tho. I could get my club advisors to write it, but one of them is a lil dumb (❤ him but just being honest) and the other isn’t related to my major. And as I said, my main science teacher retired and so did my math teacher. So I’m kind of stuck. I guess I could try to get a hold of them but that might prove to be difficult, and they might not even care cause I took half those classes virtually 💀. My other option is my chem teacher, who I’m taking AP chem with next year. She is one of those teachers  who just flirts with the 16 yr old boys tho so I don’t think she cares about me much. I could also get one of my old employees from the fish hatchery to write one (one of them even offered), but I know colleges prefer teachers. Advice on the matter is appreciated 🫶



Chance me for any T20 but especially Vanderbilt (my moms dream 🤩). you won’t hurt my feelings if you say I have no shot lol. Also feel free to leave tips on my application, like what is or isn’t relevant, or suggest good schools to apply to. Sorry if the post is long 💛"

13q6rzg,16,2023-05-23,"Freshman Internship. Little to no communication from ""employer""",Shaqu1lleOatmeal,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13q6rzg/freshman_internship_little_to_no_communication/,"Hey everyone

  
First post on here. Generally just asking for advice. So I'm an incoming sophomore accelerating through my degree (set to graduate in three years) and managed to land an unpaid internship with a startup. I got the internship through LinkedIn by contacting the owner of the company.

Now the stuff they need me to do in the internship, I have never done before. It's a lot of Machine Learning stuff paired with some work with a few APIs (which I can manage). That wouldn't be an issue as I'm very keen about learning new stuff any way and was the big reason I took an unpaid internship in the first place anyway. However, I have only been able to get on a call with the owner a few times and he's told me what I need to do but there has been basically no communication otherwise. I have not been introduced to anyone on the technical team who I can ask doubts to.   


I still want to see this through because I know that a) I'll learn a lot through this and, b) It's gonna look good on a resume. It's just taking me a lot longer to learn this stuff on my own than I'd hoped and I don't really know how to accelerate that. Any tips or suggestions? Are there mentor groups I should join or something so I can learn from them?  


TLDR: Doing an unpaid internship, little to no communication from the employer apart from assigning the whole task. Want to see it through. Learning is taking time. Tips on speeding that process (ML related stuff)? Thanks!"

I got into the CPA kickstart program at KPMG (and already accepted it) but I wanna know if I’d be crazy to decline it to go to Deloitte (whom I also have a FT offer from but did not intern with). 

I’ve been harping on this for a while and I just can’t make up my mind and would love to give them an answer soon. I feel like I would be out of my mind to rescind an offer from a company that I actually interned with and got into their CPA program, to go to a company that I’ve never worked with at all - and have no knowledge of how they operate or anything. I know in audit, it’s dependent on the teams you are on but I would love to hear y’all’s experience whether it’s on an engagement team, events with the firm or encounters with people. 

Also, how difficult do you think it would be if I was to start out at KPMG (to utilize the cpa program), stay there for like a year, then reapply to Deloitte? Would that be crazy? 😂

I am a computer engineering student currently working in a summer internship. I do not work with anyone considered a ""data engineer"" everyone works a sort of mixed role of programmers and planners and other random engineering things.

Anyways so most of my time I am working on a project where we are designing and building a system that takes some sensor data from multiple sources and different databases parses them in python, pushes the data to a postgres database then we use a Nginx to host a Grafana front end to visualize the data in the postgres server. It may seem silly that I'm asking if this is considered data engineering but because I haven't been around anyone with that specific job description and this has been my only internship I don't know if that is what I am doing.

Also my career goal is move to a architect/manager position out of university so I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to make that move as soon as possible out of school.

Thanks you!"

However, during COVID, I got a taste of online learning, and it really worked for me. I got the chance to replay lectures pace around my room. This lead to a noticeable improvement in both my mental health and my grades. This got me thinking that I might want to pursue a masters online at some point. I recently started as a software engineering intern at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and I’ve become really interested in the school. Given my circumstance, what do you think my chances of admission are? I plan on getting a letter of recommendation from my supervisor who’s a research scientist for GTRI, as well my boss at UW who’s a data integration engineer for the IT department. Also, would a year of work experience help make up for my GPA to some extent? Thanks in advance for any advice :)"

I'll get better as I get more accustomed to the platform.

***I'd really really appreciate it if anyone can help me out in this regard. I'm totally lost.***

&#x200B;

* **Context:** I am currently working in a field (\~1 year) that is not exactly CyberSec but that has certain (albeit very less) flavors of it in a Fortune 50 company. However, my team was recently changed and now I am in a field that has no relation to CyberSec at all. I'll be applying for the Fall'24 intake. This is my first job as well.

&#x200B;

* **Profile:** If this might help in any way in helping me out. International Student (Indian). 8.91/10 CGPA. 1 chapter publication (cybersec related) in IGI Publishers. 3 internships \[Big 4 (tech), Startup(CyberSec lead), Startup (non tech)\]. Topper in all the CyberSec courses taken during undergrad. Couple of VDPs. 4 CyberSec projects.  Azure Fundamentals 900 and Security Analyst (SSC/Q0901)- Nasscom (Gold) certification. Volunteering specific to teaching underprivileged kids about digital literacy and CyberSec awareness. Haven't yet taken GRE and IELTS/TOEFL. 

&#x200B;

* **Planning to do before submitting the application:** Try to send another research paper (almost done with it) for publishing, Try to get CompTIA Sec+ and Pentest+ (or CEH). Try to get some more bug bounties/HOFs/VDPs. Attend a couple of conferences and try to present something if possible. Try freelancing to gain more experience in the field.

&#x200B;

* **Targetting colleges like** CMU, GeorgiaTech, UCB, UIUC, etc
* **Questions:** 

1. Are these schools too ambitious? (I know SOPs, LORs, and GRE scores can do magic but barring all of that, do I stand a chance?)
2. If I do stand a chance, does my current work experience hinder my shot at these places?
3. What can I do (in terms of certifications/other things) to improve my current profile?
4. If these schools are out of my league, can y'all suggest some target schools I can apply to?

Thank you so much in advance. Have a great day ahead!"

I also interviewed for a very similar role but for a  marketing company. Long story short, the marketing company got back to me first. The start date is the first week of June. I accepted it.

I received a conditional offer letter (that I accepted) from the government shortly after (emphasis on conditional) and I’m not sure when to tell the marketing company. I already told my employer that I got an offer and ended my time at my current job. Didn’t take long since I was an intern so I was never fully employed there. 

The reason why I’m in a pickle is because the government job hasn’t fully guaranteed my position yet due to the bureaucratic hoops they have to go through in order to fully extend an official offer. They even told me not to quit my job yet (haha too late). When I asked how long the process would take, they said 2-3 weeks. Mind you the marketing company role begins the first week of June.

I’m hesitant to tell the marketing company until I know for sure the process for the government job is complete and I can negotiate my start date for that. However by the time the government role gets back to me, it will likely overlap with the beginning of the other role.

I’m even more annoyed because the marketing company has ALREADY sent me the damn laptop. What should I do? How do I even navigate this?!?!?!?!?"

13qguq1,1,2023-05-24,Which degree to go for,ImperialNexus01,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13qguq1/which_degree_to_go_for/,"MEng or Bsc in Computer Science (UK)

Hi everyone
Basically MEng is a 5 year degree and BSc is a 4 year degree
Both have 1 more year than the norm because my degree is 'Computer Science with Professional Experience'
And are orientated to using industry experts for teaching the courses from day 1, + lots of internship opportunities

My question is assuming my budget can afford it
Should I go for the Masters in Engineering or Bachelors in Science

I'm confused if that 1 extra year is worth it, and also if a freshie like me having a master's degree may decrease job opportunities, since employers may not be willing to pay my degree's worth

Also there is just the standard Bsc of 3 years
My question is basically would be which degree gives me the best job prospects"

I really enjoy software development and the finance industry in general, and I’ve done some ‘projects’ in the past as I have access to my universities Bloomberg terminals - stuff on inverse yield curve environments, and more recently on studying if boycotts effect stock price and building software to trigger when a potential ‘boycott’ event happens and if this is a buy/sell signal 

Currently in my free time also doing the free BMC on the terminal, just as I’m enjoying it and it’s something else to add. 

Is there anything else I can be doing to strengthen my CV? The only problem I have is in experience really, and honestly I’m too burnt out from my current third year of studies to do any internships. Better to rest up and actually get the masters was my thought process. But I love doing projects and programming. 

So is there anything more I can do? How do I mention these past ‘projects’ I’ve done? 

Thanks for reading a post that basically became a rant haha."

13qiyse,7,2023-05-24,Is TCD computer science worth the move to Dublin?,[deleted],DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/13qiyse/is_tcd_computer_science_worth_the_move_to_dublin/,"I finished my LC last year, and I have the points to do CS in trinity + DARE if the points further inflate so I think I’m secure. 

I’ve done a few courses on programming this past year and now I’m certain I want to study CS. I’m intrigued by trinity’s course specifically because it is very theoretical/maths heavy (which I enjoyed in school) and I feel like it could give me a more of an in depth education than any other course in Ireland.

My biggest concerns are 

1. Work experience, apparently you have to complete the masters for you to be able to spend 4th year on an internship, which I feel is a bit pointless if I plan on becoming a SWE, and it’s a disadvantage because every other course has one in 3rd year with no cache.

2. Dublin expenses! The housing crisis is a nationwide problem but Dublin’s on actual steroids, I’ve had friends who had to defer this year, mid course, because they couldn’t find accommodation. I’ve saved enough money to afford the first year, but I’ll probably have to work throughout the year and during the summers during my course to afford it, which might be difficult especially because it’s a really demanding course.

I could study CS in UCC which is logistically easier in every way. So is there enough of a difference between the courses to justify the struggle of moving to Dublin? Don’t get me wrong, I really like Dublin as a city, and I would enjoy the independence/“big city” lifestyle which is another bias I have to TCD but I have to be realistic given the circumstances."

Ask Me Anything!,DNAniel213,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/13qozc9/im22_ran_away_from_home_with_30k_and_a_computer/,"Hi!

The r/phinvest, r/phcareers, r/PanganaySupportGroup, and r/phmoneysaving subs got me through difficult times and a lot of advice from the people here helped me get to where I am right now.

**And Reddit knows my story!**

* Part 1: Around 2 years ago, I asked for help on what [necessities I should get when moving out](https://www.reddit.com/r/phmoneysaving/comments/o80xq9/sheltered_moving_out_at_22_what_is_your_new/).
* Part 2: 7 months after the first post, I came back with [what I learned after living alone for 7 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/phmoneysaving/comments/sd861n/sheltered_for_22_years_here_are_the_things_i/).
* Part 3: A year after that, I got myself a [huge salary milestone](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/up6wu7/just_signed_a_contract_thats_at_least_200_more/) as a Senior Unity Developer! First thing I did was turn to reddit to share it with people who know better, and try to make sense of my situation since I can't with anyone else (except my gf).
* Part 4: is **where I am today.**

**----------\[Part 4\]**

**So yeah, I started a game development studio.**

I won't name it since it'll be flagged and considered advertising *unless a mod gives a green light*, but the idea of starting a studio dedicated to creating the best games ever has always been my dream. Back in 2017, I got the studio name from a classical piece played in my class project group's favorite anime at the time. We played that masterpiece way more than we could count and named our team after that.

We didn't care if the name was long. **We loved it.**

Then graduation came (2018), and the team went our separate ways. I tried to convince them to take the risk, but understandably, the risk was our livelihood and we needed money. So we did our own thing.

*part 1, part 2, part 3 happened (around 4 years total passed).*

&#x200B;

**Fast forward February 2023, I started a studio with the same name.**

Our short-term goal is to sustain and survive by **outsourcing**, and our long-term goal is to create our **original IP.** And I'm seeding in 50,000 per month into the studio until it's profitable.

At first, I hired my GF as an artist. We built the website, did a lot of brushing up with the portfolios, and reached out to a lot of potential clients. Then, we hired a social media manager who significantly boosted our confidence in making the studio look and feel more legit. After which I hired a game developer, and an amazing friend that used to be part of the original team.

After adjusting to a bit of chaos, we worked like we've worked together for years. We secured clients, developed their games, had fun, joined events, worked on our own games, played games, earned money, and kept pushing forward! A month passed and we needed more hands. So, we hired another developer and got an intern. Now we're **self-sustainable** and building the company's emergency fund! In short, we are kicking ass!

I was checking off box after box of my game development career goals and couldn't be more excited of what's to come. We're nobodies, but we're just getting started.

**We'll be in ConQuest. We're flying the whole team there!**

&#x200B;

**------------\[End Part 4\]**

Looking back, it's kind of hard to believe that I was crawling in a really dark place mentally and financially just two years ago. I still don't think I'm that qualified because luck has played a huge part in this path and I'm still grinding my way there, but I'll **try to answer any question.**

And I hope I can inspire one or two people!

I'm a 24-year-old male who graduated with a degree in Finance from a non-target state school with a 3.8 GPA. First generation.

As the title suggests, I'm currently in the software sales environment. I'm a BDR with almost 16 months of experience at an industry leader. My first-year salary all in was 93k, and this year's projections are looking like 105-110k.

I'm fairly career-oriented now, but I, unfortunately, didn't put in the necessary work/underestimated networking during undergrad in order to secure an internship and create good career prospects for myself. I am appreciative of the fact that I'm pretty well paid for my role and age, however, making cold calls and having a constant quota over my head gets repetitive, meaningless, and boring after a while.

As many say, the BDR role is a ""launch pad"" into other careers such as sales/marketing. I love the money of sales, but again, it seems unfulfilling and stressful knowing that you can get laid off extra easily at any point during a slump, plus having to restart over every single quarter.

I'm very compensation oriented, and the worst part is that I've realized that the current role I'm in has very few exit opportunities that pay as well as sales.

The most attractive role for me is a Solutions Consultant/Sales Engineer which has the salary potential and exit opportunities I'm looking for. However, I'm worried that with my background and lack of experience in a technical field, I'll be pigeonholed in my current industry. (FinTech)

I've also thought of exploring Implementation Consulting, but I've done research here that suggests it's even more of a pigeonhole.

**With that being said, I'm considering applying to PT/FT T10/15/20 MBAs (would probably take a scholarship admission) and going into management/strategy consulting, doing it while enjoying the salary in my 20s, then going into Product Management/Strategy/Ops, or really anything else that seems attractive at that point, I feel like with consulting one can exit anywhere. Please correct me if I'm wrong.**

**I understand the ROI of an MBA isn't really there without good experience, however, I'm concerned that I'm falling behind by trying to push and hustle through my current situation.**

Should I bite the bullet and reset my career while it's early? Should I not do that? What is all your advice?

I appreciate every single comment. Please let me know if I'm missing anything and I will be sure to edit."

I was extremely burnt out and planning a wedding/honeymoon, so I didn't look into getting another job, I mostly have been just doing that the past 11 months, and making a tiny amount of money from some art ($200 a month, it's still growing but not enough to live off of lol). Now the marriage stuff is over, my art hobby is very stable and I'm looking for a job again. I'm worried this was possibly too big of a gap on a resume to get another job? Do I have to explain this gap, or no? I do have some passion projects I did over the gap because I love coding and also do it as a hobby (Python image slicer and Discord chatbot).

For context I have 4 years professional experience, one of those people who has coded since I was 10, and have never had any issue getting a job before, I got one right out of college, I am very good at coding (I do not fear coding interviews) but it takes me like 3 months to study and ramp up to full potential. I'm kind of terrified hearing about this job market and I'm afraid I totally fucked my earning potential for the rest of my life because of my burnout + wedding + art dreams failing (not really failing but not to support me yet) taking up 11 months of time.

Perspective please. I probably need a remote job for around 100K. Am I fucked?  


EDIT: I didn't know internships counted as years experience so I probably have more like 6ish years experience not 4."

13qx083,5,2023-05-24,High school senior here - Can I ask for some advice?,True_Bird2067,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13qx083/high_school_senior_here_can_i_ask_for_some_advice/,"TL;DR: I am going to Georgia Tech for CS, but I want a well rounded education and close connections with professors, so I think I would be much better off at a liberal arts college or something similar. Advice?

Hi everyone!

This is my first post, and I’m a high school senior who has just finished the whole college process. The first thing I want to say is thank you - while I have never posted or commented before, this subreddit has answered a lot of questions and given a lot of helpful advice.

When I was first applying to colleges, I was not sure what to major in. Throughout high school, I have had a lot of interests across the humanities, social sciences, and STEM. I tried to think about what kind of long-term career I would want, and then tried to work backwards. I figured that being an author would be great, since I like reading books. I also thought that becoming a scientist, conducting research at some university, would be really cool, since I have always loved math and science. However, at times, these goals seemed unrealistic. I thought I would need to be extremely talented and have some measure of luck if I were to really make it as an author or scientist. However, then again, I always felt as if I could do this. This is going to sound really full of myself, but please bear with me for a sec. I have always been praised, by my friends, my family, my teachers, and just those around me in general, as the “smart” one. In my classes, I seem to grasp certain things easier than my classmates. And I would say that my grades support this. I go to a school that is small, but somewhat competitive, and I will be graduating as valedictorian. 

Part of me, after being praised as a really smart person all my life, felt really confident in my abilities. But another part of me doesn’t think that I am smarter than anyone else. All the time in school, someone would bring up a point in a class discussion that I never considered, find a clever way to solve a math problem that I didn’t see, or something like that. Because of that, I felt that I should major in something that is more “safe” than, say, English. And that is how I came to computer science. I liked coding (sometimes), and I liked math, so why not? Also, I kind of felt that I was always going to eventually go into cs. Both my parents work in cs, and they have always encouraged me to go into that field because of all the opportunities. And if I really did want to do research, I could do research in CS, and if I wanted to write a book, I can always do that in my free time, right?

Anyways, because I chose CS, my college list was tailored to CS department strength. I applied to a lot of reaches, including MIT, Stanford, CMU, UCLA, UC Berkeley, a bunch of ivies, etc. My safeties included NC state and my in-state school. And I applied to one target school: Georgia Tech (oos).

Over the next few months, I spent a lot of time learning about my “reach” schools, getting excited about the prospect of studying them, only to be rejected by them all, despite my really good stats. I was heartbroken, after investing my emotions into them, but I realized that getting rejected was probably an important lesson to learn. I was also accepted to my safeties and Georgia Tech.

At first, I was happy about Georgia Tech. It’s ranked #5 for cs, and this sub seems to love it. I committed there and was somewhat satisfied, albeit still upset about all my rejections. However, after committing, I started having a lot of second thoughts. The first was about humanities. I have always loved English, history, and psychology classes - even more than math, science, and cs. I love reading books, discussing passages, writing creative essays, and getting feedback from teachers about my writing, and I am really worried that I will sorely miss this at GT. From talking with current students, I have heard that their humanities classes are considered more of a joke / nuisance, just gen eds that people have to put up with rather than an actual, legitimate field of study. This ties into another worry of mine - that the student body is too homogeneous. I think it's cool that GT students want to become computer scientists and engineers that innovate, but I worry that I will get sick of being around engineers, and that I will miss hanging out with people passionate about history and literature. Also, I am not opposed to people from the state of Georgia at all, but the fact that they represent 60% of GT’s population, and the fact that the school is mostly male, make me worry that it won't be as diverse as I hoped. Furthermore, I have heard that at GT, there is a sort of rat-race to get the best grades or internships, whereas I feel like I would best fit at a place that was not so focused on churning out worker bees. (worker yellowjackets?)

Another major worry is the class size. I’ve heard that classes can have hundreds of students in them, and that while they do get smaller as I get to higher level classes, they can still remain pretty large, at like 50 students. In high school, I was used to having classes of 10 to 15 students each. I was used to having interesting debates and discussions in class, and staying around afterwards to discuss a certain idea with the teacher longer. I was able to form strong, personal relationships with teachers to the point in which they seemed more like friends than teachers. At GT, I feel like I will have none of this. I imagine that classes will comprise mostly of the teacher giving lectures, without any discussions or debates. I’ve heard that it is rare for teachers to even know your name. I have also heard that, while some of the GT teachers are great, others care more about research than actually teaching. Throughout HS, while I have done well academically, I am naturally a really nervous person, and it is really nice to have adult figures who are just wiser and more mature than me and who care about me and my success. Teachers have been so much more than just teachers, they have given me advice and guided me to where I am now, and I don’t know what I will do without this at GT. At GT, I have heard that the environment is very rigorous and “sink-or-swim,” and that I will get little guidance from caring adults. I have also heard that the mental health resources are really bad, and this could end up being a really big issue later on.

Lastly, I was never dead-set on studying computer science, and ever since I applied, my interest in cs has slowly waned. I still feel that this is the field I will probably end up studying, but if I do switch majors to something else, GT’s program for my new major will probably either be much worse or nonexistent. I have a plethora of other worries with GT (did I say that I was a naturally nervous person?) like bad dorms, bad food, hostile administration, far from home, grade deflation, drinking/drugs culture, a lack of tranquility in bustling Atlanta, and more, but the ones I outlined above are the main ones for me.

I guess my big takeaway is that I should have applied to different schools. A lot of my friends are going to liberal arts colleges. I did not know anything about these when I was applying, but after looking into them, they seem amazing, and I am kind of jealous. Small classes, connections with professors, great humanities departments, well-rounded education, supportive community - what is there not to like? It kind of stings to have thought of myself as the smart kid, the kid who gets the best grades, the kid who works the hardest in school, all to end up at a college that seems like a bad fit for me, while watching people, who are great but who have nonetheless accomplished less than me academically, go to colleges I wish I was going to. I thought that all of that hard work would pay off when I go to a great college, but it seems like college will just bring more problems. Maybe one day I will look back at this and see it as a good life lesson, but at the moment, I can’t help but feel worried and disappointed.

It is kind of nice whenever I see people praise GT, both here and in real life, and some of my friends are just the kindest souls in the world and have been trying to reassure me this whole time. But all of this discussion about how GT is amazing - about how it is one of the best engineering / CS schools in the country, etc. - kind of confuses me. In terms of actual education, it is not like GT, or really any other top cs school like MIT, Stanford, etc. will teach me some secret formula or concept that another small, liberal arts college won't, right? Infact, I imagine that the education at the liberal arts college would be better, since the classes would be smaller, and I would have a greater opportunity to interact with professors. I also hear about how Georgia Tech has a lot of great opportunities outside the classroom, like with internships and research with faculty, but then again, a lot of liberal arts colleges have similar opportunities, and for them, there are much less people competing for them. Lastly, I have heard that GT has a great track record with employers, but my goal would probably be to go to grad school first, and I’m guessing that an LAC will be better for that goal, since getting good grades and letters of recommendation would be easier. All in all, I can’t help but undermine the great things I heard about Georgia Tech. Maybe it is just my nervousness getting the best of me, but don’t the things I am saying have some validity to them?

Overall, I feel like college should be a space to explore myself and my various interests. It should be a place of growth, somewhere that I can be happy, healthy, and develop into a more informed, more mature, and more thoughtful person. But I feel like Georgia Tech is not this place for me. The more I learn about it, the more it seems like a factory that produces workers to feed the demands of big tech companies.

I guess the reason why I am making this post is to ask for advice. Should I try to transfer? Should I try to take / audit humanities classes at Emory? Also, am I sleeping on GT? Are any of the points I made incorrect? I am just a high school senior who does not know a whole lot, so that is very possible. If you could make me feel a little better about Georgia Tech and my current situation, I would really appreciate it. Lastly, I do realize that, compared to a lot of people, I am in an incredible position of privilege at having even the opportunity to go to a college. If this post is inappropriate or just tone-deaf because of this, please let me know. Thanks for reading, and sorry that this is super long."

This endeavor not only allows me to showcase my creativity but also serves as a platform to connect with fellow artists and potential clients. It has been a rewarding experience so far, and I am constantly refining my skills and expanding my portfolio.

Despite my dedication and qualifications, securing a graphic designer job has proven to be a challenge. However, I firmly believe that the right opportunity is just around the corner. I am eager to contribute my expertise, bring fresh perspectives to projects, and collaborate with talented individuals in a professional setting.

If any of you have advice, tips, or recommendations on how I can enhance my chances of landing a graphic designer position in Germany, I would be immensely grateful. Whether it's networking opportunities, industry events, or specific job boards, I am open to any suggestions that can help me further my career aspirations.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Best regards,

Mona"

I was working on an economics degree at 18, but my father revoked financial funding when I admitted to switching to a social work degree. As a result, I owed about 15k to my university, didn't qualify for financial aid, and couldn't fund my education myself. 

By 2020, this debt was paid off, I had rid myself of any other debt, and I'd saved enough money to return to school without financial aid. I was able to return in the Spring of 2021. I paid for the first year and a half on my own, but my degree program limits my ability to work, so I am now reliant on a scholarship that pays 100% of any costs associated with my education. I do work part time, but my fiance covers the majority of our living expenses. I have overloaded my schedule every semester and taken as many summer courses as possible, meaning that I am currently on track to graduate in Spring of 2024 with a degree in education. It would be this coming fall, but my degree program has an internship requirement that adds an extra semester with no classes. I will not be allowed to work at all during that semester. 

Now to my current issue. I was very proactive in planning my schedule multiple semesters in advance. I knew that by overloading my schedule it would be important for my advisor and I to have a very clear plan from day one. If even a minor change occurred I would forward these changes to my advisor for review. I'm going to bullet point the sequence of events that have taken place as its quite a bit all typed out.

* February: Attended appointment with my advisor to be greenlit for summer and fall classes. Was advised class A may not be available, class B would require individual study, and Class C would require May Intercession. Thus was due to low enrollment and I should be prepared for it to change. 

* March: University published classes. Class A was available, B was available during May Intercession, C required a substitution. 

* March: Emailed the department head requesting approval for Class C's substitution. She approved it. Emailed my advisor asking he submit paperwork for substitution. He responded that he would. 

* March: Asked advisor to review my graduation plan due to the above changes and others (two classes switched where a summer course became fall and vice versa) My advisor replied that everything looked great. My degree program is a mix of two departments, so he forwarded the info to another advisor in that department and they also approved my plan.

* Early April: Enrolled in all classes except class D in the Fall. My fall schedule required approval from the vice dean due to the overload. Recieved approval same day and forwarded it to my advisor, who replied that he would submit the paperwork.

* Mid April: had not received emails confirming either my substitution or overload had been approved. Checked my degree plan just in case. Found that I was not enrolled a specific type of course that was required. I had two options and only needed one. Option 1 has not been offered since 2020, Option 2 is only offered in the Fall but they are skipping 2023 which is unusual.

* Mid April: Emailed my advisor asking for help with Class E as its not being offered. Instead of helping, he admitted that the paperwork for my substitution for class C had been lost and he had no record of it being approved. I provided the emails and again asked help with Class E. He refused to help until Class C had been corrected. 

* 1 week later I received approval for Class C. Emailed asking for help with Class E again. Advisor responded telling me to be patient because approval for Class C would take time. I responded reiterating that it had already been approved but I needed help with Class E.

* Late April: Advisor finally replied, ignored class E, and admitted that there was no record of approval for my overload with class D. I forwarded all necessary emails, including when he said he'd fill things out, and requested help with Class E. He again instructed me to wait until I received formal approval for Class D.

* Early May: Received email with official approval for class D. Due to it being the end of the semester, I waited until 1 hour after grades were due on May 4th to ask for assistance with class E. Advisor said he would get on it ASAP.

* May 9th: logged into school website to look for syllabus for May Intercession course (Class B). There was no syllabus. Class B was removed from my schedule. Emailed advisor asking for information on B and update on E. No reply.

* May 10th: Email from Dept head advising B had been canceled for low enrollment. Only 1 available alternative in the Summer and I've already taken it. I can't take anymore Fall courses. Emailed advisor again explaing B had been canceled and asking for update on E. No reply.

* May 11th: Friday. Text from advisor offering substitution for class E that would start the following Monday (May 15) during May Intercession during hours I am scheduled to work. I work in emergency services. Not going in for 12 days would mean losing my job, my health insurance, and just generally failing others. Explained I wouldn't be able to find coverage on such short notice (although I did try continuously until Monday morning). No reply from advisor. 

* May 15: Emailed advisor asking for a substitution during the summer for class B. Was told I would not be offered any other substitutions.

* May 16: Emailed advisor asking for help with classes B and E again. Reminded advisor this would mean late graduation and loss of financial aid. Revieved out of office reply saying I would not get a reply until August.

* May 17: Received email from advisor with dept head CCed. My explicitly stated that the vice dean found a solution to class B. He did not explain this solution. Dept head offered to let me take one of her courses (Class F) to substitute class E. I have already taken this class. She said we'd make it work. I accepted.

* May 23: Received email from dept head saying she enrolled me in class F, but also class G. I don't need class G. Class G does not substitute class B. It would substitute class E, but then F would not be needed. Also, I don't know who she enrolled in these courses but it wasn't me. 

*May 24: Emailed my advisor asking for clarification on the solution to class B he mentioned on the 17th, just in case G is a substitution for B and I'm just confused. Advisor told me to refer to email I mentioned in the last bullet. I apologized for not understanding, admitted I didn't know G could sub B, and emailed the dept head thanking her for her assistance 

* May 24: Advisor replied after a few hours saying G can't sub B, he has no idea what I'm talking about, and he never said anyone had a solution to B (even though I forwarded the email he says this in). I sent an email to the dept head apologizing for being confused and explaining I only need G or F, not both. I requested I only take G as I've already taken F.

* May 24: Received very upset email from dept head saying she was wiping her hands of the situation amd further solutions were up to my advisor to find. She also said that by taking class G, I'd be forcing that professor to completely revamp her undergrad course. The dept head had never said anything about this when she initially enrolled me in the course and made it seem like a great idea. Advisor replied saying he'd get to it, but I have very little faith in him at this stage. (I should note I took one of my advisors classes last semester and it took him the entire semester to grade a paper turned in in the first month. He's very disorganized and forgetful)

While I am getting a degree in education, it is a stepping stone to a masters in educational psychology. I don't actually need a degree on education to go this route. It was a personal choice so that I could have more professional freedom while finishing my masters. The program my degree plan is in allows me to create a plan for a different degree but includes courses I've already taken so I can see exactly what I would need to take. I used this to see what I would need for a psychology degree. As I've already taken many courses on that plan, I would only need to take 12 courses. All of these courses are currently listed as available and it would allow me to graduate on time with much less risk of a late graduation (bigger department, less risk of cancelation). I would be able to stay in my current field when completing my masters, but work more and make more (about as much as I'd make as a teacher), or work in a field more closely related to my degree in a much less stressful position (but make slightly less than I would as a teacher). I have several friends with psychology degrees who work for this second option and they all absolutely love it.

My fiancé is worried that changing my degree when I'm so close would be a rash, panicked decision. He said he'd be happy for me to keep making less for an extra year if it means I'd get to teach, but it's not even about the money at this point (although that is a concern for me). I just feel very unsupported in my current program and I know there are other options."

13r8y5q,77,2023-05-25,"TIFU by thinking I was in a committed relationship while being dumped,- Update months later",whatevenismylife69,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/13r8y5q/tifu_by_thinking_i_was_in_a_committed/,"I would be very suprised if this post wasn't deleted but I made a post a few months ago about finding out I was in a committed relationship while being dumped. The post was deleted and I honestly forgot about making it.

Basically in the original post I thought I had a fwb situation with a friend but he thought it was something more and when he was dumping me, I found out he thought we were exclusive for 3 months and that us being in a relationship was implied though we had never talked about being anything other than casual.

Just to answer some questions-
A. How were we able to see each other so much? We're college students. Our apartments are literally a street apart. We could go over to each other's all the time, whenever we wanted.

B. What was the relationship like?
We would literally text each other memes or funny things or ask when the other person was free to hook up. There was no in depth convos, dates, or anything like that. Sometimes, we would hook up multiple times a week, sometimes once in 2 weeks. 

C. What were the fun activities?
Movies, bowling, indoor golf, and just walking on a trail, etc. We're in college and not rich. 

D. Was what was expected dicussed?
 Yes, in detail. Before we started a sexual relationship, we discussed what we expected, the rules, what we wanted and what we would do if someone changed their mind? We both wrote the rules down in our phones and the biggest rule was to communicate if something changed for you. 

E. How many ppl were u hooking up with?
One other person, believe it or don't, but I had him and another person. If one was busy, another was usually available. 

F. Did he know you were hooking up with other ppl?
I told him early on I was talking/hooking up with another person but I didn't explicity tell him who that person was. I used protection and I have been tested for both. 

After me leaving his apartment after the initial  post, we didn't talk for months. I did a semester abroad and he did an internship in another city. When we were both on the same campus again, I messaged him to discuss things.

I asked him, did he really think we were in a committed relationship?
He said no. Though he was down for a fwb, once he saw me talking to a guy at a bar, he got jealous and didnt want me talking to anyone else.

Why did he act like we were in a committed relationship? 
Because he wanted to see my reaction. If I was hurt that he was ending it, then he would have changed his mind and gave it another chance but exclusively this time. 

Was he hooking up with other ppl too?
Yes. So he was never exclusive with me and made up the relationship angle as a lie. 

I honestly panicked in that initial conversation and I apologized if I hurt him in any way but until that point, I thought we had both been transparent with each other. Turns out he didn't really like the idea of me hooking up with any one else but him and made up this committed relationship. We are now good and back to being platonic friends.

TL;DR: Fwb dumped me and made me think he thought we were in a committed relationship. Turns out feelings on his end had changed and he didn't want me seeing other people. We talked it out and are now platonic friends.


Edit: We barely see each other now. I haven't hooked up with him since before the ""breakup convo"" and don't ever plan to do it again since I know there were feelings on his end that I don't reciprocate. I can see what he did was manipulative but I don't really care to get an apology from him. I will just maintain my distance. I appreciate the concern though."

13rhaww,7,2023-05-25,Sizing Conductors per NEC,tryingEE,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/13rhaww/sizing_conductors_per_nec/,"I am a new intern at a MEP consulting firm and I was given a practice assignment to size a 100 A 3p 4w service system. Knowing that it is 4 wire, I went to NEC table 310.15(B)(3)(a) and used the adjustment factor of 80% to the ampacity. Since this circuit needs 100 amps but the number of wires reduces the ampacity, I went backwards. 100 divided by 80% is 125. With that in mind, going to table 310.15(B)(16), I used the 90 degrees column because I did calculations (also I am assuming copper THHN conductor and the ambient temperature won't affect the temperature). This leads to a 2 AWG wire. Then, for the grounding wire, I used table 250.122 and since the current is 100, that lead to a 8 AWG. This allowed me to find the conduit sizing, which I am extremely confident with conduit sizing, just scuffed with conductor sizing.  


All in all, I just do not know if I am overcomplicating the math, because if I use the 60 degrees column in table 310.15(B)(16) (since the circuit is only 100 A) this would let me use a bigger conductor, a 1 AWG. I know that if I calculated a 2 AWG, then I should be allowed to use a bigger wire (for the most part).

I guess my specific questions pertain to when to use the different degrees in table 310.15(B)(16). My understanding is 60 degrees is for 100 A or less, 75 degrees are over 100 A and all motors, and 90 degrees is for calculations (when temperature and quantity of wires affect ampacity). Also, if my math thought process is correct."

I am considering applying for a data analyst job in London/UK.

I have tried to gain some considerable experience in this field but wanted to try the market for UK/London since I have heard that the competition for the job isn't so fierce.

I don't have any plans to move there but a contract-based job or an internship from abroad might be a good experience if it's for a small period like 1-1.5 years.

Has anyone had any experience in this situation or can guide me if it's a good idea or not or if I should continue searching in India?

About my ECs, I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, and would not have regretted doing them even with a less successful admissions cycle. 

**Tips**:

Essays guys!!! In the end, AOs want to see how your current set of skills/experiences will apply well to their institution (academically, socially, etc.) and whether you are likely to use your/your college's resources to make a real impact throughout your life. Essays are the way to do this!! Once you got the baseline stats, make sure to be very vigilant with your essays; you'll already be ahead if you get your most important points across!

Apart from this, DO ECs THAT YOU ENJOY - excellence will follow, and you'll enjoy high school more!

I grew up religious and believed that as long as I survived through everything, life would just get better due to god's plan/the universe being in balance.  
  
Now I'm 23 and just so tired of struggling. I've always struggled with depression, even as a little kid, but I haven't been suicidal since I graduated from college, up until this month.  
  
Socially I've literally always struggled. I had no social skills growing up due to being bullied and had few to no friends up until graduating from college. I've managed to build up some skills and make a few friends in my current city, although none of them are all that close. I've also begun trying to date last year but have only had negative experiences, including being ghosted by a guy after going on multiple dates.  
  
I used to console myself by telling myself that even though I was friendless, I was good at school and would be successful later in life, but now I'm not so sure. My life initially seemed to be going somewhere academically. I graduated from a semi-prestigious college and got into a PhD program at 21, which impresses everyone outside academia. In reality, the program is small and severely underfunded. People regularly graduate without the required publications and struggle to find a career in academia. Knowing this I've been trying to get a summer internship at a company, but I failed. I fear I'll eventually graduate without qualifications for either academia or industry. My parents tell me I was stupid for getting a degree in something so impractical (especially since I'm not interested or qualified for clinical or psychiatry). I'm starting to regret it too, or at least I regret being too depressed in college to study hard and get into a better lab in a better funded university.  
  
I just feel so hopeless. Many people my age may not have their life completely together, but they're at least going somewhere. They have a partner they hope to marry someday, or they're starting their first full-time jobs.  
  
I know none of you can truly do this, at least without lying, but I need someone to tell me that one day my life will be so great that all this suffering will be worth it. I'll go to bed thinking about my husband rather than all the men who've rejected me. I'll wake up excited for my job rather than dreading filling out internship applications and knowing I'm not going to get anything a week from June. I don't know how I'm going to keep going now that I can no longer see a light at the end of the tunnel."

I'm a rising senior in college so it's crucial that I land an internship this summer. I have the opportunity to work with a startup on their app, using React Native and Firebase. It's part-time, 20 hours/week (allegedly) with daily stand-up meetings. However, it's unpaid (lowkey illegal).

On the other hand, I have the opportunity to be a summer camp instructor who teaches kids ages 10-18 how to code. I would have to relocate and work 9am-5pm, M-F, but housing and food is provided and I'd be paid $16/hr.

I was wondering what would be the best choice. The end goal is to be a software engineer. I'm fortunate enough that my parents can support me while I do an unpaid internship, but I'm uncomfortable with that and want to help with the bills. The summer camp position lets me ease the load on my parents, and it sounds fun. My parents have also bought everyone in the family plane tickets to visit our extended family in late June. I would be able to go if I took the unpaid internship, but unable if I took the summer camp position.

Now my schools Discrete I and Data structures courses were very subpar. We did a total of two proof problems for Discrete I across the whole semester and I finished the course with A over 5 weeks in the winter without learning a thing. As for Data structures we did not touch a single sorting algorithm, the course went over the basis and implementation of linked lists, stacks, queues, lists, recursion (briefly), collections, sorted lists, graphs and trees. That’s it. I am severely underprepared in terms of background knowledge going into these courses at the 4 year school and I’m not sure what to do or how to prepare.

# Please read this, and I hope you can seriously consider if CS is the right path for you to explore.

Before anything else: **What makes me qualified to talk about majoring in CS / the tech market?**

I'm majoring in CS (tbh it's at vanderbilt, so it's not anywhere near cutthroat like MIT/Caltech), I landed an internship at a large tech company (think uber, airbnb, type names), and all my friends are also CS majors at top engineering schools (uw mad, mit, berkeley, gtech, etc). Obviously I'm not sundar pichai or zuck, but i think i have a pretty solid understanding of the absolute fuckery that is the CS job market and path rn.

&#x200B;

**Can't I just grind Leetcode, join a few engineering orgs, and then land my dream 150k+ a year SWE job?**

I see so many HS kids/freshmen saying this on this sub. CS pays well, CS is great, in CS you only work 40 hrs a week but make upper 100s, etc.

CS *is* great. CS *does* pay extremely well. In some cases, CS is *only* a 40 hour workweek with six figure pay. But I'm really sorry to report that it's not 2015 anymore, and the market is grossly oversaturated, almost impossibly competitive, and full of new technologies that can fuck over your desired tech job in a matter of months.

*You cannot just Leetcode your way into a SWE job anymore*. I'm cracked at Leetcode. So are all of my friends. I still submitted around 350 internship applications, and received only 5 offers, three of which were absolutely horrible (one ended up being straight-up UNPAID).

If you're considering CS, do not pay attention to those tiktokers telling you it's easy, or that a bootcamp can easily boost you up to a great paying job. It's possible, but you either need to have the luck of a lephrecaun OR the brains of elon musk and albert einstein combined.

&#x200B;

**What makes the job market so bad?**

Honestly, too many factors to go over in one post. Also, I don't know every single reason why, and neither does anybody else. Part of it is due to tech companies grossly overhiring during the pandemic, and suddenly laying off/cutting down new/rehires after realizing they brought on way too many people. Part of it is just the shitty economy in general. Part of it is companies being scared of new tech (i'm looking at you, AI). Regardless of what the reason(s) are, it's shit. It'll get better within a few years, but it will take a LONG time before it's anywhere near the pre 2021 boom that many of you are seeking and thinking about.

&#x200B;

**Okay, but I still want to do CS. Wtf do I do? Am I just mega-fucked?**

Kind of, but not really. First, you should realize that great CS jobs are just like t20 admissions now. There are so many perfect applicants that it's just not possible for everyone to get a job. Microsoft isn't paying $200k to 15 backend devs just because all 15 can do 2 leetcode hards in 40 mins and pass a basic behavioral when they only need 5.

Second, you've got to grind. You know how kids that want to do banking start grinding when they get onto campus since offers are given out by the end of sophomore year? You should do that too for tech now. It's not the end of the world if you don't get an internship in your 1st or even ur 2nd year, but it will help immensely. Start Leetcode. Learn unique but employable skills like Kubernetes or even something easy like the basics of scrum. Join engineering orgs, start projects, and network with people. Be a try hard. Idc if it's embarassing, because if you want the dream tech job that the Essentials hoodie wearing dude on tiktok has, you've got to do it.

Third, you've got to realize that it's just a numbers game. A2C has gotten great at this recently - I see so many less salty kids who didn't get into their dream ED school or something. Applicants are becoming more adjusted to the reality of admissions - it's a numbers game, but an unfair one. Life be like that. Like I said above, there are literally thousands of kids that would absolutely DESTROY an internship at your dream FAANG company (destroy in a good way, btw). But they don't have that kind of space or money. It's a business at the end of the day. You are NEVER entitled to a job just because you're qualified.

&#x200B;

**What now, then? What are alternate paths, other things I should consider, etc.?**

If you're still hell-bent on becoming a SWE at your dream FAANG company, I respect you. I believe in you. I hope you know it's going to be hard, but it will also make the achievement feel so much better for you.

If you're now a little iffy on CS, I want you to know that there are SO many other CS jobs that aren't necessarily as saturated as SWE is that still pay well. PM, DevOps, UI/UX, product design, etc etc etc. So many exciting sectors of tech and types of tech jobs.

I still firmly believe that CS is a great major/degree, and it's still arguably one of the most valuable, employable majors. It's just that its become TOO popular, and combined with the market rn, it's rough.

I was on this sub for like three years with another account, and I understand how nerve-wracking college, your major, internships, etc all are. I think that's why I posted this - I really want to help.

If you are intending to major in CS / are already doing CS related things, reach out to me if you have any questions. I'm not an expert by any means, but I do think that I can at least provide some perspective and a very realist opinion on what you're curious about.

**EDIT 1:** There are a ton of really upset people in the comments, everyone with differing opinions. I should qualify that most of what i wrote here is taken directly or influenced heavily by real conversations going on over at r/cscareerquestions. Some people being overly negative, in my opinion, are trying to cope with an incredibly tough market - I get it"

Would one of these look better on a resume than the other when applying for summer 2024 internships?"
13ruom2,0,2023-05-25,"I just finished my first year, what should I do over the summer to prepare me for the future?",zdrunc,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13ruom2/i_just_finished_my_first_year_what_should_i_do/,"Before anyone says this, yes I am going to have tons of fun, this is probably the last time ill have a 3 month break for summer, however, what should I do in my free time to prepare for my CS career. Also, if it matters, I only learned C++ this year.

Some things I already plan to do:

1. Fix up my resume, get it ready so I can apply for internships for next summer or even over the winter.
2. Practice C++ and try to do one or two projects with it.
3. Start learning HTML and CSS, and maybe make a website and try to integrate C++ into it in some way."
13rv6fn,0,2023-05-25,Which would you hire?,barowner1234,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13rv6fn/which_would_you_hire/,"I am currently deciding between two candidates for a social media intern role for a non-profit. Which would you choose?

Candidate 1

* Pros  

   * Very bright, thoughtful, and polished.
   * Has worked/interned at non-profits in similar roles before.
   * Just graduated and is looking for work in the non-profit space.
* Cons  

   * Content from her prior roles is not very engaging. Said that they felt very limited by management to be very creative.
   * No discernable personal social presence. I understand wanting to lock down your personal feeds but I would expect someone applying for a social role to have a portfolio or something similar.

Candidate 2

* Pros  

   * Has a viral TikTok with over 100,000 users so has demonstrated ability to create engaging content.
   * Has worked/interned at non-profits in similar roles before.
* Cons  

   * Did not do any research about the organization prior to the interview.
   * Not as polished.
   * Content from their viral TikTok is a tad risque. Not sure why they wouldn't remove their real name from the account.
   * Working in the non-profit space isn't an end goal. Wants to work somewhere cool and exciting (I'm paraphrasing)."

I know cornell is better for CS, but gtown is very close to my house and I love the opportunities they give for internships at DC. I also like the small campus and I have toured the campus. However, CS at Cornell from what I heard and the program is good as well. I also think a cs degree at Cornell will probably hold a higher value. Does any one have some thoughts or advice."

13rxjlw,22,2023-05-25,VLSI/Computer Architecture career questions,Cheesybox,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/13rxjlw/vlsicomputer_architecture_career_questions/,"Hi all. I graduated in 2020 with a BS in Computer Engineering. I focused mostly on RTL level design (FPGAs, Verilog), but my main passion was VLSI and computer architecture. I took a computer architecture class and an VLSI class in undergrad, but I pivoted into FPGAs when I learned that what I wanted to do would most likely require a Masters. I thought I might be able to leverage some experience plus my education to get an entry level job in the field. I've been applying for entry level positions and internships and haven't had any luck yet. So I have a couple questions about breaking into VLSI/computer architecture jobs:

1. Are there any project ideas + free tools and documentation that I could use to refresh my memory on these concepts? I've got all my old notes from school but that only goes so far. Plus I want to see if I still enjoy the process as much as I did a few years ago. If I don't enjoy it much then this is all moot.

2. What's the day-to-day look like? On paper I love the idea of designing new CPUs/GPUs/RAM/motherboards/etc, but I don't know specifically what these kinds of jobs look like in the day-to-day stuff.

3. Are these kinds of jobs only found in California? It seems like that's the only option. AMD has a few openings from time to time in Colorado and Nvidia sometimes has some stuff in Raleigh, NC. Ideally I'd work remote as much as possible but mostly stay on the east coast (US). Is that realistic?

4. Is a Masters essentially required? It certainly feels that way. I haven't had any luck despite a few years experience in a related field (FPGA/embedded systems hardware security). Is there anything I can do with a Bachelors that might help me in some way?

Thanks in advance for any advice."

I would prefer a sub-industry that does materials (specifically urethane formulations) but thats just a preference.

Currently I got some jr positions in engineering clubs (Areo, Baja and ""society""), going to stack some minor projects this summer (CAD weirdly-shaped boomerang and some arduino stuff), have a 3 month summer co-op term doing electrical installations for projects (best i could hustle for first year).

**Thoughts**

Honestly pretty shocked about the whole waitlist thing because I thought waitlists were just soft rejections but I guess I got lucky. As an engineering student, I got a lot of pushback from friends about not deciding to go to Georgia Tech because of its ranking and reputation in engineering specifically, but ultimately I liked the vibe / resources / flexibility of a smaller non state flagship colleg experience. Picking between Northwestern and Duke was really tough and I think there still is a chance I could end up regretting not choosing Northwestern, but ultimately Duke won me over by its campus, its weather (compared to Northwestern which gets very cold), semester system (Northwestern is quarter), and combined CS + Computer Engineering program (something I very likely will do). Overall though, the college process was definitely frustrating to me with me getting 11 waitlists, but ultimately I’m super grateful and lucky / happy that it all worked out for me in the end."

Anyway, I’ve been a SWE at a FAANG+ company for ~2.5 years now. I graduated from a T20 school with a BS in math. My original goal was to go into quant trading at a trading firm or hedge fund like Jane Street, Citadel, Optiver, etc. 

Wondering how realistic it is to jump from being a junior SWE to an entry level quant trader. Do you think I can pass resume screens? I have all the necessary mental math/probability/statistics knowledge already and got to final rounds when I applied out of undergrad but now I’m worried I’ve been slotted into a perma engineering career. 

Also would appreciate suggestions on how I can improve my chances to make the jump. Thanks!

Edit: have heard Jane street basically only takes its QT’s from their intern pipeline…is this true? If so, would I be better served applying to the intern position first?"
13s1zk2,1,2023-05-25,What should I pursue?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13s1zk2/what_should_i_pursue/,"I have never taken education as a child quite seriously, and I regret that now. Somehow, I made it to engineering; today is officially my last day of engineering.  
Yes, I do hold a computer science degree, but I am still jobless. I regret not studying hard enough for jobs and not applying for internships during my sphomore year. It is now that seeing all my friends going places made me realise that I too, want to improve my life and prosper in life. And I will do at every cost, whatever it takes.  
  
I am scared that I am late and I know I cannot turn back time and correct my mistakes.

I always wanted to pursue MBA, but a part of me also wants to carry forward as a computer science engineer. I want to get a software developer job first and then do MBA. I am technically wasting this year doing nothing except applying to job portals, learning frontend.

  
My dad wants me to apply for a master's in US. As a child, I never had good grades so I have technically ruined my chances to apply to ambitious universities forever. Also, I am not confident enough about doing a masters since I am kind of weak in math. And only a job/ internship can fix me now. Really very confused about what to do next. About MBA, I'll have to sit for GMAT and as an international student with poor grades, I think I have ruined my chances of applying to any university forever. Idk how to make a comeback, which path should I work on.

Please tell me what should I do next as I keep applying for jobs and make projects this year."

2. Vice Principle / Track Coach (still debating): We didn't have an actual coach my entire track season, we got coached by the varsity coach. When we went to meets and had home meets, a lot of the time there wouldn't be anyone that understood how to run it or anything. So I got up and decided to run it as best as I could, I ran it the best I could under the vice principle saw me and was pretty happy by what I was doing and he convinced my coach to make me captain of the team. I just don't know exactly who I should ask.

13s25l2,12,2023-05-25,How to get cracked ECs over the summer?,heavenlylord,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13s25l2/how_to_get_cracked_ecs_over_the_summer/,"I'm finishing 11th grade (want to study CS) and my stats are very good (36 ACT, lots of APs, like a 4.7 GPA) but my ECs are kinda nonexistent (no research 💀 no internships 💀 no crazy competitions 💀 no volunteer work 💀 no sports (that I'm good at) 💀 no nonprofit started 💀). I have skills (music, programming, writing) but very little to show for it basically except for a couple clubs, honor societies, science olympiad, etc.

Anyone have tips on how to use this summer effectively to improve my ECs? Do I even have a chance at top schools when I've so far done so little? I feel kinda lost and I'm not really sure where to start."

I left my job to attend a free, non-profit coding bootcamp for women that widely advertised a guaranteed internship with one its tech company partners, and the alumni of this program had managed to break into tech at staggeringly high rates, so I was incredibly hopeful that this would be my best chance at breaking into a career that I would genuinely enjoy.

The first few months of the classroom portion were such a blast; my love for coding has only increased with the sheer amount of material and projects being thrown at us. Just last week, though, the leadership of this bootcamp dropped the bomb that for the first time in this organization’s existence, there were only enough internships for 10% of the students… and the students who got the internships would be randomly selected. According to leadership, companies don’t want junior interns at all, even for free.

One of my instructors—who has worked at big-name tech companies and has a Master’s in computer science—was very frank in telling some students that there is a very low chance we’ll get an internship, much less a job, without experience in this climate. The same sentiment was echoed by my program mentor just earlier today. My mentor’s own employer, a smaller tech company, shut down the entire department that hired junior talent just two days ago. Other teaching assistants for the program have been telling us the same in office hours.

I am heartbroken and discouraged. I do not want to give up coding at all, and I don’t want to see other passionate junior developers give up either, but I’m at a loss as to what to do now. Is it even worth it to try and form connections with other developers at this point? I was hoping I could do that through the (now non-existent) internship. Should I keep learning more frameworks and working on projects while hoping that the tech sector will improve? Do I grind leetcode?? I feel very directionless—any advice would be massively appreciated."

My name is Suraj. I am a web developer currently, I am self taught and working at a very small company. When I started learning about the field of IT and software 4 years ago I had no exposure to the field and not enough money to get a degree, but got very interested in the field of Data Science. So, I learnt python, after that I had no guidance for a long time, someone suggested that I learn web developement mean while, so I did that and got a job.

I am still interested in Data Science, but, not getting any perspective on what to do, I used CHAT GPT to get the subjects and topics that are needed in data science. I am studying statistics by my self and also pursuing BCA.

The current market scenario prefers people with engineering degree, but people with different backgrounds have also been able to transition into this field. I am in need of proper guidance from those, who have been able to do achieve success and can provide guidance and show me the pathway, so that I can become skillful enough for the companies to find me helpful. I am willing to put whatever efforts needed. If you are a company who is looking for someone who you can take an intern and train them, I would be willing to do that. 

Test me in whatever way you need to, in order for you to see value in me and be able to trust me.

You can directly message me.

Thank you."

I am completely stumped by the thate of GPU offers. I am aiming to get something truly, truly powerful that won't let me down. Yet GPUs feel like a fucking minefield right now.

-RTX4090 
is the excalibur holy grail ark of the covenant, from what is described. Apparently power incarnate and the toughest strongest card on the market.

I remember when the 1080ti held that title, and i dont hear anyone talk about it anymore. 

Also, it costs almost my whole budget, 450w scares me a bit, and may be overkill for my needs. I want to render 3d animations and afyer effects videos. Sure. Ill play some games, but my priority isn't 4K 800 fps crysis whatever, lol. While I would looooove a card that probably won't be obsolete or need replacing for the next 8-10 years, i wonder if that doesn't apply to something cheaper.

-the 3060.
I heard everything ranging from ""best value"" to ""this insanely outdated and ewaste by today's standards"" to ""everything above has been a scam"". Which is it? 

-3090 and 4070.
I found a few weird comparisons between the two. Can't seem to figure what is or not a good choice.

-4080?
Seems like a good card for me, not as prohibitively expensive as 4090 and perhaps less overkill, but i still find it in the same cobversation about the 40 series in general being terribly priced.





So uh... could i have some directions here? Looking online for reviews or comparisons has me completely lost and confused. I just want a damn good card. I cannot stomach editing video on a tiny laptop for longer. For literal years i simply couldn't affort a machine, but now that i can, its a damn minefield."

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm at a crossroads in my academic journey and would greatly appreciate your insights and experiences. I'm currently considering four universities to pursue a Master's in Data Science (MSDS) program: Northeastern Silicon Valley Campus, Indiana Bloomington, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Stevens Institute of Technology. With so many options available, I'm finding it difficult to make a final decision.

Here are a few key factors that I'm considering while making this choice:

1. **Curriculum and Course Offerings**: I want to ensure that the university offers a well-rounded and comprehensive curriculum that covers all essential aspects of data science. Are there any specific courses or areas of focus that are particularly impressive at any of these institutions?
2. **Faculty and Research Opportunities**: Engaging with knowledgeable faculty members who are actively involved in research can be a huge plus. Are there any notable professors or research initiatives in the field of data science at these universities?
3. **Internship and Job Placement**: Practical experience and industry connections are crucial for launching a successful career. Which university has a strong network of industry partners, internship opportunities, and a good track record of job placement for MSDS graduates?
4. **Campus Life and Location**: While academics are important, a vibrant campus life and a supportive community can greatly enhance the overall experience. I'd love to hear about the campus culture and student life at these universities, as well as any advantages or disadvantages associated with their locations.
5. **Scholarship and Financial Aid**: As a prudent student, I'm also considering the financial aspect. Are there any notable scholarships, grants, or financial aid packages available for students pursuing an MSDS program at these universities?

If you have any personal experiences, anecdotes, or general knowledge about these universities or their MSDS programs, please share your thoughts! I'm open to hearing any additional factors that you believe should be taken into consideration while making this decision.

CloudCrack leverages the nearly infinite resources of AWS to allow large-scale password-cracking operations from the command line of any device. As ReadMe explains, the supporting infrastructure runs entirely within the Free Tier meaning you only pay for the pure hashing power you use. All operations happen within your AWS account. That means no sharing of keys or data beyond your account.

The first is with a somewhat recognizable company but nothing a recruiter would do a double take for. It's in a field that interests me, and I got it after meeting a recruiter at a job fair and successfully completing one 'resume interview' and one coding interview—the process was really not too difficult.

The second offer is at one of the most impressive companies around, pays more, and the work is in a similar field but would likely be a bit more interesting. To get the job I completed a phone interview and then a really difficult, 2-week long take-home project which apparently impressed my boss...but I know for a fact that I only got the initial phone interview through a reference from my Dad's past coworker who is very high up in the company. My boss didn't know I was selected for a phone interview because of a reference, so the rest of the process was solely merit based, but obviously getting my resume boosted is a huge help.

I am extremely confident that taking the second offer would be much better for my future career and likely make for a better summer, but I really don't want to have to say for the rest of my career that I got where I am because my Dad knew the right person.

I had this interview with a very small IT company that already made an offer for a business intelligence/data analysis role (internship). I don’t like this company too much because is very small but I value the experience I might acquire in the field to then move to a better company.

I also got contacted from a major IT company for a data analysis role (internship) and is a company I really like. Had 2 successful interviews with this and should had a third interview in the coming days. They already told me that my qualifications are totally in line with what they are looking for and the third interview is more or less an additional step, because the feedback is already quite positive.

Both companies would like to keep the person after the internship is over.
The small company needs a response from me more or less immediately, and can’t wait any longer. 
I don’t have an offer from the bigger company and potentially the third interview will be ok (but in theory they can still not confirm me).

Point is: with the small company I could get the course certificate because that internship is considered part of the course program, while the internship in the bigger company can’t be considered part of the course for burocracy reasons so in that case I won’t get any certificate for the course.

Should I just take what they are offering me now (very small company) so I get my course certificate and later on find a bigger company OR reject the small company offer and give up on the course/certificate, in order to do the final interview and potentially begin my career in this field with a major company that I really like?

I recently acquired an Associate in Applied Science: Computer and Information Technologies with Programming (where I learned Python, Java, Javascript, PHP, SQL, C#, HTML & CSS) and went back for my Bachelors. Unfortunately, in my state fully remote is very limited, everything was IT communications, IT Applied Computer Science, IT Computer Science, no Bachelors of Computer Science, sadly. 

At this point it comes down to these 3 but my concern is since it's an IT oriented degree that employers wont find it appealing. Will it be as effective as a BSCS when I get back out there looking for internships and future jobs?

Where my head sits is that Software Engineering is great, it's fun (I expect that to change when I work) but it's also extremely competitive. Ever since COVID there was an insane rise and since the mass layoffs have happened competition isn't getting any easier for fully remote entry, especially not with a criminal record.

Data Science seems very interesting and I love to manipulate data but I am not entirely sure how effective it will be with an Bachelors IT degree in Data Science instead of a Masters or grad, same for AI Engineering. Thoughts?"

Recently I got accepted for C++ internship, for a pretty big name company, with a very real chance of staying to work part time, so I'm overjoyed and really don't wanna screw up, especially in this economy.

 Does anyone have any nice resources for more advanced C++ concepts? I'm looking mostly for books recommendations, and with focus on networks and ml, since that's the company's job, but videos on youtube/project ideas are nice too. Not exactly in a position where I have the time to do topic+reviews checks on works, cause of uni, and I'd love to hear recommendations from more experienced people. Obviously the company will give me training, and decided I know enough, but I'd like to prepare somewhat, to combat the impostor syndrome. Not to mention I like C++ and would love to study it more anyways. Thank you in advance!"

There is no offer yet but I feel I should be able to land a few.

My interview with Citadel Securities was pretty pleasant as opposed to what most online reviews says. But I sense (a lot of) concerning things from my chat with the interviewer. Like do or get fired (the interviewer blatantly said something like this), long working hours, etc. I also read that the culture is very toxic there. 

I have only had the behavioral interview with Optiver so I don't have much understanding of how good/bad the firm is. But my online search shows it to be a better place to work (WLB vs Pay).

Haven't done much research on SIG yet, but based on Glassdoor review, they seem to be struggling as well (losing many seniors).

My ideal choice is JS in HK (I am also interviewing), but in the case I don't get offer from JS, I wonder which one is the best choice for an internship and why? What are the pros and cons for doing internship for quant research in each of these places?

I like money and wouldn't mind 10+ hr days (not 12+ though) or high stress. I do like a place where there are leaves as I do get burned out sometimes and need a few days to recover. And I value places with better career growth than WLB. I am also a bit concerned about job security as I am currently an international student and would want something that I can at least keep for a few years to get my PR/citizenship in Australia."
13sbevl,2,2023-05-26,how do i stop obsessing over the co-op hunt???,cool_beanz9,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13sbevl/how_do_i_stop_obsessing_over_the_coop_hunt/,"i apologize in advance for the rant, but i didn’t know who to talk to about this. for context, i’m a third year ece student currently working at an engineering firm on my very first co-op. it’s an 8 month term and i only just started at the beginning of this month, but before my contract is up i have to find another job because the requirement for my school’s co-op program is 12 months.

the problem is that i find myself constantly distracted by thoughts about where i want to apply when that time comes. even while i’m at work (and i still have seven months to go!). it’s literally all i ever think about anymore.
last time around, i applied to ~75 jobs and got one interview - that’s where i’m working now. got rejected by all the others and it feels very bleak and while i know that rejection when applying to internships is inevitable, this just felt kind of unbelievable. meanwhile, i have friends working at large scale companies (even out in silicon valley at companies i wanted to work at!) with a very similar background to mine, and it’s soul crushing if i’m being honest. i think that’s where the obsession comes from - seeing everyone else around me being successful in jobs they actually like when i’m in a job that i was obliged to take because no one i wanted to work with wanted me. i can’t tell what makes them “better” than me on paper, especially considering i had my resume checked by many people of various backgrounds for improvements. all of this only made worse by the fact that i had every qualification the companies i wanted to work at asked for on my resume and never even got an interview (what is up with that?).
this sent me into the dreaded linkedin-doom-scrolling pit (which in hindsight was a bad idea but i could not help it at the time) and now i’m stuck here.

currently while on co-op i’m trying to upgrade myself and my skills for my resume in hopes of landing a position i’m interested in next time around, but the fear that i’m going to be about as successful next time as i was last time is also consuming me.

anyway, it’s not sustainable and i know it, but i can’t stop myself from obsessing over it and kicking myself for my shortcomings. i just need help to figure out how to get over it and keep my mindset healthy, at least for the next few months until i have to start applying to jobs again. 
i swear i have hobbies and a real life i and make sure to go outside every day but nothing is helping anymore. i’m desperately in need of advice and literally anything would be appreciated <3

TLDR: i need advice on how to stop obsessing over where, when, and how i land my next job opportunity, and to stop beating myself up over my failures. maybe just some words of encouragement too i think i could use it :’)"

I spent two years of undergrad as a Research assistant for a group where I developed software and did data analysis work. I presented the culmination of my research at a poster session of a conference where I won first place.

This experience landed me a research internship at a major tech company for Quantum computing where I worked with advisors whose research centered on computation physics. Although this was an internship for PhD students and I was only an undergraduate, I pulled through and had a successful internship. I was offered a full time contract as a research software engineer to continue the work i was doing. At the end of my contract, my advisors encouraged me to pursue grad school and at the very least, strive for a master degree. It's been nearly 2 years since the end of that contract, but I feel ready to continue and seek graduate research opportunities in quantum or computational physics. 

The reason for my low gpa was that I was simply spread too thin. I unwisely took 4 physics/astronomy classes + labs per quarter  on top of research. My lowest grades were in my elective/non major classes, I dropped the ball because I was more focused on my research and physics. Additionally, my lowest GPA was from the quarter that I suffered from a miscarriage (tmi, sorry). 

Was hoping for some advice and insight. What are my chances and what can I realistically expect from the admission process to a physics phd program? Also, any program recs? Thank you!"

Hello, I'm currently in a panic mode due to work stress and I wish for clarity and opinions. First of all I'm currently a TV producer or at least on the title it says so. 

I started as a news reporter, then radio producer and lastly this. On none of them I got a good pay even tho I achieved some mayor milestones for the executive producer (the one who finances everything) 

I loved reporting, I started as an intern and quickly got the job, sadly I started on a program that had expiration date. When it came my job made an impression on the radio side and they offered a job which I took without hesitation. 

Not a bad desition since I was jobless for like an hour. Then due to a bad and irresponsible host the program got cancelled even tho I worked my ass of and got tons of on air promotions, ads, interviews etc etc. 

Lastly the same executive moved me to another tv channel where I started to produce for a comedian. (worst mistake I ever made) I got reduced for a prop boy who had to buy everything he fancied. Once again do to irresponsabilities the comedian got fired but I was left in the work place with nothing to do. 

Now I became an errand and jack of all trades boy. One who hasn't gotten a raise since I started and all my ideas and pitches are turned down. I've been wanting to quit since I started with the comedian yet no other producer seems to want me so now I'm stucked at a job that doesn't pay me, or uses me and my experiences. I'm a lowly errand boy running floor to floor doing everybody's job for a portion of their salary and getting blamed when something goes wrong because its easier. 

I've been applying like crazy for the past 2 years, even on jobs somehow related (lateral movement) but nada. My stress because of the constant pressure, and self disappointment is unbearable. I achieved the peak and quickly got into a slope so slippery I can't get up. I wish to honor my college mayor and passion but everything is pointing for me to get on a retail or easier job (which sadly pays more). I'm overwhelmed.

Please note: Although I do not have any prior experience in backend development, I plan on learning it before the start of the internship.

This is a little bit long as I feel a little lost and I want to share my own experience but I would appreciate if anyone answer the question above if he don't have time to read all this.


I have been working for a company for 4 years now (startup) and it wasn't that bad as it was my first real world experience, it was more than just creating a CRUD application/service as it was working with terabytes of data, I am working on a large application so I found myself lucky helping to scale it up to support more users and I was flexible picking my own tasks and challenges...

I leaned a lot during the job and my contributions were quiet seen, like I significly reduced the cloud costs, improved performance significantly,  made the app more modular, started using a queue system and separated the services, I refractored some of them, had other teams refactor other modules instead of one big monolithic application, so I am basically the person to go to if someone needs technical advise with our solution or if something goes wrong..., it was a lot of stress but it was part of the experience.

Now I work more on my management skills, leading skills and project management skills which it wasn't one of my strongest skill but so far it has been a good experience and I feel my team is the most team that's achieving stuff, respecting deadlines and more organized and not feeling lost like most of the other teams...

We are like 9 developers in the company not really that big but I had the chance to work with seniors and tbh it never felt that they deserve to be called seniors, maybe they are older and have more years of experiences but when working with them I never felt I could make progress, it didn't feel right for them following a Junior/mid-level person and they are not risk takers, they don't want any responsibility and they are more want to play it safe and have all the requirements defined which is not something you can do in a startup context! they do have knowledge, I admit that, but they just don't seem to want to be the responsible for any product or define a good processes..., so aside from 1 or 2 seniors that I enjoy talking to and I always seek their advice when needed, I don't feel I am learning that much from my colleagues.

I think I was lucky because the startup business has grew and as a result my role grew and I didn't feel the need to change company but I kept feeling lately that the learning curve is slowed, I am doing more of a routine tasks and I always felt bad when thinking that my CV contains one experience after graduating that are not internships.

The reason I am writing this is that today we had a call with a lead from Amazon (it's normal with our business to be in touch with Amazon, we always have calls with product managers, tech architects.. which was also part of the experience that I liked, and never felt intimidated by them, I saw that even big companies could be lost as we are..) but today this call was different, the entire call I was afraid of saying something stupid, maybe part of it is is that the person in the call was a little arrogant but it felt that she knows what she is saying and she seemed a little difficult (I wouldn't want to miss a dead line if I was in her team 😂), that's probably the reason for the success of her team anyway but for me I was presenting my small company, I was the somehow the tech/architect ""expert"", I admit that I can't compare ourselves to Amazon because we have less resources, less experts but still the entire time I felt bad because I wasn't the senior I want to be and even that the call was ok, it still felt I am nowhere close to be a senior, I know I could do better but I am just not sure how...

I don't feel like spending my free time coding and learning new stuff as I want to enjoy my free time but at the same time I feel I am not making any progress with my carrier..., I am thinking of changing my job but I am also afraid to lose the privileges that I have now like the flexibility to pick my own challenges or probably my role in the new company won't be that much significant unless it's a startup which could be stressful but at least still better than someone asking me to do a CRUD application or fix a bug...


Also it seems this period it's quit risky to change job and join a startup, any project could be shutdown at any time if it doesn't get funds.

TL;DR: I've been working for a company for 4 years, I have learned a lot and changed my role from software developer to software architect and I am still trying to improve my skills but now I feel I am not learning as much as I used to and I feel intimidated by other people out there that have more experience and knowledge and I am not sure how to keep myself expert in my field of work."

They use latest tech stacks and the mentorship is good.

Another option is a standard paid web dev internship. The amount seems fair to  me considering i have zero experience but I might not get to learn as much since it isn't really a tech company. They just need me to work on their website.

Do paid internships have any value over unpaid ones in a profile?  Please guide me towards which offer should i accept.

13sll6k,1,2023-05-26,me ( F19-20)and my lecturer (M-27) did the deed,catastrophywaif,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13sll6k/me_f1920and_my_lecturer_m27_did_the_deed/,"Repost/update 

My (F19-20) college year is done and I’ll be switching colleges now. About 10 months ago, we had a new lecturer(M26-27)who approached me randomly one day as i was leaving the premises. Long story short i end up making out with him. He is also a student at some other university. The teachers get to know somehow. I was in a down-spiral in that phase. Ended up gathering the courage to fix things than giving up. Aced my exams. I have established a good bond between my teachers now. This was the backstory. 

Now, my lecturer has texted me a couple of times for hooking up with him and i have declined it every single time. Mind you we have hooked up for 4 times up until now. He was the first dude i had sex with. I was a little traumatised back then but it’s fine. The problem is he was verbally demeaning and would belittle me all the time when i was with him. He literally saw me as a walking-hole. Is it my mistake? Yes, fucking was a choice and i consented and it’s not like I didn’t have to bear the repercussions. He wasn’t nice to me any of these times. He would call me randomly to come do the deed. He has said very questionable things to me which is a whole list in itself and i have tried to save as many evidences as i could.
My exams are done and he hit me up again recently. I politely declined. He even asked me if i was mad at me because deep down he knew that he had said some horrible things to me. Anyways, I decided to forgive myself and forget as already 5-6 months have passed to that incident and i asked him to ‘chill out and we good’. i ensured to keep it very normal and academics related and he took it to a sexual tangent.

He hit me up again last week and did some small talk to which i kept replying normally. And then he drops the “are you done with me?” Bomb like wtf does that even mean. I felt bad. Plain simple bad. And them he goes on to say that he wanted to see me once he came back from a vacation or whatever it was. The thing that ticked me the most that he did not say anything regarding why he had texted me and simply said that i want to meet you on this this date. Hello??? How cocky do you have to be? I replied with a simple Okay.

Next day when he texted me i was done for real and i asked him to stop asking me about sex in a bit harsher tone and he replied with that he never asked me for sex? I asked what it was about and he ghosted me.
Am i going crazy??? Is something wrong with me ???? Should I apologise to him????? 

PS: AND ALL WHILE HE HAS A PARTNER ( or a potential love interest)AND TRIES TO FLIRT WITH THIS OTHER GIRL OF MY CLASS and asked me once if i was jealous of her or if i would be okay fantasising about threesome with her. i have receipts and screenshots istg
 

Now, this all happened and I recently got an opportunity to work as a trainee at his university. So we crossed paths and i kept my head lowered the entire time and avoided him at all costs after what he texted me recently about want ing to meet me. 
I m sure he was never expecting me to be there. 
Since i avoided any kind of interaction, he texted me twice regarding why am i acting so weird which btw i m trying to maintain an ethical work environment. Yes i m avoiding him but it us for my betterment because cumulatively he has done too much damage to me mentally already. 

Is it wrong of me to avoid him like that? 

Tldr: my lecturer and i had an unprofessional interaction, life went downhill, i got out of the dirt, picked myself up and mended my relationship with academics, reached a certain level, joined an internship, encountered him there, started avoiding contacts with him."
13smm6c,196,2023-05-26,My Story from CMH to Solo Private Practice,therealDonRoth,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/13smm6c/my_story_from_cmh_to_solo_private_practice/,"Hi.  I wanted to write about my experience in the mental health field to help demonstrate some of the ups and downs since graduating in 2019.  I now have my own practice and want to share some things that I have seen that you may be able to relate to or have questions about.  I believe that many of us in this field are too competitive and we need to help each other by being more supportive and transparent about what is actually going on after graduating!  

My first job as an intern was with the same site I did my practicum with, a medium sized CMH office in Central Florida owned by business people, not therapists.  As a 1099 contract worker they offered 

\-$27 per hour 

\-I pay them $27 every other week for my supervision

\-All trainings and meetings are mandatory and unpaid

\-Non-compete for 2 years and 20 miles from any of their locations 

\-When I have at least 40 clients they can offer my a W2 position 

I did this for a while, really looking forward to that W2 position.  I was excited to finally have benefits after working so hard.  The state supervisor that they paired me with was absolutely horrible.  She would schedule clients during our meeting time and when she did meet half of it was about her, her clients or teaching her how to use the confusing EHR.  The worst part was the racist things she would say about her clients like “I know when I see a black client that they are here for short term therapy because few of them stick around.”  and a joke about a Middle Eastern client bringing a bomb to the office really solidified my opinion of her.  I should have said something but I was hundreds of hours in and the state supervisor has so much power over you, so I chose to not rock the boat. Instead I found a new supervisor outside of the agency that was great but charged $75 an hour.  Now I am losing about 3 hours worth of my income each week to something I can’t really afford but absolutely need. 

Eventually I hit 40 scheduled clients in a week and they offered me my W2 position!  Unfortunately, the terms were atrocious and I could not agree to them.  

\-$35,568 per year for 35-40 clients per week

\-5 PTO Days and 6 Holidays per year (except not really because your productivity doesn’t get adjusted and you are expected to still meet an average of 35 weekly for the month)

\-Non-compete again (Clients are PEOPLE not PROPERTY!)

\-Free Supervision! (Caveat that they will sue me for $5000 if I do not work for them for at least 2 years post graduation) 

\-Poor insurance plan/no retirement benefits

I told them that I could not agree to the terms and the owner asked if I thought she was a bad person (wtf?) because she has been told that many times before.  I stayed on as a 1099 while I found my next job.  A few months later I was hired as a W2 employee at a clinician-owned practice that seemed to actually place some value on their clinicians and clients. This job offered 

\-$38 per hour and $10 per hour for meetings, until full-time 

\-$40,000 per year for 20 clients per week 

\-10 PTO Days and 7 Holidays per year 

\-The opposite of the NDA, they ENCOURAGE you to take clients if it is in their best interest 

\-Free Supervision (with a great supervisor!) 

\-Decent health insurance coverage 

Considering where I came from, this was a dream opportunity.  I enjoyed my coworkers, clients and learned a lot while working there.  I kept continuing my education and honing my therapeutic skills, eventually crossing the finish line for licensure.  I was ready for my big raise, only to find out from the owner that it would only be a $5,000 yearly increase for my license.  With everything I had put in to get to that point I was highly disappointed to hear that $45,000 was the starting rate for a LICENSED clinician.  

I let them know that I would have to take my shot at private practice as it would be soul crushing and financially difficult for me to accept those terms.  They thought I was a valuable asset to the team and created a new position to try and entice me to stay.  

\-Join the leadership, with a weekly meeting and extra responsibilities 

\-30% pay increase to $52,000 per year 

\-Decrease client load to 16 clients per week 

\-Biweekly meetings with the counselor interns (I had 2 assigned to me)

I accepted the offer right away and was getting paid more for doing less.  I was able to easily meet the client hours and I enjoyed being a supervisor.  I was actually pretty comfortable in my new position. After a few months in this role the owner and my manager asked me to join them in a meeting without the other leadership members.  They let me know that they were restructuring the agency and my position would be eliminated, with my responsibilities going to other members of leadership. 

Since I didn’t have a full 20 clients anymore either, they required me to go back to being an hourly employee, prorated at $45,000/year.  All of the PTO that I had collected as a manager was also now only worth the new rate. When I asked what I did or didn’t do to deserve this they straight up told me “You met but did not exceed our expectations.  We are looking for all members of leadership to exceed our expectations.”.  I’m pretty sure that is code for “we want people to work in their time off and you didn’t” but they didn’t elaborate any further on that one.  

They told me I could either accept their new terms or immediately be without employment.  My bills continued growing so I reluctantly accepted.  A few weeks later, management sends out a big mandate that every employee is REQUIRED to be in the office AT LEAST 30 hours per week, no exceptions.  I had 20 clients per week and only about 4-5 were meeting at the office.  This level of micromanagement and demand for my free time was the last straw.  I gave a 2 month notice, to allow my clients a smooth goodbye and provide a small income while I was getting my business off the ground. 

I started my practice in May 2022.  One of my old coworkers told me about Headway which led me to also discover Alma.  I signed up for both platforms in hopes of being able to get referrals and accept insurances.  I created my own website, had professional headshots taken and made a Psychology Today.  Almost immediately people began reaching out to me from PT and I was in business!  In July I was paneled with the insurance plans on Alma and Headway and began receiving referrals from those platforms as well.  With the clients that had followed me from the agency and all of the new clients I was taking on, I was full by mid August and changed my availability to waitlist only.   My numbers dipped a little bit in February and I was only able to turn the profile back on for one month before I was full with a 7+ client waitlist again.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By the numbers I have had appointments with 71 unique clients in the last 12 months.  

\-8 clients followed me to private practice 

\-27 clients from Psychology Today (out of 74 calls and emails/132 website visits)

\-21 clients from Alma (out of 47 inquiries) 

\-6 clients from Headway (out of 8 inquiries) 

\-9 clients referred from other therapists or past clients 

\-16 Self-pay clients and 55 using insurance 

\-33 Virtual only clients and 38 in-person/hybrid 

It sounds like a lot of extra work to be a private practice owner but I honestly have more freedom and flexibility than I ever did in the agency.  I am also working less than the 30 hours per week minimum they wanted me in the building.  

\-Schedule 20-22 clients per week, averaging 18-20 billable hours per week

\-Available 4 days per week 

\-All mornings from home/no meetings 😀

\-1-3 virtual days per week (I could probably go all virtual right now if I desired) 

\-Self-pay at $180/hour.  

\-Insurance at $90-130/hour

\-Late Cancel fee $90.  No-show/no-call fee $135

My biggest expenses are the office at about $600 per month and my Alma membership at $120 per month but being local and part of a great referral network are some of what have helped me stay busy.  Alma also pays more than headway at about $6-7 more per session, so just 20 appointments a month on the Alma schedule will pay for itself without even factoring in the value of constant referrals.  I seem to have reached a good, sustainable pace here with my business, with plenty of room in the week and client demand if I determine I need to make more money.  

The biggest things I am missing from my past job were the health insurance and coworkers.  I am considering marriage as a realistic option to obtain insurance and have come to accept that I just will not have coworkers in this position.  Maybe in the future I would like to help a beginner therapist start their private practice but as of right now I don’t really have an interest in turning in to a group practice and complicating things.  I hope that this story can help give some people who are in CMH, where I was a year ago, some perspective and hope that this industry is not all misery, low wages and exploitation.  Please ask me anything or let me know if you relate to any of this."

Due to some weird rule, I have been considered a non resident at my state (I appealed, and it didn't work). I will be resident for the second year. My ultimate goal is to transfer to a top 25. If I choose to attend a CCC (California Community College), will I be at a disadvantage when transferring compared to going to my mid tier UC (not Cal or UCLA)? 

I know that my program have a TAG (Guaranteed admission) to my UC, but is it worth losing two years of actual college experience for this? But if I attend my UC, I would be in 70k debt just for the first year! I cannot justify that much debt for a t25 let alone for a non t25.

Also will that hurt my career since I would not be able to get internships? I saw many internships at CCC like Cal's TTE is for first gen/low income/minority. and the big N/FAANG only take college students.

What would you have done if you were in my shoes? My desired major is CS

And lastly, What t25 schools are transfer friendly to CC students? I have traditional/usual background (middle class parents with college degree and not a minority)

 - **iTunes** - Not Verified so have a backup planned. Some of these movies are from back when you used to need both the digital disc and the code to get the movie. You no longer need the disc to redeem these but they will probably redeem in SD quality. There are also a few codes that are the split portion from a Paramount, Lionsgate or Universal slip.  If you need an iTunes code because you don't use UV, a lot of the codes in the MA section above have the ability for direct redemption on iTunes. Let me know if that is something you need more information about.

13snl69,2,2023-05-26,Still can’t find a job months after graduating with computer engineering degree. Advice?,johnn1379,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13snl69/still_cant_find_a_job_months_after_graduating/,"It’s been 6 months since I’ve graduated (December 2022) with my bachelors and oh boy my self confidence is really dropped since then. I was confident I could secure some sort of job either working in software or maybe I could pivot into IT if that didn’t work out, but I haven’t gotten anything, barely any interviews either after 200 applications. I blame myself for wasting my time during school just attending class and not even attempting to apply for internships since I didn’t know how important they were at the time for helping get a job. So all the experience I have is my degree, a few side projects, and working a restaurant job. Now I’m still working the same minimum wage job I had when I graduated high school, with my degree feeling like a waste of my time and money. Not sure what to do at this point. Getting a software development role was my intention at first, but my major barely scratched the surface when it came to software compared to Computer Science majors, so I’d have a lot of catch up to do on top of all the side projects, leetcode, etc that all companies seem to want to see now. So right now my goal is to get an IT job such as help desk where I can gain some experience and eventually move up to higher positions. Having trouble getting callbacks though, probably because of my lack of IT experience. So maybe it’s time to get some CompTIA certs and stop assuming my degree and 4 years customer service experience would be enough to land a help desk job? Sorry for the rant, had to get this off my chest."
13sntab,5,2023-05-26,At my wits end trying to find another position at my local design company,ropuro,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/13sntab/at_my_wits_end_trying_to_find_another_position_at/,"I worked a 6 month internship as a product designer at a very popular fashion and home goods retailer in my city. It’s basically the only design company in my city, but it employs about 25k people, and anyone who does anything creative in this area currently or formerly works here.

In my time there, I single handedly designed 200 products, 90% of which are slated for production and will reach shelves later this year. Tables, sofas, chairs, accessories, toys, etc. I worked over time frequently. My team and adjacent teams loved my work but didn’t really care much for me, as I apparently did not fit the “image” of the brand. I heard some particularly mean/ignorant comments about me, my looks, and my medical condition from team members. I only made $15 an hour but outworked half of my team, most of whom arrived late, left early, casually skipped meetings, etc. I didn’t really care what they did, but it blows my mind how they are tenured when they never seemed to work hard. They frequently gave me their work to do while they chilled in the cafeteria or walked their dogs or smoke pot. Whatever. I was content. They can do what they want, I was happy to just make some money.

The team decided not to place me. I’ve fought hard to make connections and make contact with recruiters, and so far in four months since my internship ended I’ve had two interviews, both for more temp roles, both paying less than $20 an hour. After several interviews, BOTH opportunities went “poof” because the teams suddenly didn’t have it in the budget to take on someone new. 

I feel used and under appreciated. I’m tired of going back to square one. I worked so freaking hard and did great work that higher ups loved.

Salary is 15-20k more than I make now, plus benefits.

Current job, I worked from my internship to a management level position, but it’s a small company. I love what I do and I love my coworkers, and it keeps me very involved in the community in my city. WFH 2x per week & commute is like 20 minutes. 

Is the 1.5 hr commute & benefits worth leaving my current gig?

Edit: WOW thank you for the responses!!

 I make 45k now and new job would bring my salary up to 63-72k depending on the offer. Moving is an option but most of my friends are where I am currently. Also have a dog to think about!

I am early final year CSE student, I have skills like cpp, python, Linux, bash scripting, django(basic) some exposure to docker also, I have created some small very basic level machine learning projects and currently I am doing Dsa(basic) and django. So with these level of skills should I start applying to jobs(if yes should I also try applying to internships?) right now or first grow these skills more like complete the Dsa and dango with some intermediate level projects in ML. Some experienced people in other subs have suggested to apply everywhere but I am confused to start doing that from now or wait to grow my skills to a sufficient level.

Hello, I am currently studying computer science in the US. I am currently looking at getting a career in the cannabis industry, but am concerned about how this may affect my future employment in the tech industry. I currently have no experience working in the tech industry, so I don't want to make it even harder to get a job in the tech industry by working in the cannabis industry. I have talked to some friends in the cannabis industry and they have said that it may affect employment based on the state of the job (Red / Blue state) or if the job may require any security clearance (ie. government contracts / security clearance) or if the job is in the private sector (nonprofit / startups). Is there any way that this could affect my chances of getting a job / internship in the future as a possible web developer or software engineer? Any advice is much appreciated. <3"

I want to study computer science so I've researched and seen a bunch of college results with people being accepted to selective colleges but they all take AP Calc BC or Calc III their senior year. For this reason I want to take AB during the summer, but I don't want to because:

1) Most summer programs are expensive 

2) I already have a 6 week internship

So my question is, is it worth it to take AB during the summer given my situation? What can I do? Should I study on my own? I wasn't able to take more challenging math classes as I mentioned before so I also want to ask if colleges are going to understand my situation and not put me into disadvantage.

Does this alone make me competitive for entry level roles? I’m a first generation university student and have heard from friends that I should be aiming for 3 internships before I graduate.

Letters of Recommendation 

I think my LORs were a highlight of my application. I was able to read 2/3 of them and I was truly shocked at how well they were written and how my teachers chose to represent me. They were both a full page and very detailed, with concrete examples of my contributions in and out of the classroom. I actually got teary-eyed when reading them. I had one from my APUSH/AP World teacher and one from my AP Bio teacher. I'd give them both a 9/10.

Interviews

My interviews were fine. I had ones for Duke, Vandy, and Yale. Duke was my best by far. It lasted about an hour and the conversation flowed very naturally and I really enjoyed it. Vandy was fine, it was relatively short but I think I gave good answers to the questions I was asked. It just wasn't notable by any means, but I don't think it hurt me. Yale was my last and worst interview lol. I had just finished all of my RD apps and I was tired. I think my interviewer was sick of interviewing too, so it was pretty boring and very surface-level. I would give Duke an 8/10, Vandy a 6/10, and Yale a 4/10. 

Essays

I truly believe that my essays were the highlight of my entire application. I spent so much time perfecting and re-reading my essays, that I don't think they could have been any better. They were personal, but lighthearted, and each one really showcased a unique aspect of my personality. My advice to future applicants is to write a like a teenager, because you are. Don't write like an adult. I think that in the end, I found a nice balance between my person style of writing (which is very witty and lighthearted0 and a more sophisticated tone. I read so many of my friends' essays that were so robotic and formal and they just sounded bad. Keep it true to you, be human, and don't write like a middle-aged man, while still keeping it more formal than, say, a journal.

Additional Information

I'm still in shock at how things ended up for me, and I couldn't be happier! If you're curious, I have chosen to attend Duke in the fall! Ultimately, it was down to Duke, Penn, and Brown. I didn't forsee myself enjoying the weather in Providence (and the open curriculum was never super appealing to me, I never quite understood it) and I really don't care for Philly (or the more competitive culture at Penn/Wharton) so I chose Duke! Duke was always my dream school and the weather, access to undergraduate research, and overall vibe of the student body solidified my choice. I'm so so excited to be a Blue Devil! DDMF!!

I realize that some people may be asking why I did not stay on the Yale waitlist. I was able to visit Duke in April and I completely fell in love with the campus and people, and knew that I would personally be happier there than at Yale. Based on NPCs, Duke would've been cheaper as well.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Yes, Penn was Wharton and, yes, it hurt to turn down. I just think the culture at Penn (especially in Wharton) would've been too much for me."

I originally planned to do CS 61 and then 32 in the spring (to knock off a requirement and have a more chill course load), but I’ve heard CS 124 is an important course to take for internship/interview prep and that CS 120 is a good course to take to prepare for 124 in the spring. 

Looking at the q-guide, it seems 120 would be slightly less of a commitment than 61, but I’ve also heard that 61 is good for teaching raw programming skills vs 120 is better for theory. I have a few questions as I try to make my decision:

1) How helpful will taking 120 before 124 be if I have extensive proof experience in math (not CS though)?
2) Is it better to take 124 sophomore or junior spring w respect to prepping for internships (if it matters at all)?
3) How useful is CS 61 as a class for building tangible coding skills?

13svs2n,2,2023-05-26,Advice on maximizing research experience (in robotics/controls/learning) post-undergrad to prepare me for competitive PhD programs? What are my current chances?,smugmamale,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/13svs2n/advice_on_maximizing_research_experience_in/,"Hey there!

I am a senior undergrad finishing up my degree in electrical engineering at an R1 uni in the US (I'm a domestic student, not sure if that affects things).  This past fall, I joined a robotics/controls/AI lab on campus and have since learned that I really love research in this area; I am certain that I want to do a PhD involving human/robot interaction, multi-agent systems, and decision making.  This lab has been awesome; it's pretty small (like only \~3 PhDs currently) and the PI is brand-new and very hands-on.  I meet with them weekly, and I get a lot of independence with driving the projects I work on; they basically treat me like a grad student is what it feels like.  Since I'm graduating in just a couple weeks, I had expressed interest earlier in the year that I wanted to continue research in this lab post-graduation, and the PI has been able to generously organize a job for me so I can keep doing research while getting paid.  However, it's estimated I would likely need to move on by December/January (so about 6 months from now) based on our current funding projections.

My PI knows I want to do a PhD, and I plan on submitting PhD applications for the 2024 cycle this fall.  I'm still investigating what labs/PIs/programs interest me most, with my PI encouraging me to look at similar labs/programs that are tippy-top in this area (CMU, Michigan, GATech, Stanford, MIT, etc.) and are all of course, quite competitive.  I am somewhat optimistic about my being a competent researcher, primarily because my PI told me ""I would love to have you here for grad school"" and joked that ""their name wasn't on the list"" when I was telling them about some of the programs I had so far looked at.  I love this current lab, and would certainly like to do a PhD here if I knew there wasn't any better fits, but it seems wise to branch out, especially if I wanted to continue in academia.  My PI also got their PhD at one of the schools on that list and seems pretty ""plugged-in"" to the network, which seems like a plus when it comes to letter-writing?

I would also like to think I'm at least *competent*: I'm on track to get a conference paper submitted by the end of the summer (won't be peer-reviewed by the time my apps are reviewed, but still), a poster for the same project I plan to write about just won 2nd place for a department UG research showcase, my capstone project is a research project I'm doing through another robotics lab (probably a decent rec letter source), and I'll have my name on a workshop paper for some other computer vision work.  Before I switched to robotics, I was also a member of a competitive engineering club for \~1.5 years, where I eventually became a technical lead, and was then an intern at a FAANG (the fruit company one) for 9 months doing hardware/embedded stuff.  Those experiences led me to discover I really didn't want to do generic industry work or do electronics as a job, lol (hence the switch to robotics).

All that said, I am still highly highly skeptical of my chances of being admitted to any ""top"" programs that are a good fit, beyond my current institution (which itself is still not guaranteed).  My GPA is nothing special at all (\~3.55 overall, \~3.72 major), and I literally just started doing robotics research last fall.  I know it can be bad to compare oneself to others, but I've also been stalking admitted applicant profiles through the lab websites of places I'm interested in or here on Reddit, and most of these people had significantly more experience than me at the time of them applying; it seems like the average amount of exp. required for these competitive PhD programs is more like 2-3 years of relevant research *at least*, which I will definitely not have by this fall.

**So TL;DR, the question is: assuming I didn't get into any of these programs I'm interested in, how can I accumulate more relevant research experience as a non-student, if I had to leave my current lab?**  Where do you find that kind of work?  Should I try to complete either a masters' or another bachelors' at my current institution?  That seems like a big waste of money but I don't know where else I could go to do research before applying again.  I've asked my current PI some of these questions and they were a little more ambiguous in answering that.  I'm really just looking for a solid contingency plan for PhD rejections.  Thank you!"
13swc1h,1,2023-05-26,Seeking Advice: CFA Level 1 as a 1st Year Student for Enhancing Future IB Internship Prospects?,TheoryEffective9348,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/13swc1h/seeking_advice_cfa_level_1_as_a_1st_year_student/,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am currently a first-year student at a UK target university, and I'm facing a bit of a quandary. I am seriously considering preparing for the CFA Level 1 exam, but I'm also mindful of focusing my energy exclusively on my upcoming internship and sharpening my technical skills. Any advice or thoughts, particularly from those who have had investment banking experience in London, would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

A bit of background about me: I wasn't able to secure any spring internships, so I interned at a PE fund of funds for a month. Recently, after my exams concluded, I secured an internship in an IB/PE boutique finance firm that's a relatively recent startup. I am keen to start my work there in the coming days.

&#x200B;

I have a fairly solid foundation in modelling/accounting skills, and I believe I can manage my internship, CFA Level 1 preparations, and IB technical studies alongside practising with JobTestPrep materials. However, I'm uncertain if this is the most beneficial path.

&#x200B;

Here are a few more points to consider:

&#x200B;

I am eligible to take the CFA Level 1 (yes, I am aware that usually penultimate year university students are eligible, but my work experience has made me eligible—I've already checked and confirmed this).

Money or the registration fee isn't a concern for me.

I have already booked an exam for August 2023.

I am an international student studying in the UK with aspirations to intern and eventually work in London post-graduation.

It's important to note that I am primarily aiming for an investment banking role.

The primary rationale for my interest in the CFA is my desire to become a more competitive candidate for summer internships in 2024, and currently, I do not see other significant ways to further improve my prospects.

&#x200B;

Essentially, I'm trying to discern whether pursuing the CFA Level 1 alongside my other commitments would substantially enhance my profile and increase my chances of securing the internships I desire, or whether focusing solely on my internship and technical preparations would be more beneficial.

&#x200B;

As I'm in the UK, I would particularly value advice from those with banking experience in London, as I understand the CFA might carry different weight in the US. If you're from the US and would like to contribute, I'd still appreciate your insights, but please clearly mention your location.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance for your insights. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

&#x200B;

Best,

Zoe (not my real name, of course)"
13sx06n,1,2023-05-26,Is it selfish for me to ask my coworker to set the AC cooler because I feel hot in the office?,Snoo-42199,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13sx06n/is_it_selfish_for_me_to_ask_my_coworker_to_set/,"For context, I’m still an intern there and I’m the youngest. My coworkers have worked at the company for way longer than I did and I feel kinda rude and selfish to always ask them to turn the ac cooler. Most of them always feel cool and only I feel hot because of the position of the ac in the office. 

I know some of you would probably ask why is it a big deal? 

I always find myself sweating because of how hot it gets and I have eczema too which worsen when it gets hot. They always set the temperature to 30C (86F) and I feel like it’s unnecessary and useless to turn it on to that temperature when you’re using an ac. My country is known for hot summer weather and there some cases of heat stroke here too if it helps. Not to mention that the office doesn’t have any sort of ventilation like windows (because we can’t open it) or ceiling fans as well (which would have made it better). Also, I always find them wearing thin clothes too.
I don’t really know what to do with them and I think that wouldn’t it be better for them to wear something else like a coat or use a blanket instead of setting the ac to 30C? What can I do when I feel hot? Peel my skin? 

Is it selfish for me who’s the only who always feels hot, to ask my coworkers to set the ac cooler? Any advice?"
13sx41z,27,2023-05-26,Finally snapped after my coffee pot broke,zimmmmman,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/13sx41z/finally_snapped_after_my_coffee_pot_broke/,"I mean, the coffee pot wasn't the only thing. Long post ahead.

In November of last year, I decided to start preparing/sending applications for internships and REUs. I stopped counting submissions after I reached 50 applications. I knew that the chances actually getting an internship would be slim, and getting an internship where I actually made money (after considering travel + rent in a new city) would be even slimmer. After months of waiting, I was either rejected, ghosted, or dropped by every single program I applied to. (For reference, I am in microbiology. Shit is competitive.)

I had a backup plan- I am really well-connected with the microbiology faculty here. I am a volunteer assistant in a professor's lab during the fall and spring semesters. The backup plan was that I could continue to volunteer in the lab while I worked a part-time job over the summer. When I asked this professor, he actually said that he was going to have some research funding coming at the beginning of May and that he would pay me to come in five times a week to set up the lab for said research. I was thrilled! By late April, the professor said that he probably would not get the funding until June. Two weeks into May, he said the funding would not come until next fall, and that he would be out of town until July. Since I already had an apartment and the scholarship to pay for it, I decided to take two classes. One of them is completely online, and the other meets once a week. I had nowhere else to live and nothing else to do.

I started applying for part-time jobs as soon as I heard that the funding would not come until the fall.  Of course, I hear back from precious few, even though everyone is so desperate for work, apparently. I have interviewed for three jobs so far. One would say they would reach back out in mid-June if I got the job, the other said mid-interview that the position would open with the start of the fall semester (NOT MENTIONED ON THE APPLICATION), and the last interview said that they would only hire me on if I committed to working the same hours in the fall, which is not possible since I am a scholarship-dependent student-athlete. 

To add insult to injury, I found out (about a week ago) that my roommate bought a pancake mix that was infested with bugs. Of course, she did not know at the time, and I do not blame her for it. The bugs took over the cabinet with all the dried goods in it. Most of the spices and just about anything that was not in a thick-walled plastic container or a metal can (pasta, brownie mix, dried beans, etc.) had to be thrown out. I singlehandedly (roommate has since moved out) have taken care of the bugs. My apartment manager has yet to contact pest control since they figured I can get this done by myself. I have done a good job, but until I can get more money, I cannot replace all the groceries I had to throw away.

After looking at Google for part-time positions for the millionth time, I told myself that I was just not going to find a job that would only hire me for merely two months. It just is not going to happen. I wonder why I even tried. I had the worst headache, so I decided to make myself some coffee. As I lifted the pot out of the drying rack, a large piece of glass just... broke off the bottom. Just one more fuckin thing I need to replace while I don't have money. I just sat there in fucking awe. I sank to the floor and cried, but made no noise. I am so over this.

TL;DR: I really tried my best to plan for the worst. Between a bad job/internship market, delayed funding, bad timing/communication, and limited job options due to my crappy availability, I am out of money. The coffee pot breaking was the straw that broke the camel's back."
13sx9yn,3,2023-05-26,Which Sydney-based prop trading firms (quant researcher) is best for internship (and after graduation)?,Dovermore,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/13sx9yn/which_sydneybased_prop_trading_firms_quant/,"I am interviewing with some Sydney based prop trading firms (SIG, Optiver, Citadel Securities) for Quant Research internship (currently a PhD student). There is no offer yet but I feel I should be able to land a few.  
My interview with Citadel Securities was pretty pleasant as opposed to what most online reviews says. But I sense (a lot of) concerning things from my chat with the interviewer. Like do or get fired (the interviewer blatantly said something like this), long working hours, etc. I also read that the culture is very toxic there.  
I have only had the behavioral interview with Optiver so I don't have much understanding of how good/bad the firm is. But my online search shows it to be a better place to work (WLB vs Pay).  
Haven't done much research on SIG yet, but based on Glassdoor review, they seem to be struggling as well (losing many seniors).  
My ideal choice is JS in HK (I am also interviewing), but in the case I don't get offer from JS, I wonder which one is the best choice for an internship and why? What are the pros and cons for doing internship for quant research in each of these places?  
I like money and wouldn't mind 10+ hr days (not 12+ though) or high stress. I do like a place where there are leaves as I do get burned out sometimes and need a few days to recover. And I value places with better career growth than WLB. I am also a bit concerned about job security as I am currently an international student and would want something that I can at least keep for a few years to get my PR/citizenship in Australia."
13sxfos,217,2023-05-27,I’m a computer science intern in Virginia and this guy won’t stop bugging me about Purdue,Monstercjr,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/13sxfos/im_a_computer_science_intern_in_virginia_and_this/,"I'm currently a computer science intern, and I went to Denny's after work today. I'm really tired after a long week, and just wanted something quick and easy. As I was walking into the restaurant this guy in a Denny's employee outfit came up to me and started introducing himself and started talking about how exciting it was that we both worked for DoD. First of all, I don't work for the DoD, and unless DoD stands for ""Denny's of Dumfries, VA,"" - he clearly doesn't either. I want to ask him if I could just eat alone but he just won’t let me say anything. 

He then started raving about Purdue and asking me whether some ""high level"" (200 level) courses were still being offered in Krannert. He’s telling me about how he started one semester at Purdue but dropped out because he flunked out (ENGL 106 is hard, apparently). At this point, I still haven't been able to get a word in edgewise and am just trying to eat.

This man won't stop rambling to me. The Whole. Fucking. Meal.

I then walk to the metro so that I can get to my place in Fredericksburg and this man follows me. 
The Whole. Way. Home.

He's currently standing outside my door raving about Zach Edey and how he hopes to get back into Purdue someday. It's 11:50pm, and I'm really just trying to sleep. Should I call the police or something to make him go away?"
13sxg8j,65,2023-05-27,Four years enrolled at UMD and the burnout is starting to hit me (thoughts/venting),Gilblitz112,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/13sxg8j/four_years_enrolled_at_umd_and_the_burnout_is/,"I've been through a lot during my time at UMD. Initially, I enrolled as a comp sci major, but the difficult coursework, general dissatisfaction, and other factors made me switch to journalism after a year. Since then, I've been taking it slow but felt pretty comfortable with my new major. As of writing this, I just have to take a few more classes in the fall and complete my internship so that I have completed all of my academic requirements to graduate. However, all of this extra planning is starting to make me feel burnt out.

After I switched from comp sci to journalism, I started taking 12-13 credits per semester rather than 15-16 since I didn't want to overwork myself and potentially flunk myself out of the university. Thankfully, I've been doing well in many of my classes, but I've always wondered if I've been here for long enough since I technically should've graduated by now after spending eight semesters at the university. I've always thought I should've said something during my first year rather than sitting in silence so that I wouldn't have to go through all this trauma of nearly being kicked out of the university.

In addition to that, I haven't been making much progress on filling out applications for internships, and that's mostly on me. I've always been focused on homework so that I have free time to do whatever I want that to the point where filling out internship applications often came to little regard in my mind, and I kinda regret that now. I think I missed the summer deadline, so now I'm just setting my sights on a fall internship that is manageable.

Finally, I'm still sorta questioning my place in the university after four years of being here. Don't get me wrong, I'm not dropping out; I'm proud to be a terp and follow in the footsteps of those I look up to, and I took advantage of some social opportunities (like concerts and club meetups). However, I wonder if my involvement would have been much more enjoyable if I had already switched to journalism (or another major) within my first year or prior to enrollment. 

Also, I am honestly not too sure about what I want to do after I graduate. I could take up some media jobs but I dunno if they would relate to my more niche interests (I maybe want to work as a media archivist or maybe a record store). Who knows what'll happen in these next few months? All I know is that I got a lot of work to do.

Also, the idea of the university doing away with winter commencement ceremonies is pretty odd. Like, I have to wait an entire year to walk on stage now rather than a few months? Will I even be Class of '23 if the commencement happens in '24? Just let me have my moment for once, smh.

(I apologize if it sounds like I'm rambling, but I just want to clear my mind for a bit)."

Title says most of it. I'm a junior studying CS, and I do pretty ok in my classes - have a GPA of about 3.5. I had a web dev internship through family freshman year, no internship last year despite trying a little bit, and this year I've applied for about 150 internships (granted many were linkedin or handshake 1-clicks) with pretty much no response, I've gotten 1 interview the whole year. Even looked into research, but I haven't really taken enough advanced classes (I've taken two non-core 4000 levels) to have the skill set for it, and got rejected from this as well. I applied to pretty much every type of SWE from frontend to backend, databases, AI/ML, game dev, you name it. Pretty much willing to try anything or go anywhere. I have decent experience with all sorts of programming languages and tools that these jobs listed as useful. I promise I am at least a decent programmer lol.

I know it's supposed to be kind of a rough year in tech, but all my friends have stuff, and most people I talk to still seem to assume I have a position and get all quiet when I say I'm still trying to find something. Just this week I talked to a home friend who studies physics at a different, less well-known school, and she told me she got an ML internship after about 30 apps (which she said was a lot, so I didn't say anything about my own search) because she felt like getting some experience in CS. Idk, it just doesn't seem like it should be that hard from what I've heard from other people.

Really not feeling siked about my position, as I feel if I'm this bad of an applicant right now, applying to real CS jobs next year with nothing new on my resume aside from some new classes is extremely daunting to me, given that I'll be competing against the entire industry and be expected to have work / internship experience under my belt, both of which are disadvantages I am currently operating without and still utterly failing. Any advice on either routes to take for this summer or other perspectives to help my job search from CS veterans or other CS students would be greatly appreciated.

I'm looking for a corporate job that I can be passionate about and I'd like some ideas as to what occupations I should start looking at as I have no idea as of right now. My main interests are technology, finance, marketing and a little bit of digital design.

&#x200B;

Further elaborating on my interests:

**Tech:** I've always had a passion for computers and tech in general. The thing is when it comes to pursuing a job in tech,  I've never really had any interest in coding or hardware development.

**Finance:** I've always been good with numbers. I recently have gotten into investing and made my first $1,000 net profit not too long ago. I understand percentages, decimals, fractions and other numerical stuff that has to do with finance and was wondering what professions I would be best suited for.

**Marketing:** the concept of marketing analytics has always seemed natural to me. The basic concepts of marketing analysis like CPM, CTC and CTR. Other aspects like PR and advertising don't really seem to entice me.

**Digital Design:** I've never really been an art type of person but when it comes to digital designs like logos or how a website is designed sometimes I wonder how it could've been designed better. This also ties in with my love for tech. While interacting with software sometimes I just wish something was done differently or something else.

&#x200B;

Ideas or guidance would be greatly appreciated. If you have other options I can look at, that would be great as well. I don't really have a direction of where to take the next step in my career and I hope this will help me get a clearer understanding of what I want to pursue.

Instead of pursuing a new education, I'm thinking of looking at internship/ co-op positions and working my way up from there. I believe I have the work ethic and dedication it requires as I managed to work for the 8th-best restaurant in Canada just after turning 19."

They were nice, but said they dont do internships, so i can apply to junior, once i have enough time.

So my question is: should i try contacting recruiters/student work agencies on LinkedIn/email/phone about iOS developer positions?
It sounds dumb, but this seems to be the only option, apart from waiting till a random internship appears in my country, or till i graduate from my CS degree (thats exactly a year from now) and go for junior position.

I saw like one remote internship, but nothing else.

Thank you for your advice in advance :)"
13t1436,2,2023-05-27,Seeking Advice for PhD Applications - Help with LORs and University Selection,Limp_Reality5009,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/13t1436/seeking_advice_for_phd_applications_help_with/,"Hello everyone,

I'm a junior student who's going to graduate in 2024 and I want to pursue a PhD. I am studying computer engineering and I am interested in computer systems (like operating systems, distributed systems, etc.) and I want to do research in that area in North America or even Europe if the research lab is good in this field. My main concern is to work in a university with good reputation in this field.

As much as I try to think university prestige doesn't matter, at the end of the day it will help me with the facilities they could provide, seriousness of work and also post-graduation it could help with finding good positions (whether it's academic or industry)

 With all this I need to start thinking about my grad schools and my chances for it in this summer.  I am facing a major issue regarding my LORs. So I would like to get help/advice from your experiences.

Some background from me:

(1) I do have a good amount of research experience in my sophomore year as part of an summer internship with a conference paper published (as 2nd author) in a good conference (I believe) in the niche that I researched in. 

(2) I have an okay GPA of 3.55 (its nothing special but it is above the usual thresholds in applying). I think I would be able to take it above 3.6 by the time i graduate

(3) I have another internship in the industry as a software engineer.

(4) My university is one of the top 2 or top 3 in computer engineering in my country with decent reputation worldwide.

Considering that for PhD applications you would need 3 LORs and they have huge impact on your application, I think I am facing a disadvantage in this area:

The professor that I worked with on (1) cannot provide any LOR (due to some reasons that are out of scope of this post) which is a huge blow but I cannot do anything and I must move past it and think of other solutions. 

Currently I've figured out that I potentially could have good solid LOR by another professor who I've been working with on another research project until now and can vouch for my research capabilities and another LOR by another professor who knows me pretty well from classes and office hours.

Other than that I may have to revert to some other professor who might remember from class and getting top grade from their class. Or a professional reference from my internship which won't help much in terms of describing my academic & research capabilities.

Some ways that could help me and I can think of is:

\- Try to look for another professor who might be interested in taking undergrads for research for summer but I find this to not be cool because I am already working with someone as I mentioned.

\- One way is that I forget about PhD and do masters first and build a better profile. The issue with this is that where I am doesn't have people who do research on this field and I might have to work on something that is similar to my interests but not exactly that. Actually most professors in my university work on AI stuff like machine learning, robotics etc. which I am not particularly interested in.

I don't think I can try for Masters abroad because I cannot afford tuition fees and cost of living (even if tuition is free) and I would need funding/TAships to be able to survive. And as far as I know these are almost impossible for Masters.

\- Another is to try my luck with this situation and see whether I could get into a PhD program. (Application fees are quite a pain)

I would appreciate if you have any comments/advice regarding this which can be helpful with my decisions or my understanding from PhD applications.

&#x200B;

Also any additional advice on which schools are good in this field are welcome!  


Thanks a lot!"

I do a bit of technical enablement and solution architecture, so a mix of technical and soft skills.

The thing is, I always wanted to work as a SWE, and even code on my spare time. I took this job because opportunities for SWE in this company were non existent at my location, as well as any big tech company, and I thought maybe starting in a technical field role I could still acquire some technical expertise and eventually move internally to a SWE role in another location.

My problem now is that I’ve been applying to multiple SWE roles internally for the better part of a year, and even before we got to the point we are at right now with the shit hitting the fan I’ve never even gotten a single interview.

I don’t know if HR just looks at my resume, sees that the only SWE experience is an internship during university and simply ignores me or what.

I am a top performer in my current role, so my internal profile is good, and can continue progressing at my current position, but the job itself does not challenge me enough and makes me unhappy. 

Added to the fact that my applications are ignored, even when trying to talk to hiring managers directly, makes me rethink if I should continue wasting my time here or look for SWE jobs at other companies.

I know the market is shit right now, I am not quitting my job before I find something, just trying to understand what I am doing wrong and where to focus my efforts on.

Any advice?"

Unfortunately, I was not placed during the initial days of campus placements. Currently, only a few companies are visiting our campus for placements, and the competition is fierce.

Regarding the placement scenario at my college, we occasionally have one or two companies offering average packages ranging from 3-5 lakhs, and sometimes even in the 6-12 lakh range. As this is my final semester, it will come to an end soon.

I'm unsure why I decided to take up the internship, but now that it has concluded, they have offered me a full-time job with a salary between 15,000-20,000 and a bond of 1 year, although they assured me that the bond isn't too restrictive.

(Please give me advice 😭),the19bouncer,MSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCS/comments/13taw3p/does_a_80k_cs_masters_ivy_league_make_sense_for/,"Went to undergrad at a state school, degree in Biology, but want to change careers. 0 loans from undergrad.

I got accepted to CS masters at UPenn which costs 80k total for two years (program meant for people without a CS undergrad, so it’s more like 6 undergrad classes + 4 masters classes). My parents can cover the living expenses, so I will be left with exactly 80k in debt. I am 100% sure I can get a 6 figure job out of graduation (especially bc my parent can refer me to the company they work at that pays about ~110k starting in Texas), but ideally I would like to work in a pure tech company in a big city and move out of my parents place lol. I already have some really good projects and stuff on resume, but I just need the formal education and a decent cs internship.

MCIT also has an online option that is only ~30k which would be way more affordable, but people who do online MCIT cannot get access to the on campus career fairs. I am not sure if I can even switch to the online, because it’s 2 different departments but same degree, but hopefully the program director considers letting me switch. 

In theory, I could pay 50-60k of the 80k in 1 year by living with my parents for a year after graduation, but it would be so nice to not have to worry about that mountain of debt in the first place. 

Anyone have any advice on handling student loans and determining what amount is too much and not worth it, and if 80k seems doable?Thoughts on on campus vs online to save money?"
13tbegg,3,2023-05-27,I don't feel smart enough to care about anything except instant gratification,SystemicAnnihilation,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/13tbegg/i_dont_feel_smart_enough_to_care_about_anything/,"Briefly about me. I'm 20, grew up in a middling public school system in a middling suburb of a red state. But then I went to a STEM boarding school and struggled while encountering people like my roommate then who self-studied half of an undergraduate math curriculum and now has a Master's from my state school and works as a full time software engineer. And then I got another lucky break with a full ride to a very competitive and very global institution.

Every semester, I let myself down. Most people grow and adapt, for me the freshman year was the best because it was easiest. Now I have to just hope I can market myself well enough to get a job that will still barely enable me to afford a sublet in a big US city. Because I'm not getting into a decent graduate program and affording it with this. Nor do I have the attention span and ability to focus on one long-term project to go further in academia, honestly. Economics gets so theoretical.

I just don't feel deep and interesting enough as a person to develop genuine friendships, honestly. I start learning new hobbies/skills on my own, but I quit. I don't have the 'debater' personality that wants to intellectually pick every argument apart, I just want to absorb information. Seems like the workforce, classes, and intelligent people prioritize the former. I only speak English, not 5 languages and whatever I picked up on two gap years in a remote village before university. I spent so much time getting my hopes up for summer internship apps only to get constantly ghosted after the interview but.. at least I got one and I'm not rotting at home this time.

I've realized that all the non-academic/non-work things I do a lot are just pure escapism. And they wouldn't be possible without me existing on a full ride. I make a reasonable amount (for side money) from freelance/survey sites and usually have (minimum wage) on-campus assistantship/jobs on top of that. But instead of graduating with $10k+ in my own savings or investing it, I'm spending it all traveling solo. I've taken advantage of positioning (these flights aren't from the US) and I will have been to 30ish countries by the time I graduate, barely having left the US before I started university. 

I've constantly been looking forward to the next trip, and I have some very interesting stories for someone my age. But I'm constantly just looking forward to my next travels and neglecting what I actually need to do to sustain my life and career. I drink, quite a lot, even alone sometimes because I feel like it just turns off the cold overthinker that I am. But the relationships I form through this are inherently transitory, and just end up giving me bittersweet feelings in the end. Or, most often, just Instagram friends where we lurk each others' stories but never talk again. I think what I prize here might be the dopamine highs of the constant novelty of seeing new places + the party scene + being 'active' with no time to dwell on my own thoughts.

I spent last semester in NYC and I was so incredibly overstimulated there that it affected every facet of my overall well being. Having no rent or actual bills I was spending an absurd amount from my stipend and other earnings at restaurants and bars. I'm naturally good looking-ish, not even through my own hard work (like gym) but by face and height. So as another form of escapism I sent myself on a dating app frenzy and fucked around and dealt with constant ghostings after dates that 'went well'. Over the past 5 months I've been on dates with OR made out with (or more) something like 20-25 different people. 10ish of those were the failed first dates with no chemistry. Yet I know none of this has a future with me moving around so much, it just makes me feel validated without having to show how smart or competent I am. And I've realized that for various reasons, which I'm sure partially include my own anxieties and porn use, that I'm not even a huge fan of casual sex. In some sense I have even felt with hookups and FWBs that the actual PIV part can be a chore but I just like the intimacy and foreplay.

The last week or two before I went home, including during finals, I wanted to just get my work over with. Clearly I underestimated what was an ""A quality"" paper here when I turned in some final papers a week before the deadline. Anyway, I was waking up every morning with the deepest pit in my stomach and sometimes I didn't want to eat. I was the kind of tired that even 11 hours of deep sleep couldn't address. And I've realized that I've felt a little bit of that sense of doom/dread at the end of every semester.

i am a first-year SPED teacher seeking advice on what paths i can take to become a general ed math teacher who currently holds a bachelor’s degree in history. i have mentioned already in previous posts about why i want to become a math teacher, but i’d like some advice on how to go about it. :)

For more context, I am hoping to make this switch for the 24-25 School Year, so i do have some time, but want to get started now. I am also in currently in Ohio, but possibly looking to move back home to CA or move east to Connecticut, New York or Massachusetts after the next school year. So advice in any of those states specifically would be nice lol

Option #1: I was thinking of doing a district internship program where i would be employeed in a school district (teaching) while also taking courses to work towards my credential. i’ve found one in CA, but have not had luck finding others in different states. i’ve also just tried looking at charter schools in different states and seeing if they had anything.

Option #2: Completing an online Math Teacher Prep program (like through WGU) and earning my credential that way. i am a bit concerned of whether i could actually complete it since i will be working full-time. (meeting certain requirements like the in-person teaching portion) i do feel like i would be able to keep pace with the course though and try to finish early.


Option #3: Completing a residency program. I would try to save up as much money now that I would could support myself the best i can to ensure i could pay it. i feel like this could be a good option, but it seems like some want me to have a related degree in the subject i want to teach.

these is just what i did research on, but if anyone has anything else, please share or tell me your thoughts! 🤍

tl;dr: first-year special ed teacher looking to make a switch to become a general ed math teacher for the 24-25 school year. i am thinking of doing a district internship program, an online teacher prep program or doing a residency program. any advice is appreciated!!"

i am still in shock that i got accepted. sure i have good stats and worked hard but compared to people i have seen with national awards, competitions, etc. my application seemed very average. i don’t think anything in particular really made me stand out, but i think that i was just a good fit for northwestern. of course do not overlook having good stats and writing essays that mean a lot to you but try and find your dream school where most students are very similar to you! 

also something funny about my northwestern application. i actually forgot to submit my ap scores so i had to email them and send a picture

another note: i wasn’t even going to apply to northwestern until october of the year i was applying. i was originally going to apply to vanderbilt ED. just trust your gut on making decisions and it will work out

best of luck to everyone applying in the future and i hope this helped!"

Will getting a more specialised degree(6 months of study followed by an internship) help me enter this job market in Paris Area ?

I just started a new internship I work in IT, and am paid 25 an hour with a bonus that is supposed to pay out later this month. 
Anywho - I was told my hours were 9-5, and my boss even said working 7-3, or even 8-4 was fine as well, just somewhere along those lines. My team doesn’t come in until maybe 10-10:30, and we all go on lunch at around 12, where we all take lunch for 2-3 hours, returning to the office sometime around 3, and then work until 4 where everyone pretty much goes home. Most of them are working 2-3 hours a day MAX. 
I had a talk with my boss, asking if these long lunches are okay, and he said to just record them as 30 minute lunches, and that I don’t need to be working a full 8 hours. Just make sure I am getting paid for as such. While we are out at these lunches, my boss encourages us to loosen up, and have a few drinks.

I am not sure if I just scored the best internship ever? Or is this normal in office culture? I am not a drinker at all, so I felt a little uncomfortable as I was worried about making a bad impression. This is my first “office” job as I have only worked retail and fast food previously. I almost feel as if I am committing time theft. Thank you everyone in advance for responding. :)

**Hooks**: ROTC isn’t really a hook but I heard it can help. I was offered the NROTC ISR scholarship, and I’m applying for the AFROTC as well. 

LOR: I think they’re going to be pretty good but I don’t think anyone can accurately chance their own LORs. 

List: I’m trying to get recruited to D3 schools, but injury took me out of the game for a while. Mainly down to MIT and Caltech. Problem is that I’m slightly out of MIT’s recruiting range now, but I can do ROTC for MIT. Should I do MIT early with ROTC and give up Caltech recruiting (which, granted, isn’t that big of a boost), or go with Caltech? Also need recs for schools that have decent ROTC programs. My top 5 are MIT, Stanford, Harvard, and then idk the last 2. 

Chance me for T10s - if I don’t get in, I’m happy with going to the military academies anyways.

13tesee,5,2023-05-27,I repressed my feelings for the first time in my life. Felt like a volcano trying to hide behind a cheese cloth.,tuppercupper,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/13tesee/i_repressed_my_feelings_for_the_first_time_in_my/,"I've always felt my emotions very heavily, to the point where I was known as the ""moper"" in my family. It seemed unfathomable to me that some people could suppress their feeling or push them aside to be dealt with later. If I felt an emotion, I had to sit in it immediately and for some drawn out period of time. I think this mandatory emotional purge is a big reason I don't have anxiety, but that's a digression if I've ever seen one.

Recently, I went through a really bad breakup that I let consume me for 8 months. I'm still dealing with it, but the last couple months have been considerably easier.

I was hoping we could come back to each other even just as friends this summer, but I found out they were going elsewhere for their internship. And that broke me.

It may have been a combination of all my hope collapsing, anger at myself for being so attached to the point of letting it affect my career,  and the fact that I had way too much to do that led me to just....push my sadness away. For about one day, I didn't let myself think about them. I laughed and joked around with my coworkers. And I truly felt happiness. But at the same time, I was a boiling pot beneath the surface. It felt extremely unstable. I've never experienced this before -- two very opposite emotions battling for space. I usually just feel one emotion at a time. 

I couldn't repress it for long, however. I let the feelings do their thing later that day. It was freeing to let it out even though I had it bottled up for only a short while.

It seems the key to repression is to redirect your energy and avoid thinking about the thing causing the distress. Very nice and convenient in the short term. But incredibly insidious. I can see how detrimental it would be in the long term.

This was a very unique experience for me. Not sure if I'd be able to tap into it again. 

I am very interested to read about all of your experiences with emotional repression, whether it's something you've been doing all your life or if you're newbies to the sport like I am."

GPA is currently a 3.67, and from my GRE practice tests I have around a 319-324 range. AWA is around 4-4.5 from those tests.

I also have two data analytics internships under my belt, with my junior fall semester spent in NY working near Wall Street for a finance startup. I am also currently doing cybersecurity research at a state uni for the summer. I'll be working on letters of rec through said research and even more during my school year.

I may have undiagnosed ADHD, the symptoms are all there. In the UK it can take quite long to get a diagnosis so I am waiting.

I have had several short stints since I have graduated. I have had 4, full time, jobs since starting from August 2021. I am a great interviewer and I told the interviewer that this role was the perfect fit for me, and was what I wanted to do, and my past opportunity didn't quite align. 

But I think the jig is up now, isn't it? The truth is I thought each of my jobs was a perfect fit for me but my symptoms basically got the best of me.  Especially in my last two jobs which were very PM focused which was such a bad move by myself and a total mistake. My current employment history looks like this

1st Job - 3 months

2nd Job - 6 months

3rd Job - 3 months

4th Job - 3 months

Maybe I can say the first two were internships and the last two were contractual positions? I am early into my career so I need all the experience I can get.

Any thoughts?"
13tgtf8,1,2023-05-27,My mom lied about having cancer and then faked wanting to kill herself to hurt me,Bloubibloub211,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13tgtf8/my_mom_lied_about_having_cancer_and_then_faked/,"The title pretty much sums it up but I need to get it off my chest in much more details, so apologies for the extremely long story, but hopefully you find it somehow entertaining and you can help me move on and heal. 

I am a 26 year old woman. Last October, after having lived abroad for two years for college, I went back home to live with my parents. I did not see them a lot during those two years, even though I came home several times because I was not living very far away (yay Europe).

After a few days of being home, my mom tells me she wants to talk to me, and explains to me that she never had breast cancer when I was younger, and that she wanted to tell me because she did not want to me to worry about maybe having cancer too one day because of genetics. She tells me that my dad does not know and makes me promise not to tell him. She also explains that she only lied to him, she never pretended to have cancer with the rest of the family. She says that she feel really terrible about it and that it took her a lot of courage to finally come clean. I ask her a few questions despite the shock, and she explains that at some point in my childhood, she could feel my dad was being distant and she was afraid of losing him, so she made up that she had breast cancer so that he would stay with her. Apparently my dad did not ask many questions about chemo or side effects or whatever, because it worked and they stayed together. She ""recovered"" from cancer, and later pretended to have relapsed, which my dad also believed, and then ""recovered"" again. I don't have many memories of that time so I don't even know how it was believable, I just always knew that my mom had had cancer.

A few hours after that, I had an appointment with my therapist, who tells me that it can be a good idea to go live with someone else for a while so I can process all the information. I agree because I have no idea how to act normal in front of my father, and even in front of my mother. So I spend a few days at a friend's house trying to figure out how to deal with it. I eventually go home, and I try to go on with my life. My dad does not notice anything, or at least he does not show it. But I am quite cold with my mom, because of course this raised a lot more questions but I was not really ready to have that conversation. We have bits of conversation, where she basically says she told me for my own good and that she does not understand why I am having such a hard time forgiving her.

A month later, while my dad is not home, I have an argument with her. I have always had an ok relationship with her, but I get easily annoyed at her because it is really difficult to have meaningful conversations with her. Basically she is always out of it, and does not understand what you are talking about and answers the most random things. This time, maybe because I resent her, when she asks why I am getting annoyed, instead of brushing it off, I tell her that it is impossible to have conversations with her and that she never understands anything (it is all a bit of a blur but what I said was reallt harsh). She then starts crying and screaming and waving her hands and says that what I am saying is horrible and if that is what I think about her then she does not want to live anymore. She then runs towards her bedroom window, which is on the 9th floor, and tries to open it to jump. I remove her hands from the handle to stop her, and she eventually calms down. She then lays on her bed on her phone and I remain in the living room after texting my dad to urgently come home, terrified that she might try to jump again. At some point she tries to close the bedroom door and I slap it open and tell her that she is not allowed to close it after what she just pulled. She tells me that she was never going to do it and that she just wanted to hurt me like I hurt her. She eventually leaves the house and this time I do not stop her.

What is important to know to understand the trauma that this caused me, is that I went through several depressive episodes and a suicidal episode two years ago, where I thought about jumping from the 9th floor several times (I am much better now, but I can still be easily triggered when someone talks about suicide). And she knew about it. She will later tell me that she did not think about that at all when she pretended she wanted to jump, which I still don't know if I believe or not.

After that, I take an anxiolytic pill and fall asleep, and when I wake up both my parents are home. I ignore my mom, and then my dad wants to talk to me. This conversation is a bit of a blur too, but I learn that my mom told my dad about the fake cancer a few days ago, and that he never suspected anything, but that he didn't know that I knew and that she asked me not to tell him. For several days, I keep ignoring my mom, and my dad tells me that it needs to stop and that I need to talk to her. But I am incapable of it. I then go on a trip with my boyfriend for two weeks (after agreeing to talk with my mom when I come back), which was already planned but is the perfect opportunity for me to catch a break and try to figure out what I am gonna say to her. When I come back, I don't feel anymore ready to talk to her, and I have only one day to do it because I am then moving abroad again for an internship. But she pressures me to, and we end up talking via text and later on a video call.

This was a really painful conversation, and it did not make anything better. It actually made it worse, because she did not understand how traumatic that was for me, and kept reminding me that it was also my fault because I made her do it because I said horrible things to her (which is true and I know I am partly to blame for it, but I think that what she did is so much worse that it is not fair to blame me). One of the worst thing she said was that what she did is not worse than what I did to my ex boyfriend. That is another very long story but basically, during my suicidal episode I tried to kill myself in front of my ex, and he was so traumatized that he went on vacation without me to recover, when I was initially supposed to go with him. I obviously did not handle it well and felt abandoned, and still in the middle of the suicidal episode, I scarified myself and sent him pictures to make him come back or hurt him. It, among many other things, led to him leaving me. I know it was a horrible thing to do to someone, and I am really ashamed of what I did now. But my mom throwing that back at me to justify what she did felt really cruel and unwarranted.

It is now seven months later. I came home twice, once for the holidays, once to see some friends. When I come home I have to stay at my parents, and I try to act normal with my mom. But she has broken my trust, traumatized me, and even after several months I have not recovered. I don't know if I will ever be able to have a normal relationship with her again, and I don't know how I can even begin to forgive her."

I have a few quires, such as when I apply do I talk about what I want to do for a masters thesis? Im worried that if I spend alot of my time focusing on quantum computing i'm limiting my university choices.  And how do I know what thesis topics they will want and wether their are suitable supervisors for it etc.

I know references is a big thing, but the lectures dont really know me that well. I have my tutor who I was hoping to complete some research with but that seems to have fallen through.  Any advice how I can get meaniful and good references. They say ask your lectures questions in office hours, but I either dont have any questions or I can just find the answer online?

As for an academic CV what goes on this? I dont have any computer science related work expirence will this look too bare compared to other applicants?

I am currently a senior and will be graduating next semester with a degree in Information Systems and a minor in business. I have experience in a lot of different entry level jobs from: sales, banking, retail, food, marketing, social media, and currently right now tech. Not to toot my own horn but I also have really great soft skills and it has been mentioned by every single employer. 

  
I job hop a lot and it took me almost 7 years to get my bachelors because I kept changing my major and undiagnosed adhd. I am currently a networking intern at a local MSP and have a job offer as a networking engineer when I graduate. 

  
I don’t exactly love or hate what I do, and was considering going into data analytics when I graduated. I was considering doing some Microsoft certifications this summer and was hoping with my IS degree and entry level tech experience that I would land an entry level job. I was considering data entry, because I like coding and the pay seems higher for less stress compared to a network engineer. 

  
Here’s my issue, my dream has always been and still is, to be a hair stylist. My mom sort of crushed my dream when I was younger by telling me its a waste of time and I wouldn’t make any money. I understand where my mom is coming from as we immigrated here and she just wants me to have a stable job and not have to bust my ass like she does in a factory. 

  
I got no pell grants my entire time in school and will have roughly 28k in student debt when I finish. I am also 24 and am now considered a dependent student, but also just got married and my husband makes roughly 75k. I make peanuts at my intern job. 

  
I can’t shake the feeling of walking away from my dream. I decided to not pursue cosmetology for several reasons: financial security, no benefits, the wear on my body, and overall just fearful of failing.   
I’m aware that starting a business is a lot of hustling the first few years and the end goal is to own my own salon. But the passion is there every day of my life and sometimes I cry about not being able to pursue it.

  
Would I be an idiot to turn away from a stable job path to pursue something that might fail? I know it would be beautiful if everyone could follow their dreams, but lets be honest, I also want a comfortable life for me and my husband. I’m tired of being broke and having to rely on him and want to contribute to our household. The idea of getting carpal tunnel or my back giving out in 10 years terrifies me.

  
I think I’m confident that I could have successful salon with my passion, knowledge, and experience but what about retiring from the chair? There is also the issue that cosmetology school is roughly 20k and I’m already stressed about my current debt. If it doesn’t end up working out, its a lost investment. I also won’t even know if it’s not going to work out until after a few years in the industry and I already feel behind my peers due to my late graduation. 

  
I’m terrified of making the wrong choice and would love some insight?"

I wanna learn every Backend, DevOps, ML/DL, MLOps, DBMS tool there is on this planet I'm almost blowing myself to bits here. But I can't fixate myself on one and fully learn it end to end. That's why my knowledge of just about everything feels so weak I can't do anything anything worthwhile practically. How do I get over this and choose just one stack or one specialisation?"

I am currently getting my bachelors in mathematics and have just become a junior. 

Recently a family member was talking to
me about my degree plan and asked if I knew anything about Risk Management. I said I did not but he thought it would be a great idea for me to come to his office later and see some of the guys in the department.

I think this could be an amazing opportunity and could possibly lead to an internship, only thing is I don’t know a thing about risk management. I’ve started reading “Financial Risk Management for dummies” to try to get a better understanding, but I wanted to get some more thoughts.

I have about 2-3 weeks to learn as much as I can about risk management and know some of the math that can be involved. I only Cal 1-2 and I know nothing about business. 

Any advice as to what to read up on before I go over to speak with those guys? Any help will be greatly appreciated!!

Thank you very much!"

The good:

* Great pay, pays more than the typical helpdesk roles I get suggested from recruiters
* Great management, co-workers, lax environment, no micromanagement, co workers are like family
* I can take more or less hours when I want and take days off when I want if I work ahead the previous day
* I'm slowly studying certs on the job while waiting for tickets
* I get to work under the IT guy who does all the sysadmin etc. so I get to watch how it all connects sometimes

The downsides:

* Not learning anything new, solving the same problems for 7 months now
* Limited exposure despite exposure to sysadmin side of things, everything is managed by MSP for us
* It's an internship and not a ""real"" job experience

For now I can only work part-time because I am also doing my bachelors full time for IT/IST.

I don't know if employers are going to take me seriously if I applied to a SysAdmin role and they saw that I had a whole year of being an intern. Should I find another part time helpdesk job that's not an internship? How can I maximize my knowledge and employability when I graduate?"

I work part time as a Site Reliability Engineer for my school and had verbally committed to continue working with them over the summer. However, I recently received an offer to be an intern at a VR/AR startup. I also plan on taking summer school to desperately catch up on credits.

So I feel as if doing all three of these at the same time will be too time consuming. Plus, I would like to use the summer to work on projects and grind LC so I can be in a better position to earn a better paying internship next summer. Even though I've verbally committed to working as an SRE, I feel as if this option needs to go and I would rather intern and do summer school instead.

Is it morally wrong to withdraw even though I've already verbally committed? (Side note: Once summer is over I would ideally like to work for these guys again during the school year)

And if it's morally right, how can I tell my manager in a way that will allow me to continue working for him after summer?"

I hope you're all doing well! I'm a pre-final year student pursuing electrical engineering, and I'm really interested in exploring the field of quantum computing through a research internship. I have a decent understanding of Quantum computing, Quantum Key Description (have done a project on that too), and theoretical quantum physics. Moreover, I'm proficient in tools like `qiskit`, `cirq`, and have a keen interest in learning about quantum architecture as well.

I would greatly appreciate any guidance on the following aspects:

1. Where should I look for research internship opportunities in quantum computing? Are there any specific organizations, universities, or research labs known for their quantum computing programs?
2. What are the key skills and qualifications that employers generally look for in applicants for quantum computing internships? Any recommendations on how I can further enhance my profile?
3. How can I effectively highlight my knowledge and skills in quantum computing, especially with tools like qiskit, cirq, and quantum architecture, in my internship applications?
4. Are there any online resources, forums, or communities where I can connect with professionals, researchers, or fellow students interested in quantum computing? It would be great to expand my network and learn from others' experiences.

Thank you all in advance for your time and assistance!

P.S. If you have any specific internship opportunities or leads in the field of quantum computing, please feel free to reach out to me via direct message. I'd be more than happy to discuss further."

Currently, I work as a SPED middle school teacher and am just really frustrated at where my career trajectory is headed for the near future (if I let it). In high school I was originally interested in STEM but also was more talented and naturally more inclined towards the arts and humanities, so I gave up STEM to go to art school, only for it to not work out for me post-graduation (no job or anything despite internships, grades, and networking--with a student debt balance on top of that).

I'm not satisfied with all the crap/disrespect teachers are getting in society now from parents, students, and admins, my meager pay, and the low return on investment I see for myself by continuing down this path, compared to the high respect and success I see some of my peers in healthcare, law, business, and tech getting because they weren't scared of math or learned to accept failure rather than attempting to avoid it, and powered through to excel in in-demand careers. I feel so mediocre, and the reality of my situation has been eating away at me from the inside for years.

Ideally, I would love to quit my job and become an entrepreneur or freelance business owner of some kind selling my art and writing but with the recent advent of AI, I worry my already low chances of success/making money in my ventures have been at best severely inhibited, and at worst, completely shot. I witnessed firsthand clients and such moving over to AI to generate content for them, and I have yet to receive any commissions for anything I do. It feels like no matter what I do, I simply can't compete with an AI that doesn't ask for money, and can produce cheap knockoffs of other peoples' work basically in an instant, and is only growing more sophisticated over time.

I feel like I screwed up my entire life, and accidentally made myself useless. I can't stay at my job for more than a few years because I am sick and tired of the politics, bureaucracy, and emotional exhaustion inherent to the profession, but I can't just leave either because I need the security/money, I have student debt to pay, jobs are scarce, and there's no telling if my job will be one of the few professions that won't end up completely automated by AI in the future.

In short, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Between Scylla and Charybdis.

If AI is already starting to replace artists and writers first-- jobs nobody previously thought would be automated so quickly-- how long will it be before teachers are replaced, and then everyone is replaced,  eradicating the idea of a career entirely?

Should I just accept the fact that maybe basing off my identity on a career is a terrible idea, and just say fuck it? Am I right to be worried about AI and obsolescence, or am I overreacting?"

4. School culture (or specifically the department ig, since i've heard the Allen school is kinda in its own bubble)

I got into UCSD Data Science and Penn State CS this year. I have committed to UCSD but still have an option of Penn State. The problem is that both univs have no scholarship whatsoever for international students and cost nearly the same. Finance is a bit of a problem. My parents earn like 80K per year, which is pretty good for my country. UCSD takes away 70K of that or comes with debt. I plan to pay some part with internships and jobs from second year but even they are not something I can highly depend upon given the recession which is coming. I didn't have great SAT scores to apply for scholarship giving univs like Stanford though I had the GPA (not sure about ECs). Should I stay optimistic enough and go to UCSD with a plan of transferring to scholarship giving universities? I think I can create a very strong profile in two years at UCSD. Is it worth the gamble? I also have an option of going to a university in my country and probably get an MS in the US.

Edit:  If you do vote, please tell the reason too in the comments. I see many of you guys have suggested me to stay in UCSD and take part time internships. Can you guys give me a rough idea how much I can earn with that and are they even manageable throughout the year? This is a very confusing and stressful time for me, please help.

- MS CS at Columbia
- Associate Systems Engineer at a government contractor (can rotate into SWE position after a few months if I’m not placed directly into an SWE position at the start) w/ secret clearance

About me: I really like AI. I think it would be cool to tinker with AI and build things with it. Software engineering is mostly appealing to me for the $ and for the work life balance (if I become an SWE, dream is remote work). Also, I like CS because I like entrepreneurship and I feel that CS is a powerful and versatile tool for that. I’m not sure if a PhD is right for me, but an MS might help me decide.

Now the question I’m facing is if the MS CS program is a better option than my government contractor job option. Here’s a pros and cons list:

COLUMBIA:

Pros:
- prestige
- ms may help me get a higher salary or better company or have future benefits
- I’m interested in AI, an MS is pretty much bare minimum if I ever want to work with it?
- experience NYC / travel while I’m young
- gives me time to grind leetcode
- graduate in a better market maybe? 

Cons:
- cash cow (although most MS programs are, so this doesn’t bother me as much)
- 1 year of giving away work experience / salary (~87k)
- expensive (70k, but won’t be in debt)

JOB:

Pros:
- start making money
- gives me time to grind leetcode and apply elsewhere and to possible other new grad positions?
- gain some work experience that’ll help get me into a better job later on?
- gives me more time to flesh out what kind of job I really want (have always been interested in finance, although an MBA later on would prob be better; have always been interested in space and mech e too)
- could take a year to improve my applications for next year (potential research at nasa using SWE or Harvard medical using AI), the goal is Stanford or Harvard (get to do research and take classes at MIT)

Cons:
- could I get pigeon-holed? Gov SWE experience not as good as big tech?
- rotational program which is good for experience but first rotation (6ish months) may not be related to software
- if I reapply to MS CS programs next year maybe I won’t get back into Columbia (can’t defer) and I’ll regret it forever


I feel like there are so many pros and cons here.

Also, if it helps, I have 2 SWE internships at nasa and an SWE internship at a small to medium-sized tech company under my belt."

About me: I really like AI. I think it would be cool to tinker with AI and build things with it. Software engineering is mostly appealing to me for the $ and for the work life balance (if I become an SWE, dream is remote work). Also, I like CS because I like entrepreneurship and I feel that CS is a powerful and versatile tool for that. I’m not sure if a PhD is right for me, but an MS might help me decide.

Now the question I’m facing is if the MS CS program is a better option than my government contractor job option. Here’s a pros and cons list:

COLUMBIA:

Pros:
- prestige
- ms may help me get a higher salary or better company or have future benefits
- I’m interested in AI, an MS is pretty much bare minimum if I ever want to work with it?
- experience NYC / travel while I’m young
- gives me time to grind leetcode
- graduate in a better market maybe? 

Cons:
- cash cow (although most MS programs are, so this doesn’t bother me as much)
- 1 year of giving away work experience / salary (~87k)
- expensive (70k, but won’t be in debt)

JOB:

Pros:
- start making money
- gives me time to grind leetcode and apply elsewhere and to possible other new grad positions?
- gain some work experience that’ll help get me into a better job later on?
- gives me more time to flesh out what kind of job I really want (have always been interested in finance, although an MBA later on would prob be better; have always been interested in space and mech e too)
- could take a year to improve my applications for next year (potential research at nasa using SWE or Harvard medical using AI), the goal is Stanford or Harvard (get to do research and take classes at MIT)

Cons:
- could I get pigeon-holed? Gov SWE experience not as good as big tech?
- rotational program which is good for experience but first rotation (6ish months) may not be related to software
- if I reapply to MS CS programs next year maybe I won’t get back into Columbia (can’t defer) and I’ll regret it forever


I feel like there are so many pros and cons here.

Also, if it helps, I have 2 SWE internships at nasa and an SWE internship at a small to medium-sized tech company under my belt."

Every year at my undergrad university’s Spring graduation ceremony, awards are given out to faculty, staff, and students. One of these is the Outstanding [insert major here] Award where a committee of professors selects a graduating senior from each Department to receive the award. During Fall graduation, the selection process is for Outstanding Junior instead.

My Department is very large since it encompasses 4 majors: Cybersecurity, Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, and Math. Because of this, the Department is allowed to award up to two students. This makes it very competitive. So, two students have always been selected every year since the award was founded sometime in the 1990’s.

However, the Department failed to nominate a single CSEC, CS, CIS, or Math student this year despite the size of the graduating class. Many of my peers who graduated this Spring were incredibly talented with REU experience, internships, D1 sports, double majors, scholarships, work studies, very high GPAs, etc. It was a strong graduating class. 

Our department was the only one that failed to award a senior. This has never happened before in any department for any other year. Why would something like this happen?

Edit: I learned through the grapevine that a girl solved an open problem in mathematics using methods that the professors thought would be impossible. Apparently, during her research presentation, two of the professors in the department got into a really heated argument about whether or not something about the proof was correct. Everyone in the department got really upset over it, the professor who thought her solution wasn’t correct said she “had nothing” and was “wasting their time” and stormed out. They ended up giving her a barely passing grade for it. Anyway, shortly after, they got in contact with the researchers that posed the problem. They were able to verify that her solution was actually correct. But the whole situation strained the relationship between everyone pretty badly. Anyway, I heard she ended up getting accepted to the top university in the country, so I guess it doesn’t really matter."

First time poster here. I recently as the title states it, Got my girlfriend pregnant.  She is currently on the pill, And the one time we had unprotected sex is probably the culprit for this situation, Which if it is, i take the blame completely. 

If important, I have met her parents like she has mine and both families are content with ourselves being together, And although we’ve been dating for 6 months, Had our ups and downs, we’ve always had excellent communication skills between eachother. I’m aware we’ve only been dating for a short month, However I’m positive this is the woman I plan spending the rest of my life with.

We’ve spoken about our options in terms of abortion and keeping it. It’s barely around the first or second week yet we found out about it 2 days ago. My girlfriend is a graduated marketing major, Actively seeking a job. And myself I am still in school following software engineering, Going into my junior year with a Internship at GE as a software engineer in the spring.

My girlfriend is set on keeping it, And to which I am not opposed although I prefer not to due to the financial aspect and me coming from a unplanned pregnancy myself, And I wouldn’t want that on my child. I’ve told her that In the end, I respect her decision as it is not my body, and I’m completely supportive of her own decision. And whatever the outcome is, She can count on me to stay. Because she  gave me the option to leave as “she doesn’t want to ruin all the plans and dreams” I have. To which I responded with the obvious “That’s out of the question”. To which she smiled at me shivering and thanked me.

Although we will be seeing a doctor to get confirmation and also get some advice, im aware my life will get 10x harder with a child. My anxiety comes with the explanation to parents (both mine and hers). And everything about what could happen and if I won’t be able to provide a life worth living.

But it’s the explanation to my parents that I got my girlfriend pregnant on complete accident despite precautions being taken. I’m scared my parents will not accept her and disapprove of us immediately and vise versa with her parents. Or to make terms simpler, I’m scared of the outcome of breaking the news to them.

Thank you I’m advance. In all honesty, A part of me smiles at the thought of having a mini “us” as I know it is my girlfriends biggest dream to become a mom. But at the same time I feel completely lost, Possibly because I’m a junior in college and i feel like i am not capable. Does anybody have any similar experiences, or have any advice on going about the situation?"

My aim is basically to get an 30+ lpa job with good WLB in some MNC...:-)

1.) Which path is the best for me , doing hardcore CP(Codeforces) or strengthening my concepts on DSA (LC) ? I've heard doing CP will help me immensely in coding rounds of interviews , but there are a lot of redundant questions and concepts used in CP which won't be required anywhere.....
 

2.) Right now I know a decent bit of C , Python , and MatLab , which more languages and frameworks need to be added in my stack so as to be well-rounded ? Are languages like JAVA , Js , etc needed for development if I were to get hired for high-paying jobs at FAANGs... I'll admit that I'm not much into development and leaning more towards CP , but I'll put efforts into learning it if it means that I'll have a good life ahead....


3.) I've heard that most of SDE jobs are FrontEnd/FullStack developer jobs for which HTML , CSS , React , Angular , etc are required ? Are these kind of jobs the best bet for 30+ lpa placement right outta clg ? Also is the job market too saturated for these jobs ?

4.) What all projects and internships are needed to stand out in this competitive market ? Does CGPA matter in on-campus placement , or is it just a passing criteria ? Do I need to win hackathons and participate in ICPC or other contests if it means I'll land a pretty good job ?

5.) Also , what languages and skills are needed for internships in quant/hfts. Does it involve a lot of hardcore  C++ and crazy math skills ? Recently some of my clg seniors (& that too from non-CS branch) got internships in Amsterdam in these firms with decent pay , free travel to Amsterdam , etc and I'm inclined to work hard for these kinda internships..... I've heard that all I gotta do is keep practicing competitive coding.

I hope this post finds you all in good spirits.

PS: Just to have some clarity and not jump into conclusions, this post is not a desperate post regarding job seeking. Just some request for help in few aspects.

I am a final year undergraduate in Mechatronics and would be graduating in a month or two. I am reaching out to this community as I am actively seeking job or internship opportunities in the field of automotive and autonomous vehicles. So, if possible any kind of reference or suggestion would be greatly appreciated and help me out in a great extent. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career as a design engineer in the mechanical domain, with a focus on areas such as mechanical design, sheet metal, brakes and wheel applications, model-based design, and R&D.

During my college days, I feel that I didn't fully utilize the opportunities available to me. However, I am now eager to make up for it by starting as an intern and showcasing my abilities and dedication. If given the chance, I am confident that I can prove my self-worth and contribute significantly to any company and later convert the internship into a full-time position based on my performance.

Additionally, I have recently developed a slight interest in the data analytics domain. If opportunities in my primary field don't materialize, I am considering a transition into data analytics because I have some interest towards Formula 1 data analysis. Maybe I am making a wise choice or it maybe I am getting intimated by the buzz and hype for Data Science.

I would greatly appreciate your opinions and insights on my career aspirations. If you have any suggestions, opinions or guidance to share in any aspect, I would be extremely grateful. 

Thank you all in advance for your time and support. I look forward to your responses and guidance."

I have many friends from this culture and I’m living with two of them here for the summer. Anyways I got here last Saturday and there has been so much going on at all times every day. I know so many people here and everyone wants to visit (friends, family, family friends I’ve never even met), I’m constantly asked to go out to the bars, there are humongous cultural celebrations happening this summer that are weeks long I just feel incredibly overwhelmed. I would honestly be fine with going home, and I haven’t even started my internship yet (starts tomorrow). The only problem is this internship is important for resume building and I’ve already paid a high price to move here but I am almost in a constant state of anxiety here. I really don’t like how I’m feeling, and as the summer progresses things are only going to get more hectic and more overwhelming (from my job starting, to even more of my friends and family coming to this country to visit). I apologize if this is hard to understand, but I could really use some input on what to do.

Update : thank you everyone! I’ve gotten much more acclimated to my situation. When my job started my life died down a little bit which was incredibly nice. This weekend I’m doing some solo traveling around the country and it’s been a blast! Love you all :)"

Standard solution is to make a dictionary of known/parent entities, and calculate string distance (e.g. levenshtein, jaro-winkler, jaccard) between each dictionary entry and each observed entry in the data, then classify observed entries to parent entities based on a string distance threshold. Cool. But (a) still requires a lot of manual oversight (what if you don't know the true list of parent entities?), (b) by only looking at distances between the dictionary entities and observed entries you're not capitalizing on a lot of information in the data, (c) our client already uses this method and wants to further automate/improve their fuzzy matching process.

My idea: What if you took string distances between all possible pairs of observed entries, and used them as the edge-weights in a network where each observed entry is a node? Then you could plot the network to visually identify clusters that might indicate parent entities, and could maybe even use community detection or block modelling on the text network to automatically cluster observed entries to (model-predicted) parent entities. 

Has anyone tried this network-based fuzzy matching? Does it even sound promising? 

(Important context: my internship is funded by a data science fellowship from my uni, so unlike a normal job or internship I'm encouraged to experiment for the sake of learning, even if it's a little less time efficient. We also have a VM to use over the summer for free.)"

I'm having a hard time deciding between the two.

I want: 
1. To work in the hardware industry after graduating (Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc)
2. Smallish classes where I can get to know professors
3. Be able to get into undergraduate research
4. Be able to get summer internships.

USC is a little more expensive than UVA, but I should be able to afford both. I prefer the location and campus of UVA more, LA's urbanness is not my style. However, the diversity of USC's student body is better. I also know that all my classes transfer to USC because of an articulation agreement, but I'd have to get my classes evaluated for transfer at UVA.

Is there a serious difference in outcomes between a #15 engineering school and a #37? Are there more opportunities for the hardware industry on the east coast or west coast?

I'd appreciate any advice on what to choose."

I am an 18 years old student currently studying finance and accountancy.

I’m extremely fascinated in the world of entrepreneurship. I try to improve myself everyday by understanding accounting concepts and the economic machine.

I know that there are 100 ways to make 100 millions. But the question is how do I start?

Everyone tells me to live my youth but I’m afraid that my youth will end and I will have to face reality.

My questions are:

What should be my priority at this age? I know that university education can be useful and I will continue with it but other than that what should be my main priorities?

I’m applying to internships (even unpaid) to get a sense of how the real work life looks like, is there anything more useful I can do instead of internships?

I know that your network = your net worth, how do I network with people? Most people my age are only interested in time wasting activities and useless partying.

I’m always looking for an advice, so please give me any valuable advice given my circumstances.

Thank you very much in advance!"

The thing is I also need to start doing Leetcode. I have not done any Leetcode before and was thinking of doing Grind 75. My question is if I should finish DS&A completely before starting Grind 75 or if I should be doing both at the same time. Which way would be more efficient and sustainable?

If I was to finish DS&A first, then I'm thinking of finishing DS&A in like 5 weeks and then grinding Leetcode until school starts (2 hours a day for both). 

If I was to do both, it would probably have to be something like 1 hour studying DS&A then 1 hour grinding Leetcode.

Why not have a submission portal for the quarterly reports where we can upload them to every 3 months so that they are gradually approved? It gives supervisors WAY too much power to clear your hours or for a resident to lose a report since the board doesn't have record of them until they are all completed. 

ANYWAY. How are y'all storing and keeping track of them? I'm looking at fire/water proof storage bins and obviously having PDF back ups and hard drives. I plan to use Tevera as an Alumni to keep track of them all since that was my schools platform to keep track of intern hours."

**Letters of Recommendation**  
  


Internship manager - 8/10, knew me fairly well, and I think it gave my business app a unique edge because I already had real corporate experience

History teacher - 7/10, known for writing good rec letters, but he probably writes 30-50 each year so I doubt mine was that incredible

Club sponsor - 4/10, knew me decently, but probably not the strongest writer

Languages teacher - 6/10, probably decent, but coming from a large public school probably meant the rec letters were overall not as strong as private feeder letters

Counselor - 5/10, explained my family situation, but overall probably very generic

  
**Interviews**  
  
Georgetown, Yale: Felt like I connected on a personal level with both of my interviewers. Neither of us seemed to want to end the conversation, and I think I left an overall very positive impression while expressing my true self. 9/10

Dartmouth, Duke, Harvard: All in one week, back to back, so it was stressful. However, the constant practice made it so that these were all pretty good. 7/10 

UPenn ED: First interview so I was really nervous, but he kind of dominated and guided the conversation. Overall did decent. 7/10

UT Austin Business Honors, MIT, Rice: Plain old generic college interviews. 5/10

Princeton: Was my first in-person interview, so I was super nervous. Lasted only 20 minutes, and I really felt like I put on a fake personality that def hurt my chances. 1/10  


**Essays**



Personal statement - 6/10. Generic essay about how a generic hobby taught me to learn from others. Spent maybe 8-10 hours on it? Really felt nervous about this tanking my application because a few friends said it was really really bad (not to be mean, they were genuinely trying to help). However, this was cancelled out by a few adults and college students saying it was really good, so idk. Overall was probably decent, and appealed to more serious readers.

Supplementals: A majority were good, probably around 7-8/10. A few were super cringe looking back, so like 3/10, while a couple were genuinely 10/10. Even got a note from my Stanford AO saying she loved my essays. Lots of research and time put into the ""Why Us?"" essays. Took a huge risk on my why major essay, and it ended up leading to mixed results. The community essay was probably my weakest, while the essays in which I got to explain my family situation, express my passion for econ, and the 50ish-word short responses were my best. As a whole, I think my supplements and how I approached them through expressing my personality and passions rather than flexing my accomplishments really helped me stand out.

Just a note on the essays: the amount of time you spend on an essay has no correlation to how good it is. It's perfectly fine to finish one quickly and use a first or second draft. Some of my best essays were written like this when I was just in a good mood and trying to finish quickly to go hang out - while the ones I grinded on for days (looking at you Princeton) ended up being fake and cringey.

**Additional Information/final reflections:**  
  
I think the biggest, biggest thing that I regret, and am still trying to overcome, is the glorification of Ivy students. What I mean by this is the echo chamber prevalent on this sub, and A2C and even among the students I met at the various competitions I participated in, that believes that anyone who gets into a school like Harvard or Stanford or any Ivy for that matter is somehow smarter or better than kids who get rejected. This belief led me to believe that only those with super stacked god-tier resumes get in, leading me to be completely shocked by my results. Looking back, even though I'm not a perfect applicant, I should've been a lot more confident and realized that I was definitely ""average"" for an Ivy applicant. I have a deleted post on an alt asking where I'd get in, and most people said Kelley and Ross at best. I think people as a whole need to realize that although college admissions is super selective and complete BS, the reason you won't get in is NOT because you didn't do enough, or because your resume is weak - it's because of factors like luck and institutional priorities. If I applied again, I could see myself getting into Harvard and Stanford again, or ending up at A&M or UT. It's literally all luck once you're past a certain point. I hope all applicants in the future are more optimistic (without being unrealistic), while taking the admissions process a little more lightheartedly.

&#x200B;

One final thing: if you're a prestige whore. Stop it now. It never ends. This is going to sound so fucking dumb, but until like last week, while I was waiting for Harvard waitlist results to come out, I genuinely had the thought that I wasn't ""good enough"" because I got into Stanford and not Harvard. WTF. I can't believe I genuinely thought something like that. Objectively I know it's false because I can see people on this sub with similar applications to me get into Harvard and not Stanford, and even without that, it's just so dumb to place my value on an admissions decision. I've really sat and thought about it for a while, and I think being a prestige whore comes from a mix of needing validation and also feeling insecure. I've been working towards addressing both, and hope in the future I won't give a shit what people think and will stop being in my own head. 

Anyways, sorry for the rambling at the end of this post! Good luck to the class of 2024 and all future classes applying! I hope everything works out amazing for you all, and dm or comment if you have any questions. Hopefully this post helped just a little."
13ucg04,275,2023-05-28,My boss just showed up at my house (Sunday Evening),grahamsmackerr,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/13ucg04/my_boss_just_showed_up_at_my_house_sunday_evening/,"I am ranting but also looking for advice on how to address this tomorrow.

I feel like I need to give background on the situation I'm in. Last October, my boyfriend and I relocated to a small city (10k population). I took a job at the local Chamber of Commerce. When I was hired, there were 3 other staff members, including my boss, L.
Two staff members left not long after I started, one retiring and one taking another position. Since January, I have worked alone in the Chamber with L.
L is kind of the worst. L behaves inappropriatley for an office. L overshares about all details in their life, talks on the phone with family members and friends constantly through the day, and does hardly any work. I do not give L any details about my life (I won't even share my weekend plans) because I don't trust L with any personal information. L watches my social media closely, and brings up anything I post. Its super uncomfortable. I blocked L's personal account on Instagram, and they used our shared business account to look at my ""story"" and then commented on that post to me at work. 
Anyway, I think you get the picture that L does not have any sense of boundaries. As they are my direct supervisor and only coworker, I put up with a lot of yucky behavior to try and keep a peaceful work environment.

So tonight, Sunday, at 4:30 my boyfriend and I are sitting on our front deck when a car pulls up in front of our house. Out pops L, who struts up to us on our deck and starts ranting about an annoying work message she got. It was a small inconvenience, has nothing at all to do with me, and is not something that would barely warrant a text. L then led a monolouge about their weekend before leaving. All together they were at my house for less than 10 minutes, and my boyfriend and I said hardly anything in that time, but just stared at her in disbelief.

My job pays a very low salary (rip);and I end up working a lot outside my 'regular' hours because of events, meetings, and other things. L causes me a lot of stress from their regular inappropriate behavior, but showing up to my home is so blatantly rude that I'm still feeling shocked. I feel this is the final straw of what I will put up with.

I am already applying for new jobs because working with L is a nightmare and because this job pays a very low salary. I was hired as a social media intern, but now do social media, events, member relations, work as a tourism representative, and so much more, and I never received an increase in pay. My hours worked, responsibilities, and stress have all gone up and I have repeatedly asked for better compensation from L and from our board of directors, with no luck

I want to sit L down tomorrow and outline that what they did is inappropriate. I am also going to stand up for myself about all the overtime I work and my unfair compensation. 
I am honestly really nervous about this because L is so unprofessional and I'm not sure how they'll react. I'd appreciate any advice you guys might have on handling this.



TLDR: My boss showed up at my house uninvited and unannounced on Sunday evening. What steps should I take to tell them that the behavior is inappropriate?

Letters of Recommendation

APUSH teacher recommendation (8/10): I think I got to know her pretty well and that she was really able to get to know me as a student. She told me she tried to really showcase the strong qualities of myself that really shined through and would serve me best. She also told me she liked how I overcame challenges on the history day competition and how I was persistent/a grit student. I also did try my best in APUSH class and i feel like she probably wrote a lot about that, including about my character.

&#x200B;

AP Psychology teacher (6/10): Wrote it in a couple of days, so not sure how strong it was. I feel like she somewhat got to know me in AP Psych class but nothing outside of the classroom. She also didn't know what COMMON APP when I asked her so this was probably a first for her, which is kinda a red flag lol but not anything bad. I feel like it was probably average to above average, but who knows it could have been well-written.

City employee internship advisor (5/10): I got the letter of recommendation after my internship and it was very generic, but i still asked her to fill it out for the community recommender part of the Common app recommendation section. I think she wrote like an extra sentence or two but people have told me it was very generic and didn't really demonstrate extra qualities about myself.

Interviews

Had 1 alumni interview with Dartmouth College. I would rate it a 7/10. I got along with her pretty well but I did have some hick ups but I really was able to express myself well. I did prepare for it but it wasn't anything extraordinary.

Essays

UC PIQ Essays (8.5/10): I spent a lot of time writing/editing my UC personal insight questions. I went to both my AP English literature and AP English language teachers, my counselor, one of my close friends, my APUSH teacher, and online ""advisors"" who somewhat helped although I did pay them upwards of $400 in total to review/edit. I started writing them on November 1st, but I went through so many drafts. I had like 40 pages of just drafts on the google doc. I did have lots of people go over it (which may have been a bad thing due to an overwhelming amount of different advice/feedback/edits they had). I also did pay for online college advisory services to look over my essays, which wasn't too helpful because they gave very minimal edits/feedback. I think three of my PIQ essays were pretty strong at the point . The fourth PIQ essay I started writing the week of the deadline and it turned out pretty good, but not super strong. I feel like one of my UC essays was especially strong for how well-written it was, how unique it was, and how much it demonstrated my personal values/challenges. I truly do feel like my essays on leadership, overcoming a challenge, favorite academic subject, and community essay shined through on me as an applicant and demonstrated who I was as well as my potential.

Common APP PS essay (7/10): As for my Common App Personal Statement Essay, I started on December 16th (one day after my birthday LOL). I tried being different and writing about an inanimate object I've had since I was young. I wrote about this and basically mixed in one of my strongest UC Essays from above into one really well-written essay. I think it was an alright essay but now looking back on it, it wasn't that well-written LOL. I didn't have a winter break and I remember editing one of my supplemental essays like 10 minutes before New Years LOL. I had like 20 supplemental essays to write and I think some of them were really well-written and insightful, while some were written as if it was written last-minute (because it was). But I really liked my community essay, at that point, it was really polished and well-written so I had that as my basis for all the community supplemental essays.  For my common app personal statement and supplemental essays, i spent upwards of $600 for online college essay editing services, which was absolutely not worth it because I feel like i could just relied on my personal feedback and not others. However, I did spend all my winter break applying to like 16 private schools, including writing the supplemental essays and common app personal statement that winter break.  The topic of my PS statement was more of a grit story and what I learned after working with my mom a lot with house cleaning and how it has changed my outlook on life.

Additional Information: Although I only got I would get into mid-tier schools like UC Irvine or something, I am really happy about my results! Despite being rejected from almost all the private schools besides Vanderbilt and Pepperdine, I really did like how Vanderbilt chose me. It was a super difficult decision picking between Vanderbilt CS (intention to switch to college of engineering) and Berkeley Data Science, I ultimately chose Berkeley because of how prestigious it was for the technology sector and how close it was from home (around 2 hour drive). Although Vanderbilt truly did appeal to me with its student social life scene, academic and social life balance, good food, new location, happy student body, and rigorous academics, it was a bit too far from home. However, although I only got into 7 out of 27 colleges I applied for, I am happy that top universities did pick me and that I was able to choose from such excellent universities. Cal is where my next four years will be! Now, that's only if UCLA doesn't get me off their waitlist, but even then I might still choose Cal if I get off the waitlist. go bears!"

I never thought I would ever get into this field because I didn’t want to get a masters despite me being interested in both Data Science and AI. Was honestly surprised that I landed this position and I’m really excited but I’m just worried that it won’t necessarily lead anywhere. Obviously there’s the possibility of a return offer but idk if I would accept one because of the location. Anyways I guess what I’m asking is can I really learn this field on the job? I hope so because I know nothing about AI or Data Science

The position I was offered to interview in actually seems like an amazing fit for me, and working at Tesla in this role would actually be a dream come true.   


The issue is however I'd have to take a leave of absence from school to move out to California. I'm pretty sure that if I take classes this summer, and next summer, and if I really need to the summer after that, I should still be able to graduate in 4 years, but I'm conflicted over if it's worth missing a whole semester of school and putting myself slightly behind.  I'd also be leaving behind clubs, friends, and other obligations, and I was also considering doing study abroad my spring semester so I would basically be off-campus for a whole year which is scary to think about.  


On the other hand I don't want to let this opportunity pass, or turn down an offer (if I somehow get one) and possibly put myself in jeopardy for getting another offer at Tesla.  


Was curious if anyone here had any insight on this, or have also taken off semesters to take an internship."

13ugt98,9,2023-05-28,[IWantOut] 34F Inventory Manager US -> France,Dulcette,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/13ugt98/iwantout_34f_inventory_manager_us_france/,"Let me start by saying since I started french classes 2004 in high school, I wanted to move to Marseilles. Studying the language, culture, history always fascinated me. I studied French again University taking 2 years' worth of classes but not majoring in it. Thanks to life and being a broke student or teacher for majority of it, I only just visited Marseilles and Paris for the first time this April for my birthday. It was great. Spoke to a few locals and stayed outside of the major tourist areas though did go sightseeing and take fun tours. 

I started doing research and planning for leaving in the next 5 years. I've always hated how America operates since I was a teen and the last couple of months a fire has been lit under my butt and I'm looking for a quicker way to get out. I was first going to get a remote data job, gain some experience, and move through employment. I think that would take too long. 

So I'm considering MFA programs in Sound Design. I was going to do one in America eventually but now I'm just like screw it. Do it overseas and stay there. The one that sounds closest to what I want is in Nice. Not as close to Marseille as I'd like but the program looks great! I'd like to add it's just me, a Black woman. No kids or relatives. A couple close friendships that I hope will visit me when I'm gone and a cat. I want to leave and never come back. Maybe for short visits.

After reading posts/comments on this sub I'm worried about being denied for lack of integration. Thanks to this sub I learned that sure after the mfa I can apply for a cdi and then permanent residency. But I'm still worried about being denied. Here's why:

1) The program is taught in English. I'm at B1 level right now though while I was visiting I was shy to speak with native French speakers and only really let loose when I was drinking with people I'd met. In Marseille especially people were super fast talkers. Whereas in Paris I felt like I had an easier time understanding. I definitely plan on getting better now while I plan for the big move. I also want to take tutoring lessons from native French speakers after the move.

2) My studies that I want to pursue are in sound design and so that's the employment industry I want to be in. Is that industry hard to break into? It's hard in America and I know I'd have to network my butt off. I'm just wondering if being in a masters program and needing to find internships would be impossible. I hear about French elitism both on this sub and also while I was there a couple people told me about it. Is it possible to get a CDI for working in a recording studio or video game studio doing audio work?

3) Right now, I work full time as an inventory manager which probably isn't in high demand for foreign employees and so I wonder about part time work while I'm there in school. Would part time work be enough to show I've integrated? Will it be hard to come by or even do as a foreigner still getting comfortable with the language? I've also spent about 6 years as a teacher and have worked a couple years as an audio engineer, too. Not science engineering but like recording studio audio engineer.

4) I have a misdemeanor from 2008 for stealing candy. It was so dumb of me. It's the only time I've ever gotten in trouble with the law and I still feel dumb about it.

5) If everything works as planned. I graduate with my mfa. I get a cdi for permanent employment and it's been 4 or 5 years. My level is up to C1, but I still get denied do I have to leave right away? Can I stay longer and re-apply? I really don't want to have to move back considering all of the scrimping, saving, and sacrifices I'll have to make to go in the first place.

I'm wondering if I should just consider an English speaking country in Europe so that I'm at least close to France and can visit often. But also, I'd consider a non-EU country and another language to learn. Just don't know which as all my life France has been on my mind. Thanks so much for reading!"

I've always been fascinated by technology, since my childhood. But somehow I'm still more inclined towards chemicals and stuff. I guess that's what made me choose chemical engineering back in 2015, when CSE was at its peak.
 

I somehow never studied for exams, even before exam days! But, somehow i passed just by mugging up some interesting concepts i randomly visited on YouTube. I'm more of a visual learner than thereotical.
 

I was even lucky that I'm one of the only guys who placed in the chemical industry with a very good package, even though i had less than 60% in my bachelor's (I'm so lucky).
 

I immediately got something to work on! My curiosity multiplied when i saw the practical application of my theory, and I'm now reading a lot of theory just to completely understand the practical applications happening around my workplace. I was a management trainee in my first year. I was treated like some of the biggest bosses from the first day, just because i had an engineering degree and all others were from lower cadre. I really felt sorry for them that a 10 year old experienced guy was reporting to me daily status and calling me SIR!
 

I somehow got along with them, made them close, and learned a lot from their practical exposure. I had a super supportive manager after my management training period was completed. God! Those days were heaven.
 

I worked relentlessly for a year and a half, made some real progress both personally and professionally. has a very good reputation. Got good raises.
 

But...but.. i still felt something was missing. I don't know what it is, but something was missing. It made me explore more, and then this happened. I used to work on Excel a lot and deal with huge amounts of reporting and data. I searched for beautiful presentations, handling big data online, and that's when i stumbled upon SQL and Tableau. My curiosity multiplied, so I took a Google-certified data analyst Coursera course. although it wasn't serious in the initial days.
 

I thought of doing a master's, but dumb me immediately resigned, stating I'd go to a master's! I applied to universities and got rejected, and something came financially as well. So I dropped the thought of masters.
 

For the first time, i was empty in my mind, with no reasonable work to do and no goal. I somehow thought of completing the course. It took me 3 months to complete the certification. I learned a bit about everything, making me much more curious. I applied for all positions randomly with a resume that had my chemical experience and a career gap and stated that I'm doing a course and want to switch. I used to cold DM on LinkedIn as well. I found similar people in my situation. Also, i stumbled upon the CEO of a small startup.
 

He offered me an intern position and told me to prove my curiosity in learning by giving me 6 months of time to learn full stack, with almost negligible guidance , but time and money. I was paid 15 K all through my training and randomly tracked my progress.
 

I somehow learned a bit of everything in full stack, jumped right in with their product development team, and understood their product with zero KT. Worked hard with development, even as an intern. 
 

I finally got confirmed, and i was offered 25K a month. I'm glad as I'm now completely absorbed into the team, although it's small less than 20 to be precise. I developed some cool features (may be basic for them, but cool from my POV). Fixed some bugs.
 

Although, I'm still struggling with proper communication of deadlines as i dive deep into code, i get lost checking every bit of it and losing time. I'm improving at it. 
 

I've been lurking in this subreddit for a long time, and recently, with current market conditions, I've seen a lot of freshers feeling disheartened with all their efforts going in vain. I wanted to share my small personal win with everyone out there, so that if i could do it, you guys could do it as well.
 

Just be curious, and everything will eventually fall in your favour!
 
Keep coding ✌️❤️

TLDR: a chemical engineering background guy, somehow learnt some basic tech, started being curious, made into tech by casually DM someone online and applying to all positions he got in his vicinity. Somehow self taught himself to be finally approved as a developer by the industry."

So I applied for master's in the fall cycle. I secured 1 admit from **Binghamton University**. I am an **international applicant**.

Background: I am working as a full-stack developer for the past 2.5 years but during my MS I am planning **to take courses directed towards AI/ML**. I have some basic info about AI/ML and have taken some courses about ML **but my profile is still weak**. 

From my research, I came to know that we have to start applying for internships from Sep-Oct. This means I have to apply for internships as soon as I start my MS. Hence it is technically impossible for me to have a strong CV during my internship phase.

**I was thinking if I go for spring intake instead of fall intake**, then I would have much time as I will get a summer break too to self-taught myself and make a strong profile for AI/ML. 

I would like to know what you guys think about this. Your opinion would be greatly appreciated."

I started my IT journey in Junior year of HS (2019). At the time i didn't know what csreer i wanted to be in. I went to a Tech campus that my HS was in partners with. I originally wanted to do Video Game Design because i loved video games. But my brother said if i even liked coding because thats what ima do. My brother is in the IT field as a network administrator and he suggested to take the CSS class. And from there i went through 2 years of tech campus and i wanted to be in the field. The 1st year class was introduction to the A+ Certification. 

I knew about the CompTIA certs but I didn't see a need to really push myself to get them at that moment because I was barely starting college and I was just taking a relaxing route. And i didn't realize the importance they hold for someone like me. I applied for an internship in summer of last year and I was declined because I didn't have the A+ Certification. I did have a letter of recommendation from my Tech campus and college certifications that I thought was good enough for being a first year in college but it wasn't. So with that rejection I took the time to really want to get into the field because I wanted a good job in IT and to gain experience for a career I wanted

Started studying for the core 1 of the A+ in August. My brother suggested me some material which mainly was professor Messer and the exam cram book, so I used those, and I studied them constantly. I already had some knowledge due to Tech Csmpus and college classes. But the core 1 exam was still hard for me due to the stress of what if I fail and have to pay for the exam again. But after studying for the entire month of August I eventually took my exam and passed. It felt really good to achieve this but then it's like we'll ok I did it but I still got to do it again to actually get certified which demotivated me a little. But by the time I finished core 1 I was already a week into the college semester. And i had to focus on classes. So i tried to study for core 2 throughout the months but i never got to really put energy to it. During the end of november i finally decided to wantng to get the Core 2 done by the end of the year as a christmas present to myself. I studied and studied. And it was mid december when i was feeling close to being done but i had some personal things happen between me and i feel in a bit of a depression. Took time off from studying and after feeling better it was january. I pushed myself to pass this exam and during mid january i passed the core 2 exam and was officially A+ certified. This was a big thing for me because I passed through the biggest gate into being able to be a part of the field that I wanted to work in

I tried to apply for jobs immediately but I wasn't sure of the jobs that I found because most of the time they required full time or in the morning. But I couldn't cause I didn't think I was ready for a full time job yet and most of my classes were in the morning so I just decided to forget a IT job until I finished the semester and then I could choose classes in the afternoon.

I tried to immediately jump to the Network+ after finishing Core 2 but I was burnt out. I wanted until April to start slowly. I used Exam cram, professor Messer, and Dion course and exams. I started mainly to push myself to focus on the exam during March since it was my birthday month and I wanted to push myself further. During this time my brother kept asking me if I wanted to work with him at his job to gain experience and stuff. But the job required me to get the network+ certificate first. So I was like ok I'll think about it. After a lot of studying I took my exam in Mid April and passed. The network+ was really hard for me due to not being familiar with the material. But I did it. I applied for the Networking job my brother wanted me to apply for, went to the interview, and got the job.

I'm really happy with the progress I made so far at only 20 years old. I'm a network assistant and I get to work with my brother. It's a full time job and it pays 27.40 an hour due to my college credits. I'm so happy to where I want to be in my life for my career. Don't bring yourself down if you can't find a job or feel like your are not going to pass an exam. Take deep breathes and you'll make it through. I start my new job soon. I've been struggling to gain the motivation to start the security+ Certification because it feels like I reached my major goal of getting a good job in IT and even though I want to get the trifecta. Im just kinda pooped out rn due to a lot of things happening in my life and just not knowing how to gain the motivation atm to study for the security+ exam and pass it. I will get to it eventually because I don't want to stop going up the ladder.

Buts that's my journey through IT so far. It's nice to see how this community helped me. It's been a while since I have actually been in any IT related discussions. Gonna try to take it easy for a bit till I get that motivation going but thanks for everything guys"

At Carleton I would be completing 3-4 co-op placements over the course of my degree, each about four months long.  
  
At Queen's, I would be completing a year-long internship between my third and fourth year.  This would make my degree end up taking 5 years.  I'd also want to find my own internships over the summer, though I know that might be difficult.

My question is: would i be taking 189 too late to find a lab to be a part of? For those who found ml research advisors for grad school, when did you take 189 and when did you start conducting research?

Btw i do have a ml comp bio internship at a local uni under my belt, and will send cold emails/urap as a soph, but Im not confident that profs would give me a chance without a solid grade in 189. Does my reasoning hold true? (btw is A- good enough? Not shooting for BAIR here)

I think it's kind of obvious I'm not that interested in taking PPS in uni since i didn't even indicate it in my application at all.

I have asked the admissions office about this but all they said was to accept the offer and send in an appeal. The thing is that I'm not sure what to include since all the appeals I've found online were appeals against rejection, not for the situation I'm in. Please send help 😭😭😭 I don't want to just accept the offer for the sake of accepting it and cause another person who genuinely loves the major to not get it because I'm taking up a spot 😫😫

- My RP is higher than the listed IGP for SMU Biz and I've won a few academic awards in sec school + JC.
- I have 7 internship experiences spread across large SG companies and law firms across different departments (finance, HR, marketing, e-commerce, etc) and will be starting a new one this week.
- I've won a handful of awards in debate competitions and MUN, and was a vice-house cap in SC (I doubt this last piece will be useful though)

I recently got laid off by my employer, and time is not on my side. Unfortunately, I didn't manage my time efficiently in the beginning, and ended up burning through* a couple of weeks in wrapping up administrative formalities, securing insurance, and exploring options to pause the clock (to no avail). Now, I only have around 40 days left before I lose my immigration status.

I'm urgently looking for opportunities as an Applied/Data/Research Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher, or related roles that require a Master's degree plus two to three years of experience. I hold a Master's degree from a prestigious MSDS program and have gained a diverse range of internship and work experiences, including at academic and tech R&D labs, non-profits, and early-stage startups. Over the past seven years, I have focused on Al/CV/DL/DS/ML/NLP, with all my coursework, projects, publications, and work experience aligned with these domains. However, I lack full-time work experience with a recognizable brand on my resume.

  
While I have a preference for the aforementioned roles, I am also open to positions like Business Analyst and Data Analyst/Engineer. I have confidence in my abilities to excel in rigorous interview loops, having performed well in the past (even though I declined the offers). However, given the time constraints, waiting for callbacks is not a luxury I can afford, especially considering that interview processes themselves can take up to a month.

  
Considering my situation, I understand the need to be flexible, but I'm trying to hold out a little longer without compromising on more than one of the following:

* Relocating
* Taking a pay cut
* Technical rigor (specifically in ML/Stats)

  
However, I’m well aware of my circumstances, and am no more than a week or so out on loosening my standards further. I have, also, thus far focused on quality rather than quantity in my job applications. By that I mean I tailor my resume specific to each role’s job description and strive to obtain referrals from my network to establish direct contact with hiring managers or recruiters. Alternatively, when applying through LinkedIn, I reach out to them directly to ensure greater likelihood of my resume being looked at by a pair of eyes, and general prompt attention to and review of my application. But I'm unsure if this approach is the most effective, and I'm considering shifting gears to mass cold applications using a generic resume (I have some strategies and scripts to assist me with that).

I would greatly appreciate any advice, thoughts, or insights that can assist me in my endeavor. Additionally, I would be grateful if you could spare some time to provide feedback on my base resume (please comment if you're so willing and I'll reach out to you via DM). 

Thank you all for your support and guidance!"

I never even thought about it until I started exploring CS subreddits, since IS fits my interests so much better, I love my classes and my advisor, and I’m finally making good progress towards finishing my degree after a tumultuous last few years in an engineering major I didn’t want to be in. I can’t narrow down my interests at all between design and SWE and it seemed like this major is a good place to be for interdisciplinary pursuits and flexibility. I assumed I’d only need to work on projects and work on my leetcode skills. But hiring managers on SWE and resume subreddits keep saying that non-CS majors are filtered out of the hiring pool with the press of a button before they ever even get to interview, that companies won’t take chances on non-CS SWEs, that if I want to be a SWE I have to be a CS major or else be forced to get a CS master’s or postbacc, that InfoSci is seen as a CS dropout major, and that companies won’t spend the time and energy vetting people they could simply not consider for having the wrong degree. I feel really broken and lost after weeks of reading all this. I don’t think I’ll be able to choose between SWE or design before the time comes for my last opportunities to change majors and/or get an internship, as I am a rising junior now. Switching into CS would mean changing my Fall semester to accommodate 2800, 3410, taking Math 1120 for no credits because I got a D in 1910, taking a foreign language, and more. It would mean losing my advisor and degree progress and not having the room to take classes in design or psychology or elsewhere again. I don’t know what to do and I am lost and in crisis. And I just don’t want to be in CS since SWE was originally this backup plan that I now feel immense pressure to funnel into a precisely defined tech job within and give up on everything else, due to the weight of loans and fear of being unemployable. I really need advise from IS grads and CS grads and people who know what it’s like after university here"

Many of my buddies are married, have houses, kids, stable jobs, etc. However for me, I feel like I’m years behind them. I’ve been working at the local grocery store for over 6 years to help me pay for my college classes and I’m still there. While I don’t necessarily hate it, seeing a lot of my old coworkers moving on while I’m stuck there is getting to me and my mental integrity. I am so happy for my friends to have a successful life but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t envious. Constantly being told “Oh, you’ll find something, just keep on applying” has become a phrase I just dread hearing nowadays because of how long I’ve been trying to find a job out of college. I don’t have funds to move across the country and relocate, and I prefer to not relocate in general since all of my family is still around this area and they are my support system. I honestly wouldn’t be where I am without them.

I graduated in May 2021 with a BS in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity with fairly good grades but I haven’t been able to land any IT jobs for two years now due to experience. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get any internships in my area due to graduating during the Covid pandemic, so I wasn’t able to gain any in-office/in-person experience before graduation. I’ve been applying to anything I could find in my general area, and had a decent amount of interviews, but constantly being told I’m the “#2 choice” in many job decisions and not landing the job is getting soul crushing. I did, however, land a remote customer service job at a local company a few months ago but I ultimately decided to leave it because it wasn’t a fit for me. I was having trouble sleeping and was constantly worrying about my performance due to lack of supervision and training. I know I should’ve stuck it out for experience but I really just couldn’t do it… I know this probably hurts my chances even more to secure an actual IT job but I stand by my decision.

I’m beginning to think “my purpose” isn’t actually IT at this rate but I have no idea what other jobs I should even try applying for. I really love the hands on, security, and troubleshooting aspect of IT because it’s why I went to college in the first place. However, I dislike customer service and want to just work on something without much interactions. Remote jobs are competitive and hard to come by as it is. Should I just “keep on applying” to the ocean of applications or pivot to a different field that would give an IT degree a chance?"

Work vice im not learning much mostly left to my own devices and just given tasks to do.  I work full-time and my contract goes for 16 months 

I genuinely don't think it's worth it when there's no sick days or vacation days given or insurance seems like a waste of time

Especially when I have previous internship experience

Edit: this is my 3rd internship I did two already"
13ux2bx,199,2023-05-29,New Grad Quant Trader AMA,AnonyQuantTraderAMA,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/13ux2bx/new_grad_quant_trader_ama/,"Hey everyone, I remember 2 years ago I was looking for info on how to get into quant trading/finance and there were very few resources on reddit. Since then I've interned as a trader for one big prop shop/MM/Hedge fund and been hired as a full-time trader out of college for another. Been at my current job for almost 1 year now, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you all have about recruiting, interviews, or the job itself (which isn't talked about enough in my opinion). We can also talk about the differences between quant traders and quants as well as between companies (broadly, like what is the difference between a hedge fund and a market maker)

About me:Went to a non-target school, graduated w/ a math degree and a 4.0, never did any math competitions in high school or college. My resume was incredibly barren (and poorly constructed) when I landed my first internship (no prior projects/career fairs/trading competitions etc), basically just my major, GPA, my schoolwork, and my interests. My only hobby was/is gaming (both videogames and tabletop games)

Rules:I'll answer anything that doesn't give away specifics of where I have worked / am working or my own identity. As such I won't be able to give specific details about any company (i.e XYZs company culture is a lot more toxic than ABCs)

Good luck everyone! I plan to do this again around recruiting season if there's interest.

Edit: If you’re looking this up a long time after it has been posted, I should still reply! I plan to be active indefinitely"

I did an internship last year (during my PhD) that yielded two publications. Both works are relevant to my PhD research however I did not include my PhD advisor as a co-author in one of them (the paper was published with co-authors from the internship only). I'd like to include both papers as chapters in my thesis because they are building blocks of the thesis idea.

Is it strange to include work that was during a summer internship? Appreciative of any advice!"

Today (on Memorial Day) I got a citation on my way to work in Ohio. I am out of state and live in Nebraska and I am in Ohio because I'm doing an internship at a hospital. I've been driving consistently for about 2 years and have never been pulled over for any reason until today. I was driving on highway 35 taking the exit 42 to get onto i 675 to get to Soin Medical Center. 

The officer got me at 74 in a 55 with radar. He told me that I didn't have to go to court and that I could go to this website, but I asked him what if I wanted to do traffic school and he said then I would need to show up to court.

My question is, should I show up to court and ask the judge to hopefully give me some mercy? Or will I unfortunately need to take the hit on this ticket and take the points on my license? Honestly, what should I do? This especially hurts because both of my parents have impeccable driving records and haven't had a ticket in years. 

Thanks for the help!"

Be as harsh as you want I guarantee you’re only mirroring my thoughts

Demographics: Female, mixed (Asian/White), PNW, EXTREMELY competitive feeder private school, like I’m talking 20% of each class goes to Ivies/MIT/Stanford and we have the children of recognizable CEOs, I’m not rich, more like upper middle class

Hooks: I am a rower (would probably be a good D3 athlete and that’s something I’m considering)

Intended Major(s): Econ, any form of Engineering, or Poli Sci

ACT/SAT: have yet to take (im a rising junior) but 1480 on the PSAT 11 as a 10th grader if that helps forecast

UW/W GPA: UW 3.94/4 school doesn’t weight GPAs but I take the most advanced course 

Coursework: hardest possible classes & I am accelerated, do most of my classes w a grade above me 

Awards: finalist in multiple local flute competitions, multiple MUN awards, worlds for vex robotics (🤞 place at state this year?)

* Trivia Team Captain

* Rower on the Crew team
* Pit Orchestra member for musical 2x

* Flute 8y— finalist in a lot of competitions where I live
* Climate internship at nearby university, decent prestige
* VEX Robotics
* Game development/programming— have led multiple groups to do this for fun idk if it’s an extracurricular but it’s a club 
* Volunteering at multiple food service nonprofits 

Essays/LORs: both 9-10/10, gonna ask my English teacher math teacher & coach, should talk a lot about how I’m very hyper (lol) but super enthusiastic about learning and participating + essay has gotta be good I’ve been using all my free time to write since elementary for fun 

Colleges-

Reach: Wellesley, Columbia, MIT (eww, but my mom wants me to go), Yale, Williams, Northwestern, Pomona, Barnard

Target: UW, any of the other UCs, Wesleyan, taking suggestions??

Safety: idk… CSU Fullerton, Cal Poly, WSU?

Personally I can’t help but feel that my application is pretty mid, given that it feels like everyone around me has been gearing their ec’s for college whereas I just do whatever interests me so there’s no unified story. But I also just don’t really know what colleges are looking for & would appreciate help to clarify my expectations."

I currently don’t have any projects and was wondering what I need in that department. How many projects? What type of projects should I make? Do they need to be unique? What skills should I show? 

Also, besides projects what other things should I be doing to secure that first internship?

I graduated early May with a Computer Science: Cybersecurity and Secure Software Development bachelors degree. And I just recently got on offer for a junior/associate level software engineer. I also have a year and a half of experience as a software engineering intern which apparently means nothing no a days, also the company I interned for didn't have any entry level openings for me unfortunately.

I started applying late January / early February but started to apply heavily (atleast 5 applications a day) sometime in March and took a few breaks from burnout and getting far in the first group of interviews. I mostly applied to software engineering roles but a few cybersecurity roles however most I wanted to apply for aren't entry level, even though with my degree and Certs I am well qualified for but since they weren't entry level I only got automated rejection emails.

I applied to about 200ish places directly, only 4 got back to me, 1 ghosted me, 1 denied me, 1 I'm waiting to hear from (been about 2 weeks), and 1 gave me an offer that I just accepted because I couldn't wait any longer to hear from the other. The rest were mostly the automated emails of rejection or I was ghosted, I'd say a out 30-40 automated rejection emails, and the rest I have been ghosted.

The job offer is decent, fully in person (nothing wanted a fully remote junior, and need to stay in my hometown for atleast a year and nothing jn my area was hybrid so biggie sadge) 70k/year, 2 weeks pto, 10 holidays, 401k isn't the greatest but I couldn't find anything and a job is better then no job. Plus I still get to live with my parents to save for a year then I'll move to a bigger city with better opportunities... and hopefully the economy is better for us. But I'm glad the search is finally over and I have a job. Time to learn, get experience, and hopefully grow from here."

If no one else does come forward they will have to disband the club and I really don't want this happening. Though I'm not sure if I should step up. I'm not great with public speaking and with being a first year I'm still learning how everything works. I'm afraid that I wouldn't be up to the task.

Now, I’m admittedly reluctant to disclose the country that I have in mind because I know it’s a bit controversial so, before I do, please do try to keep an open mind.

Ok, brace yourselves: I’d like to study abroad in DPRK.

Now, I know what y’all are thinking: “Has she gone mad???” “Is this another shitpost??” “Why do I feel wet down there whenever I see Oski????”

In response to the first two questions, I’d like to say that, no, I have not gone mad and, no, this is 100% unironic. As for the the third question, same lmaoo.

Anyways, before you all advise me on whether or not studying abroad in the DPRK is a good idea, I’ll first give the myriad of reasons why I am interested in studying in the DPRK:

1.) The quality of life: I’m under the impression that the quality of life in North Korea is luxurious and unparalleled because, when I asked my friend what it was like to live there, he said, “I can’t complain!” Incidentally, I never heard from him again. :/



2.) Plenty of [amazing internship and employment opportunities to develop an outstanding work ethic!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwalliso) The best part is that Glorious Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un’s magnanimous three generations law GUARANTEES that my children and grandchildren will have a place of employment and they’ll have work ethic instilled in them from a young age!



3.) I really like anime ☺️💅🏻 and I really wanna marry a hot K-Pop dude 🥵😍



4.) I think it’s really cool and courageous that DPRK is the only country in the world that has the guts to wage war against Poseidon! And judging by the fact that DPRK has never been hit by a tsunami but that they’ve successfully hit the ocean with multiple ballistic missiles, I think DPRK is winning the war! 🚀🚀🚀

5.) [Opportunities to improve my programming skills! :)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group)

So then, what do you think r/Berkeley ?

Should I study abroad in DPRK?!?!

Majority of my friends are starting their internships this summer, meanwhile i got rejected from companies tens of times but i dont blame them. I have no side projects to add my resume or i have no knowledge about any frameworks-libraries-databases that will actually be useful in the sector. 

  
I am really confused in which area i want to work at. Lets say do i want backend development or mobile development or data science? I have no idea. For example, last summer i learned Pygame and made Flappy Bird clone, i actually enjoyed the process but when i did some more research about the gaming sector, i dropped out that idea. Couple of months ago i learned html and css to see if i fit for frontend, i made google main page clone and i did not enjoy the process one bit.  Lastly, last week i learned some web scraping with bs4 but i dont know why learned these stuff, you can say i just went with the flow of the water. I dont want to learn the tech stack just to figure it out that i dont like that area.

  
At the moment i am in a dilemma, Do i want to learn Django-.NET-JS-mysql-mongo for Backend or should i learn kotlin-flutter for mobile development? Do i even want to do backend or mobile? i dont know."

I recently committed to UCSD, but I'm starting to worry about my major choice (Data Science atm).

Some people have told me that the major will seriously hurt my chances for internships in the future, while others tell me companies don't care as long as it's close to CS and you have the skills (just fyi, switching into CS is impossible)

&#x200B;

Here are some important points about each major:

**Data Science:**

* Capped major (easier to get into classes)
* Heard that the data sci institute is really good (ik rankings aren't super important, but UCSD is t10 in data science by US news)
* There's a mandatory senior capstone project which is apparently like a research internship with a real company

**Math-CS:**

* Computer Science is in the name (heard this is useful for bots that scan resumes?)
* Math-CS would allow me to pursue both swe and data science if I wanted to
* shorter major (more time for projects/internships)
* It is tough to get into CS classes, though I've heard that this may only push you back a quarter or two (the major is already short so doesn't matter). Additionally, I have junior-level standing rn so it will be super easy to finish the major on time

Here are the courses/series I'd have to take (doesn't include classes I have AP/transfer credit for):

**Data Science:**

* Intro to DS
* Principles of DS
* Programming and Basic Data Structures for DS
* DS&A for DS
* Theoretical Foundations for DS
* Practice and Application of DS
* Subject Domain Track (options: econ, ai, sci, soc sci)
* Stats courses in the math department
* Data Management
* Systems and Infrastructure for Scalable Analytics
* Data visualization
* ML
* Data Mining
* Research capstone
* 5 electives

**Math-CS:**

* Vector Calculus
* Intro to CS
* Software Tools and Techniques
* Computer Organization and Systems Programming
* Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design
* Mathematical Reasoning
* Modern Applied Algebra
* Theory of Computability
* Computer Implementations of Data Structures
* Intro to Probability
* Discrete Math
* Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* Major electives (2 applied math, 2 computational, 2 general math-cs)

Career-wise, I'm interested in both swe and data science. I've tried out both during hs, and there are aspects of both that are interesting to me.

Should I switch over to Math-CS? Or should I stay in the capped major (Data Science) with more support/resources?"

I live with my mom, grandma and my mother, my dad died when I was 13 in August, I have a working mother and a now properly working aunt who is going for masters this year

It was back in 2019, (yea lol I'm a child), it was mid may and my school had it's halfyearly exams, where everything from the past 6 months is on the tests and it was around this time that my Aunt got her first internship, she's 14 years older than me and is one of my legal guardians. 

The exams were spread out in a span of 2 weeks with 11 exams, most of my exams beforehand were with horrid marks so I wanted to study properly and try to get better this time, but my Aunt didn't think so

She would always scold me (rightfully so) because I didn't study but this time she didn't give me a chance to prove myself, because of her internship she would leave very early and come home at 7/8 and be very stressed out, I'd always open the door because my mom comes home at 11 and my grandma sleeps early 

One thing I now realise is that when she gets stressed, she gets a very short fuse, for days on end, I'd wake-up early, study for hours and would open the door to her coming home, but no matter how much I studied, no matter how much I worked hard for it, she always ALWAYS yelled at me for ""Why aren't you studying?!"",""Why did you open the door so fast!"",""Why don't you show me what you written?! No not this this is probably old"" and things like that.

But one day she ended it with ""Well, if you're not gonna study, do you want to take a break from school?!?"", I went to my room to study but then I fell apart, I couldn't stop crying, I had a hard time breathing.

I then found the sharpest knife in the kitchen and went to the bathroom to try and cut open my vein on my neck for a painless death, the knife fell from my hand as I looked into the mirror and I fell apart, then I collected myself and went into my aunt's room to ask for a break, she didn't understand but the moment she realised what I meant I almost fell apart again and ran into my room, I ran past my mom who came home from a long day at work and I couldn't look at her but I could tell, she was scared, furious and extremely sad.

I cried so much that I genuinely couldn't breath for a few seconds, my mom tried to comfort me but she left the room and screamed at my aunt who then apologised to her for pushing me to this state.

After that day everytime I tried to bring up that situation (minus the suicide attempt, no one knows that), she would scold me for bringing it up, saying things like ""You keep bringing it up again and again, try to complain about something else for once"", I only ever brought it up 3 times, once at the hospital after I fainted mid class and fell on the floor and the other times before the next big exams.

Everytime I would cry after she scolded me, she'd say ""Stop crying, you're overreacting"",""You'll never survive in the real world"" and ""Stop crying, you're making me feel like the villian"", even though I was bare a teenager and it stayed till I was 14

She's a good person, she had been saving up her money to buy me a PS4, this will come up later 

Since 2017, my mom and dad had bee arguing and fighting, ALOT, this led to my dad's poor mental stability and health to turn to being abusive, and instead of people trying to stop him, they shunned him out, which just added to his poor mental health, however, no matter how bad his health got, he ALWAYS avoided showing it Infront of me, I was scared of my dad, not because he was unstable, because I was scared of being too emotional and and turning out like him

When he died in August of 2019, his birth month, my aunt took me out and bought me the PS4 the same day, the following month all I would do is play videogames and miss a few classes and tests, that's because I was depressed and lost my dad, my aunt didn't realise that (even though her dad also died when she was 13).

She blamed my PS4 for my worsening grades and missed classes, even when I told her why I missed classes, she didn't really care and probably thought I was making excuses, everytime I tried to open up to her it was used as fuel for the next time she scolds me.

By the time I was 14, I realised that if I didn't cry... I wouldn't get yelled at for crying (genius), so I tried it the next time she yelled at me, it just stopped there, it didn't extend to an extra 15 minutes of yelling, I haven't properly cried ever since and my eyes hurt when I even slightly cry now.

I can't even tell my mom because she's a very overprotective mother who would verbally beat my aunt to a bloody pulp, and everytime I did try and tell her my aunt would just scodl me again

By the end of 2020, I found healthier coping mechanisms, things like using humor, drawing, just getting lost in thought, finding catharsis in characters like Guts, Peter Parker, Clark Kent, Barry Allen, Luffy, Thorfinn and so much more

The only living being to know how I really feel... Is my cat, she sees me cry and comes up to me and lays on my lap while meowing loudly, but he's getting old and I'm scared of losing her, no I'm terrified.

My aunt is still just as bad but I am trying to be stronger now, since my IGCSE exams are here I have to be stronger, I forced myself to try and grow up when I was 14 and my friends even realised that I never really changed after 2020.

My aunt is an amazing human being, she raised me like a 3rd mother, the 2nd being my grandmother, I love my aunt, she just has very low empathy, and that's not her fault.

I promised myself to not be like her and be the kindest, and the most gentle human being I can ever possibly become and I'm well on my on that yellow brick road.

I've applied for one job offer, in an IT position (R&D), and I'm really excited to hopefully get hired.
 I want this job so badly because it's like an Amazon plant, where I would have lots of coworkers and it would let me socialize and be more independent. 
In addition, they offer training and the option to travel to test the programs in the clients country. Due to the training, I guess I'd be a calmer workplace, which is what I'm looking for.

I applied like 3 weeks ago and last week the recruiter told me they'll inform me if I keep on the selection process. 

I'm desperate to know if I'm selected or not, but I don't know if it's good to ask them how the process is, just after one week from the last contact. Even though I'm, I don't want to sound desperate to this company.


I'd gladly appreciate receiving advice from someone who had been in my shoes.

Thank you.

I dropped out after freshman year to take a shot at tech sales and I got a job at 19 in one of the largest companies earning about 70k a year.

Now at 21 I'm starting to feel like I don't like this field and want to go back. Rn I have about 60 credits and going back to college means I will approx graduate at 23.

In sales I can earn about 200k without a degree but sometimes I feel like I can be making 300k or more if I stick to CS.

I just wanted your help deciding and was just wondering if you can provide me with some comfort on these 2 points:

1. If I graduate at 23 will I be perceived as old among junior developers? I might get a job at 24 since I won't have any internships in this market.

2. How realistic is it for me to be making 300k + in CS after about 5 years experience? Is the switch from sales to CS worth it?"

I heard you need to be really bad to not get a return offer, and this makes me self reflect. 

I had two internships at this firm so far, so they gave me a return offer once, but I remember it was because I was lucky and got a team with my friend, so it left a better impression on the managers. But my second internship they didnt give me one, I didnt know anyone there, and had a death in my family, and my childhood friend I used to hang out with a lot passed aswell, and I lived all alone. So combination of these I was really depressed and didn’t bother talking or socializing. Which is probably why they didn’t give me a return offer, and I understand that. I also didn’t fight for one because I was too tired to motivate myself to do that.

Now pass forward a year later, I really regret not focusing on making friends at work, and I have a hard time finding another internship that I would like. I got really lucky with my old firm bcz I was in a good mood when I did the interview.

I tried for other big 4s, and they didn’t even give me an interview despite me having another big 4 on my resume. It kind of worries me as I want a FT there when I graduate. I think I may be blacklisted from the old big4 firm though so I didnt bother reapplying to the one that I worked at previously. In addition, I did a few finance interviews: high finance was really bad (they asked me about random current events i do not know), and the normal finance jobs were alright, but I flunked it (they havent rejected me yet, but I know I didnt do well).

I’m worried I lost my chance as I messed up the job I wanted to work at, and now my job search isn’t going so well for me.

Wondering if it’s possible to go back to my old company at big 4, try again for new ones at big 4, or give up on big 4 and do finance.

Also wondering if someone could give me tips on how to get into other big 4 firms and pass the hireview interview session, or if anyone is available to offer me career advice/mock interviews I’d greatly appreciate!"

I (23M) am an engineer and I do my job well.

I left that company after my college internship because I hated nonstop desk work. My current job has some desk work, but I get outside about 25% of my work week. Even though this field work has been great, it’s still not really satiating my desire for something more exciting. I see dangerous jobs like those in the military, navy, on cargo and fishing ships, tour guides in dangerous places, etc and get envious. I know the risk and stress is large, but I would love the adventure. My hobbies are running and mountain biking, I love being on the move. There are parts of a mundane life that I know have major benefits. I have a girlfriend that I’m pretty serious with, she’s an engineer too. Neither of us are big fans of engineering but excel in the field. She would definitely not have the appetite for excitement that I do, however, she has other career needs that aren’t met by engineering. Has anyone on this sub made the jump from a regular job to a very atypical job and loved it or regretted it? Tell me about it if so.

For context, I am young (20y), I'm from Brazil and started programming Java as a hobby when I was very young (around 13). Because of that fortunate beginning, I could get an internship a couple of years ago, small brazilian company. Then I got a full time job at a bigger brazilian company, AND THEN I managed to land a job at a company that was founded in LA but extended to Brazil as well. About 150 employees, half american half brazilian employees. Fully remote.  
People in my company tell me that I don't need a degree anymore, I actually put my uni on freeze to focus solely on my career. I have the desire to move to the USA as soon as I can.  
I have a couple of questions, am I realistically losing out on opportunities if I don't pursue a degree?  
For context tho, I don't know if I should at all continue my degree on Brazil, I assume a brazilian degree wouldn't be worth much in the US, so when I talk about a degree, I'm talking about an american university degree.  
Will not having this degree close doors for me? Even though I started very young and will probably build the experience over time? My thought is, when I get to the age that people often finish their bachelor's (23?) I will have 5 years of experience already, so, I don't know how to weight these factors.

I ah e graduated university with a film production degree. I wanted to go into video editing since I was in secondary school. After graduating I did small jobs in the industry before covid hit and I decided on a career change. 

I did a four month internship with the uni as a project coordinator working closely with the digital communications department and working on their social media. 

I then got a entry level job as a digital marketing lead at a startup (the company was practically non existent and was just me and the ceo). I taught myself digital marketing on the job with a couple of online courses, pretty much no practical experience was gained. After 6 months and a myriad of false promises from the ceo I decided to reject the permanent contract offer. 

I was unemployed for 3 months while living with my gf still having to pay bills and rent etc. It was a pretty worrying time for me, luckily I had savings but was unsure of how long it would last me. 

Finally got a job at another startup (a more successful company) as the social media executive wfh. There was no training and as it was another small team, the workload was A LOT. It got to the point where I couldn’t even make lunch and barely took a break because I had so much to do. The expectations were very high but I didn’t have the agency to reach them so I became burnt out. The job description stated I would have a creative team, analytical team and a manager I would report to but none of that was the case, I was covering everyone of those teams as an individual. 

I was working hard but just not able to achieve what I wanted which was very demoralising. I spoke to the boss about the workload (ideally I would’ve loved for them to hire someone else) but when the end of the 6 month probation came about they decided they wanted someone “more experienced”. The boss is known for firing people at a whim. 

So here I am again unemployed in the same position I was 6 months ago. I don’t know whether to persist in digital marketing or look for an admin office job that would provide stability and structure to my work life. 

I do think that I need to be in a company where I can learn from someone more senior, not in a startup again either, as I am in the beginning of my career in the digital marketing field. However the job market doesn’t seem to have these kind of roles at a decent salary for me to pay bills etc where do I go from here?"

# Alien-Nation Chapter 169: Jailbreak

*******

A Leslie's Pool Supplies retail outlet made for a strange rally point for any group of people, even moreso now that the whole strip mall along what had been Concord Pike had long since closed. The stainless letters spelled the forgotten name of the shopping center, still proudly adorned the top of the diagram of blank signs ensured at least the brick obelisk was a conveniently obvious marker for the men to find and make preparations for assaulting the jail.

'Morningstar' squadron had swelled their cell's numbers to well over twenty by absorbing the miscellaneous fragments of other cells, whose skills were more generalized. The name carried over to the newly formed Strike Force by virtue of being both the largest and the lynchpin of the operation's success.

This was the largest force of the three organized groups they'd split into, each aiming to try and hit the larger jails along Route 202, the other two branches making a target list of their own. Vendetta had given them an extra half hour to at least get themselves close to in-position, but with only one shortwave had no way of knowing if they would coordinate their strike. He was a known element to everyone even if only by name. At least Elias's words stayed true; All seemed very familiar and well-practiced with their carried weaponry. More importantly, none contested his assigned leadership or questioned his orders.

Vaughn cradled the RPG he'd been given, eyeing the well-lit building just over the carefully landscaped hill. The last had been over a half hour ago. The box-mart across the old highway was the temporary headquarters of the repositioned Troop One, after the suburbs near Camp Death had been cleared, likely soon to be repositioned again. But the size of the old box-mart seemed to indicate several things, that it was largely indefensible, could contain a fair few prisoners, and by its proximity to Camp Death, could be useful to strike regardless.

The flow of traffic was unusually heavy for being well before the crack of dawn. Perhaps people were trying their luck getting up old 202 to try and reach the border that way, after having no luck along other closed border checkpoints. There was a feeling of self-consciousness in carrying heavy weapons out in the open along a suburban highway most had driven along during peacetime, the juxtaposition of old familiar environment and newly familiar activity showing just how much their lives had changed. Moreso as cars rolled along it like it was a Friday night of olde, the two lives- old and new, bumping shoulders for a moment.

""You ready?"" He asked, snapping them back to the present.

Mutters of assent was good enough. Haltingly, everyone in the mishmashed strike team moved toward the precinct's bright lights, taking advantage of the long shadows and occasional noise of the passing cars.

It was an unassuming building, the repurposed garrison made out of some retail outlet built back in the turbulent seventies, all brick and little else but tiny glass doors, with not even windows for the occupants to know the impending violence had been approaching. What era will this be known as? Early Imperial? Resistance? Revolutionary? Wondered the teen, as he leveled it at the lobby. Good? Bad? Hell, I'm just the man with the gun.

Everyone levelled their weapons as once, and Vaughn held a hand high. ""We're here to liberate the prison, not blow it sky high,"" he chuckled. It was hardly armored or reinforced- or at least, so it seemed to him. And if it was, then the Data Center had shown the virtue of striking the same spot with concentrated fire beat showering it with dispersed impacts.

At least the glass door looked normal enough. ""Bump and grind, forward. Forward!"" He hissed. ""Aim at that- there- the front door."" Easy enough for the homemade launcher to hit, and these were arguably of the lowest utility if things went sideways. Elias had taught him asset management well- it was a waste to throw your best equipment at a stationary target. While the design was tried-and-tested, Vaughn still took a few steps away.

The improvised launcher let out a metallic clunk, and with a surprisingly subdued noise and recoil the projectile was sent tumbling freely, end over end, the cap blown clean off the improvised launcher. A second later, the giant projectile more than made up for it as the round smashed through the glass door, taking the automatic door slightly off the rails and bowing slightly inward- before then blowing both them and a hail of glass fragments outward as the detonation went off inside the main lobby.

Someone in a security forces uniform staggered out.

""Infantrymen, Fire!"" Vaughn roared to the infantrymen, most of Morningstar dutifully restraining themselves as a hail of bullets sprayed into the storefront and even stitched up the exterior brickwork. Clearly, some insurgents were better trained than others judging by the tracer rounds and slowly tapering off rounds.

""Advance and reload! Morningstar, spread out and cover!""

The smoke and dust was subdued, at least for now, and left them with a surprisingly clear view into the front entrance. Red streaks were painted up on the wall, black and grey of smoke-dusted debris mixed in like a spin-art collage.

The lobby's contents were an absolute shambles- everything set on a ledge had been knocked about, including the ledges and desks themselves. The security forces inside responded by charging out the main doors to follow just a second later.

A hail of gunfire met them, most of the armored troopers flinching reflexively, their armor plates overlapping and protecting their wearer. A few reflexively tried returning fire despite the harsh stings of rounds tugging on the mix of fabric, bulletproof weave, and shattering off the neosteel plate they wore. The gunfire never let up on those unfortunate few who had charged out from their cover, the complete lack of coordination, dissimilar reloading times from infantry with unequal amounts of time spent with their weapons. Effective equipment and enthusiasm was undercut by poor training, surprise, and total lack of a plan to counter being outnumbered. Morningstar, on the other hand, had the numbers, the angle, and the element of surprise.

One by one the Security Forces lay flat. Either they were dead, had the fight knocked out of them, or were trying to present as minimal target as they could while they lined up their own rifles to return fire. It was hard to say for certain what the intent was, but the outcome was little different. Round after round continued pouring into them from dozens of unevenly sized magazines, an RPG or two sending the bodies of any who tried opening fire tumbling, their limbs likely held on by the durable material underneath. When they landed, their bodies folded like misshapen laundry, pressed into unnatural shapes with the wearer still inside.

The whole front engagement was over in less than a minute. A pale, non-gauntleted hand waved frantically from behind a shattered brick front, red streaking down the fingers.

""Hold!"" Vaughn shouted. ""Identify!"" The hand continued waving, and Vaughn shoved an unwitting volunteer forward to pull the man out from behind, to reveal a man in a stained tee shirt with a dazed expression and blood dripping from a series of scratches on his cheeks, cut in like a cat's claws had raked over them.

""Civilian!"" Vaughn bellowed over his ringing ears. ""Any others inside?""

The man shook his head and mouthed 'no,' his voice seemingly too hoarse- perhaps from having spent an untold amount of time screaming.

The man was wrong- there were, or at least 'had been' more security forces inside. A sudden blast and the tinkering of shrapnel caused Vaughn to duck, then charge forward, his improvised explosive launcher discarded, swinging his shotgun around from his back to rest in his hands. A Technical had tried to leave via a service bay exit, apparently not even managing to round the corner before an RPG wielded by a Morningstar veteran had upended the uparmored pickup as it pulled out.

A survivor crawled from the wreckage, and Vaughn sprinted forward, pressing the barrel against the shivering man's temple as he raised his empty hands. The wet splatter kicked high, and Vendetta checked for any other survivors, the smoking tip of his shotgun wafting grey in the fluorescent tubes of the old retail outlet.

The technicals were indeed tough, he noted, but the round seemed to have flown into a wheel well, bypassing the plating. No one else inside seemed to be moving- yet still, he made certain. There'd be no theatrics of announcing himself to an enemy who played dead by standing in the open and giving orders, letting them try and exact some measure of revenge, or gasping out some warning to the shil'vati. No, a strike was to be calculated, and that calculation was to be total.

Two minutes later and a clear picture of the aftermath had emerged. Over five hundred prisoners rescued from the cells, cramped together like sardines, hastily erected concrete laid in a grid backstopping a prefab prison. PVC pipes ran from room to room for toilets no less roughshod in their construction, set straight into the dirty linoleum. Quite a few of the prisoners were deafened somewhat. The skeleton crew of Security Forces personnel hadn't stood a chance- supposedly, most were out, working from some kind of list, or perhaps had finished their shift after a long day of throwing people into prison.

Vaughn gestured with the shotgun. ""There's your exit, people. If you're still undecided about the Shil'vati, then this was your wake-up call. If you're still undecided about us, then I'm not sure what to tell you. We just risked our lives to save yours. You want to pay it back? You can either pay it forward by helping us with the next prison, or you can help the Emperor of Mankind. Blankets, food, water, soldiers, guns, ammo, whatever you've got that you think might help. He hasn't said it, but I reckon you all owe him, if you've got a decent bone in your body, you'll at least bring him something, offer to try and help. If you want, you can listen in on the radio for instructions, and if you haven't got a shortwave, I'll separate off a few from our strike squad who can fill you in and get you there, if you feel like chipping in on the war effort.""

Vaughn lowered the shotgun, taking a shell off his bandoleer and loading it in to replace the one he'd fired.

""That went well,"" Parker remarked. ""And not a bad speech. Short, to the point, and all that. Honestly, I wish I'd brought a whole crew. One for the close-up on that impact. But, uh, that execution...""

""Completely necessary,"" Vaughn snapped, irritatedly. ""That guy was fatally wounded. Putting him out of his misery was an act of mercy. And you'll remember to narrate that, if you got that on film.""

""Of course."" Parker didn't deny where he'd been aiming the camera- saving Vaughn at least the headache of reviewing the footage, and then having to kill Parker, if it turned out he'd been lying.

""I'm starting to think of these jail cells as something more like a pinata full of prizes. Namely, insurgents and good PR,"" he muttered. Truth be told, he'd wanted more of a fight. Vaughn pulled the radio from his pocket, and sent out the broadcast. ""Done here. 202 North has been cleared. About four fifty good to go in some sense of the word, though where's anyone's guess. Tried sending them your way, don't know if they'll take it. Another fifty will need medical treatment. No casualties on our end. Surprise was total. We've got pictures. No enemies taken prisoner.""

Vendetta stared around the lobby, an idea slowly dawning on him.

""Hey! Hey hey hey! Snag armor off any of the ones that you can. Grab any goods that are stocked up, and arm up anyone who says they're headed to Camp Death with the weapons the guys had here. Come on, we can't stay too long here. You-"" he pointed at a man who had held down the trigger on his rifle, spraying the building at full auto. ""-You're fucking useless at fighting. Gather up the ones who are able and willing to fight, get them packed into a civilian-style police cruiser, and drive them on over to Camp Death. Everyone, help him load up. Get everything you can out of the Evidence lockers into the trunks- they can fit a lot, trust me, I'd know. Camp Death's going to need goodies. Come on, move, people, move!""

Morningstar Squadron had re-mustered on Vendetta.

""Alright, now what?"" They almost seemed eager for more.

A smile crept across Vendetta's face, invisible to all as he pointed at the row of vehicle keys.

""I think it's time we hit 141 and a couple more,"" he muttered, pulling it off the hook. ""Now...wheelman, shotgun, or turret?""

# ""Accidentally Cut Content""

[Author's Note: Hey Everyone. I made a really dumb mistake and included part of the next chapter in the previous one's end in my rush to get it out the door. So the first couple paragraphs will be a repeat, **but this IS a new chapter**. I even updated those first four or five paragraphs slightly.]

I couldn't sleep well on the cot that night. Though I noticed hours ticked by, every moment seemed to be spent tossing and turning. I even tried resting with the mask off, held in my hands, but the risk to my identity being discovered if anyone barged in caused me enough stress to worsen the situation. Eventually, I gave up, kicked the covers off and donned the mask again, making my rounds around the camp, trying to calm myself down by taking a midnight stroll. Instead, I felt eyes countless following me, and I had to force myself to stand tall for them. For the thousandth time, I thought of this as my Valley Forge.

As I patrolled, I could hear whispered prayers, muttered plans of action, and mercifully, snores. At least some were getting some sleep. I could [see orange lights reflecting off the clouds](https://imgur.com/RpCExpe) from where I knew Wilmington lay. It seemed Vaughn was keeping busy, if indeed it was his handiwork.

A few shipment inspections and a routine update from a sentry later, and I felt caught up to speed. I noticed Radio from the corner of my eye, seemingly also unable to sleep.

I almost jumped a foot in the air when I felt the tap on my shoulder, only to find G-Man's mask staring into mine. How strange that such a haunting visage was a comfort to me.

""Hey. Can't sleep?"" He sounded surprisingly serene. Or maybe it was just tired resignation. His hands seemed stuck in a familiar claw-like shape after holding the soldering iron for so long, and my fingers ached in sympathy. My mask's filters took much of the scent of smoke I could smell from the distant fires, but I was sure that if I wasn't wearing my mask that G-Man would smell faintly of molten silver solder. I'd wondered how we'd repaired and updated so many railguns so quickly. Now I knew what he'd put himself through.

""I can't,"" I confessed. ""G-Man, I'm sorry what happened with your father. Hell of a birthday."" I hadn't even had a chance to give him the present I'd bought him- a couple new filters, and vintage craftsman toolkit, 'from before they sold out,' as Verns had phrased it. The memory of his voice already felt distant, somehow.

""Wasn't your fault. Even if Town Hall wasn't your big idea to get them to retaliate, you know? Then they'd still have done something. But, uh, thanks for saying that. And thanks for trying to get dad out. I'll remember that."" George said quietly, then the conversation ended when he turned away and went to the edge of the embankment. Just like that.

I could never quite get a read on him, but I wanted to respect his distance. Whatever he was feeling, he seemed to want to feel it alone, and to keep his own counsel on the matter.

I continued course toward Radio.

""Any word from Miskatonic?"" I asked hopefully.

Radio offered a noncommittal shrug, then dropped it in a hurry, raising one hand to massage his chest. ""They say 'this is your war,' but did ship us a small container.""

""I saw.""

I hadn't exactly expected them to line up alongside us in the trenches in their white coats, but I'd hoped they'd have had some kind of wonder drug or noxious gas we might deploy. Something toxic to the Shil'vati but not us. The best they'd given us so far were experimental bullets and toxic-tipped arrows and knives, the former of which supposedly could potentially the armor, if fired with enough force and impacted with a good angle. If true, then I supposed they might be moderately useful in an ambush, and they had helpfully included a pair of compound bows. I had conducted a pretty decent survey of the defense, but I hadn't thought to ask if any were experienced archers. I also couldn't imagine taking someone off a railgun, large caliber rifle, or even an old cannon to hand them a bow and arrow without feeling like I was somehow offering them an insult without equipping it myself, and there was better I could think to do with the remaining minutes before the Shil'vati would inevitably come looking than to practice.

They'd fallen out of favor for a reason, and it wasn't that the earliest guns outperformed bows.

They had also supplied a small cache of rifles that were more likely to pulverize than penetrate unless the armor had been compromised already. These were still appreciated, but hardly the game changer I wanted in return for all we'd sent them.

Then Radio leaned in, voice kept conspiratorially low. ""They did, however, mention an exfiltration for you.""

Sam had been right, I wouldn't get back anything close to the value of what I'd sent out. At least, not unless I was willing to abandon everything and everyone, to cut and run for my life. Such a decision would be the inglorious end of the revolution, spelling doom for everyone in it, and all of humanity's culture. I'd forever be remembered as a coward, if I was so lucky to be remembered at all.

""Well, I'm not going.""

""Okay, but here's a real head-scratcher. Did you show them where Camp Death is? I've been careful not to broadcast our coordinates, and my little helpers haven't been talking with Miskatonic. And the person on the shortwave mentioned that the border would free up tomorrow morning, then mentioned the interstate right up against the back of our base as a meeting point. They said Last Exit Before Pennsylvania. That's right there."" He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. ""And I didn't mention broadcasting without a cat's paw or relay. I mean there's a chance they triangulated, but throwing together a plan that fast? Nah, man, they knew.""

I searched my memory. ""I'm certain that I didn't mention it to them...did Hex? She did that internship. No, wait, she got picked up and dropped off at Warehouse Base. Unless she mentioned something on the drive past? She said they were somewhere North."" Now that Radio had mentioned it, I was left with a bit of a puzzle. How did they know? How much did they know about us?

""They had to have known somehow. And if they didn't know before and just figured our location out, then I bet you it's not long before the Shil'vati figure it out themselves and come sniffing,"" Radio resignedly threw a hand up. ""Should we update the signal? Start directing people straight here?""

We had numbers, yes, but we could still do to take more in, especially if the fighting dragged on or casualties mounted higher than I projected. ""How long until they're sure we're here?""

Radio yawned under his mask, the animated glass-plated mask he wore misinterpreting it with an ASCII shocked "":O"" face. ""We've been broadcasting all night, so, who knows?""

""Well, if it was just a signal they picked up on any random given day, how long would it typically take for the Shil'vati to muster a response?""

""Depends on the day."" At my silent stare, he objected further. ""They sometimes respond pretty fast to that sort of thing, but these aren't normal times, E. They used to come to check out wherever I broadcast from within an hour or two or two, but remember, they've kind of got their hands full right now thanks to Vendetta's jailbreaks. Plus, there's so many more signals."" He checked the screen of his shortwave and chuckled, then lightly massaged his chest again. ""I'm sure we've already gone way past.""

""Alright. If we see anyone snooping around us, add our location to the broadcast. That way, anyone in the resistance or is sympathetic but isn't sure where Camp Death is can find their way here. In the meantime, though, I still think we're best not leaking it. At least with the sentries having set in the final claymores and outer defenses, we should be well-situated to ward off anything they throw at us.""

""Maybe. Maybe not,"" George said from behind me, and I froze.

""Why not?""

He'd helped build this place. He'd know any weaknesses as well as his father.

""They might have cloaking tech, or some other means of infiltration,"" his voice was a dry rasp.

I shuddered thinking about it. ""That's a good point,"" I muttered. ""Assassination and recovery might be up their alley...except, I think they're terrified of what losing me might mean for their hostages.""

""I'll be honest. I don't think she cares at this point,"" G-Man countered. I couldn't fault his gloomy disposition. I could just hope that he didn't want something bad to happen to us, to balance out that something bad had happened to him, from some weird sense of fairness.

""Yeah?""

""Think about it for a second. What happens if you die? Then what does that let her do if that happens?""

It was with a startle I realized he had a good point. Azraea had committed to a shocking all-in, something that would shake the political landscape and memories of countless denizens of the state. Months of carefully planned schemes involving carefully planned defensive patrols meant to reinforce one another, frustrate, and hinder our operations had culminated in us adapting, learning. We thought we had her beaten, especially when we destroyed her monitoring, data collection, and reporting asset in Something Else Square. Then she'd pulled something like this out of a hat, catching us totally flat-footed, rounding up who-knew how many of us before we could muster. What other assumptions had I made that were incorrect? Would she hold fire, if she knew where I was if it meant sparing the hostages? Or were they now just an 'acceptable, if regrettable' loss? When your opponent becomes unpredictable, issues arise, especially when you're counting on them to do certain things.

If it was, then I'd just done her work for her, and all of us would be dead the moment she figured out where we were, and at least the end would come faster than I knew it had arrived.

I realized I was staring up into the orange-lit cloudy night sky. I could voice none of this, not without undermining morale and potentially sparking a panic.

""If she was going to start bombarding the state, she'd have started already by now,"" I chuckled. ""The borders are sealed, right? Why wait? Why bother trying to build some sense of dread? She's not a vampire who feeds on fear. I choose to not be afraid of what she may do. I instead intend to plan around it, to the extent that we can. Besides, if I die, what would the twins do to the hostages?""

George made a disappointed growl, his sore hands turning from awkward claws into shaking fists. ""That may be the point. If the Twins do anything to the hostages in retaliation for your death, then maybe as long as she didn't pull the trigger, she thinks she'll be absolved of whatever damage their deaths mean to them.""

I wasn't sure she thought that way. Heck, after months, the woman was still an absolute enigma to me. Governess Bal'shir, I understood- the flurry of speeches and photo-ops and handshakes at civic meetings with 'literally-who's-that' of 'what-community' had been carte blanche for us to grow. Ministriva was a lying snake, and once we pieced that together, I ripped her apart. But Azraea? What drove the Fleet Admiral to come down here? Duty. There wasn't any sort of hard policy she followed that I could tell, not that I knew Shil'vati military doctrine well, being an outsider such as I was. Perhaps it was the greater liberty afforded her of being both Governess and General that made it seem like her plans shifted and changed in ways that made it hard for me to keep up. Or maybe she was just at such a rank and in such a position of power to where she could make her judgment calls. If so, that begged the question: What was 'the line' for her? I had a feeling I'd somehow crossed it already. Probably Radio's tape of me fucking the Empress, if I was to be honest. Most unfair to be judged for something that hadn't been my decision, though I doubted an apology from either of us would amount to much.

I looked over to my Lieutenants. They'd helped carry me this far. I'd be foolish to ignore them now. What could I do to at least mitigate the risk that he was right, and there was someone looking to kill me, right here and now?

""Alright, fine, you've convinced me. Instruct the sentries to get the next dozen people who we intake to help patrol the inner perimeter, and to keep a watch for...well, I mean, a stealthy seven foot tall purple alien with giant tits?""

""Something invisible,"" George supplied.

""Alright, for anything shifting in the tall grasses that they can't immediately see- I can't really ask them to keep an eye out for something they can't see, can I?"" I was suddenly too tired to think properly.

""I'll explain it,"" G-Man offered.

""And I'll get the sentries ready to take over the radio, explaining how it works, then I'll try heading to bed, too,"" Radio offered, and I realized that a yawn sounded very strange through a voice modulator- his ASCII helmet seemed to fritz out again for a second.

""I should change my sleeping quarters, too,"" I muttered. ""They'll almost certainly check the command cabin for me, if they manage to enter. I'll pick a tunnel- uh...somewhere.""

""Might be smart. Could be they'll try and take out the explosives shed, too. Make it look like an accident on our part, get rid of any hostages, and then get a free pass to exact vengeance on the state. Got anywhere in mind?""

I thought to myself. Where might be a good resting area? There were many tunnels that led to bunkers, firing outposts, and even to stowage areas. Any one  of them might do in theory, but I knew of one that overlooked one of the two streams that ran along the side of Camp Death. I didn't want to situate myself either too low to where I was on the very front of the lines- why make an assassin's job even easier by putting myself on the perimeter, after all? But the creek should make a pleasant bit of white noise- and also get me away from the center shed. ""Probably facing North, along Perkins run. G-Man, you look absolutely dead on your feet. Get some rest if you can, you've certainly done enough and gone through enough for today.""

""There's...still things to do.""

""There always will be. If the others are finished doing their repairs, lock the shed,"" I muttered. ""I know the hostages are in there, so post a sentry or two there, too, to watch over the entrance. You're right that she may try some kind of underhanded tactic."" It wouldn't do much if they decided to set charges against the side or something, and the subsequent explosion would be, in a word, 'cataclysmic'. ""This was supposed to be a relaxing walk to help me rest..."" I scratched at my chin under the mask, feeling the beginnings of the few scratchy hairs that had grown since I'd last shaved, and feeling the cool fresh air without the filter as the wind kicked up.

""Sorry,"" G-Man offered sheepishly. ""I'll go tell 'em.""

While he ambled off, I followed Radio back to his pile of equipment.

""Before we split then, one last thing.""

""Yeah?"" Radio asked.

""Have we recovered Verns?"" I asked Radio. ""Any word?""

""No, not that I've heard,"" Radio confessed. ""Vendetta's been mostly quiet, I think to hide his heading from anyone who might be listening, but I know that he's struck at least three jails and counting. Some of the ones he's freed are trickling up to us here on foot, and it seems he and Morningstar are acting like a human wrecking ball. The troops are calling it Operation Smash-and-Grab.""

""Smash-and-grab,"" I laughed, thinking of the pun. ""I like it. Do we have a more recent headcount?""

""Sam said we've got enough to last about three days of continuous, round-the-clock fighting with the hundreds of people we have here. If we get a resupply run- well, I suppose it would depend upon how big a hole gets blasted in the encirclement. Or, well, something to that effect. Look, man, I'm 'Radio', not 'Telephone,' and I don't have the head for this logistics shit that you two do. You want to talk to Sam, you get the man on the radio yourself, or ask one of the Sentries I'm sticking here to manage the comms. Point being, you try and get hold of him. I'm done for the night.""

I could have said something witty back, but it felt counterproductive, and would only delay the sleep I was now well overdue for.

""I've got an idea for an update. The ones Vendetta's letting loose? They can gather supplies and wait for the signal to reinforce, or to agitate, or can organize people into a more focused group, one that can punch through whatever blockade they try and form up. It'll also force the Shil'vati to not concentrate forces on our back door-"" I pointed back at the interstate. ""Even if they clear them out, the opportunity for us to encircle and destroy and then break out is too high for them to really try to do a mass deployment along our back."" Sam was, I knew, something of a career criminal. Able to rub elbows with the worst elements of humanity. He was a facilitator, I knew, not really a leader. ""Can you tell him-""

Radio was already fiddling with the dial. ""Already on it,"" he muttered. ""Lotta profit in looting, should be easy for him to steer people with that, or something. Get some sleep, E.""

I went up to a sentry, requisitioned a sleeping bag someone had helpfully brought,  went into a trench and told him where I'd be if I was needed. I waved to Radio, and crawled into the gunnery tunnel, almost stepping on another four people already laying in it. I loosened my laces, clutched my sheathed knife, and fell into a fitful sleep.

So i was wondering is it normal that i am feeling a tiny bit overwhelmed about all of this? I have to thank sololearn and great youtubers like bro code because sometimes i am so tired and i pretty sure i have some ADHD so i dont really follow in class at times. My eureka moment mostly come when im looking at concepts online or projects while asking CHATGPT for further explanation. I feel like it would had been moren logical to just focus on either frontend or backend but damn i feel like their trainning us to be fullstack developpers at this point.

At the same time, I was taking German courses, and my level is B2 (I understand almost everything and speak fluently). So I started looking for a job. I don't have a technical higher education (at university, I majored in English), but I studied at an IT academy for a year in frontend development.

I was faced with the fact that all my applications were rejected. Moreover, I can't even get a free internship. As far as I understood, this is because I do not have a specialized higher education.

13vssd6,6,2023-05-30,"New grad at startup, not meeting expectations. Need help with improvement",pidena,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13vssd6/new_grad_at_startup_not_meeting_expectations_need/,"I am a new grad that started a job at a startup two months ago. It's a team of five people, and the engineers are myself and my manager (the CEO is also technical). I've done two internships at big tech companies; learned a lot there but startup life is completely different.

The feedback I have gotten from my manager on my weekly 1:1s is a bit concerning. Along with positive feedback when I do show improvement, I am getting feedback such as not meeting expectations for where an engineer at my level should be, lacking independence and ability to take on tasks on my own, asking questions that could be easily answered by doing my own research, reliability that my code would be correct, among other things. I requested a half day of PTO last week, offering to work more hours per day the other days to make up for it, but the request was denied because I would not be productive without someone actively watching over me.

I feel like I am trying really hard — giving lots of energy towards setting clear goals, communicating with my manager when I feel stuck, asking about what I can help on when I feel directionless... but it never feels enough. I'm terrified of getting let go, especially as a startup where financial resources are limited and the talent you hire must be very functional. There are two new engineers coming on, one entry level as well, and I'm worried that they will be much more productive than me, and I will be useless in comparison and be let go. I have anxiety and depression, which makes things worse in terms of believing in myself for self-improvement.

How do I increase my personal improvement and ability to meet expectations? I feel like I am working pretty hard, working 12-15 hours some days, trying to improve my skills, reading up on documentation, communicating openly with my manager, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I'm not sure if the expectations on me are too high for a new grad in their first job, or if I really need to push harder in some way (and what way that would be). I want to surpass expectations and shine, but it is hard for me to even meet them.

tl;dr getting feedback about me not meeting expectations and need advice on how to improve myself to meet expectations, if not exceed them"

But really - have you? 

I see people who have had the same partner since college, 20 years ago, and been with the same company for 15 years, and just has this “stability” …

I can’t even wrap my head around it. 

All the way back to high school - the only constant in my life is “change”. 

In high school I went to 3 different schools, and did an internship for a semester. Went to (2) different colleges. A private art school, from which I dropped out after a semester. Then went to community college where I learned enough to start working, but nowhere near the associates degree I signed up for.

Started working career - in 25 years, probably changed jobs like 10-12 times. No exaggeration.

Yet somehow - I have carved out a niche position for myself in my industry, and have always been in demand for work. My last 3 jobs found me, not vice versa.

In relationships, been in like 5 relationship that lasted a couple years, been divorced, re-married for 12 years now - but barely hangin’ in there in that front. 50/50 shot at marriage succeeding, but the temptation to leave is always there. 

Maybe if I was the slow and steady type - those thoughts might be out of sight, out of mind - but for me they always creep in.

Anyway - how about the rest of you? Do you envy that stability, or do you revel in the chaos?

Personally - I lean towards chaos, but probably because I was undiagnosed for 30+ years, and grew up in chaos. I know nothing else…

But I do wonder about it."
13vtuf5,14,2023-05-30,"Solodev or internship, what should I do?",caressingleaf111,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13vtuf5/solodev_or_internship_what_should_i_do/,"So I applied to few companies for an internship this summer and two companies gave me an offer, both are great and offer similar pay. The thing is Company A offered a part-time position instead of an internship, where my job is to maintain their website and backend on my own, and Company B offered an internship where there's a mentor to help me. 

Now an obvious downside of Company A is that I'll be the only web developer (there are other SE in the company but they work on different stuff) so there will be mostly no guidance on what to do, they told me the tech stack they use for their site and I'm familiar with it.

As for Company B there's actually someone to help and teach me proper software development. 

An obvious choice is Company B, but the reason I'm hesitant is that Company B offers a 2 month internship, while I can work as long as I can with Company A, and tbh since the working hours aren't that demanding it's nice to have some side pay while being a student.

Keep in mind I'm still a 3rd year student so I can still apply for internships next year. 

Which one should I choose?"

The organization has a pretty restrictive environment with barely any public facing services which means that doing anything on the network requires knowledge of the internal architect to get anything done. 

Issue is is my counterparts are supposed to be helping me and guiding me through this environment but it's not going well at all. Simple questions are often left with with one word answers that don't explain what I need help with. It's seems as if they are annoyed with me for asking simple things, but how am I supposed to know where the test certificates are or what the authentication is for a server when there is zero documentation. I am often sitting at my desk for hours rerunning the same commands while they watch my command history on my account just to bring it up later on in a meeting or something to have a laugh. 

Ive been assigned a simple app update as my first solo task and while I know the general steps of redeploying the app with the update, I am hitting every small road block you can think of because of the architecture. I can't get anything answered for me like how should I bring up this database, how do I auth with our repo, how do I access server X, why can't I hit this webpage, etc etc. 

I came from an internship of great people who genuinely wanted to help me. And this team even seems fine outside of these 3 bozos. Problem is, the rest of the team isnt DevOps but instead SW Engineers they can't help much. I feel like I'm in a place where not knowing is offensive, and the stress just doesn't feel worth it. Of course I moved to a small town where the industry knows each other.

I have smoked pretty consistently throughout my college years so far, and this summer I applied for an internship in construction management. I am also 22 years old.

Eventually, I was called and told I was hired and that I would be starting the next Monday and that I was required to take and pass a drug test. Here’s where I need help. From the moment I was told I got hired, and told I was going to have to take a 10-panel drug test, I stopped smoking all together. I started on that Monday and after my orientation shift, took the drug test.

Fast forward, I finished my first week on the job and this morning received a call. I assume I tested positive because when I talked to the woman she asked if I was taking any prescription medication, to which I replied the honest answer which was no. She then said okay and began to hung up before I asked if something was wrong, and she answered saying the Medical Review Officer would reach out to me, then hung up. That was this morning around 8:30 and as of now, 12:08, I haven’t heard anything else.

What should I do and do I have any good options? I mean I smoked recreationally and in a legal state but the moment I was made aware I was hired, I stopped. It wouldn’t seem right to lose this opportunity to do something I had done (as simple as smoking weed) before I was even aware that I was hired.

Thanks for any advice you guys can offer, I don’t know what’d be worse, losing this opportunity or having to explain to my parents why I did."
13vv2ay,25,2023-05-30,HBS 2+2 Interview Experience and Tips from 100+ 2+2 Admits,JohnFromLeland,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/13vv2ay/hbs_22_interview_experience_and_tips_from_100_22/,"Congrats to all 2+2 interviewees! I interviewed with HBS 2+2 a few years back and have since helped 100+ HBS 2+2 Admits with interview prep. Here are my best tips:

#### Interview Structure

* Interviewer: Admissions staff member
* Length: 30 minutes
* Not blind (interviewer will have seen your application)

HBS interviews are known to be more formal than those at other schools like Stanford. Historically, they’ve taken place on campus, in big cities across the US, or over video call. No matter how you interview, your interviewer will be a member of the admissions staff. Because they are all trained professionals trying to assess you as quickly as possible, you need to be ready for what may be an intense interview experience. Another thing that lends to the more intense nature is that they often test interviewees to see if they will succeed with their case study model, which requires you to pick a stance and defend it.

#### Tips

* Know yourself well and stand by your choices.
* Prove initiative.
* Show confidence.
* Be ready to explain and analyze key, pivotal points in your resume.
* Understand your industry, its trends, and its current market.

#### HBS Post-Interview Reflection Essay

1. Express gratitude.
2. Reiterate interest.
3. Highlight specific parts of the interview that you enjoyed.
4. Don’t worry about trying to explain an answer that you didn’t feel great about (unless you absolutely bombed a question). Chances are, your interviewer doesn’t even remember that one question that you wished you had answered better, so to bring it back up again is probably not worth it. 

#### Example Questions

* *What has been your most meaningful experience throughout college? Why is that meaningful to you?*
* *Why did you decide to do X in college?*
* *What would you go back and do differently about your undergrad experience?*
* *What are you doing during your time between graduation and your full-time job?*
* *What have you liked about starting a company?*
* *What would your co-workers at X company say about working with you?*
* *How have your experiences working at X company been different from working at a startup?*
* *Walk me through an example of something you worked on in your internship.*
* *Were you good at your job?*
* *What drives you?*
* *What was the interview process like at the company you are planning on joining?*
* *How did you make the decision to go with that offer?*
* *What else do you want me to know?*

#### My Personal Experience

When I was invited to interview at HBS, they offered me several interview options. I could interview on campus, in several major cities across the US, or via Skype. All HBS interviews are conducted by a paid member of their admissions team, which is different from Stanford’s alumni interview-style. 

When the time came for me to step out and interview, I was very nervous. I was wearing a nice suit and tie, and the whole formality of things was very intimidating. I was taken to a waiting room with \~10 other applicants, and we all waited nervously for the next steps. Then, our interviewers came in and called out the name of the applicant who would be interviewing with them. I was greeted with a smile, a firm handshake, and ushered into a room nearby. The interview started off with “John, it’s great to have you here on campus. We only have 30 minutes, and I’ve already read through your entire application, so we are just going to move right into questions.” No time was given to build rapport or get to know her at all. This was time for her to pepper me with questions and get inside my head as quickly as possible.

If I were to pick a theme for the interview, it would be the question, “Why?” Almost everything she asked was related to the why behind the decisions I had made. “Why did you choose to intern at X?” “What were the projects you worked on?” “Why those projects” “What specifically did you do to contribute to those projects?” “Why did you start X club on campus?” “Why did you choose to work at X full-time?” She even did some fact-checking for some things on my resume (so don’t lie on your resume!). Overall, it was really hard to gauge how things were going because I was the one being questioned. It felt intense, but I was happy with the way I had answered most questions. 

My interviewer also asked for my thoughts and perspectives on leadership and some technology trends happening at the time. She pushed me on my answers and challenged me to think deeply. She also wanted me to open up and share my strengths, weaknesses, etc. And she also asked me about the interview processes for landing the internship and job opportunities that I had, possibly to vet how challenging those opportunities were to land. Overall, it was a really interesting conversation but also somewhat stressful.

Hope that helps! Shoot me a note or check out Leland if you'd like additional help prepping. You got this!"

Since that point, I say that I'd have had ~15 interviews in total, with me getting to the final stages of 2 different companies, both going with another candidate at the final moment.

# 8 genius strategies that landed my first job

📷Q: I’m having a tough time finding a job in tech. What are proven strategies I can use to land a job?

Tech is a fascinating field, a blend of artistry and functionality, psychology and aesthetics. But breaking into it can feel like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. As someone who has successfully made the transition into the tech industry, I know firsthand the challenges and struggles that designers and product managers face.

Today, I'm sharing **8 proven strategies from my personal story**, a self-taught designer who landed a Design Lead role at Gotrade (YC S19).

Let's dive into the 8 key strategies (📷 with interesting historical references from famous figures).Step 1. Understand The Company

Before you can woo a company, you need to know them inside and out, like a biography writer researching their subject.

>**📷** **True story:** Remember when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and steered the sinking ship back into clear waters? He had an intimate understanding of Apple's mission and culture. You need the same level of understanding about the company you want to join.

Actionable steps:

* *Research the company's mission, recent news, market trends, and the backgrounds of its leaders and interviewers.*
* *Use tools like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and the company's own website to gather information.*
* *Try to understand the company's pain points and how your role could address them.*

Step 2. Leverage Warm Intros

In the world of networking, warm introductions are the holy grail. They're like a secret handshake that gets you past the velvet rope and into the VIP section.

>**📷** **True story:** In the early days of Airbnb, the founders used warm intros to connect with potential investors and mentors, leading them to their first funding round. It can work the same way for you in landing a design role.

Actionable steps:

* *Scan your networks for any connections to the company.*
* *Engage with their content and ask for advice or mentorship.*
* *Use platforms like LinkedIn or ADPList to find potential connections.*

Step 3. Craft for ""Tell Me About Yourself""

This is your moment to shine, to craft a narrative about your past, present, and future that will captivate your interviewers.

>**📷** **True story:** When Elon Musk explains his journey, he doesn't just list off his accomplishments. He talks about his passion for technology, his visions for the future, and the key decisions that led him to where he is now. This is the same kind of storytelling you need to master.

Actionable steps:

* *Develop a concise but compelling story about your journey into design.*
* *Highlight key decisions and insights that have shaped your career.*
* *Practice this story until you can tell it naturally and confidently.*

Step 4. Targeted Companies

Just like how different species of birds have unique calls, every company has its unique needs and preferences. Meta and Google, for example, lean towards data-led design, while Apple is all about visuals.

>**📷** **True story:** In 2009, when Square was just a small start-up, they weren't looking for a jack-of-all-trades. They needed a designer who could build a simple, user-friendly payment app. Knowing what a company is specifically looking for can help you tailor your approach and stand out from the crowd.

Actionable steps:

* *Understand the needs of the companies you're interested in.*
* *Learn about their past hires and what they valued in them.*
* *Tailor your portfolio to match the company's style and needs.*

Step 5. Targeted Network

Before you send off that job application, try to connect with a few employees at the company.

>**📷** **True story:** When Sheryl Sandberg was considering joining Facebook as COO, she met with numerous employees to understand the culture and challenges of the company. This not only gave her insights into Facebook but also helped her establish connections within the company.

Actionable steps:

* *Reach out to 1-2 employees at the company.*
* *Send a personalized note asking if they'd be willing to share their insights about the company.*
* *Use the information you gain to improve your application and interview preparations.*

Step 6. Challenge Them (Humbly)

When you're asked, ""Do you have any questions for me?"" during an interview, it's your chance to show your preparation and curiosity. You want to challenge their thinking, not just ask about vacation days or company culture.

>**📷** **True story:** When Reed Hastings was considering investing in Netflix, he didn't just ask about their business model. He asked challenging questions that made the Netflix team think deeply about their strategy and future. You want to do the same in your job interviews.

**Actionable steps:**

* *Prepare thoughtful questions about the company's projects, strategies, and challenges.*
* *Show that you've done your homework by asking specific, informed questions.*
* *Be respectful and humble when asking these questions.*

Step 7. Contribute Into Future

Interviews are not just about what you've done in the past, but what you can do in the future. People want to hire folks they're confident can bring in results (fast).

>**📷** **True story:** When Sundar Pichai was interviewed at Google, he didn't just talk about his past experience. He also shared his vision for Google's future and how he could contribute to it. This approach can work for you too.

Actionable steps:

* *Think about what skills and ideas you can bring to the company.*
* *Show them how you can contribute to their future success.*
* *Be specific about what you'd improve and how you'd do it.*

Step 8. Tell Story With Results

Forget about going on and on about your design process. What matters is the impact you've made with your work. It's like showing the delicious cake you baked, not explaining every step of the baking process.

>**📷** **True story:** When Jony Ive presented the design of the iPhone, he didn't just talk about the design process. He demonstrated the end result and its impact on the user experience. This is the kind of storytelling you need to employ in your interviews.

Actionable steps:

* *Showcase the results of your design work in your portfolio and during your interviews.*
* *Highlight the impact your designs have had.*
* *Limit the explanation of your process to about 10% of your presentation.*

Final key takeaways

1. **Research**: Thoroughly understand the company, role, and key personnel before the interview.
2. **Networking**: Leverage your connections for introductions and insights into the company.
3. **Prepare Your Story**: Craft a compelling response to ""Tell Me About Yourself"", focusing on key decisions and insights.
4. **Tailor Your Approach**: Understand the unique needs and goals of the company and tailor your portfolio and application to match.
5. **Connect with Employees**: Prior to applying, engage with 1-2 employees from the company to gain insights.
6. **Show Critical Thinking**: Use the opportunity to ask the interviewer questions to challenge their thinking and demonstrate your preparation.
7. **Internships**: Shine in an internship by exceeding expectations and making yourself indispensable.
8. **Apply for the Right Jobs**: Exercise empathy, make your CV/resume a story, and tailor your approach to the company you really want to work for.
9. **Nail the Interview**: Articulate your creative process, describe design challenges you've experienced, and explain the rationale behind your creative decisions.​"

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Science Olympiad (9th-12th, officer since 11th) - spent an insane number of hours a week even though I only put 5 hr/wk on the Common App; led meetings, made presentations on upcoming comps and how to prepare for them (i.e. how to take notes), chose comps to compete at, placed top 6 at regionals and states individually and as a team
2. School Marching Band (9th-12th, section leader since 11th) - mentored new members, instructed on marching basics and led sectionals, also organized section bonding time (like we painted our nails and stuff hehe); played piccolo for the season
3. Intern @ CUA (summer 2022) - fabricated polymer membranes on microfluidics device via flow-assembly, conducted membrane strength testing, analyzed data for strength enhancement
4. Tutor for various honor societies and music (10th-12th) - tutored everything from high-school level math to AP Chem to flute, most of it was basically getting hours for different honor societies but I think it was pretty productive and meaningful
5. Cross country (9th-11th) - quit before senior year to focus on college apps ;-; I wasn't that fast, just average, but I led a small running group and ran 300+ miles each summer to prepare for the season
6. Various community service projects (10th-12th) - made face shields for healthcare workers (was reported by a local news network so I linked that in the Additional Info section of my Common App), crocheted/knitted rectangles to assemble into a blanket for the homeless
7. Policy Review Committee Chair (12th) - basically 2 or 3 other high schoolers and I (along with other adults) reviewed some curriculum policy that needed to be updated in terms of language and terms, didn't really do much but it was cool seeing the process of how it actually worked
8. Teen Leader for Christian youth fellowship (11th/12th) - kinda fell off of it senior year but I led meetings along with a couple other peers, I created slides and we facilitated intergenerational discussion
9. First Chair in Wind Ensemble (11th/12th) - yeah that's basically it T\_T I played solos and stuff
10. Household Obligations (9th-12th) - cared for siblings, helped with their school assignments, did chores, translated for parents from English to Mandarin

**Awards/Honors**

1. State Science Olympiad Competition (1st - Ornithology, 8th - Environmental Chemistry) - 11th grade
2. Regional Science Olympiad Competition (2nd: Chemistry Lab, 2nd: Ornithology, 3rd: Environmental Chemistry) - 11th grade
3. County STEM Award - 11th grade (idrk how significant this was tbh it seemed like a throwaway kinda thing; it was for my performance in Science Olympiad but they got the competition name wrong on my certificate T\_T)
4. Governor's Volunteer Service Award - 10th grade
5. State Seal of Biliteracy Recipient in English and Chinese - 11th grade

**Essays**

1. Common App essay - had 2 versions, one for EA and another for RD. I would rate my first version (basically I compared my identity to a sandwich and made it a love story it was kinda weird T\_T) like a 7/10 if I'm being generous and a solid 9/10 for my second version (I talked about how my being officer of Science Olympiad challenged me and made me grow as a person; it sounds cliche but I used a unique format that I'm pretty proud of)
2. Supplemental essays - my EA supps were probably on average like a 6 or 7 out of 10, and my RD supps were an 8 to a 9. I tried to make them more creative/unique since I knew my ECs were on the weaker side when it came to the higher ranked schools and I knew that I was going to get in, my essays would play a major role in my acceptance. I spent so much time and so many rounds of editing with my dad asdfkljasd;lfkj

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. AP Chem teacher/Science Olympiad coach (11/10) - She really liked me and she's honestly my mom atp... I'm also an aide for her this year so I help set up labs for her and the entire science dept. She also assigns me other labs to prepare just for funsies and bc she trusts me apparently ???? Hopefully she can speak to the diligence and time I put in as a Scioly officer and my performance in the AP Chem class. Might also be worth mentioning that I tutored one of her current AP Chem kids?
2. Wind Ensemble/Marching Band director (7.5/10) - I didn't have other STEM teachers as strong as my AP Chem teacher but my logic was that I would ask teachers who knew what I was like outside of school past the academic/stats/grades kind of thing; hopefully they could give some insight into my personality (ig that logic worked? idk) Since I was a section leader in marching band for 2 years I had some leadership in terms of that but I would often come in a couple minutes late to class tired asf cause we had band first period... Overall I still think he has a decent impression of me
3. Internship advisor/prof (9/10) - He is a family friend of my parents and that's honestly how I got the internship T\_T But he has a pretty good impression of me during the time I was there; I picked up things pretty quickly so I think that helped. Only submitted this to some schools I was applying to RD and some schools late in the EA cycle
4. (only submitted after waitlist) Science Lab Assistant Manager (8.5/10) - Set up labs for the science department, had an overall good impression of me since I volunteered to complete other tasks and extra things outside of the labs I had to set up
5. (only submitted after waitlist) School Principal (6.5/10) - Our class is \~650 people and he only became the principal my sophomore year so I doubt he knew me that well; I sent my resume to him so hopefully he did something with that T\_T

**Takeaways**

* Start your essays early (preferably before senior year!) It helps to get ahead of the game and brainstorm, plus I find that I am dissatisfied with some part of an essay that i think needs editing a week or two after I finish
* Familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of the Common App layout, like what each section entails (you might be surprised to find that it's a lot of info to fill out)
* Look at examples of everything related to your application, whether it be the Common App, supplemental essays, and how to word your activities list
* Don't downplay your achievements, but don't overly embellish them, either!
* **Think about your application as a whole.** I cannot stress this enough! Is there an activity that is overly mentioned in your application? Try to balance your application out. Is there an aspect of yourself that you want to include but haven't yet? Try to touch on it in your supplemental essays. I go more in depth in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13si6wp/how_i_sold_myself_and_how_you_can_too_from_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* Apply to scholarships and treat them as you would your college apps! Also consider the finances and affordability of a school before totally committing to it and putting it on your list"

I know junior year is supposedly the year for all this but I don’t know how I should prepare myself. Any advice for any of my questions would be a great help

First of all, how do I get responses? Last year I tried to get an internship, but received maybe 5 responses that led to coding challenges. I sent a lot of applications, and the tiny response rate really beat me down. I know that sophomores don’t get internships but I thought I’d have a little more hope than what I got. I’ve heard that you should try to make a human connection to the recruiters on linked in or something. Would that help? I believe my resume is in a very good format, so I don’t think that’s the issue. 

Secondly, side projects: What should I do? to me this is where I’m lacking. I don’t really have all that many side projects. I have a small simulation game I made using JavaFX and a discord bot written in python. I thought both were cool but it seems that so many people have like full fledged software out there. What are some examples of good projects that I could use for inspiration? 

Thirdly: Interviews. How do I pass them? Is leetcode all I need? I’m a very good talker, and I can make connections pretty easy, but I feel like I’ll struggle in the technical areas. How bad were some of your interviews?

If you have any answers to these, or any advice at all really, it will help me so much."

Background: I've graduated last month. Had a research assistant position and internship. Got a new grad position I start at next month. 

First off let me say that I'm extremely grateful to have a job at all. The job market is super tough and I consider myself lucky to be able to get any entry-level SDE position to break into the industry.

The issues on my mind lately are that I'm not excited about the location (Vegas) or the product the company works on at all. I was really passionate about my internship and loved the product, and feel like that almost spoiled me. The pay isn't incredible by SDE standards ($85k total comp), however I understand that by many other standards that's still an amount to be really happy about.

At the end of the day, my thinking is life's short and if I think that I might want to transition to a company that works on a product I can be passionate about and a location I like. However, I'm still in no place to be picky as a junior dev. Of course, there's still the possibility that I'm pleasantly surprised by the location/work environment. 

I'm curious if you all were in my position, what would you do. Would you start applying to other positions you like more immediately? Would you stick it out for a while, and if so for how long? Would you keep bettering your interview skills/improving your resume with side projects so that if your assumptions are true and you do want to jump ship fairly quickly you're ready?

Thanks for your input!"

I have two options that I would be ok with. The first option would be me going to law school. I had always wanted to go to law school and thought it would be a good idea. The downside to this is that because of my college major (CS), my GPA is in the low 3s. I'd enjoy being a lawyer, and reading and writing are typically my strong suits. The other option is to pursue a job as a software engineer. I had an internship at a very well-known tech company during college, however I did not get a return offer due to me not finishing my project fast enough. Also, coding is very difficult for me as it does not come easily to me which leads to a lot of burnout and frustration. During college I would see others put in similar work hours with CS as me and they seemed to understand the content more. This is what leads me to believe that programming isn't for me. The idea to go to law school came up recently. I had wanted to go into law since I was very young, but the money and lack of resources made that seem impossible. Now, I am in a better situation to where that could be a possibility. My question would be, should I continue to program and get a job in the SWE field, or should I go to law school?"

I’m a 4th year IT student about to be a senior, and as the title suggest, I have no idea what I’m doing. 

I thought I was average and doing ok until I started doing interviews to land an internship for this summer, and so far, it’s not looking good for me. 

I noticed that other students are already taking interests in some fields and areas? And would talk about it in their own interviews? Whereas I would only talk about basic course projects that I have done during my years. 

I quite honestly don’t know what kind of things I am interested in at the moment? And to be honest I also didn’t think I’d make it this far in college (and life in general lol) as I was struggling mentally, but I managed to have a somewhat good GPA (4.64/5), I’m a good student but I think a successful career in my major requires more than that. 


I’m fine with trying out things and getting a jumpstart from them, and maybe I can switch out later if I change my mind. 
So I thought about getting a security+ certificate this summer, but I don’t know what else to pair it with? Whether it’s another certificate or a training course.

I have a full time job in health care and am currently back in school in my second semester of CS as a transfer student. I truly do not think I have the option to pursue an internship for 2 major reasons:

1. And probably about 90% of my concern. Leaving my job to pursue an internship is not feasible as my job provides me with all of my benefits (quite good ones that are difficult to walk away from) AND they are paying for my school with a tuition reimbursement program. After life expenses that we all gotta pay, I truly don’t think I could be back in school without my job paying for it (I think it’s important to mention that I absolutely live within my means)

2. Going back to school after a years off, I transferred to a new university, and because I am a transfer student with a preexisting degree, I only have CS classes left to complete and only have 3 semesters left. I’m already a junior and have just the very basic fundamentals of Java and Python, nowhere near the knowledge to apply in a real world setting.

I am wondering what my options are here, has anyone had luck asking professors if research hours are possible or if there’s anything else I can do as volunteer work 1 or 2 days a week, or should I maybe keep doing what I’m currently doing and just building up my skills and create a portfolio.

I was looking for jobs and applying rigorously to them for 5-6 months. I quit my DevOps Internship on the first of May even though I had no other offer, because the workplace was toxic. So toxic that it made me write documentation for KT, took the documentation and ghosted me, didn't pay me for April and didn't give me my letter of experience, etc. 

After months of frustrations and immense stress, I've finally cracked an interview and I'm more or less joining my dream company. The benefits are insane, and in this market (even if the market was ok), i couldn't have asked for more. I'm talking about, WFH, MacBook, unlimited leaves, fun and healthy work environment, everything.

They wanted me to make a kubernetes deployment of wordpress, custom nginx (openresty lua) and MySQL, and then monitor nginx and my cluster using Prometheus and grafana, all using helm charts and K8s. **FOR AN INTERN POSITION.**

I did it. I picked Kubernetes up from scratch and after 3 sleepless days, i finished it. I was the only applicant who was able to give a proper, working assignment.

I cracked the rest of the interviews today, and I'm in my bed crying right now because I can finally be at peace. I can finally relax. I finally have a job, and I'm happy.

13w1y62,72,2023-05-30,I think i got scammed for an internship and idk what to do,Affectionate-Foot-41,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13w1y62/i_think_i_got_scammed_for_an_internship_and_idk/,"I won a startup internship at a competition organized by the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology (SCET) at UC Berkeley in October 2022, and the interview/acceptance process lasted from December 2022 to February 2023. Long story short, I got accepted and the internship was supposed to start 2 weeks ago, but I haven’t heard back from the company since April even though I’ve already followed up 2 times. I tried contacting the competition organizer too, but even she hasn’t gotten back to me yet.

It was kinda sus from the beginning since the CEO was very unresponsive whenever I talked to him, but I heard from several people that that was normal for internships and that they would get back to me eventually. 

What’s most frustrating is that
1. I put a lot of effort into the competition, and it’s just right that they give the prizes that they said they would since it was organized by SCET. I expected more professionalism from them
2. I’m an international student and I worked hard to get work authorization in the US for this internship. I also have to pay for summer units if I want to have an internship (which is very stupid), and I have to be in the US if I want to get paid for the internship legally. This means that whether I stay home or go back to the US during the summer could depend on whether or not my internship pushes through.

If anyone has some tips/advice, that would be great!! I just feel kind of cheated because I spent a lot of time and energy trying to get the internship and didn’t apply to anything else bc i thought i was gonna do this"

CS 170

CS 189

CS 162

CS 186

Data science majors have reserved seats in CS 170 and CS 189 and are maybes for the rest, but CS 70 is listed as a prerequisite for both courses while not being listed anywhere else in the data science major plan.

**Are CS prerequisites for the above classes enforced?** I know all the data science department courses are.

I don't want to take CS 70 because my semester will be extremely stacked, and I also want to avoid CS 61C because I want an internship over summer and I can only take it during then. I  would rather just self-teach the relevant concepts for the upper-div courses. Thanks. "

To be honest I'm frankly quite bad at mathematics, have poor work ethic at home, lazy outside of school, and lack motivation to continue doing stuff, but I acknowledge that I'll most likely need to learn and improve on myself (addressed a little later on). 

I wanna know what majors are worth taking or looking into (or some insight on those listed below). I'm no good at artistic stuff, and am not a very creative person (I prefer structure). I am taking an internship this year around being an appointment setter, to help me get used to talking and understanding people as I currently kind of suck with communication. 

I am no good at music.

I think I am good at English and literature but I'm not sure. Writing is a passion of mine, but not sure if it's a talent. I love reading as well.

I'm pretty much green in everything as I've never really had the chance to do much. I like science, biology and marine biology specifically, but I'm not sure if I am capable of going into that field. 

I'm in a Technology and Business magnet, but admittedly it is quite poor and I haven't learned much about businesses. I have no issue with a business major, though I lack experience in any of it.

I do like using computers, and did temporarily take an intro to engineering course that I kind of enjoyed, but I (unfortunately) had to take a temporary break from school for government stuff. Never got to go back to the class. 

I can't think of anything else to outline, I only ask that no one lectures me on this and that. I just want to know some majors worth looking into, they don't have to be super high paying but I do want to live a comfortable and happy life. 

Minor heads up, I've been effectively stunted in math.. Or it's more accurate to say I've never been taught it properly and been forced to actively learn rather than being outright 'bad' at it. 'Perk' of the USA education system. I do have all my math credits though.

Don't be concerned about just throwing me in the deep end with a major, it'd probably be good for me to try something legitimately challenging. If you're going to comment I'd also like for you to reply since I'm going to read everything.

Thank you for future responses (if I get any).

Stuff that peaked my interest somewhat, but I don't know much about:
Marketing 
Business Administration 
Human Resources (My mom took this)
English

13w34sg,102,2023-05-30,It’s finally OVER! Soldiers 🫡,chickwwn,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/13w34sg/its_finally_over_soldiers/,"I woke up from the fattest nap after conquering the toughest and final exam of my life. The four years of academic studies had been an exhausting journey, and there were moments when I was on the verge of giving up. But fueled by sheer determination, I pushed through.

In my second year, I made a bold choice to take a break from my studies, and luckily, I landed an internship as a junior engineer. It served as a much-needed escape from the overwhelming demands of academia that had left me feeling shattered. Little did I know that this experience would reignite my passion for engineering and mend my spirit.

As the day of the final exam approached, I entered the examination hall with a mix of nerves and excitement. Each question brought back memories of my internship, and I drew strength from that experience, knowing that it wasn't just a career but a deep-rooted passion.

Now, as I woke up from that refreshing nap, I felt a profound sense of liberation. The dreaded four years of academic studies were finally behind me. The results were yet to be revealed, but I had no doubts about the effort I had put in. I had poured my heart and soul into this journey, and regardless of the outcome, I had become a resilient and determined individual.

To all the engineering student soldiers out there who know in their hearts that engineering is their true calling, hear this: You've got what it takes! Finish strong, never give up, and remember that failure is merely a stepping stone on the path to success. When you stumble, pick yourself up, brush off the setbacks, and keep pushing forward. Embrace the challenges, for they will shape you into a stronger and wiser engineer.

It's time to plow through obstacles, shatter barriers, and carve your own path in the world of engineering. Believe in yourself, channel your passion, and let your dreams soar. The world needs engineers like you—innovative, determined, and ready to make a difference! 

GOOD LUCK SOLDIERS! 🫡"
13w383q,0,2023-05-30,Should I accept an offer that is filled with red flags? What do you think?,One-Pomegranate-6873,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13w383q/should_i_accept_an_offer_that_is_filled_with_red/,"Hello, I'm kind of in a weird situation and I'm not sure what to do. I got offered to join a startup based in Malaysia that is creating software for trading crypto, but I'll work remote in the US. It doesn't pay much (pays Malaysia swe intern salary so like 250 usd a month) but the software sounded really interesting. The issue is that the process for getting recruited was very suspicious. About a week ago, I saw a post on another career-oriented subreddit about looking for software interns. I messaged the poster and he asked if we could move to WeChat. I wasn't sure if this was a red flag or not because maybe other countries use other forms of communication idk. We then set up a call and talked for a lil. During this call, it seemed like he didn't tell me much info about his company, except that it was him and somebody else working on some high-frequency trading stuff for crypto, and I even had to ask him for the name of the company. After the call, I did some researching and it seems there are accusations of the company being a scam and some saying it isn't so I'm not sure. They don't have much of an online presence except their website. Even if the work I do is legit (which I think will be), I feel like this would be a huge red flag for recruiters and background checks. I'm not sure what I should do. The only other option I have is that I am working as an unpaid part time swe intern at a startup and I could probably get it extended into the summer. I think this would also look a lot more legit to recruiters since the US startup has more of an online presence."

Tomorrow my internship ends. I have been looking for a job since april, with no luck. I did get one interview and got rejected right there, bc I was still a student (this was a position in my career field). Jobs in other fields, that don't requier experience or education, just don't respond, bc there's like 100+ candidates for one position, sometimes even 1000+ (just saw a couple today). My biological father has been helping me survive by giving me 300 bucks a month, that I use for food, transport and necessities (soap, haircut, etc...). Thankfully, I'm living in a flat for free rn, with a rommate, who's the landlord's son, plus the ladlord also lives here, although he's no around much, just about 3 times a week he comes home... There have been plenty of problems with my rommate, esp since he really loves lying about eveything to his father, and obv nobody ever believes me or cares... People generally don't like me and they initially started helping me only bc my mother died last year and I had no where to live and no money, I was still a minor...So that's when my biological father decided to help me, but now he's not so eager... I refused to come to his son's birthday two months ago, because it was on the next day from my mother's passing, but he really didn't care and now he hates me bc of that... Last year he said he would pay for my driving school to get a driving licence, now he's telling me to get a job and constatly bellittles me... I already hated him a lot, for leaving my mother when I was born, I had to act nice so that he would help me, but this shit really depresses me... I don't understand how you can give no fucks your child this much to not want to pay 50 bucks for a driving school... I am so tired of doing this people pleasing persona, when I really want to drop all of these people who treat me like such dogshit... They all ignore me and isolate me, I don't even have any energy rn to write about how much shit I had to endure last year and this year also... I really want a job and move out asap, but the unemployment rate is so high here, esp for young people, it's basically impossible, if it's not in some specific career field. I feel like soon my father is going to drop me and the landlord (who's his friend) will kick me out. I have no idead what I'm gonna do in that scenario. I have managed to save some money and inherited some from my mother (very small number tho) so I could pay rent for a small room for maybe two months, but I don't think that I would be able to find a job in such a short time... Maybe I would have to move to another city... I have no idea. I am so scared and so alone. I literally don't talk to anyone thoughout the day. No friends or close family... idk... I'm so scared of becoming homeless."

I (23 F) honestly have no idea how to even begin describing the feeling I have toward college anymore. I am going on my 6th year of college and I just found out I failed one of my core classes. I have scraped by the past two semesters only worrying if I passed the classes not really caring about my overall GPA. I have no idea what I am doing anymore, I still have passion for the field I am in, however, I am scared for my financial future and if ill be able to find a job. There is immense pressure to go to graduate school, which I have wanted to do since high school, but now I am questioning if it is even worth it based on the price of living and being in debt. 

I am double majoring in physics and astronomy and from how my college has painted it, there is not much to do with these degrees without obtaining a PhD. I have research and publications under my belt but I have shit the past year or so with my grades, and everywhere is so competitive I just don't know how I'll even get into grad school anymore or how I'll be able to afford it. It has taken me so many years to get where I am now since I started at a community college (my GPA in high school was bad lol) and had to start from the *very* beginning of math/science courses (I'm talking like algebra).

 I thrived at my community college, getting on the dean's list almost every year, being friendly with the professors, honors programs, etc, and was able to transfer to a very good college. Once I transferred during COVID I failed 3 classes and was placed on academic probation. I got a really high GPA and got off, but then lost my grandfather to cancer and found out my grandmother had cancer within 3 months.  I have had a shit ton of other personal issues and my grades never really recovered after that first semester. Every time I get an A it feels like my GPA goes up like 0.05 points compared to failing or getting a C or B (my college does +- GPA). Overall, I am just paralyzed on what my next move is. I am even scared to look at my GPA to even try to apply to internships and I kinda have thrown the idea of graduate school right out the window. I am just looking if anyone has been in a situation like mine and what they did or how they improved themselves. I work part-time and I have ADHD but I have accommodations, I am just unsure where to turn or what to do."

I have no experience at all with comp sci, programming, etc. No matter how small or big the advice is just shoot it to me. Also tell me some of your personal experiences! Pm me or say it on the thread it doesn’t matter!

As far as my personal questions. Being I have no background in this field, what are some apps, software, reddit communities, etc. that will help me on this journey? When should I start applying to internships? How is the tech industry holding up as far as all the layoffs and such? 

Also for what it’s worth. I’m a 21 year old transfer student based out of North Carolina lol

13w826d,1,2023-05-30,Fresh Grad: I am confused for my first job. MT Program vs Direct Hire? Need decision ASAP!,coastalsnlattes,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/13w826d/fresh_grad_i_am_confused_for_my_first_job_mt/,"Hello guys,

Need some advice as a fresh grad this 2023 as I'm getting really confused on what's more worth it for my future career path. For context, I'm *a graduate of a Marketing course with a Bachelors & Masters Degree*. I've had a lot of experiences in the marketing industry for my internship, but most notable of all would be my *Unilever Brand Marketing internship for almost a year where I was given the role to act as an assistant brand manager* and tbh I really enjoyed what I did and the culture + learnings from that role was top notch as well.

However, while *I was given an offer in Unilever to get absorbed it wasn't in Marketing - it was in Customer Development / Sales as a Direct Hire* and the salary + benefits were really good tbh. I was really happy about this news and was gonna take it in a heartbeat, but at the same time *I also had 3 pending processes for 3 MNCs in FMCG (Nestle, L'Oreal, Colgate-Palmolive) for a Management Trainee role* that seemed very promising as I've been shortlisted into the last stages already for the first two.

**My dilemma now comes in here...**

I already have an offer with Unilever and HR is just waiting for my decision and I wanna wait for all results sana pero...

* I don't know how long can I delay my decision baka if I delay too much they might **rescind the offer**
   * If I say yes to this, I am concerned about my career progression (might take some time) + difficulty in shifting back to marketing
* Nestle & L'Oreal, while I did get in the final stages does not provide any guarantee that I'll get in the final roster. Colgate-Palmolive still in the early stages as they just reached out recently.
   * Why do I want these MT programs over Direct Hire?
      * Faster career progression & more exposure to different cross-functional units
      * End-goal for me is to eventually be in the Marketing department as a Brand Manager

In terms of factors to consider, such as location, benefits, pay, I don't really mind as my priority is very grounded on my long-term plans aka career progression + eventually staying in Marketing.

Hoping to get everyone's thoughts on this! I would really appreciate the guidance :)"

I plan to finish Level 3 here. 

I have 2 years of work experience in a big 4 firm doing DD and Vals work, 2 years of equity research work, and 1 year exp in a Renewable Energy company doing project finance (will likely stay here til I go to the US). I’d say my modeling skills are solid with modeling certifications. Currently not looking for a specific path as it will likely depend on the job market situation in the US for us, hence this post. But not leaning towards IB haha

I just want to know how’s the job market in US/California for us Filipinos/Southeast Asians? **Because I always see here that to get into a good company you have to graduate from a notable university in the US ++ internships and MBA?

Will it be different for us? If yes, may i know what type of companies would give a better chance to get into? As well as salary range (will this also differ)? 

Or does it not matter and its all gonna be the same as long as you are competent?

Any tips or advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!!"
13w9ast,90,2023-05-30,Fresh Graduate Job Hunt,Melerelepele,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/13w9ast/fresh_graduate_job_hunt/,"Hey fresh graduate of r/asksingapore, as we recently received our university results I would like to ask how is the experience of job hunting been for you?

I have been job hunting since Feburary and till now I still have no luck in getting a job. I have seen career coaches, customize my resume for each job, written cover letter for the job I really wanted and practice my interviewing skills using star method. 

I mainly aim for jobs which deals with AI/machine learning and my internship and projects were mostly on those topics. I explained what I did for internship/school during my interviews but it seems like it is for naught as I still get rejected all the same by government or private sector. I have also applied for jobs outside of my interest mainly in embedded software engineering/application engineer/system integrator but no interview offers were given to me. 

While some says it takes time to find the job you want, but I am trying my best to be patient by taking courses in Udemy not learned in school and mainly to keep myself distracted from all the rejection and waiting. 

Honestly, I am sick and tired of this bullshit as it is so tiring preparing for an interview and subsequently getting ghosted or rejected without any feedback given to me regarding my interview. All I want is get a job which allows me to deal with machine learning application but holy fuck the industry is so hard to break into as a fresh graduate. Now, I can see why people are becoming FA/Property agent. 

Sorry for the rant but I had to get this out after being rejected by yet another position which I felt I was confident in 😥.

TLDR: fresh graduate, apply for AI/machine learning engineer job, ghosted/rejected for months, sick and tired of bullshit, how is job hunting experience for graduating student(please tell me I am not alone in this)."

Any advice?",mikahir,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/13wanzk/im_an_incoming_freshman_majoring_in_cs_but_i_feel/,"I'm an incoming freshman planning to major in computer science with a focus in software engineering.

I've always liked things related to biology and medicine, but for a number of reasons, I decided to study CS instead. For my entire life, I've been vehemently against studying it, and have never seen myself pursuing it. I've taken a single programming class at a community college when I was in high school (Java), but dropped out halfway after failing the midterm. I hate math, I take a while to grasp concepts, and I'm uncomfortable with pretty much anything related to CS.

I'm scared that I won't do well in my classes (especially since I'm a huge procrastinator), that I won't be able to get an internship, and that I won't be able to get a good job, etc. I doubt that I'll spend a lot of my personal time working on projects and things like that. I'm also the type to put things off and ignore my work when I get stressed, so I can only imagine how that'll go.

However, I think CS may (???) be the best option for me right now. My dad is a software engineer and can definitely help me in my classes, I've heard the flexibility and work life balance are good, and I'll need the money since I want to live in Silicon Valley (which is where my family and I currently live as well).

I keep telling myself that the sacrifices I'll make if I study CS will be worth it, but I really don't know. I know it sounds like I want nothing do with CS, but it's not exactly that... I want to pursue computer science in the sense that I want the benefits, but I don't know if I'll be able to last (in college and the field).

If anyone has had similar experiences or has any tips and advice, please feel free to share!"

Intern at a Big MNC( Think Google/Microsoft)

Will be working at the same company for the next 2 years.

Realistically, what chance do I have for Stanford/MIT/Harvard/CMU/UIUC/UCB  MSCS?

Also, I don't have any research papers till now, but will be working on publishing them in the next 2 years. What papers/ specific areas should I focus on to increase my chances for a top-10 admit?

But at the same time these are core foundational CS mods so I’m worried SU-ing both would leave a bad impression on employers?

Also, I heard that SU-ing CS1101S means I wouldn’t be able to take certain selective modules like CS3217/CS3216? Can any seniors confirm pls thank you!

For context, SU-ing both these mods would raise my CGPA to 4.4 from 4 (cap if not su both these modules)

I know there are tons of SU-related qs on the forum alr but I haven’t quite found one that answers my concerns so I’d really appreciate any advice!

CURRENT STATUS WITH COMPANY A: nag accept pa lang ako kay company A through email 2 days ago pero wala pang reply. di pa din ako nag sign ng kahit anong contract. i heard they have their employees and interns sign an NDA.

QUESTIONS:
should i accept the interview request with company B or wait for company A to reply until june 4? should i email company A and inform them about it and negotiate sa salary kahit 8k man lang huhu + any ideas on how? 

COMPANY A VS. COMPANY B:

company A
- type: local digital marketing agency 

- salary & benefits: did not mention salary (probably unpaid), company events, flextime, opportunities or promotion, promotion to permanent employee

- work setup: remote/wfh

- schedule: 8 hrs, flextime

- contract: 3 months

- niches: pretty much everything (HUGE BENEFIT)

company B: 

- type: international IT company

- salary: 18k to 30k, 13th month salary, bonus pay, commission pay, overtime pay, performance bonus, yearly bonus

- benefits: health insurance, opportunities for promotion, pay raise

- niches: marketing analytics, market research, social media management

SUMMARY:
- company A: exposed in multiple digital marketing niches and industries but not paid.
- company B: will market their company, exposed to limited niches and paid. 

i think that company A will benefit me more in the long run, kaya lang di paid. di ko naman masyado kailangan ng pera sa ngayon but it’d be so nice to have tho 😢"

On almost every single ranking page Stony Brook is similar to BU in terms of ranking, I am aware that nobody can decide for me in terms of where I want to go but I would like some input or advice in this situation. Some factors I heavily consider are social life, job recruitment/internship opportunities, course curriculum and ability to network. (I am trying to become a software engineer with either school)  
I also have some questions for BU's CS program.

1. Is the course curriculum really mostly theory based and hardly teaches any applicable skills for a software engineer? 
2. Do you have to do a significant amount of self learning on top of BU's cs program if you want to become a software engineer?
3. What is the workload of the classes like? Is it possible to balance a job/fitness and school as a cs major?
4. How is the internship opportunities for CS at BU? 
5. Do most CS graduates end up finding a job easily after graduation or is it a struggle? 

The format of the post is really messy so I apologize for that but any input or advice would be greatly appreciated."

 Personally I have experience with JavaScript and PHP, but not with .NET or React. I'm definitely doing the first internship, but I'm confused what tech stack to pick for the online internship, which is going to be more laid back. At first I thought I should pick .NET since I plan to learn it some time in the future, but I was wondering if it's maybe too much to learn two new technologies at the same time. I definitely won't pick React since I don't want to learn the same thing at both internships. So, that leaves me with PHP which I have experience in, since I recently built a relatively complex website with PHP. What advice do you guys have, should I pick the language I have more experience in, or should I try to learn a completely new programming language for my second internship?

Keep in mind, that I am doing the React internship full-time."

7 years ago my parents separated and my dad remarried, he treated us pretty bad my mother and I ( even before getting married) but ever since he did, $hit got worse. 
( Still 7 y.a) So my dad made me talk to that woman even when he was not officially married to her, I never wanted to know her or talk to her but somehow my dad made it happen…She was kind to me and once they got married she became the worse person in the world. She lied so many times about me and that resulted in my father treating me in the worst way possible without me knowing why. He ended up not talking to my mom anymore and said some things about her to make me hate her ( he even tried to convince me to live with him), anyway she ended up pregnant and my father never told me, he called the day my little sister was born as if I knew all along. I WAS SHOCKED…but still I had to congratulate him…anyway bad treatment continued, he refused to let me go to college ( in my country you can’t work and study at the same time, your parents usually pay for your college fees etc…) anyway I had to convince him that the field I was going for was really important and will get me filthy rich for him to let me do it . 
Fast forward to today, he’s still paying for college, I can’t ask him to pay for my clothes ( Im wearing the same clothes since high school, im fine with it but for internships or when someone important comes and I have to be classy I can’t…) Everytime I ask to go to the doctor’s he says that I don’t need it and should just have whatever medication…Back when I used to see him and his wife she would brag about the pricey things that my dad would buy her and tell me maybe she can find something to give me , but when I tell him that the shoes I’ve been wearing for the past 3 years are destroyed he tells me that he doesn’t have money and that I should try to be more careful with my things….I want to ask him for more money bcs life is pretty pricey these days and I can’t even pay for one egg. I also have been sick for the past 3 weeks and can’t go to a doctor and the medecine that I bought didn’t work. Im afraid to ask him for more money.( My father is pretty wealthy but somehow can’t afford things when it comes to me). 

Im not being ungrateful, Im thankful he’s paying for college but still I can’t talk to him about things that are as important as studying.

Aanyway Im tired of this situation and don’t know what to do….Please some advice 🙏🏼

Ps: My mom ( doesn’t work because of my dad’s past promises) asks money from my grandma everytime Im sick because my dad won’t take me to the doctors…but still He’s MY father and he should pay for stuff like this"

Generally, fall intake is preferred over spring intake. But don't you think spring intake would be better if an international applicant changes his/her field, i.e., **from full-stack to AI/ML?** 

Spring intake will give them **summer break** after 1st semester where they can work on **building a solid profile** and then apply for the internships in Aug-Sep. On the other hand, if they choose fall intake they have to apply for an internship **as soon as 1st semester starts.**

Option 1 is to live 15 mins walk from the office, but it's 2k per month unfortunately cause I'm only there for 3 months. 

Option 2 is to sublet from college students, which is on average about 1k per month. However, I would need to commute 1-1.5 hour via public transportation to get to the office, and same thing going back. And this is in Atlanta btw, so the metro is supposedly not that reliable.

I work 8-5, so idk if I wanna spend so much time commuting. But I would like to live in option 2, since I want to be in the city and explore Atlanta during my free time. Traveling to the city from option 1 is harder to do cus there's less service on weekends. 

Just to clarify, the office is in a suburb, meanwhile I want to live in Midtown, Atlanta. And I do get a relocation stipend of 3.5k

Total comp (salary/bonus/401k match) is $110k currently. Very solid comp for my current situation, life is very comfortable. Thinking I would need total comp of at least $130k (ideally closer to $140k) in Denver to compensate for the increased COL such that quality of life/ability to save isn’t diminished too much.

Is this reasonable, or am I expecting “too much too soon”? I’m a CFA charter holder and have a solid credit and financial analysis background with 4 YOE at one of the largest commercial banks in the country, plus a couple of strong internships during college (double majored in Fin/Econ at a state school, definition of “non-target”)

Recently finished interviewing at a bank where the salary range was listed at $80k-140k. I requested base salary of $120k+. The interviews went insanely well (I tend to interview pretty well, but these were some of the better interviews I’ve had) but the offer they made was $85k + bonus… less than what I currently make in a low COLA. I even told the people that interviewed me that my primary motivation in looking for a change was to earn enough money to adjust for the higher COL. I didn’t tell them what I currently make, so maybe they assumed $85k + bonus was an increase, idk.

TLDR, is $130-140k in total comp in a high COLA an unreasonable ask at age 27 regardless of background and credentials, or is it attainable?"
13wo0fm,1626,2023-05-31,TIFU by destroying my relationship because of a friend,throwaway_photog762,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/13wo0fm/tifu_by_destroying_my_relationship_because_of_a/,"I (22F) had been going out with my ex boyfriend (31M) for about 9 months. About 6 months ago I started my job which was my first job since graduating college. I worked at this job during a summer internship and they hired me back after graduating. Since I started the job, I made friends with the same people I was friends with during the internship, including a girl who I will refer to as friend 1 (26F). My ex was convinced that friend 1 had a crush on me even though she didn’t. She shaved her head and has a different sense of style but she isn’t gay/bi. Her and I went to the same gym and we would often go together with two other coworkers. She has helped me when I was in a very bad place mentally because she has been through similar experiences. About 3 months into the relationship, he had to leave for a month for work. Because I had recently graduated college, I didn’t have a lot of friends because they were either still at college or they lived far away. Friend 1 and some other coworkers were my only friends during that time. I really got to know all of them and I enjoyed hanging out with them all. My ex didn’t like that, especially since we were long distance. After 3 more months, I canceled my gym membership and stopped hanging out with my coworkers as much, and that included friend 1. She would still text me occasionally, especially if she was having a bad day. I told me ex that I wasn’t hanging out with her outside of work and that I would avoid her more at work. I stopped going to team sponsored events outside of work to avoid her because he didn’t like her. 
This past Thursday she was having a really bad day and said some things to make me worry for her mental health and safety. I offered to go on a walk with her for a bit to help her calm down. On Saturday, my ex and I were driving to go camping, a 3 hour drive, and he started looking through my messages. This isn’t he first time he has done this. He would go through my phone a lot when I was sleeping to see if I was texting friend 1. He did see the message about me asking her if she wanted to go on a walk and he got pissed. He told me I lied to him and betrayed him. He said friend 1 ruined the relationship. We ended up camping anyway and he kept bringing it up throughout the weekend. On Monday we got lunch at a restaurant before driving home and he told me to choose between him and getting rid of her in my life. I told him that I wasn’t going to choose. As long as I still work at that job, there’s no way of avoiding her. I can’t leave the job because I don’t have enough work experience to get another one with the same salary. He got mad at me and started yelling at me telling me again and again that I destroyed the relationship. He also threw a water bottle at my car and it bounced back and hit me. It was a very long and awkward ride home. He called me the next day to continue insulting me and telling me how much I ruined the relationship. I broke it off with him after he kept calling me and insulting throughout the night knowing I had early meetings in the morning. I ended up going to the hospital on Tuesday because I had a panic attack that caused sever chest pain, which made me miss a day of work. He is convinced that I destroyed the relationship even though I already lost a friend (friend 1), gave up grad school, a gym membership, and a lot of money on a vacation my ex and I were supposed to go on. I gave up weekends with my family and friends to stay with him where we wouldn’t leave his apartment because he didn’t want to run into anyone he knew. 

TLDR: ex made me choose between him and a friend, I refused to choose, he told me I destroyed the relationship.

Edit: I feel like I FU because he told me I could have stopped the friendship sooner, as soon as he told me about being uncomfortable with the friendship.

Edit 2: I put an update in the comments but I’ll post it again up here. Insert the “I didn’t know this would get so much attention”. Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment to help me open my eyes to all of the BS I went through. Thanks for pulling me out of this self pity party too. 

To those who commented about spacing and syntax: I was a crying mess when I wrote this in the notes app on my phone. I apologize. 

Friend 1 update: she was completely understanding when I told her about the situation. She was proud of me for standing up for myself. I’m lucky to have her, other friends, and my family as a support system. My mom told me she was proud of me today and her and I cried together. 

Ex update: BLOCKED! I’ll figure out how to get my stuff later, I need to focus on my health now. 

Health update: I have to wear a holter monitor for the next two weeks to monitor my heart. I was told stress and anxiety make it worse and was given a prescription for anti anxiety medication. It was medicine I used to take and I’m going to give it a try to see how I feel. 

Vacation update: my mom and I are taking a girls trip together. Not to the same location (my ex’s home country) but to go visit my aunt who lives in a beach house. Plus, my best friend (EDIT: different friend since high school) invited me to come with her to visit her home country later this year! 

And most importantly, grad school update!!!! I’m sending the deposit as soon as I get my paycheck on Friday. My job is paying for some of it so thankfully money won’t be something to stress about too much. 

Thank you so much again to everyone for opening my eyes and helping me start this healing journey. I appreciate you all ❤️"

The last two months I have been strengthening my body and recuperating from all the mental stress that I took over the duration of my cancer. Needless to say because of my cancer I have not been able to secure an internship in either my 3rd year or 4th year. My college has been quite understanding and have waived my attendance requirement and one of my internship requirements thus allowing me to graduate this summer. 

Due to the cancer have professional and personal growth have crawled to a standstill, I haven' t really learned anything new in the past year. Also have delayed my plan of going to the US for masters indefinitely. 

While this post may sound like a pity post I assure you it is not meant to be one, this post is solely asking for advice from seasoned industry professionals on what should I do now? At this moment I am extremely confused on what should I learn and how should I approach my career? 

I am kind of good at frontend development also have basic knowledge about C++ and Java, J2EE, JSP, Core Java. For my final year project I made a basic NES emulator in C++.  I would appreciate any advice on what to learn next, currently I am learning AWS and basics of cloud but do not have enough knowledge to confidently apply for positions.

Gonna keep this short.

I am a college grad with a Computer Science degree I also have two previous internships at a well-known Cybersecurity company. Unfortunately, during my job search I was offered a great position at a government agency but it was just 60 miles away from my house and was in person everyday.

I have applied to a bunch and have since accepted a job as a IT Data Coordinator which pays less and  is a mix of helpdesk/hospital data. I do not have to commute as much for this role.

My question is how do I get more into the security world and get to the second job? Or should I even be thinking about that already, should I just try to do the best job I can now even if I don't code or use many things learned from my degree?

I have been studying for Sec+ as a start and already have a ISC2 CC cert and a AZ-900 cert. I want to do cloud or cyber and have been very confused on where to go.

Any advice is appreciated!"

What’s the next couple years going to look like in terms of internships and my future once I graduate with my undergrad degree?

I understand it’s rough right now but I’m wondering what the future seems like? 

I’m a fairly decent student with a good resume so I’m hoping to maybe get a FAANG level internship before senior year so I can get into FAANG by graduation. Bloomberg hires a lot of SWEs from my school and so I think if internships aren’t that good, I could possibly look into FAANG level within 5 years of graduating?

Does this seem realistic? I’ve already started leetcoding before our DSA course and im taking a competitive programming course next semester which is just two LeetCode Medium’s a week."

Ideally, I want to either be able to find a job after my current full-time internship is up (july of 2024) or go into grad school for my masters. I would have two years experience by the end of this internship.

My relevant undergraduate degree is in economics, which is technical is some regard but not something like CS or statistics. Currently a senior research assistant at an economic think tank. My work involves a lot of scripting and production of several indices. I use a lot of R, some python, some SQL, and a decent amount of Tableau. Additionally, we interact a lot with business clients and C-suite level executives and therefore I have a decent understanding of what stakeholder needs, and translating more technical concepts for a wider audience. For my personal project at work, I decided to try and build a model to predict salary using an extensive dataset of online job postings so I can have an actual project under my belt; however this is the first time I will be doing any modelling and am learning on the fly. At the moment, I am going through a python textbook (Head First Python) and a machine learning textbook (Hands-On Machine Learning) to assist in that regards.

I am a little concerned that I lack the technical skills of entry level people in the field. For example, I did not take probability or linear algebra during university. I am however, following the MIT online  Linear Algebra class but I am not sure if employers or masters programs really consider that as legitimate. I plan on doing a probability class later this year when I have more time. I do have a solid understanding of statistics due to the economics degree, and completed a substantial senior thesis doing regression analysis on the economics of crime. I also lack computer science skills that a lot of others have (I see tons of posts around here with terms I have not heard of).

Am I on the right path when it comes to entering the data science space? What other resources should I look into as well? By the end of my internship, should I be looking at grad school or trying to get a more entry level data science focused position? I think I would prefer finding another job versus grad school, just at a cost level, but will go to grad school if its a must/recommended. I think right now if I were to go into another job, it would probably have to be something along the lines of data analyst rather than ML related, too.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I do well in college. I’m on track to get a first class hours next year when I graduate but it’s not because I’m an amazing coder. I’d even say I’m pretty average if even,  and I only do well because I study more than the norm, but the thing is I spend a lot of time working on tasks and understanding and reasoning assignments and just writing little notes on what to do and I always get it right in the end even if it takes time

I’m on an internship right now and I’m completing the stories however I find I’m working so much hours just because I want to get the stories done by the deadline and whenever I have questions I always send my manager extremely detailed messages pin pointing everything I’ve done and where it’s going wrong

Do you think he finds this annoying? I’ve done it twice so far. I just don’t pick up things fast. Will it be hard for me to secure a good role ?"

It gets easier and easier, and then one day it all falls apart and you realize that you're still the same piece of shit terrified of talking to other people and being seen in public.

Today was my last exam (I'm at university, 4th year without talking to anyone, I love it) and I'd started to make friends with a girl over the last few months (we were doing an internship together, I hadn't seen the rest of my class since). It was the last exam, so we were going back to campus just for the occasion and I thought ""I'm going to meet her friends, she's going to make me part of the group, it's going to be cool"" and the moment I saw them, I froze. All my anxieties came flooding back. I smiled vaguely at her and hid in a corner of the hall. For 20 minutes everyone around me was chatting, talking about classes, laughing and I just stood there in the shadows, more terrified of people and my loneliness than of the exam I was about to take.

The exam went well. I went home and collapsed in a way I rarely did. I'm scared because I promised her I'd come to a party with the whole graduating class tomorrow. At the time I thought it was a good idea, a good workout, that I was getting better. But it's a shit idea, because I'm a stupid asocial, I'm not ready and I never will be. They'll never integrate me because I don't make an effort and they have no reason to like me if I don't talk to them. I hate myself for being so stupid, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself. Relapses hurt so much

I'm sorry to complain, it's just that the anxiety is too much to handle, and lying on my kitchen floor, I couldn't find anything else to calm me down than talking about it. I hope you had a good day."

I'm trying to set up python on a Windows computer to run some scripts to migrate from an old PBX server. We have our own internal PKI and the certs are in the wincertstore. The pbx uses our certs (although for the API, it might use it's own signed cert). Either way, since it's going away, I don't really want to fix certs on it. I'd rather have python ignore these errors just to get through an intern being able to use it to pull some data, migrate users, and be done with this thing.  
I'm using the ciscoaxl module which in turn relies on requests. I've read a ton of posts about how to ignore SSL certs when using requests, but how can I do that when it's just another module calling (ciscoaxl) calling requets? I think my best bet is an environment variable but I cannot find one other than to point it at a CA bundle (and not totally clear how to make that in windows).  
Either way, is there a way I can pass verify=False in to the ciscoaxl module for requests to then ignore it? Is there an env var I can set to do it globally? Or do I basically need to pull the module's source and update the code for my own use?"

I’ve been at my current internship for over a year now and have been praised for my accomplishments since joining the company. I’ve done good work and have been told to expect a conversation about potential employment for a long time. 

Finally those talks happened, but they eventually shifted into them having to list the job outside and search for candidates before giving me an offer for diversity reasons. I was told to throw my hat into the ring back in March and since then I’ve been asking for updates or that job listing’s progress has been mentioned in meetings every now and again. I’ve just been told, “this has been taking a while and there’s lots of interviews etc.” in recent weeks. So it’s been 2-3 months of just waiting for an answer on whether or not that FT spot has been filled or not. 

Earlier this week, I went on teams and accidentally opened an org chart and noticed a new name for the role. My company must’ve filled it a few days ago, the new hire hasn’t been trained or anything yet, but they’ve been hired and added to the system. I’ve heard nothing from my bosses and have been working with them like there’s been no change in routine. I found out myself and am waiting for them to finally say something. 

This is really frustrating because it’s been months and months, and I’ve been told to just stay patient. Then when they hire someone I don’t even get word of it. My current intern role is being replaced by an undergrad, as that’s what the position is for. So now I have to turn around and find a job very quickly.

My job search has been a long one, I’d say since January or February I have been putting in applications 1-2x a week and I’d estimate well into the 100-120 range. I primarily use LinkedIn or Indeed. I think my resume looks good, as I’ve spent a lot of time refining it. So the job search is frustrating. 

I have 4 years of internship experience and I’m looking for an entry level role. I’m often ghosted by companies or hear back much later. I do not have the privilege of rich parents who have connections, so I must make them all on my own. People in my network who do happen to have jobs often have ones with security clearances or jobs that are requiring tons of experience. 

I don’t know what to do, but I need to find something by July or I’m SOL. 

TL/DR: recent grad who has an expiring internship that has taken too long to give an official word on a full-time position. They finally filled it a few days ago but haven’t said anything. I’ve been on and off job searching and have had horrible results. Need advice."

I am currently a rising senior majoring in computer engineering. I wasn't able to secure an internship this summer so I wanted to come up with ideas for projects.

One of my project ideas is creating a police speed gun that uses LIDAR to measure the speed at which a vehicle is moving. I was thinking of buying a LIDAR sensor to measure the vehicles speed and using a microcontroller to perform the logic of calculating the speed and displaying it onto an LCD screen.  I know I could also use a doppler radar sensor to also to measure speed, but I want to know if this is possible with LIDAR sensors.

These are some of the LIDAR sensors I was thinking of using:

My goal is to work as SWE in a big tech. I’ve been applying to full time positions in faang-like companies the past 2 months. I have a BA in CS and am currently enrolled in an online MS in CS. I know the current climate is bad for SWE job seekers, but I’ve had zero luck scoring any interviews for a full time position. 

I don’t know if it’s because companies get turned off when they see I’m still studying for a masters degree, or they don’t see any high profile companies in my work experience. I’m even wondering if trying to get an internship (on account of me pursuing an MS) is possible/better in order to get my foot in the door. 

Do I just keep applying and hope for the best? Should I quit my job to finish my masters sooner?"

 I currently have an internship as a technical support employee and I was tasked on fixing some computers and printers for a department with another coworker, I ended up solving the problem with the PC quickly, but the moment I plug the printer it starts printing a bunch of things and wastes about 10 papers

One of the employees sees this and accuses me of ruining the printer and wasting their paper, and demands that I get them a new bundle of paper and replace the ""broken"" printer, and for the first time in a long time I defended myself saying that it wasn't my fault that the printer did what it did instead of apologizing and accepting the blame!!!!

This really filled me with joy & confidence, I'm finally breaking out of my shell :)))! 

To whoever ended up reading the entire post thank you for your time!"

I worked as a sde intern (6 months) for a ed startup. They are quite popular on twt.

Then I switched to a very early stage startup. The wind was not our way and two months into it we couldn’t raise anything. 

My experience has been with react, tailwind, building chrome extensions and tinkering with ai.

I am in my final year of college(Tier 2) right now. Also in banglore for now. 

My priorities in order:
Energetic team focused on building quality stuff.
Culture conducive for learning both tech and non-tech.
10-12 lpa in hand (no perks needed as such).

If you have some advice for attaining above goals, be it as specific as a company list or a generic overall advice please feel free to drop :)"

I am currently a rising soph majoring in ORIE. Unfortunately, I was unable to secure an internship for this summer. I would appreciate it if upperclassmen and alumni would be kind enough to share their summer and academic term experiences with me.

As I am a bit lost on where to go with this major. Possible routes have been to double major in CS,  go into machine learning, consulting, or the healthcare field.

Additionally, I am curious to know where this major can take me and what skills I need to develop for an internship or research in this field. Thank you to anyone who replies!!

And please let me know if I can PM you to further inquire about the major, internships, and other questions if you are an ORIE or CS major!"

At the time that I got my intern offer, I knew that I got by solely with personality and not so much with technical skills. That part is important because now I’m really struggling with my project. It’s in languages and environments I’ve never used, I’m having such a hard time getting the programs to even run, and the previous intern was some god-like figure whose expectations unfortunately fell onto me. The only solace I take is in the fact that I’m only two days in and can show improvement, but so far this internship has been so out of my league. Has anyone had similar internships, and how did they deal with those internships?"

Just created this account to not get identified lol. I'm from the southern parts of BC, Canada. I've listed my academic stats and some of the extracurriculars I'm most proud of. I won't include awards/publications as I don't want to be identified just yet. Please note that I'll be quite vague with a few of them, as I don't want to get identified 😅. I also have a few questions for you guys at the bottom of this post, so please answer them if you do know what to do!

**INTEREST: BUSINESS AND COMMUNICATIONS**

**MY ACADEMIC PROFILE:**

My Citizenship: Canadian and Japanese (will apply with Canadian one?)

Gender/Age: 16 (making my IB examination session in May 2024 🙏🏻)

Demographic: Wasian, middle income (European dad, Japanese mom)

SAT: 1550 (superscore), 1520 (highest w/o superscore)

GPA: I do the IB program, with a few APs as my IB school did not offer them. I just finished my DP1 finals, and am sitting at a 42/42 (excluding TOK/EE, as my school is not including them for the DP1 report card). My course selections are:

IB Film HL - 7

IB English Lit HL - 7

IB Biology HL - 7

IB Spanish HL - 7

IB Math AA SL - 7

IB Geography SL - 7

TOK - predicted 9/10 on my exhibition, haven't gotten my EE back yet. I wrote it in English.

Note - I don't think I'll get a 45/45 IB. Biology HL is getting pretty hard with all this plant stuff.

In terms of APs, I did:

AP Arts and Design - 5

AP Music Theory - 4 (I took this to prepare for my RCM theory exam - WILL NOT INCLUDE!)

AP Spanish Lit - 5

APUSH - 5

Research: Collaborated on a paper with some researchers from CERN through a Stanford professor (I took a chemistry ""summer course"" with him and was invited to do research - he had excellent connections, and I am still very grateful for that opportunity!)

Currently conducting independent research in my science lab at school. Getting my research supervised by my PHD science teacher. I want to submit it to some journals before the regular applications.

*What I think: I think my academics are a relatively strong part of my profile. But, with many things, I can also be wrong. If there are some things that I should add/get/try, please let me know in the comments or DMs! I'm a very open person, and would love to chat about anything.*

&#x200B;

**MY EXTRACURRICULAR PROFILE:**

* FOUNDED A COMPANY BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA:

Essentially, my team (credit to them! I would not be able to do much without them) and I help big brands more on the financial and marketing side. We've been grateful enough to be recognized by the Canadian Government, and have worked with brands such as Lululemon and Canadian Tire. On the media side, we're currently working on securing something with Apple (sorry, can't share more details about it here), and have signed a partnership with Facebook (for our gaming sector), and the photography sector has been recognized and promoted by Nikon. We've been sent a few of Nikon's gear to test out - again, very grateful. We're also in the works in something with the New York Times for the news/media newspaper we own... very excited for it!Currently, we generate around 90k USD per annum. No more details will be shared about finances until the management team release the August financial report to the team.

&#x200B;

* TRACK AND FIELD:

I run the 100m/200m/400m/4x100m/4x400m relays. However, I'm pretty bad at everything except the 100m, where I've run a 11.14 (PB, legal, wind-aided (slightly)). Went to Canadian nationals with that score for my youth category (this was in 2022). Going to BC Champions for all events listed this year.

&#x200B;

* EDUCATION NON-PROFIT (FOR STEM RELATED SUBJECTS):

The non-profit works partially with the IBO as well as Crimson Education and the CEMC (@Waterloo, Ontario) to provide mathematics and STEM education for people less privileged in BC.

&#x200B;

* INTERNSHIP

Internship @ Paramount over the summer. Very cool experience. Parents did not have enough money to fund the trip, so did it myself with my portion of the income with the media business.

&#x200B;

* BUSINESS NON-PROFIT:

We've currently helped around 3k students compete in business competitions (and win!). Business non-profit can be considered a ""sector"" of the media business, ig.

&#x200B;

* MUSIC:

ARCT! I also love producing DNB and hip-hop, and may be getting a record deal to Interscope for it! Got some connections I'm trying to work with to get that to happen quickly. Also am part of a band that performed at some summer festivals in West Vancouver, BC, Canada & elderly homes, as well as street performances. By doing this, we've raised around 5k for dementia.

//

I am aiming for universities like McGill, Waterloo, some of the UCs (UCSD, UCLA, UC Berkeley), Upenn Wharton (why not), Harvard (why not), and Stanford (why not - might as well give it a try).

**NOW, SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU GUYS:**

What should I add?

Is there anything I'm forgetting?

Should I re-take my SAT? I think 1550 is a bit low compared to what you guys are getting.Is it good to see IB and AP at the same time on applications? I'm fine with not including my APs since I will get my IB Diploma (hopefully).

Feel free to DM me! I want to partner and work with you guys (either on research or extracurriculars) and partner and branch out."

I will graduate from a mid-tier university this summer for my undergrad. I study Political Science. The first two years of my undergrad life were horrible. I failed and Ced and got academic warnings. After I decided my major in PoliSci, I managed to get my GPA to exactly 3.0 with a major GPA of 3.30. It is still horrible but at least an average B. 

I am now considering applying for grad schools for the next spring term. I got recommendation letters from 3 of my professors, but I am still unsure what to do. Should I even try out for the programs in the top universities? Cause I don't think I stand a chance. I got two internships, one of them was like a business assistant, and the other was an interpreting job for an exhibition(for a little company in the same industry). My dream would be pursuing a dual-degree program like a MPA/MBA, but I am sure I won't be accepted under any circumstances. 

I wish I could have all 3 of my professors write 15 letters for me so I can lottery through all the top programs. Sadly this is not going to happen, so I really need some advice on program selections. Guys I know I am doing horrible so please roast me, just gimme some advice."

Am I just supposed to grind out some projects and try to apply before the end of Fall? My resume is just going to be the UC Berkeley name and 2 mid projects maximum in this scenario.

Howdy everyone! So, I know there's a working hours cap if you're an international student. 20hrs part-time during semesters, and 40hrs full-time during academic breaks. 

I was wondering about the income sources, wage, taxes, tips (if there are any, I don't know how much I should count?). How much would I be able to earn after taxes in a year as an International student? 

Also, I've heard about paid internships for STEM majors, which pay more than minimum wage. I've applied for Computer Science in FIU, so I'm curious about how likely it is you'd land a stem major job and whether it'll make any difference compared to minimum wage.

Any experienced tips on this matter would help a ton. The more detailed, the better. 

Thanks a bunch in advance!"
