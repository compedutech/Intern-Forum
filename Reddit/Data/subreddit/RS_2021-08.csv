I'm 22, in school to become a psychologist, because I myself could understand how it feels to have mental health struggles. I saved money to go to therapy last year, which helped me a lot not to fall into depression this year. 

However, this summer I made the mistake to overload my schedule because I was so motivated to get into grad school this year (applying very soon). I have a weekend job, did a summer class, started an internship while working on my thesis and volunteering. I did very poorly on my class, which is going to lower a lot my gpa and making me super nervous. My new boss at my weekend job was upset at me at first because I couldn't answer her email in time, but I feel like it's better now. I couldn't devote that much time to my thesis (necessary to go to grad school), so my teacher gave me a number of participants to recruit by the end of the month or he's going to drop me, which is also making me very anxious. 

Everything was doing well with my internship supervisor for who I'm doing research and writing an article, except I had to get it done by this week and I'm nowhere near finished because I'm so burnout by this crazy summer. All I do all day long is stay in bed. It takes everything in me to get up and get dressed. I took last week off and told her I was sick and would finish by next week. She send me an angry email back saying she expected me to be done and I was very behind. She implied she didn't believe I was sick (ans also the 2 other times I had to delay work a bit) and it was just an excuse. Ealier this summer, I had an asthma attack and had to go to the hospital. A couple weeks ago, I also got into a car accident. Thankfully I was fine, but it was pretty traumatizing to witness and it definitly have been a turning point. Truth is I'm not sick physically, I'm just burnout and need a little bit of time but unfortunately employeers don't seem to understand that very well, so I'm scared to be upfront since she already mentionned she has been too nice and doesn't really believe the 2 previous accidents.

I was wondering what to do because I'm not okay mentally at all. I'm trying to advance the project but I need more time to myself. The stress and pressure of having to finish and the thought of having to talk to her irl again is consumming me idk what to do. I thought about saying I have covid, but I don't want to lie. I just want her to understand I needed more time. I think I can get some things done by Monday evening, but she'll be expecting an answer and I want it to be convincing so she isn't so upset.

I'm an Asian college student in the US, studying Computer Science at a Top-80 (not sure if this is relevant but rankings might make it easier to get a VISA/Permanent Residency) Midwest state school, and will graduate with no debt. I wanted to think long-term (around graduation in 2024-2027), and upon reflection, I would like to move to Ireland, somewhere a bit cooler, as over the years, the Midwest has continuously gotten hotter (of course, there are other significant reasons that I won't mention). I also currently hold 2 citizenships, (USA, Canada).

In terms of prior experience, I visited Europe in 2015, and loved it, however, I did not visit Ireland, assuming it is similar to the UK in culture. I understand that Ireland requires you prove you can sustain yourself for a few months or so, and for that, my plan is to continue working during the school year, and get internships in the summer, so I should have enough saved to prove I can live independently for some time. In terms of languages, the only ones I know are English, Hindi, some French/German, and if you want to count it's similarity to Hindi, Urdu/Punjabi. Out of respect for their culture, I was also planning on taking a few classes in Irish, and learning a few of the basic phrases.

I was considering 3 different paths to Ireland.

1. Work for 1-3 years in the US, then apply for sponsored jobs in Ireland.
2. Apply for a masters (either an MBA or MSc) in Ireland, then begin the transition to work and stay there.
3. Apply directly to jobs in Ireland, and have a company sponsor my move.

With that information in mind, I had a few questions:

1. Where can I learn more about the requirements and the process to move to Ireland?
2. If I wanted to take a partner, would more limitations be applied to immigration?
3. Where are the tech hubs in Ireland, what is the culture like in those cities, and in Ireland as a whole?
4. Is it possible to transfer from my school to an Irish one, where I would be able to do an undergraduate in CompSci?
5. Would learning Irish increase the odds of a sponsorship to move there?
6. Is there a prevalent culture of racism, or is it relatively accepting?
7. Is there anything else I haven't mentioned that could provide a route to Ireland?
8. Lastly, if anyone has any general comments to make, or knows anything about Computer Science job culture in the country, please, send me a DM or write about your experience below!

They have the impression that I will become perm after 6 months.

However when I entered the company, it just seemed to go downhill for me everyday.

People in the department are burnt out. Required to work on Medical Leaves. Leaves require valid reason even though it is an entitlement. Not to mention stingy and micromanaging boss where everything has to go her way from the way you dress to the colour of folder you used.

A system message sent by the CEO encourages us to ""do. do. do."" ""get out of the way early in the morning and the rest of the day is pure fun"" like what?

That message he sent is already giving me bad vibes but I just went on and tried my best at the job.

The whole company seemed to have an OT culture where literally no one goes home till late evening or night. Work ends on 5.30pm. During the interview, HR told me they had a before time culture: report 15 mins earlier and go back 15 mins late. I was like ok that wasnt that bad considering I did that for years at my part time job. 


So came 5.45 after my first day and I had nothing left to do but my mentor didnt say I could go. And i was afraid to ask as I didnt want to leave a bad impression. So i waited till 6.30 before picking up my bag and decided to leave. The rest of the colleagues are still working. Apparently my mentor said there's still the daily reflection to write but since I switched off the desktop, then its ok i can just leave. (I have to write a daily reflection and a weekly report on friday) And i felt so bad because i felt bad for leaving? Like that night I felt so stressed somehow and just wanna cry at the thought of the remaining months in the company. Prior to this job i have worked in fnb biz for 4 years but this is the first time i feel so emotionally stressed about a job till i wanted to cry. My partner was like saying as long as you finished your job for the day, just leave by 5.45 but then again I was reluctant to cos i didnt wanna leave a bad impression.

my parents suggested i stayed for the 6 months just because the pay was not bad but just leave latest by 6. my friends suggested i leave but i really wanted to collect the 6 months of experience before finding another but its really hard to hold on.

next my contract stated i can claim OT. however I asked my mentor she said no, so i checked with HR who said yes depending whether I had the approval of my immediate supervisor and learning and teaching outside of work hours didnt count. After that a few minutes later, she said to meet me to discuss the OT. We met next week and she said there was an error in contract. As i make above the salary cap I am not liable to claim and they put the clause in there by mistake lol. nothing i can do but to fake laugh and go back to work.

since then, i try to leave by 5.45 and I dont bother about the OT. Then few days ago my mentor messaged me to not be calculative with the hours contributed to the company. As it will reflect badly on myself. I didnt bother replying her. My contract hours stated 8.30 - 5.30 then ill work till that time. 

I had an intern friend told me there was once an intern who did that and the colleagues werent happy and claimed that she had no team spirit. I live near the intern and she was happy to have a going home buddy but then colleagues told her not to give me the impression that i can leave on time... (which she told me on the first week) when i knew that i felt really sick in my stomach.

now i know why their turnover rate is high.

Its just my first month here and i find it hard to hang on but i have to. How do i tell them im not intending to stay? Any motivation to stay in a company with such work culture?

I guess  i know what to look for when job searching next time.

Any tips and advice is greatly appreciated!

Sorry for the long post but i felt I needed to let it out. thank you for reading"

Not making this a sob story, just statement of facts; I had no car in college and my college did not allow for remote/online internships. So I took class credits as an internship instead. I have one now and I'm working on my liscense. I got a Bachelor's in Information Technology, concentration on Network Administration. I had plenty of hands-on lab experience and I'm confident that with proper employer training in the position, I could become a competent ""Junior Network Administrator"" or similar for a small company to start. I was an Operations Support Rep for Jackson Hewitt, temporary for the tax season, but was general Tech support for how to use their websites and tools.

My chosen university is the college of my dreams, and one I've planned to attend for some time. I've a scholarship from the aforementioned college, among several other scholarships given to me by outside organizations. To top it off, I have just gotten a paid internship at a magazine in the city my college is located in, an exceedingly rare thing for a college freshman. By all accounts, I should be happy. Yet that is not the case. Consistently, I fear I'm slipping up, or not working hard enough, or am in some sense a fraud, coasting through life based on people's perceptions of him. Every moment I sit still feels like one I could be spending on work or academics, and I spend that time imagining other young people surpassing me, professionally and academically.

Beyond this, I've had a largely depressing personal life. I have  never had a relationship, and have not yet  kissed another person.  I do not have a driver's license, and don't own a car, decreasing the likelihood of me being desirable. Despite academic successes, other people my age have lived fuller, more enjoyable lives., and are no doubt happier as a result.  They've loved, and have a level of freedom which I've never have, and, seemingly, never will. I picture myself taking a shuttle from my college to my job, or asking friends to drive me back to my dorm, and I become deeply sad. No amount of accolades or recognition will make not having a car at age eighteen acceptable. No number of academic honors will make people stop themselves from cringing when I awkwardly attempt to flirt with them.  I feel as though my strides at excellence are nothing more than an attempt to hide one crushing, horrible reality: I am, at the end of the day, a loser. Nothing will ever change that irrevocable fact. Am I being too hard on myself? Is my mindset warranted? Most importantly, how do I stop this toxic view if myself from ruining my life?"

Does anyone have any tips, resources, advice, etc for building large scale projects that are iterated on constantly by multiple people? For context, I am a recent college grad working as an intern software engineer. I'm hoping to improve my abilities, and I think the next step for me is to learn some of the bigger concepts behind software engineering, ie. design patterns, programming with scalability in mind, security, making my code clear/writing documentation, and other general knowledge for working on large projects as part of a team. Obviously some of these skills can only be mastered with experience and time, but if anyone has any advice or supplements to help speed up the learning process, I am all ears.

I am planning to study in the business school next year (about to finish year 12) and had a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it difficult to make the 93 ATAR? I understand how bonus points work but I was sceptical about how many people make it. My estimated is about 89 right now and i'm hoping my school rank boosts me for my subjects.
2. BCom/Info Sys vs. BCom/Arts? I've heard BCom/Info Sys is pretty saturated now and that it's going to be very employable in the near future. I have an interest in some of the majors that Arts offers but I'm not sure if it's better to pursue my personal interests (arts) or pursue technology in info sys. Also, does info sys involve/require lots of maths? I do Math Adv right now with decent marks, but not really interested with numbers.
3. How do majors work? What do people normally study in business school and what are the benefits? i.e double majors, one major, 2 minors etc.
4. Societies? How important are these in building connections and friends on campus (esp. for first years?
5. Internships? Are these more important than your WAM and is this the most important part of your studies?
6. Mainly for those majoring in finance or HRM. How do these courses stack up against each other? I was leaning towards HRM but fintech sounds interesting. Are there any good combos?
7. How does UNSW business school stack up against USYD? USYD offers comm/adv studies but from what i've heard most of what USYD offers in adv studies is mostly fluff.
8. Are trimesters as horrible as I've been told?

 My exam dates were announced. They would be from 6th of August. Long time. Enough for me to finish an entire semester study and do extra stuff...right??...

Well things didn't go well. I didn't study much in June. Kept on procrastinating and day dreaming.

In July, I started going to do exercise in morning(5:30am). People say morning exercise is great. Keeps one fresh. Turns out it doesn't work for me. It messed up my day. My sleep pattern was becoming irregular. I couldn't study at night for long because otherwise I wouldn't get enough sleep.

My mother forced me join a driving school at start kf June. So daily more than an hour would go in that.

My college started teaching for the next semester. This was totally a surprise. So my morning time would go in that.

Left was evening, in which I somehow managed to do some study. But it wasn't enough. 

Plus I saw an advertisement for an internship. I agreed to do that. And it starts from first week of August. 

Also I decided to do a another course which I think is really good and missing it would be a bad decision.

So now my semester exams collides with my internship, reaming lectures of driving school, a course and bad sleep pattern.

I also have a lot to study and I am left with only about 4 days. My semester exams are online which means copying is easy but I don't want to do that. My friends do it but I don't feel good about doing that. And times my moral compass about not wanting to copy cracks but I fix it somehow.

For now I guess I will just see how study I can finish before 6th and settle with whatever marks I get.

Only if could just focus some more.

Everytime I made a plan something went wrong. Something always distracted me. A lot of times I was distracted because of myself but at times external factors distracted me.

I guess just wish me luck..."

I was offered two positions back then for internships, one unpaid at an Apple-like company and one at a different fortune 500. I took the $22 per hour internship.

After working at that company as an intern they decided to bring me on full time after I graduated for 85k. It was a relief to have a job before I graduated from college.

A couple of years into that job I was promoted and was making 93k, but I found the work was becoming too easy and felt that there would be little growth on the same team. I explored other teams but didn't find any that were a good fit. In addition I had been pushing for another promotion for another year but due to Covid everything was being locked down.  

I was searching for jobs for a few months and studied LeetCode almost every night. I started making it into the final rounds with several companies and ended up taking one of their offers.

I'm now making 176k TC as a Senior Software Engineer!

I really appreciate all the people here and the advice they give. Thank you for helping me start my journey/career!

I wish everyone great luck in their careers, I think even reading this subreddit you are already a step ahead of most. Have a great Sunday\~!!"

So I’m a self-taught programmer with a little over 6 months of experience (2 months doing software engineering internship + 4 months at my current full time job as a software engineer).  My degree is in Applied Math.  My work environment is kind of toxic as theres not much help when i ask for it,  I’m literally given A LOT of work to the point where I’m working night and day, and theres hardly any efforts to help me develop my own technical knowledge.  I’ve been miserable about the environment but I think I still enjoy programming.  I work in a very niche field (its not typical web dev) which tends to have an even higher bar for entry as the employers usually demand for EE/CE/CS majors.  If I stay,  I’m not sure what i can do to improve my situation l.  If I try to leave, I am dealt with the same situation I faced trying to get this job where prospective employers ask “why didnt you get an engineering/ CS degree”?"

I love my friends, they’re really fun to be around and are really supportive of me but lately they have been exhausting me. They were some of the first friends I made in college and we’ve stuck together for about 4 years now. The biggest thing that has been bothering me is that they are big on partying and recently I’ve slowed down. Personally, I just got tired of playing the same handful of games every weekend and I always feel like crap the next morning, so I just decided to kinda stop to protect my physical and mental health. The problem though is that I live with my friends and they will continue to party and blast music all night. It’s gotten to the point where they keep me up at night (sometimes until 3/4 in the morning). I’ll send them the occasional text asking them to turn down the music, but it’s often either not quiet enough or it doesn’t stay quiet for long. Some mornings I wake up to our living room trashed and end up cleaning a little bit of it because they take forever to actually get around to do some of the cleaning, despite me reminding them it has to get done. I sometimes feel like they don’t have a lot of respect for me because of how loud they are. 

On top of that I just feel like some of our jokes are getting old and I no longer find some of the things they find hilarious to be funny any more (mostly cause it just comes off as mean or rude to me now). I also have been trying to be better about setting and upholding boundaries and I often feel like I’m expected to be able to drop everything to go spontaneously hangout with them, which is something I don’t think I can do anymore. 

After working and living with a phenomenal internship crew this summer, I’m looking back at my college friends and questioning whether or not they are relationships worth keeping. It’s been recommended to me to sit down and have a conversation about it with my friends, but I have no idea what to say. Any advice on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated!"

ovxb9c,2,2021-08-01,What should I do as a new grad ME?,enginerthrowaway21,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ovxb9c/what_should_i_do_as_a_new_grad_me/,"Hello all, new grad ME here unsure of what to do with with my career. When I graduated I had a few offers. One where I can live at home, save money, and be close with friends and family and the other that's about 2 hours away from home but I'd have pay rent in a MCOL area. I accepted the offer at job 1 to stay at home but I am now having second thoughts after starting and not being very satisfied with the work.

Job 1: Working in a manufacturing company creating drawings for customers, calculating stresses due to loading requirements (mostly plug and play into excel sheets) and reporting results to   
customers, create modifications to existing design models to fit customer needs but this is rare as my industry is very standardized. The company is very relaxed, great working environment, everyone is nice and I probably won't ever work more than 40 hours/week (sometimes I work a few hours less). The problem is I feel like I'm not learning or gaining technical skill that I should be as a new engineer. I feel like I fell into more of a project management job than an engineering job because I'm basically being trained to replace my boss and he's the companies project manager. I don't get to design anything new or work on anything innovating.

Pays 72.5k/year, 10 days PTO, 3% 401k matching after 1 year on the job. Will help pay for masters but only if the class pertains to what the company does. Living at home so I save up pretty much all of my take home pay.

Job 2: Working at a small (\~50 people) R&amp;D company that does very interesting work. I interned there last summer and loved the job, the work, and the people. I'm not sure exactly what projects I would work on if I worked there but it would more interesting and much better technical experience than Job 1. This company does contract work for NASA, USAF, US Army and other entities of that nature. My issues with this offer is I will be expected to work 45-50 hours/week with no overtime compensation and I'd now be paying rent in a MCOL area, though I do like the area as it's fun and more oriented to people in their mid twenties than my home town. I have a few friends that live somewhat close so I wouldn't be totally alone either.

Pay is also 72.5k/year, 14 days PTO, will pay for masters after 1 year of working there, offered 1k relocation, 3% 401k after 1 year of being with the company.

Since graduating in May I took Job 1 and told Job 2 I decided to pursue other options and Job 2 told me that's fine and to reach out if I change my mind since they liked having me as an intern and really wanted me back full time. I've also been accepted into a top 5 program for my masters in aerospace engineering which is online and part time and I will be dedicating most of my free time to that once school starts again next month. I'm not too worried about my company paying for my masters as I have time left on my military benefits that can cover most of the costs for my masters... But obviously my company picking up the rest of the tab is a benefit.

I decided to take Job 1 because I knew it was a low stress job, I can save a significant amount of money by saving rent, I can focus on my masters program and hopefully have the time to take more than one class a semester to finish the program faster, and I didn't have to move states. At job 2 the expectations would be higher but so would my learning potential as a new grad. I feel that my skills would develop quickly but I also don't want to burn out between my full time job and grad school. For example, when I interned I remember my boss came in before me (I got in around 730) and he stayed until midnight that night. I'm now having second thoughts since I feel like I've cheated myself and not given myself the opportunity to grow as an engineer by not working in a fast paced and technical environment. My goal is to eventually work in the space industry once I finish my masters and I feel that working in a project management position may hinder that goal.

My questions is should I email Job 2 and pursue a more technical and interesting position instead even if it means working more hours, taking longer to complete my masters, and not saving as much money? Or should I stick out a cushy job until I finish my masters and then try to move on? Will my first job affect my career much down the line? I'm sure if I reach out to Job 2 they would hire me on as I kept a very good relationship with many of the managers while there.

Thanks everyone in advance!"

However, as I am set to convert from my internship to full-time employment in two weeks, there are many things about being an official professional that I need to adjust to, one of which is the subject of overtime.

During my internship, I have often worked more than my required 8 hours a day, just because there was some extra chunk of code that I had to wait to finish executing or a final paragraph I had to type up for my report, etc. -- stuff that I could leave for tomorrow, but felt would serve as a better bookend if completed today. I've had a bad experience in a previous internship with being too literal with the ""record all your overtime hours"" policy, which caused my manager at the time to think I was trying to milk as much money as possible off the company clock, so in my current internship I have been clocking straight 40's every week, even if I stayed late in the office for an extra couple hours or so (I've been given pretty good pay so it's not really about the extra few dollars for me). This was probably the right move, regardless, since the internship program may have a ""only clock 40 hours every week"" policy anyway.

I'm fine with cutting corners like this for the duration of my internship, but after I move into my full-time position, I expect to log my hours correctly and get paid for my work accordingly. So this means I have to navigate the art of ""not screwing myself out of the pay I deserve"" but also ""not be fired for (perceived) frivolous overtime-pay abuse"".

So my questions are, assuming I am eligible for overtime pay based on the hours I clock in:

1. How comfortable/proactive should a new entry-level employee like me be in taking advantage of the policy (within reason, of course)?
2. What sort of overtime work justifies actually staying overtime and getting paid for it? For example, watching training videos in the office after 5 p.m. would be hard to justify, but what if you have some Excel work that you happened to be slow with finishing, and decide to stay late to get it done? Or, say, a call with a talkative and long-winded client or coworker that starts at or runs after 5 p.m.?

Thank you in advance for your feedback!"

I'm looking for a bit of clarity here, or advice, or whatever you want to call it.  I potentially have an opportunity coming up and everyone I've talked to thinks I should go for it, but they're not in the field and I don't feel like they completely understand the circumstances so I'd like to run this by you guys and get the opinion of my fellow sysadmins.

The scenario:  I hired onto the sysadmin team just over a year ago.  Within a month the other sysadmin, the team lead, and manager all moved on.  They got me a new team lead from the cyber team (no real sysadmin background) and a new sysadmin colleague from help desk.  Together we managed to fix 90% of the problems in the environment and things, now, are more or less stable.  Not too long ago the other sysadmin moved on to another contract for a security position (she's going to school for cyber security) and we replaced her with another, very green, candidate from the help desk.

Quite separately, we recently received an ""intern"".  The guy was practically handed a sec+ by the military and his entire job consisted of downloading an update from point A and deploying it at point B.  If anything went wrong, he reported back to someone else and they did the troubleshooting.  He has no formal education, no professional certs except for the dated sec+, no desktop experience, no server experience, nothing.  We didn't think much of it until we learned he was offered (and accepted) a position on systems.  Normally, I'd be happy to help him out and teach him what I can, but he is firmly of the mind that any education or training should be provided by the company.  He won't buy a book, look up an article, read a forum...nothing.  And anything we do try to teach him he doesn't absorb (asks the same question five times and still doesn't get it.)

Up to now I've been like...whatever.  Not my circus not my monkeys.  I come in, do my job, and go home.  Now, there is an opportunity for me to step up into the team lead position.  It'd mean more money, of course, I'd be taking call whereas I do not take it now, and my team would consist of a very new but teachable sysadmin and a guy who basically politicized his way into the position with no ability or desire to learn anything new...  I'd like to take the job, but I'm not sure it would be worth the headache I know I'd be walking into...

My next step is uni and I am looking to switch to animation at a great program at my local university. I am taking about a year off beforehand to work on a portfolio and think things over. I finished my degree with an internship which I really did not enjoy and I think it woke my up to the fact that the work is not for me. 

I understand that an arts degree itself is essentially useless but Id learn a ton. I have a new found passion for the arts but its completely different from what I’ve been doing and what I have always been good at.

TLDR: Newfound passion in arts and animation, always been good at engineering, plan to do animation in uni.

Is this a sound decision? I want to do what I enjoy even though engineering is much safer. Any inputs greatly appreciated

One more thing, Where I live uni is very affordable so student debt wont be an issue."

I just started dating a girl in Hong Kong (I grew up there), she's really quite awesome. It's moving kind of fast (emotionally, at least) - no complaints from me though, I'm loving it and loving her! For reference, I'm 25, she's 21. Of course, the worrying part is that means that I likely have to meet the parents soon (1-3 months??), their knowledge of me has already come up in conversation a few times.

**Some background on me:** I'm 25, Indian by ethnicity, so I was born in Mumbai, but a week later my mom moved me to Hong Kong - where I grew up relatively privileged, went to international schools, worked for the big investment banks, moved to the US/California for college (an average-ish one for undergrad), started a company that's now worth a ton of money - and thankfully I make more than the average banker/doctor! Haha. Slightly after that, I dropped out of a top university's PhD program to focus on running my company as we raised venture capital. Today, I am CEO. We have about \~400 employees worldwide with HQ in San Francisco. The company is worth about US$100m. Having grown up in HK, I'm relatively well versed in the culture, but don't speak the language (it seems her family's first language might be Cantonese, and hers is English). I'm explaining my background right now, but in person, I'm quite humble, it's one of the reasons she likes me (mostly driven by personality, I'm not that attractive, but she thinks I'm cute!).

**Background on her:** She's ambitious, driven, smart, fun, and beautiful (objectively!) She was born in Hong Kong, grew up in the most expensive area of Hong Kong (her family is quite well off), went to top schools, then an international school, then studied at a top university in the UK, did a bunch of competitive internships, and now works for a global name in consulting. She loves to travel - she and her family have been seemingly everywhere. She seems to have a really wholesome relationship with her parents and seems to think they'd be cool with her dating me. So cool, in fact, that while she was in my lap the other day she picked up a FaceTime call from her mom without any warning HAHA. Another time though, she mentioned her parents were ""a bit racist"". Her grandparents are from the South of China. She's also really wholesome, she genuinely loves personal growth, learning, having intellectual conversations. She's also a huge nerd, and a lot of fun!! Basically, I think she's perfect HAHA.

I'm not sure what to think! I've dated \~4 girls from Hong Kong before, and it's usually been the parents that were the issue when things started to get a bit more serious. That's okay, I get it, of course. Though, in the past, I've never really had objective success on my side.

So far, I've been the perfect gentleman to her! She says she feels safe, loved, valued, special, wanted, and like a princess! We've gone out on 5 dates so far, she said she loved me on the second date. She showed me her DMs - she's turning down guys very frequently LOL. I really quite like this girl, and would love to have a more serious relationship with her. So far, she's not really materialistic at all and offers to pay for things frequently. I'm 6ft/183cm &amp; generally big, she's 5'1ft/153cm &amp; generally tiny. I'm just throwing random facts at this point so I'll stop and ask my questions!

***tl;dr:*** she's a kind beautiful genius from Hong Kong, I am a kind thoughtful average looking CEO from Hong Kong too, but Indian by ethnicity. Her parents are wholesome, but a bit racist apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

**I have a few questions!**

* Are there any odds I impress the parents? LOL
* What is the ideal tone to strike? Confidence? Humble? Respectful? What mix?
* What are they probably thinking as they meet me?
* What kind of place to select? I should probably secretly pay on the way to the bathroom?
* Bring a thoughtful gift for both? Or is that too much, and I should just get like a bottle of wine?
* Generally, any other advice?"

I still have one more year, but after I do so I would like to go to grad school. I do not have a car, and it sucks (a lot) because I'm essentially stuck wherever I'm brought. It's a huge hassle in my life, but a car is a lot of money. My parents can't afford to buy me one, and I've never had one. I started working when I was 18, but I am paying for college with my job money. I ended up getting laid off from my year-round job that was my income in June, and right now I am working a paid summer internship (but that's going to end in like a week). I have enough money in my bank account to cover the rest of college for the upcoming year, and some leftover after that which should be good for groceries or an emergency. Looking at it, I should have enough for a relatively cheap, used car. I am worried about the gas money and insurance without a steady job, but that's a separate issue. My parents are telling me that I should put some money down for the car and then take out monthly payments on something that is more expensive than the total amount of money I have, but I personally don't feel comfortable doing that. I feel like in order to make monthly payments I for sure need to have a part-time job so I can get money each month.  My parents think I'm being stubborn about it, but I am just really not sure if that's the move. I would LIKE a more expensive car, and my parents have been pushing me to not buy anything in my price range that has over 100,000 miles. But, everything that IS in my price range is above that. I feel like I don't have the money to be picky. They insist that if I buy it and I break down on the side of the interstate, it could be a dangerous situation and that if it does break down (which it likely will, they say) that I won't have the money to fix it. But, in my opinion, I won't have the money for a car that costs more than what's in my bank account while I'm unemployed.   
I am also a highly anxious individual. I have severe anxiety, and I'm actually very terrified of the concept of being on my own. I know I'm in college, but I have at least always had someone to look after me, whether it's a friend or a two-hour ride to get back to my parents. I feel like a sort of failure of an adult because sometimes I just can't take care of myself very well. My friends have asserted that it's because I'm depressed and that everyone has those ups and downs, but I am just very, very worried about moving away to go to grad school where I do not know anyone and have nobody to lean on and reach out to for support if I need help with something. Because I am so anxious, I get stressed out at the thought of walking places alone. Public transport is spooky, and honestly, I should note that I'm obviously privileged to be able to say I am scared to get on public transport and shouldn't be so picky in my situation. Also, the public transit in the area isn't really great to begin with. I'd like to one day move to a walkable city, I've heard cities are often easy to get around in without a car.    


I have a rocky relationship with my parents, and I would like to be able to move out as soon as possible. If I go to grad school, I hope to get a Ph.D. I've been assured it would be covered financially, but it's still another unknown in my life to worry about. I have considered going directly into the workforce, but for the specific career that I want, it's very hard to get in without a graduate degree. I would go for a master's but they're not covered financially as Ph.D.'s are. My thoughts are I should apply to colleges in cities you can get around without a car, but all of those places are so far away from home if I needed help I would be out of luck.   


  
I really just don't know what to do with myself, I'm going to ask my professors when school starts up again if they have any paid research positions open, and if not look around for remote jobs. I'd like to hopefully keep to jobs in my field so I could continue to bolster my resume, but if I can't get anything I suppose I'll probably look for an on-campus job. Maybe that will help me get enough to feel comfortable with a monthly payment. I'm just not really sure what steps to take for my future."

ow7iah,2,2021-08-02,Feeling lost and ranting,nerdyginger27,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ow7iah/feeling_lost_and_ranting/,"Things were much better for a while. I was able to afford my apartment at school with the money from my scholarship/job and my best friend as my roommate. I could even pretty much buy whatever groceries I wanted, a couple streaming services, eat out once or twice a week, go bowling/see a movie, etc. and still have money to save. I thought I was stressed with school and the pandemic, but I knew that being away from my toxic family and generally supporting myself was the most freeing thing I'd ever experienced - and helped my depression a lot. 

Now I've had to move back home with my family, whom I fight with all the time (or more accurately, they yell at me about things like leaving my clothes in the dryer for a day, or eating in my room, or working too much, or not babysitting my sister, or going to spend the night at my boyfriend's, or not spending enough time with them - even though they can be very mentally and verbally abusive). 

I have struggled to find a decent job even after applying to almost 100 in the past handful of months. The one that was desperate enough to hire me (apparently) was for a company I always imagined was my dream job at a big theme park (you'd know it if you heard the name), where I thought everything was going to be energetic and about providing a great guest experience. Turns out it's just toxic, I'm severely underpaid, and they keep giving me more responsibilities beyond my job description. I haven't had two consecutive days off in almost a month and they work me weird shifts constantly (for instance, a 2-11, then a 9-5, then an 11-5, etc). They even went back on days I had specifically approved off more than three weeks in advance, because they ""need the help"" and I'd be fired if I refused. I drive almost an hour there and back every day just to get there, which I was fine with before I realized how shitty the job environment there is.

I got a 4 year degree in Hospitality and Tourism just to work my ass off constantly for $11/hr (with NO benefits) doing tasks below my skill level AND work my boss just doesn't feel like doing (at a higher level than the rest of the team, because they're obviously not qualified for that level of college-degree-required type work). I know I need to ask for a raise now that they've given me way more projects that are outside of the job I was initially hired for, but my bosses are so toxic I expect they'll say no and I will want to quit  even more from the anxiety and how undervalued I feel there.

But I can't afford to quit, because even though my parents are allowing me to live in their house, they decided to kick me off of their insurance policies now that I'm ""an adult"". I have severe dental problems that were mostly covered by my university's student healthcare policies, until I graduated and found out they messed up two fillings, but I would have to pay full price out of pocket with no insurance to fix now that I'm not a student. So I'm going without fixing those, and haven't been able to chew on the left side for months now. Another reason why I need a better job with actual benefits, even though no one seems to want me. 
I have a couple of speeding tickets I got almost 2 years ago as a dumb college student that are now making the quotes I'm getting for car insurance insane so another thing to worry about affording.

My boyfriend has an amazing job, a great career, tens of thousands in savings, and we talk about getting engaged and married a lot (we've been together 6+ years). But after many discussions about our values, future dreams, etc. I know he isn't going to propose until I have a job that he thinks is good enough. It makes me feel awful and like I'm not enough because I can't get a job that will pay ""even $15/hr full time with benefits?"" like he asks why I can't get. 

I don't fucking know why people won't hire me or why jobs aren't paying $15 or more for my career field other than the pandemic and the fact I only have a year of ""qualifying experience"" (I worked in a related field for 2 years through college did multiple internships, and keep getting told I have no experience).

It's not like I think about killing myself as brutally as I used to in highschool, when I actually attempted once and started cutting. It's become this dull feeling of being stuck and just wanting to not exist or wanting to be dead and wanting all of the pain and anxiety to go away. 

I really realized I had a problem when on my one off day I decided to go into the theme park and ride rides but had a way different reaction. I used to be super scared and super excited for things like that, but every ride I went on made me just feel meh. Like I didn't care even if it killed me. I got no excitement out of it which made me feel even worse.

I know what I want, but I don't know why everything has to be so hard. I WANT to marry my boyfriend, I WANT a decent job with benefits and decent pay where I'm respected, I WANT a family that loves and cares about me and supports me. 

It's not even like I'm being lazy or expecting this to all be handed to me; I'm going to work every day even though it makes me want to drive into a tree and I'm applying to jobs even though next to none have responded or interviewed me (shout-out to the one that I did a four hour panel interview for that straight up ghosted me afterward) even when I am EXHAUSTED and done with life. 

I think about dying almost every day and how much simpler it might be. I cry all the time, ESPECIALLY when someone is kind to me. I cried the other day because a fast food worker gave me a 10% discount on my meal. I had to excuse myself to go to the restroom and cry after a guest at the park called me pretty. I cried on the way home from work the past three nights just because I felt so tired and sad. 

I don't feel like I have any time to accomplish anything at home - especially taking care of myself in ways like cleaning my room (it's a wreck), putting my furniture from college back together (it's sat there half finished for 4 months), or even just watching a movie/TV show. It's this constant cycle of working and being exhausted so I try and rest (get insomnia and can't sleep so I'm not well rested) then sleeping in when I should be productive because I'm trying to recharge, rushing to work, getting home and not having time to do anything except get ready for the next work day.

I fucking hate this."

Currently teaching myself JavaScript with plans to move into react.

That said, some co-workers have said that, at my age, it might be worth considering that I should stay in Cyber due to my age; By the time I get enough experience, I may be too old considering where I could have been in Cyber.

owade8,0,2021-08-02,Renting House from Parents or Renting my Own Apartment,MyPokeballsAreItchy,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/owade8/renting_house_from_parents_or_renting_my_own/,"Okay hello everyone.
So here is a little background information about myself.

* 21 year old student, going into my third year of a Bachelor of Business Administration majoring in accounting. I have worked the summers doing various forms of construction. From December 2020 - April 2021 I worked in a public accounting firm as an accounting technician. I have accepted an internship offer for a  private company starting September 7th for 22/hr for an 8 month period which would fill the cooperative education portion of my BBA degree. I am still attending interviews for public accounting firms due to the potential possibility of them paying for CPA PEP. 

So I’m in a little bit of a predicament. I’ve been renting out an apartment in my city for $1287/month, this is with all utilities included and $135 for parking + $35/month pet fees. 

Not terrible, however I was splitting this cost with my old roommate who moved out about 5 months ago. So I’ve been footing the bill for all of the home expenses which took a measurable dent out of my savings. I have been spending currently around $4000/month, and I’m aware this is a problem moving forward. Although this is below the  national average in terms of monthly expenses, its left me with little room to save (especially considering due to the extreme heat and weather conditions my seasonal summer employment has limited my net income monthly to around $2040/month on average since I started there in early May). 

I have found an apartment in an area close by that is $925/month + $25/month pet fee. I’m close to signing a year lease on it however my parents decided to throw me a curveball and offer me the chance to move into my childhood home. They are about to refinance the mortgage on the place itself with $139,000 remaining as they live on a property that’s been paid off, and realistically I could move into the whole house for the same amount that I would for the new apartment (albeit while covering the utilities, which combined come to around $294/month) 

Even as a student with my internship I’m on track to make around $21,000 over the 8 month period and I have verified the amounts using the payroll online deductions calculator off the Canadian government’s website as I used to do payroll when I worked at the accounting firm.  I am receiving around $13,000 in provincial grants and student loans over the course of the semester as well. 

The issue that presents itself is like I’m a little bit flustered with moving…. Especially after looking at these numbers. 

-	Annually my current apartment costs around $17,196. 
-	Renting the townhouse from my parents would be around $14,938.68 ($2,257.32 in annual savings)
-	If I moved into the new apartment, it would cost me $12,780 annually. ($2,158.60 cheaper than the townhouse. Significantly cheaper than my current apartment. 

My parents are willing to move me into the townhouse without having to pay a damage deposit and basically renting it to me on a month to month basis. This is with the fact that the house has been on the market in a stagnant state as condos/townhouses haven’t been moving much. 

Assuming in a perfect scenario and I do end up making around 21k CAD + 13k in student loans, the apartment would be 40.52% of my net income vs 44.09% at the townhouse for the rest of the year. This is with internet and all utilities included. 

Obviously I could get roommates to even out the cost after a few months however the previous renters we had caused about $1500 in damage and I’m selective even with my friends, who are hesitant to take the same steps as me in moving away from home.

I’m curious to hear what anyone else thinks in regards to my situation as I am honestly trying to maximize the amount of money that I will be saving over the course of the year as I still have a year and a half left of my degree. After deducting my current  internet expense (close to $115/month), it really only comes down to a 3.4% difference in cost. 

Im really trying to meet either a 30/30/40 (Housing/Insurance + Food + Misc Bills/Savings) target in terms of my budget. It is extremely hard with respect to high personal expenses such as insurance ($403/month, was in an accident 1.5 years ago. Drive a 2009, 4.5 years of driving history, no tickets).  

I know this is a lot of personal financial information but I appreciate any and all replies as I plan out the next year or so."

owgi3v,1,2021-08-02,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (8/2/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/owgi3v/weekly_job_qa_thread_822021/,"Hi all,

Here is the seventy-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

The major stumbling block in applying to any grad schools is my terrible CGPA (6.8) and no research experience. Only have a couple of internships under my belt.

What are my options for the next couple of years, when I will have wexp in a similar domain of interest that I want to pursue (Distributed Systems, Networking)?

Do I try to continue applying for any University I can get for 2022/3, and settle with whatever I can get, or continue with my job in India and give up on going to US?

Another option I have in mind is that I line up a RA kind of position in my university (or any one of the IITs, but I'll have to work for it), quit my job, and try to work there wih a professor for a few months or so, and try to get my LOR from them for a better profile MS application.

Any suggestions would be helpful.

owi7l9,4,2021-08-02,When is it a good time to start working in a part-time internship beside university and how important is it? [Electrical Engineering],[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/owi7l9/when_is_it_a_good_time_to_start_working_in_a/,"Hi, I am about to start my third year of BSc as an Electrical Engineering student. Even though I am doing quite well at university (my GPA is relatively good and I even qualified for an international scholarship), I feel like I am not doing enough to develop myself. Everyone else has these amazing personal projects, which I am incapable of doing (I suck at doing anything that isn't mandatory), and a lot of people already work in internships part-time or in the summer. I just feel stuck as someone who is good at math problems and used to be good at basic programming. 

So I decided to look for a part time internship to do during the semester with the following goals in mind:

1. Developing myself in the field of embedded programming and Unix-like operating systems.
2. Getting as much experience looking at hardware as possible with my current hardware experience (which is basically the Intel 8085, so none).
3. Getting work experience on my resume that will let me choose where I want to work once I have my MSc degree.

I have already heard back from two companies out of six (I already have an offer from one of them), but the hours they are asking for don't seem to be doable to me. I spend 40 hours studying or in class in an average week, plus travel. In the more intense parts of the semester this sometimes increases to 70 hours a week for 2-3 weeks. Most companies want at least 20 hours, but the one I have an offer from wants 24 a week. I simply can't physically fit this into my schedule. 20 would be doable, but it already feels like on the border of my capabilities. I would like to finish my degree on schedule so I can get my hands on an MSc as early as possible.

So my questions are:

1. When does it make sense to start working like this? (I've been told by someone in the industry that now makes sense.)
2. How important is getting a job like this from perspectives of both career and skill? (Question re-formed: How much of my life is worth sacrificing for this?)
3. What are your general experiences with this type of thing? (If you have done something like this before, how did you juggle your job and studying?)

Thank you for the help and advice in advance!

(Additional info: Getting a job isn't very hard where I live, especially with my skillset, but I really want to work in R&amp;D which is still hard as shit.)"

I’m going into my senior year of college. I am a business marketing major. I was diagnosed with autism when I was a lot younger, but I really don’t think I really have it. I’ve only had one job as a summer camp counselor in 2018, but then that summer camp closed the next year. Ever since then, no job has ever hired me. I tried for like 20 jobs the last 3 years. Only 4 interviewed me and it was always a no. These jobs were mostly fast food and retail jobs. I never even disclose autism on my application or interviews. Last spring, I tried to go to my college’s career office to get help with finding a marketing internship. They sounded like they completely wanted to ignore me and said “there’s not many internships because of covid”. That doesn’t make any sense because all the other marketing majors in my college have internships right now, and some are even a year younger than me. In 2021, I’m hearing a lot of businesses are struggling to find employees, because people don’t want to go back to work. Well, when I apply to them, they don’t hire me. I try so hard. I desperately need money and I want a life. It seems like society doesn’t want me to enter adulthood."

I am writing here to kind of rant and ask some advice. So I applied for a summer internship and was offered a position last minute. My experience has been the worst. The owner is an asshole. He is so messy and disorganized. He gives me so much work. Some work I think shouldn't even be done by an intern. I'm doing more than what the job description said. Not only that, he is also so narcissistic. His side comments are rude and sometimes sexist. He is overall a bad boss and a bad person. He thinks people don't have lives outside of this internship or something. He treats my time like shit and expects me to work outside of my work hours. OH and did I mention it's UNPAID. I have had my last straw when he pushed all his work to me. I just ignored him yesterday when I was supposed to work because it was stressing me out. I know it was irresponsible for me to do that but I really can't handle it anymore. I'm returning to school soon and I have stuff I need to do before school starts besides this internship. I really want to quit but I feel bad at the same time. I did learn a lot during the internship going past the bad experience. I don't want to end on a bad term but at the same time we never signed a contract or decided on an end time so I don't even know when it's appropriate for me to stop this internship... what should I do?

I’m a student athlete with a high gpa which has helped me to build a decent resume.

My question is whether or not it’s realistic to think that I will be able to land a job out of state before graduating? Because I go to a smaller school, most students I know end up staying in the Midwest. I would like to move to Texas and start my career there. There are tons of jobs for manufacturing and engineering in texas. However, I don’t know if it’s realistic to think companies will consider an entry level candidate from so far away before graduating.

What are your thoughts?
Is there anything I could do between now and the spring to give me a better chance?

Rather new to reddit so hopefully I'm doing this right... I'd like to start by saying that I am way more of a tech person (20M, CompSci senior) than a business person.

While sitting on the patio one late evening while pondering how I wanted to stay away from the classic 9-5 cubical world after a long day working as a data analyst intern, I overheard a bunch of people complaining about not being able to do something, and realized that I could create the basis for a perfect solution (mobile app) that can be and would be utilized by most people for the demographic (app would follow a mix of paid account revenue - not required for full app usage - and ad revenue generation).

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately did some research regarding a sole proprietorship vs LLC and settled on an LLC, wanting the liability protection (company is based in Michigan). As of now, I've started doing some early design art, have a giant doc of specifications, bought a domain and have a website for the next two years, filed a provisional patent on a new tech concept that this app would use, and got an EIN from the IRS for banking purposes (have yet to open an account). Looking to hire someone to develop a pitch deck so I can pitch my idea to a software firm I'm interested in partnering with (this project is way too big for 1-4 people minimum and I'd rather just outsource maintenance anyways).

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward are there any things that I should focus on to bolster my chances of success? Additionally, how do I go about setting up paying myself so I don't pierce the veil and leave myself vulnerable? I know for the purposes of tax filing, I can just file this LLCs taxes with my own as its single-member, but I don't know how to handle monetary stuff in day-to-day ops. Would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for someone like myself who's completely new to the business management world."

However, this sort of scope seems unlikely as the internship is only three months.

The hiring team also made it clear there may be a lot of vagueness in the responsibilities that could make it difficult to execute action items or solutions to high-level problems. There is definitely the option to extend past three months, but ultimately I believe the short position is to mitigate the risk of my lack of experience.

I am confident after meeting with the team that they are extremely competent veterans and can be helpful if I remain focused and ask the right questions. But it does not seem like there is a well-defined project to be working on and will require a lot of grit and self-starting. I am extremely motivated, but also recognize I have a challenge in front of me.  I was curious if any of you had some helpful advice.

About a month after declining, I reached out and asked if the position was still available. They said yes, I accepted, and I'm planning to start next week (Did background check/drug test). Fast forward to today, I received an offer from another company that I was interviewing before accepting the previous position. 

I should mention that the two positions are very different, one is more of an analyst position (new offer) and the other is an engineering leadership position (accepted offer). I'm a bit conflicted right now because I just recently graduated a few months ago and I'm not sure which area/position I am more interested in right now. Another thing that is sort of wavering my decision is that the PTO for the first job is only one week while the second job is a little better with about 2.5 weeks. I think another reason is that I felt a little rushed with accepting the position because they said they had an onboarding starting in about 1.5 weeks time, wanted me to join it and in the offer letter, I only had one day to confirm (previously they gave me about a week). Similarly, with this new offer today, I was given 72 hours to decide, which is giving me anxiety right now in choosing. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar position before and if so, how did you decide or like how did you know which position/career path you want to further go into?"

I just graduated from a nice university in Southern California with a degree in computer science, and next spring I will have finished my master's degree in cybersecurity engineering. I have zero related work experience and no internship experience. It seems that the consensus among my professors and classmates who already work in the field is that there is basically no such thing as a true entry level position in information security for someone with no experience.

Does anyone who works in the field have an idea of the typical career path for someone entering the information security field with no working experience? Some have told me I should work in IT for a bit first, but working a $20/hour job in Southern California fresh out of an expensive college isn't the most appealing option. Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR; how do you start a career in information security with only educational experience and no work experience?"

Sometimes I’ll get a task from the VP (who always includes my manager in the requests) to create spreadsheets since I’m the only one on our team who knows how to use excel efficiently. 

Last week, Jim asked my manager and I to create a spreadsheet for budgets; Which I took the initiative of creating considering my manager doesn’t know how to use excel to the degree that I do. I got numbers from a document that Jim sent over. BEFORE the completed sheet was sent to Jim, I sent the document over to my manager to review. He approved so I sent it over to Jim. Jim said the numbers didnt reflect what he had, so I asked my manager to gather the numbers because I do not have access to them. Then, in a call, my manager and I went through the sheet row by row and he put in numbers that he was really just spit balling. Sent it over to Jim, Jim said they were wrong again but too high this time. We got on a call with Jim, who explained how to find the numbers which mind you is EXACTLY what I had in the first draft that he denied. So I redid it with the same exact numbers in the first draft, got approval from my manager, sent it over to Jim again. Didn’t hear anything back.

Today on my weekly call with my manager, I asked him if the sheet was what Jim needed. He told me that Jim was happy with the sheet but thinks I can “kick it up a notch”. Bob then went on to say I should double check things before I send it to Jim because it’s not only a reflection of me but him (Bob) as well. Mind you, I NEVER send anything to Jim without Bob’s approval. So this irritated me for a multitude of reasons. One being that I felt like I was the only one who knew what was going on with that budget sheet in the first place. I honestly feel like they were the reason for set-backs/errors. Another because these guys don’t even know how to use excel and another because Bob was acting like he doesn’t approve everything before I send it to Jim.

Now I feel like the VP isn’t fond of me and I’m not sure how to go about it because we dont have a direct relationship. I only speak to him through/with my manager. Working from home makes it difficult to build relationships with regular coworkers let alone someone as busy as the Vice President. How can I build a relationship with him? How do I politely tell my manager that he approves of everything that goes to Jim so if it’s not to Jim’s liking it’s partially his fault as well?"

owwe8r,1,2021-08-03,Coming at the cybersecurity industry from a weird angle....,planktonstudios,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/owwe8r/coming_at_the_cybersecurity_industry_from_a_weird/,"Hey all,

Sorry for yet another career question post but I feel like my situation is unique enough that I should make a separate post rather than a really really long comment in the Monday Q&amp;A megathread. Thank you to anyone who has some advice!

So I'm at a position where I'm looking to switch careers over into cybersecurity (join the club, I know). I have a weird work history and background, with an odd mix of technical and design stuff going on. I'm trying to decide on a general course of action to get going in cybersecurity right now, and would love to know what I should add to the process or what I should remove from the process.


A bit about me:

* I have a BA in Computer Science. Note the 'A' there; it was a mix of hard technical skills (programming, database, etc.) and artistic skills (animation, special effects, game design). I also went back to school for a UX design certification and worked in that field for about a year. It wasn't for me, unfortunately.

* I currently do data analyst/PM grunt work at an unnamed PNW tech giant, serving as a low level project manager for a data/ML project.

* I have a good grasp on networking/IT/Linux and host my own home server (multiple websites, cloud, game servers, etc.). Home networking and IT is something I really love, just at a basic level. It's great. 

* I'm working through TryHackMe right now. I'm doing the beginner's track first to refresh myself on those topics, then on to the blue team stuff. I'm also reading through the Pakt Humble Bundle books on the side for more theoretical knowledge vs. practical knowledge from THM.


So from here I have a couple of questions:

* Optimally it seems an entry level cybersec job hunter would have BOTH a degree in cybersec and certs. Is this accurate? Or does the smart money skip the degree and just shoot for certs? I'm looking at schools in my area and also WGU, but will skip it if having a comp sci degree and a good grasp of the work is already enough to get moving.

* Will my weird mix of skills and job experience get in my way going forward? Even with the relevant degrees &amp; certs, will someone see, for example, my design experience and think, ""Ew, no thank you.""? My resume might look bizarre to a cybersecurity hiring manager.

* For entry level positions I see a few different paths being discussed on this subreddit. Notably, a lot of people seem to get into SOC and burn out or struggle to progress. I did see, however, that someone mentioned roles in vulnerability management, and even posted a guide last week. Is a role in VM something to shoot for? Or is it a safer bet aiming for a low level analyst/SOC position?

* I did a few practice questions for the Security+ certification and it was quite easy; the questions seemed to revolve more around networking/computing basic knowledge than highly specific security topics. Is this perception correct? Are the beginning level certifications easy as long as you've gone through a ton of TryHackMe or have a bunch of experience wrangling your own home networks and security?


Lastly, here are the steps I've created for myself for going forward. Am I missing anything? Am I doing anything I don't need to? What do I need to add or remove for this to make sense? I've largely created this in a vacuum and could use input/advice.

1) Finish initial research and self-driven education (TryHackMe courses, Packt textbooks, reading up on the subreddit, edX/Coursera/etc. courses)
2) Find and enroll in a cybersecurity degree of some sort, either WGU or something local to me.
3) During degree, get certifications in Security+ and others.
4) Either get an internship or entry level position in SOC or VM.
5) Find areas of interest and specialize after some time in SOC/VM positions. 
6) Profit?

Thanks in advance to anyone who has any advice or thoughts, they're very much appreciated."

I'm planning to apply to an MS in ECE this year (fall '22 application) and I'd love some advice.

First off, here's some general information:  
I have a BE in ECE and a minor in physics from one of the top schools in India.  
CGPA : 8.58 (currently in my 7th semester)  
TOEFL/IELTS: Yet to take  
GRE: 328 ( Q:167, V:161 and AWA 5.5)   
I'm applying straight out of undergrad so I won't have any work experience.

Experience (projects):

\- 1 in the field of signal processing (specifically, using certain processing techniques to find the instantaneous frequency of voiced speech) - study oriented.

\- 1 in the field of communication systems (specifically using orbital angular momentum beams to increase data rates) - design oriented.

\- 1 in the field of communication systems (specifically the use of good code sets for radar and military applications) - both study and design oriented (ongoing).

\- 1 in the field of cybersecurity (specifically checking whether systems have DNSSEC enabled in them and if not, trying to ensure that we can provide that extension) - both study and design oriented (ongoing).

\- In addition to this, there was an internship I did the summer after my 2nd year, which was also research oriented, but in my opinion that is not as important as those mentioned above (but, just for the sake of completion, it was also in the field of signal processing and we tried to find the rpm of an engine by processing the sounds it made while switched on).

  
LORs (possible):  
\- Assistant prof, did a project under him last semester and am currently doing another one that could result in a publication (strong)  
\- My thesis advisors (both on campus and off campus), did some courses with the prof on campus (strong)  
\- Another assistant prof under whom I did a project and a few courses (moderate)

  
These are the universities currently on my list (in no particular order):  
1. UC Berkeley   
2. UCLA  
3. UCSB  
4. Columbia  
5. Georgia Tech  
6. NYU  
7. UT Austin  
8. Penn State  
9. UT Dallas  
10. University of Maryland, College Park  
11. BU  
12. Rutgers

  
I'd really appreciate help in categorizing these into safe, moderate and ambitious (feel free to add more in any category you want). In my opinion, most of these schools I've mentioned are really top class in the US and I'm unsure if what I've done in terms of project work is enough to get me through. So if y'all know for sure that it's very difficult to get into some of these schools with my stats, let me know and I'll cross them off my list.  


  
A little extra info:  
\- I'm interested in communication networks within the broader umbrella of ECE. Potential fields of specialization are Wireless Communications, Signal Processing, and Cybersecurity (my thesis is in this last field and I'm not looking at it from an IT perspective but from a communications perspective)

  
\- I'm on the fence about pursuing a PhD right now or doing it after my MS. However, wherever there's an option for an integrated MS/PhD, I've listed it as a priority over just an MS. 

  
\- Should I end up doing a PhD, academia is not my immediate interest. I'd like to work in the industry with a PhD. Would love inputs from people who've done this (mostly on whether it's a good option, what the odds are of landing a job post PhD, and how to sustain yourself financially throughout your PhD).

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, thanks so much for reading through this long post!

When he was replaced, I became a star performer. But then my 2nd boss turned against me in the span of a month where I got accolades from
senior leadership followed by an abrupt turn of events where he then attempted to get rid of me by stripping me of my reports, changing my tasks to that of a college intern and then finally trying to get HR to build a case against me without merit to get me demoralized enough to just quit. I then hired an attorney and a HR coach and He then gave me an ultimatum to switch teams before he can do even worse. My old team has a HR case filed against them by an employee every year.

I land a new team quickly but now I have a new problem where my boss was ok but my org is toxic. I have no support from leadership on anything, the quality of the work around me is poor but then everyone hides around it by piling on the next person and passing the buck. Today, I lead a org review that I had to pull together in the last 20 min because no one sent me their content on time- only to find that my own leadership didn’t show up. This meant that everyone piled on me instead…all while my boss watched me take the hits and do nothing. It was like being called to the stand in a court trial for a crime I did not commit.

I’m demoralized, burned out and feel like a shell of a human I was 5 years ago. I was diagnosed with a herniated disc and stress related back problems a few months ago and am almost at a point where it’s painful to sit in a chair. I’m on a slew of antidepressants with more boosters for every day I go to work. I literally have 3 different therapists I go to weekly to talk about work. My best friend/partner of 5 years and I broke up 2 years ago because 2 stressed out, depressed people cannot be together. I am profoundly unhappy with where I am in life.

Yet I cannot find the courage to quit each time. I worry about having health insurance, especially now where I have 9 months of back pain PT and painful treatments. I have more than enough money to live off for a few years but I’m afraid I won’t find another job when I’m ready again.

What do I do?"

My intention would be to take a bootcamp because learning on my own I know I would not finesse the finer details of writing quality code, I can be tempted to skip corners to get things working.

Way back in the Myspace days I really enjoyed using html to personalise my page. 

Then at university I did courses in Matlab and really enjoyed the puzzle solving element. However at this point I got put off slightly when I did a course in computational mathematics which was really challenging on the theory side. 

Since then I've done an internship where I learned a lot of Python and worked in Linux, and then had a job for 4 years where I've dipped in and out of R, SAS and SQL. 

I've always found coding to be really satisfying and have always shown a preference for pieces of work requiring it over my other work. 

So how do I know if I want to make the move from \*a bit\* of coding to coding all the time? I really enjoy the problem solving aspect, and I do feel I'm a creative person lacking a creative pursuit. (I find painting, writing etc frustrating and messy - I used to really enjoy photoshop back in the day because it just.. works). I think my dream job at the moment would be to combine those skills with my background in physical science and work as a GIS developer or similar. 

What other skills make up your day? At the moment I'd probably describe myself as average (but willing to develop!) when it comes to soft skills like presenting and working in a team

ox3rtz,2,2021-08-03,"Got offered a new Job, what should I do?",Mr-Monroe,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ox3rtz/got_offered_a_new_job_what_should_i_do/," 

Male, 21, just got my Bachelor's Degree in Finance, been self-taught investing since I was 16, and still doing it, living in Europe. Now persuing CFA program. Dream is to work as Fund Manager based on Value Investing techniques, and make a lot of cash, not gonna lie.

I just got offered a position as Equity analyst, of a small fund with another ""senior"" (he's 30 and fund is approx 40Mln).

The new job's salary first 2 years is fixed (low bracket) and perf. fees after the 2nd year. Basically half of what I'm earning right now.  
My current job, where I started 1 year ago, I get a good paycheck, a bonus and many benefits, however I don't really like what I'm doing now (sales trader, was interesting at start because you get different prospective of the market, but never in the world I want to do this for my whole life, also it isn't what I've been self-studying my whole youth).

Of course not planning to work there for my whole life, but I don't know if an experience in a small fund would be better than an experience in an important company, given my ""Dream Job"".

On one side I know that starting early to do equity analyst/fund managment is great if you want to manage bigger amounts in the future, on the other side I know that prestige of the company you worked for is important in finance.

I don't really mind changing and making less I think I'm doing this for the experience more than anything, however I don't know how many doors it can open.

The fact is that in the current company I can make maybe x3/x4 of what I'm making right now in 3-4 years, but you can't really go past that unless you're lucky. A collegue of mine said that at start salary looks good, but at the end you'll see that there isn't much room to improve. So, looks like if you're good with having a mediocre/nice house, nice car and 1-2 nice holidays/year. So nothing really extravagant, which is what I'm aiming to. Been studying investing because I saw it as a good opportunity to make a lot of money if you generate a lot of Alpha.

What is blocking me:  
The company I'm currently working for, literally ""discovered"" me first, they gave me my first internship when I was 17, something that takes a lot of courage for a great company like them, but they have been impressed by how much I already knew at such age, so 1 year ago they offered me a job as sales trader without doing interviews with other candidate. I accepted the job (in the meanwhile I've been studying for my last year of bachelor's degree, really tough) because I thought that I would be able to transit from trading to Equity Analyst or Portfolio Managment department within the company (yes, they have those departments, as many brokers out there), but I think this isn't a remote possibility because I'm learning that trading floor's boss (which is the one who offered me the job and is fond of me) can't decide to move a resource from his department to another (I haven't asked him for confirmation because I don't want to sound ungrateful for what he and the company did for me, since in every industry, reputation plays a big role to be successful in life), even if I'm the youngest person in the company, so with a lot of room to improve no matter which department I work for.  
Also, I have been here for 1 year and I don't want to ""run to fast"" burning stages, but at the same time I don't want to lose the advantage I have over my peers (started to work very early in finance industry).

I don't really know what to do, looks like if I make the wrong choice I would be fuck\*d for my whole career life and it is something I don't really want since I'm fully committed to it and I know I will live a sad life being mediocre."

He's majoring in CS and doing some sort of debugging work if that makes a difference. Frankly I'm not a CS guy so I couldn't really describe what he does but I did ask if he had access to really important stuff and he sort of rolled his eyes."

I am a student who will enroll in the master‘s program in informatics. I would like to find a software engineering internship during my study and the wiki has helped me a lot. I have the following questions about finding an internship in Germany:
1.  Is there any website except Leetcode and Github where programmers share programs, ideas, and interview experiences with each other?
2. Is the content of interviews similar to that in the US, which usually includes algorithm, system design, and past internship experience? If not, what does the content include?
3. Does finding someone to promote you have a big impact on whether you get an interview or not?
4. Is it possible to interview and work in English? if not, which level of German is required?
5. Is the process of finding a job as a software engineer similar to the one in the US, usually finding a summer internship and managing to get a return offer? 
Thanks a lot!:)"
ox4csk,3,2021-08-03,Feeling lost in the void. Need help rationalizing my thoughts,[deleted],Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ox4csk/feeling_lost_in_the_void_need_help_rationalizing/,"21 F here feeling like I've tried many things to tackle mental health issues and getting nowhere. This post is chaotic just like me, so I apologize for the non-English and janky organization. 

I've been in therapy since the ripe old age of 12 after my mom put me there after my parents got divorced. Been on and off since. Recently on for about 3 years until insurance bit back so I'm taking a break. I've been on zoloft and Prozac and attempted suicide on each one, so stopped taking them. At this point I feel like I'm just seeking attention or my issues aren't even real. I put on such a convincing performance every day to coworkers, friends, my partner, to myself, that I feel normal and act ""normal."" My downward spirals come and go, and I've been fortunate enough to have not had a deadly one since March of this year. I haven't even felt that depressed or sat too much on these type of thoughts for a good month or two now. But I can feel it kicking back into gear and I'm scared. I don't know what to fucking do. There's no good reason for it either. If anyone has any mindfulness-based reading recommendations, I'm 100% down to check those out

‐----------------------------

Identifying risk factors: 
- My support group (friends, family, partner) is going through a shit time and I'm trying to support them. 


- Putting a lot on my plate. In one fell swoop I decided to rejoin my college NCAA sports team, become president of an animal rescue organization, work 20 hrs a week, a zoo internship, maintaining positions as executive board members for 2 other clubs, on top of coursework and a class I have to retake. I was feeling so good about doing all this, but now I'm feeling shaky and uncertain and feel I lack the ability to not enter a downward spiral during the upcoming semester.


- Continuing my habit of not reaching out to/responding to people I care about. Including my support group but not limited to. Since I got a phone at the ripe old age of 14, I have been *horrible* with responding to people. I'll go weeks without responding to a friend after we had a hearty chat. Or they reach out to say hello and we share a few back and forths and then I'm radio silent. Not fair to my friends or family. 


- Feeling incredibly selfish all the time. I constantly wear a mask and constantly feel like I'm trying to protect this ""nice person"" image of myself. I think about how I'm being perceived by people, how I have a stick up my butt, heck even what I'm writing right now. If I could get my head out of my ass, I'd probably be way better off. 


- Still overcoming trauma from a sexual assault by a close ex-friend. That shit messes you the fuck up. Yet I reported it, he admitted to it, got a punishment, the whole nine yards of justice. I had people supporting me along the way, both professionals and those close to me. How can I still feel so bothered by this event after working in therapy to overcome it and having such a huge support system that many don't get? And it was almost a year ago??? I should be over this, right?? Anytime I bring it up to people around me now, I feel like I'm attention-seeking. Or I feel like I'm bothering them, that they've heard me talk about it before, that they think I should be over it. 


- Feeling confused about my childhood. Was my dad abusive? He's not necessarily now--hes come a long way and remains far calmer in the face of conflict than he used to. But that doesn't erase what happened in the past. Never physical. I'm angry with how he raised me to be honest. But also grateful. How can those feelings exist at the same time? 

-------------------

Identifying calming factors:


- My rescue cat that I foster-failed. Petunia is 10 yo and is such an amazing creature. 


- Going for solo bike rides or walks. Downside is sometimes I have suicidal &amp; hateful thoughts while doing so, but when I remind myself to pay attention to my surroundings, my head clears out a bit. 

What the hell do I do if I can't escape from my own negativity? How can I fix myself?

P.S. will probably delete when I realize later how disgusting I sound here"

The Navy is currently running their SeaAirSpace Expo at the Gaylord convention center- I've been to about 10 booths so far, and most were interested in interns and whatnot. If you're an upperclassman engineer or compsci, this is a really good place to check out. 

It runs today and tomorrow from 7-4, so if you're in CP and thinking about work for next summer this is a really good place to be.

Edit: this isn't an event geared towards students, so there's almost no competition too. People were surprised to see a student at all."

Long time lurker here. I am planning on applying for the intake of 2023. Would be super grateful if I could get some feedback on my current profile and ways in which I can improve it.  


Demo - ORM \[Indian, Male\], International Applicant

GMAT - 760 \[46V,48Q\]

Undergrad - 6.5/10 in Computer Science from Top Uni \[think IITs/BITS\].

Work Ex - 2 yrs now, 4 by matriculation. 1 year in FP&amp;A at high growth startup (Unicorn), 1 year (and counting) as a PM at a different Unicorn. 

Post-MBA goals: Tech PM/Strat or Consulting. From what I've read on this sub, most internationals who want to stick around in the US tend to go for consulting or big tech (easier visa applications). 

Extracurriculars and other experience: I am working as a consultant for an International Org (think UN, World Bank, ADB) on a market entry project. I have also worked as a consultant for a few Non-Profits on go to market strategy, competitor analysis etc. I volunteer with the alumni association of my alma mater (focused on building lasting industrial partnerships for the institute). Was a part of event management teams and placement cell during college. Have 3 years of formal training in classical vocal music (this was quite some time ago, so not sure how much weight it will carry), play the guitar as a hobby.

Other education/coursework: CFA Level 1, an executive education course on Product Management from Kellogg

A few points that I am concerned about:

* Low GPA (of course). No excuse for the bad grades, I never really took to hardcore computer science, did a ton of extracurriculars in college. My undergrad uni does have tougher grading than most (median score being a 6/10 in most courses) but I'm not sure if that matters.
* WE - While I have tons of impact to show for my work, I don't really have any F500 brands on my resume (other than a few internships during college). Moving to FAANG/T2 tech in a product role is very difficult as most of them hire post MBA. I have been contemplating a move to VC (startup experience plays into it). Does a mid-size VC fund (a few hundred million dollars in AUM) make for a better profile than PM at unicorn startups? (I know it's apples and oranges but I've heard somewhere that VC being a smaller cohort is considered more prestigious).
* Target Schools - I'm targeting T15s, need help classifying them into Reach, Target and Safety as I don't really know where I might stand a good chance.

Lastly, any advice on profile building that might help me would be welcome."

I started learning basis around a year ago and landed my first job 6 months ago in a startup as front end dev.

I previously had 5years exp as IT recruiter and was making good money, but I was thriving for more so I decided to take my chances.. 

The start up I joined is good, provides good support and I learnt many new things, but my concern is they are only paying me intern salary and they don't provide any benifits such as PF ESI etc.. they don't have HR so they don't provide payslips as well.. I have current offer letter and they can provide with releaving letter at time of leaving the organisation .. 

So my concern is when I wanted to change organization will other organisations consider my exp as valid one, bcz I only can provide offer and releaving letter other than that I cannot provide much proof..  what are documents they usually ask employee to validate there startup exp ?

Kind of confused.. need suggestions please..."

ox5nur,1,2021-08-03,Just got offered a new job and I don't know what to do,Mr-Monroe,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ox5nur/just_got_offered_a_new_job_and_i_dont_know_what/," Male, 21, just got my Bachelor's Degree in Finance, been self-taught investing since I was 16, and still doing it, living in Europe. Now persuing CFA program. Dream is to work as Fund Manager based on Value Investing techniques, and make a lot of cash, not gonna lie.

I just got offered a position as Equity analyst, of a small fund with another ""senior"" (he's 30 and fund is approx 40Mln).

The new job's salary first 2 years is fixed (low bracket) and perf. fees after the 2nd year. Basically half of what I'm earning right now.  
My current job, where I started 1 year ago, I get a good paycheck, a bonus and many benefits, however I don't really like what I'm doing now (sales trader, was interesting at start because you get different prospective of the market, but never in the world I want to do this for my whole life, also it isn't what I've been self-studying my whole youth).

Of course not planning to work there for my whole life, but I don't know if an experience in a small fund would be better than an experience in an important company, given my ""Dream Job"".

On one side I know that starting early to do equity analyst/fund managment is great if you want to manage bigger amounts in the future, on the other side I know that prestige of the company you worked for is important in finance.

I don't really mind changing and making less I think I'm doing this for the experience more than anything, however I don't know how many doors it can open.

The fact is that in the current company I can make maybe x3/x4 of what I'm making right now in 3-4 years, but you can't really go past that unless you're lucky. A collegue of mine said that at start salary looks good, but at the end you'll see that there isn't much room to improve. So, looks like if you're good with having a mediocre/nice house, nice car and 1-2 nice holidays/year. So nothing really extravagant, which is what I'm aiming to. Been studying investing because I saw it as a good opportunity to make a lot of money if you generate a lot of Alpha.

ox5oem,0,2021-08-03,Am I behind in applying for internships right now?,phatnerdd,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ox5oem/am_i_behind_in_applying_for_internships_right_now/,"As a rising sophomore who didn't have the best luck in applying for internships last season (but still ended up getting a not-very-well-paid one), I'm trying harder to at least get interviews this season. I assumed the application would open beginning of August like last year, but apparently a lot of different applications opened up mid June (most notably Amazon lol). People also apparently got interviews and offers already? 

The reason I'm waiting is 

1. to practice leetcode (because I can barely do easies) and 

2. because I want to at least finish my current internship and start with maybe another personal project so I could polish my resume (which has one not really CS internship, projects from high school that were not very impressive, and bad descriptions and keyword optimizations). 

I also wanted to add in my positions I will have in the fall, like working as a TA and in a CS lab. I thought I would be able to wait and it would be fine, but now people are getting offers because they applied early to the top companies, and even intern openings for Salesforce (which I saw opened up a *while* ago) are now closed. I'm kinda getting nervous now, especially because I'm 100% not a competitive applicant. 

Am I putting myself at a disadvantage by waiting? Thanks!"
ox6cbx,2,2021-08-03,"Internship ends this month, I have no apartment or job at the moment - Not sure what to do",PoofyChairClub,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/ox6cbx/internship_ends_this_month_i_have_no_apartment_or/,"So, I'm a recent college graduate fulfilling a summer internship that ends on Aug. 29 - that is when I need to be out of my provided intern housing. Now, I don't have an apartment or immediate job set up for after. There are a couple of possibilities, though. 

I should hear back within the week about a remote, full-time $15/hour internship that would ease my worries significantly, should I get it. I feel OK about my odds, but I don't want to be complacent. It's possible I could work a little job for my brother, but in an area I don't want to live at all. They do have an extra guest room that I think they'd let me use for a little bit. I also am not keen on moving back in with my parents. I just think my mental health would suffer. 

I could move back to my old city where I went to college, but I'm feeling ready to move on and don't want to sign a full-year lease. 

Financially, I think I'll have around $5,000 at the end of my internship, maybe a little more if I save really well. 

In my head, I'm thinking that would at least be a deposit and 2-3 months rent in some cities, but maybe not much else. If I don't have a job lined up anywhere and no apartment, with 5k in savings, should I just go ahead and move to a city? There's a higher cost of living in general, and if I worked in my college town for 6-12 months I'd be a lot more comfortable moving with no job lined up in a year, but I don't want to spend another year waiting if I don't necessarily have to. Of course, if I get this internship, then my options might open up a bit more. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation? What did you do? What did you wish you did? What should I do? Appreciate any feedback or advice, let me know if you need to be more detailed on anything."

I've started a new internship as a security guard a few days ago and i like the job. The coworkers have been nice so far and I like my workplace. However, all of the people I have worked with so far won't be there tomorrow (partly working somewhere else), which means new people tomorrow, since I will at my current workplace for tomorrow as well. 

Again, I really like the workplace. The only issue is that I will work with completely new people tomorrow, maybe even alone as a guard, let's see. Its part of the job but it kinda got me by surprise for tomorrow and terrifies me right now. 

Adding to that my dad decided to insult me and terrorise me further, so that wasn't that good for me either.

Plus, I am tired as well so maybe it also has something to do with that.

I am trying to focus on the positive, also because I will have a day off right after tomorrow.

Its just really hard right now. Think I am having a nervous breakdown..."

I have sent hundreds of applications in for internships, jobs, etc. but I haven't gotten one call back. Is this going to be permanent?

It wasn't until today when I was talking to my therapist that I realized how much it's aiding. Here are some examples:

* Emotional Dysregulation:
   * Prior Meds:  I was more perceptive only of strong emotions --anger, sadness, euphoria, you get the gist, and when none of those emotions was present anything could phase me given that it wasn't strong enough to stimulate me; I'd feel like an empty husk waiting for orders 
   * On-meds: I'm calm, like not necessarily an empty husk, but relaxed. I can internalize my emotions A BIT better, and try to understand them rather than scientifically analyze them
* The Engine can be turned off:
   * Prior: I was 2 months through the summer without an internship, and not only did I feel guilty for not doing anything, but not doing anything is very discomforting to me, to the point that I would enter small depressive episodes because nothing was exciting nor stimulating enough. I had to be busy somehow, all the time
   * Now: I realized when I was talking to my therapist that there are days that I'm not doing much, and I am ok with that. When I don't touch my work, and I'm at peace with it because ik I will work on it the day after. I can be ok with not getting everything done
* I can remember more stuff now, without having to put reminders everywhere, all the time
* I don't zone out as much as I used to when talking with people
* I feel the need to get up and walk around when in meetings less often

I'm not trying to glorify meds, and frame it as the cure of it all. I'm slowly but surely trying to make meds help me aid into changing my patterns, and just now noticing all these changes has helped to stop gaslighting myself. Lately, I've been thinking that maybe I don't have ADHD, and I may do it for attention (even though I'm don't mention to people my ADHD), but just put in it into perspective I realized how much it has helped me, and that there's not just one way for meds to work. 

Let me disclose that along with my meds, I'm also in therapy, and trying to be more cognizant of my behavior. So regardless of how much of an influence my meds have, I will continue to use them, and readjust my behaviors to what I want them to be. School starts in less than 17 days, so we'll see how it being medicated will help improve my school life."

I wouldn't mind these hours if I got paid well, but I get paid absolute pennies, I get paid so little that I'm even ashamed to say it when people ask me. I know I'm an intern but my brother made the same 10 years ago when he was in college working 1/4 the hours.

I know the best possible course of action is to stick it until I get another job, but I just can't handle this anymore, my mental health is in the dumpster, I look depressed, I cry several times during the day in front of an excel spreadsheet, my family and BF are concerned.

oxkw99,18,2021-08-04,How to Be Productive During the Summer,FrostAries,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/oxkw99/how_to_be_productive_during_the_summer/,"This is going to be a long one. Now that I'm a Senior-to-be, I learned a few things I want to share to fellow younger high schoolers on how to be somewhat productive during summer:

1. **Always plan ahead:** Before the summer break starts, you want to plan and organize events, talking to organizations/internships, and/or organize a scheduled timeline. If you're a huge procrastinator like me, scheduling and especially agreeing to an event before summer will FORCE you to actually do it when summer comes (since cancelling will be awkward, and honestly, I'm too much of a scaredy-cat to do that). Pack your summer! Leave the tiredness and the ""why did I do this to myself"" to future you, and when summer ends, you got something done. For example, schedule a summer camp in the mornings/afternoons, and a tutoring class in the evenings. Now future you CANNOT refuse. 
2. **Do something you enjoy:** Oh god this is such a cliche tip, but honestly, it's so important. If you do not like an event that you planned, people will notice, and you will be less productive. Don't do something just for college! Even if it is for college, make sure the topic is at least something you're incredibly interested in. For example, let's say you're doing research for college. At least make sure the research topic is a huge passion. 
3. **Reach out and snatch opportunities**: Snatch 'em. Even without familial connections, I have come to realize that some opportunities will naturally come to you if you reach out first. For example, let's say you have a great relationship with a teacher and you're invested in a school club. Sometimes they'll have opportunities for you, so long as you ask. And sometimes, they will even give you opportunities (ex. internship!!) But you have to join that club first, and you have to take time to create an impression on the teacher/people around you. For other opportunities and less than lucky individuals, contact local organizations! At least one of them will be willing to take a capable (and determined) student. One of my friends got an internship simply by contacting local businesses. They don't have to be super famous and big. 
4. **Take breaks and love yourself:** I know, another cliche tip. However, especially after noticing a ton of burnt out classmates around me, there can be a vicious cycle for being unproductive. You waste away the summer by fearing how little time is left, you despise yourself for being lazy, then more of the summer wastes away, etc. As long as you have one event that will make you feel good about yourself (let's say participating in a summer camp), then you'll feel like you can be even more productive! Also, to all your haters, now you can flex your productivity on them. Prove to yourself that you are capable first, and suddenly, your self confidence and love for yourself will greatly rise (this helped me a lot, especially with my terribly low self esteem).

Obviously, I'm not a professional, and some of these tips I may have come to learn a bit too late. But these are some stuff I have come to figure out, so I want to share. Hopefully I'm helping at least one of you nervous wrecks! 

P.S. Hopefully I put the right flair..."

Besides work I am the founder and captain of an FTC robotics team, I am president of our relatively successful math club, the captain of our science bowl team, and I volunteer about 5-6 hours at my church. I also have a few smaller clubs and hobbies I do but they aren't really that big of a deal, and I don't have some of the research, big internships, or big awards that some other students may have.

oxm9x6,0,2021-08-04,Completely lost,_itdoesntevenmatter_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oxm9x6/completely_lost/,"I’m a rising sophomore at a public school having a CS program better than other programs but an okayish school in general. I came from a STEM heavy high school background but I didn’t think I’ll have the stamina to build a career in the pure sciences and I’d never really done any thing non stem so I opted for a CS Major. Enjoyed intro to CS, great prof and I started enjoying CS. Data structures was online too, but I mostly cut corners and did just enough to ace exams and get an A, not too competent to write code from scratch. After a year of covid school, I’ve  realized that I’ve completely lost motivation to succeed academically like I did in high school, I mean I’m sure I’ll get As and A-s but I’ll never have the intuition and understanding. I am capable of that, and I know covid and online school can be a reason but I’m no longer going to sit down and study in my life after almost 2 years of slacking off. But I’m not ‘dumb’ dumb. I feel that it is because I don’t like the Software Engineering internship race at all. I don’t want to be a dead CS Major grinding leetcode and scampering for personal projects, running from one bootcamp to another and spending sleepless nights at hackathons. 

I don’t wanna become a code monkey. I’ve come to realize that I love talking, communication and things that involve people. Obviously that doesn’t mean I’m gonna transition to show business because that would be dumb even though glamorous but I’ve literally enjoyed nothing other communicating with people, leading clubs and student govt and learning to be a better communicator because I’ve always been an extrovert. The things I’m excited about going into regular college for the first time isn’t dealing with fucking swe code tests for a year for the next summer but live life, meet new people, be a better conversationalist, communicator and leader. 
But I have zero clue how that translates to a career. While I don’t wanna put in the effort to get an internship for summer 22, I also don’t wanna not do anything for the summer, because it feels guilty when you do nothing when you could be sitting on a shit ton of money. And till I figure out what I want to do by the time I graduate, I could do internships and make a saving that can help me while I find a real thing for me or even startup.

Product management and analyst internships look bearable and super interesting tbh but I don’t think I’m qualified for anything. I have stuff on my resume but I’ve literally done nothing in those jobs and never written a single line of code, and I’m super unmotivated to even make a leetcode or hacker rank account or even write a single line of code. I can, and I can do it well but I’m a couch potato and will never do it because it doesn’t intrigue me a bit, working your ass off for a job you’re not too excited about. But money is money lol. With all this uncertainty around career I’m super lost. Please help."

I would consider myself to have a passion for the field as I love working with computers and have learned several programming languages such as Java, Python, and Lua. I've made some small projects (like this stock options screener [https://github.com/GitOffMyPorch/Robinhood-options-screener](https://github.com/GitOffMyPorch/Robinhood-options-screener) and this library organization program for my school [https://github.com/GitOffMyPorch/JavaLibrary](https://github.com/GitOffMyPorch/JavaLibrary)) So I think I have the motivation and drive to make this path a good fit.

Right now I'm considering two colleges, Grand Canyon University in Arizona or my local university in my home town. I would like to ideally go to Grand Canyon, but if not, my backup is the local university where I'm fairly sure I can secure a full ride (I'm pretty close to a full ride at Grand Canyon, but still short about 3,500 a year based on their offered scholarships).

 I'd like to know if anyone maybe has experience with Grand Canyon being a good school for this? Based on this thing I found it says they are in the top 5% [https://computer-science-schools.com/grand-canyon-university](https://computer-science-schools.com/grand-canyon-university) but I don't know how factual it is. I'm just slightly worried that I'll have graduated and end up with a low paying job relative to the industry (like 20-40k salary) or worse, that I may not end up with a job at all. 

From what I've heard a good CS grad in an entry level position can expect somewhere around 50-70k a year (correct me if I'm wrong) and that's what I would like to shoot for with potential for a six-figure salary at some point. Do I need to be really aggressive with trying to get good internships to make that a reality?

&amp;#x200B;

So TLDR; my two questions are,

Does anyone have experience coming from Grand Canyon? and if so is expecting 70k salary out of college (specifically GCU) reasonable (assuming I put the work in)?

How important are internships in securing a good job with a good salary right out of college?

Thanks, to anyone in advance. Just trying to make sure that I make a good decision going forward into this new section of my life."

We would like you guys to advise on which country/city in the country (UK/Canada) to move to. We are targeting UK/Canada citizenship. 

Basic info:

Married couple, both born in HK. Have savings around usd 110k. 

Male - age 32; working as a banking data analyst for 4 yrs; got an unrelated master degree and math/phy bachelor degree with good grades; having working knowledge of R/Python/SQL/data vis.; all exp. are in HK, will study online master of computer science (omscs) Georgia tech in coming January (if application successful) 

Female - age32; working as an enrolled nurse (equiv. to nursing asso. in UK, in general a nursing practitioner with fewer years of training than a bachelor in nursing); 2 yrs of exp.

Visa Application:

Canada - open work permit for HKers, can only enter the country after receiving a job offer; can apply for PR after 1 yr exp

UK - BNO Visa, which allows us to work without restrictions; it takes 5 years to get indefinite leave to remain

Plan:

Male - study part-time while finding a full-time job of software engineer/data science, internship or junior

Female - transfer the nurse license in HK to an equiv. qualification and study full-time registered nursing bachelor OR studying

For family plans, we are planning to have a baby within 4 years. 

Consideration:

1. Saving for a future house/flat - we love a stable home than moving around, and we will save $ aggressively for that. 
2. Leveraging on the master student status of Male for opportunities in tier 1/2 tech firms - Canada is closer to GaTech and hopefully can get into a good tech firm (of course it depends on various factors).  
3. Cost of living - around usd 2k-2.5k per month, a suburban city than a crowded one like HK would be better. Target is to not drain our savings too much. 
4. Job market for SWE/data science - which cities are fast growing? 


Our choices currently are:
1. London (job opportunitiesssss) 
2. Cambridge (job opportunitiesss) 
3. Leeds (cost of living) 
4. Toronto (job opportunitiesss) 
5. Vancouver (job opportunities)

Please also advise any cities that match our consideration. Thanks!"

Hello, I've linked below a rough draft of my resume which has my education and work experience info.  I know that product associate isn't directly related to IT. But I have no other IT related work experience and I just felt confident enough posting I skills I feel like I have received working in manufacturing.  While I wish I could have signed up for an internship earlier in my school career, unfortunately due to financial circumstance and family health issues, I had to focus on just keeping a job while attending school. 

My main issues is that I just feel unconformable listing out computer skills like SQL or Python when I haven't used them yet in a work setting. I know that I'm just starting out but the list of requirements for most entry IT jobs listing makes me feel discouraged as a beginner. I just want some career direction so that I can better utilize my time instead of just grabbing a list of certifications for a entry level job for IT work experience. 

How does this subreddit deal with getting bombard with different qualifications or skills when trying to apply for their first job/internship? How would you recommend posting SQL competency in a resumes?

So I got accepted into a uni to major in CS. However, now I need to choose a specific track, and I'm a bit lost.

Cybersecurity:

+ Would give me some specialization which is great because I'm really worried about not having any niche knowledge
+ More internships available where I live
+ Could be fun to learn

- I'm not the biggest fan of cybersecurity and don't find it that exciting
- I have no intention of actually working in this field so lots of time might be wasted

Digital systems:

+ More variety with regards to languages &amp; systems studied
+ The track itself is more modern and up-to-date
+ A bit more free time 

- No specialization which is really stressing me out
- 'digital systems' sounds a bit tacky and unspecified

So, what should I study? I know it doesn't matter that much in the long run, but still want to make the right choice."

I've struggled with mental illness since elementary school. Now diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OSFED (eating disorder). My grades sophmore year 2nd semester dropped due to my disorders getting out of control. GPA was still considering high, but a noticeable drop from my usual. I'm on meds and doing treatment so hopefully my functioning improves and I do better in school Junior year. 

I don't know how I'll explain this drop in my grades to colleges. I know it's not a great idea to write about mental illness in essays. And with all the stigma around mental illness, I don't want to come off as a liability to schools. But I feel like I need to explain it because the drop in grades is obvious, at least to me. I went from straight A's to a mix of A's and B+'s. I know that's considered good still, but I've been a straight A student since freshman year so it's noticeable. Can you tell that I'm an anxious perfectionist lol? 

Also idk what to write about on essays. I have basically no hobbies, thanks mental illness! I've always struggled with finding interest in things. I've won no awards at school either. I know you can write about a life challenge, but my main life change is my mental illness. But it's not a great idea to write about it so I'm at a loss. I don't want to sound like I'm asking for pity or making excuses. Is is appropriate to write about how you overcame mental illness (if I even can recover lmao), or how something like perseverance in relation to mental illness recovery?

I don't have many ECs either, only violin (4 years but recently quite due to severe anxiety attacks), tech internship, and key club freshman yr. I'm interested in maybe going to med school or nursing school to be a psychiatrist or psych np, and there's a medical careers club at my school, which might appeal to me. It's just so hard to find ECs when I have virtually no hobbies. I'm hardly a person anymore.  Maybe some volunteering or a summer job would be a good idea, if I'm well enough. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? Thanks :)"
oxxpqb,1,2021-08-04,Juggling two offers,kels234,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oxxpqb/juggling_two_offers/,Hi guys I’m having a dilemma. I just graduated college and have been doing an internship at this large company since last year. It was pretty much guaranteed that I would be receiving a full time job offer in May after graduating but there was a lot of hold up by HR and the full time position became a bit less guaranteed so during this time I started applying to other jobs for my own job security so I wasn’t being dependent on this one job offer to come through. Fast forward to now and I ended up receiving a job offer from the company last week but I also got the opportunity to interview with an even bigger company this week and am pretty far along the interview process and the prospects look good. This second company will potentially be giving out a much better salary package and my growth career wise will be much better as well. Now i’m stuck with the first company’s offer (where I interned) and another company’s offer which will most likely be coming in next week. I’m about 95% sure I’ll be getting an offer from this second company and would prefer to work there instead. I just feel horrible about the first company that has given me an offer since i’ve interned with them for so long and they are assuming that I will be accepting their offer. Don’t know how to have the conversation about not accepting the offer after the second company’s offer comes in since I’ve already made up my mind.
oxypum,18,2021-08-04,Microsoft Internship Interview,demacros,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/oxypum/microsoft_internship_interview/,"Hi,

I've just been invited to a codility coding challenge by Microsoft followed by a first-round screen next week. Which is quite short notice. I requested Friday the 13th as it's the final screening day available.

I will be starting my third year of University in September in CS and have zero leetcode experience.

I have done some basic algorithm scripting on freeCodeCamp and did ok, not great!

I have just gone and bought CTCI, most probably too little too late.

The codility questions (3 of them) need to be completed prior to the virtual screen/interview. And once started it must be completed within 80 minutes. I will get to do the virtual interview regardless of the score on codility. I don't want to start that until I have done as much practice/study as possible so will probably leave it until the day before.

Has anybody got any advice or know the level of difficulty for an internship role coding interview, I know Microsoft have very high standards and lots of applicants so I'm thinking my chances of landing the position are slim to none but I'm going to do my absolute best regardless.

I've got about 8 or 9 days to cram algorithms and data structures, behavioural questions etc. I will probably be doing 12 hour days on the computer.

Any advice at all would be hugely appreciated! I know I'm screwed!

edit: I am just now learning what big O notation is all about in CTCI, am I expected to understand this fully even though we haven't covered that yet in college?"

oy1bn5,6,2021-08-04,I work for an event space as a website admin. A Director of Events was waiting for a laptop but I was prioritized given the nature of my work. The director found out and effectively confiscated my laptop.,[deleted],work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/oy1bn5/i_work_for_an_event_space_as_a_website_admin_a/,"Title says the most. This Director has been extremely patronizing with me since I on-boarded and I feel as though I'm constantly prepping to defend myself against them. 

I was onboarded to take-on day-to-day management of a Wordpress site that was previously split between 4 people. The org is honestly extremely not savvy at managing their hardware or software, they don't even have an instant messaging tool so we just email each-other constantly when we're not in-office. They also give out phones to interns if their manager requests one for them but not to full-time employees like myself. 

So long-story short I make my case that I need to have a laptop to manage the site in the event I'm remote and an immediate website update is needed (the office has desktops that we use when we're there), I eventually get one and things are otherwise hunky-dory. Today at a meeting this director dude says to me ""oh did you bring your laptop?""[because he asked me to bring it to the meeting] and he picked it up and goes ""so this was not allocated to you, you’re in the queue and IT will be getting you another one shortly [total lie]; did you bring the charger?""

I confirm later with IT that this transition was not planned or approved, not sure what to do here. I'm pretty low on the hierarchy but I can't help but think this deliberate seizure of company resources would get someone in trouble at most places. Help lol

UPDATE: They gave it back after I told a superior (&amp; IT earlier) during a meeting ""I could show you this, but Jonathan took my laptop"""

However, at the end of the course, we had to take an exam in order to get certified in the software. Believe it or not, I passed with a really high score.

However, that was back in 2018 in high school. Right now I'm a first year in the pre-engineering (Electrical Engineering) program looking for a possible internship for, well, electrical engineering.

ECS:

- part time job (lifeguard) 
- “leader” in youth volunteer organization 
- surf club co-president and founder
- CSF (basically NHS for California)

I lead groups within a volunteer organization, but I don’t run the program. I just feel like being ‘good’ won’t be enough for T30-40 schools.

I don’t have time for prestigious internships and such bc of my job, and I’m not smart enough for academic research or tournaments like I see a lot on this sub.

That's what we're paying YOU for!""",shoggyseldom,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/oy2jof/where_are_the_project_requirements_what_do_you/,"Over the last year or so I've had the, uhhhh, pleasure of watching roughly 2/3 of our little consultant company's work force quit and run for the hills, mostly due to the mismanagement of a pair of absolute train-wreck projects.


One to ""upgrade"" a completely functional but no-longer-supported-by-the-vendor Angular tool/site.... by completely rebuilding it all as a dedicated .Net thing. We're not going to dwell on all the silliness involved in this, though I will mention that when I first pitched in they handed me a 1200 line STATIC HTML page that was very obviously created by copy-pasting the angular output and having an Intern manually go through it and set up the mappings... I don't really know how they wound up at that point, only there was a LOT of uninformed promises and ""estimates"" in early phases and the constant rotation of people working on, realizing it's insane, and then quitting. Eventually, at the cost of the company's most-senior developer/architect, that nose-dive leveled off to the point where (only 8 months behind schedule) the customer now has an app just as good as the one they started with, and we can now start working on improvements.


The other project didn't go nearly so well. 


To start with some important groundwork: our little company's CEO is comically out of touch. He used to code at some point, at least that's what he says, and believes this makes him an adequate subject matter expert as far as estimates and approaches go, and that he's ""one of us"" (seriously, he keeps dragging the one on-site Junior Dev out to random lunches to ""shoot the shit"" and has invited us all to his virtual birthday party next month with instructions to ""bring an amusing or embarrassing anecdote about working with me"". Imagine that energetic, but unqualified guy that got added to your team, so you do your best to push him towards the pointless busywork tasks and have someone more senior doublecheck literally everything he does in case he accidentally sets the office on fire... except he's the CEO and perfectly willing to override/fire anyone who second guesses his genius. He does not grasp why he ""doesn't get more honest feedback"", though I'm working on that.


My role in this is just being a senior-ish dev on an absolutely bullet-proof contract, who's been feeling bad about the two remaining junior devs and have been doing some OT (paid, you better fuckin believe me) to help triage the train-wrecks and get things moderately back on track. However, since I'm cheerfully cynical about the whole thing and perfectly willing to call the CEO's bullshit (what's he going to do, fire me and let the customer direct-hire me without breaching their contract?), I've somehow been designated as both his ""Friend"" and ""Only Expert Worth Listening To"". I mostly just act as an interpreter between him and the Junior devs, since there's a direct correlation between people quitting and how much they have to interact with crazy CEO man.


Now, on to the second train-wreck project. When I first got brought in to survey the wreckage and give my input on what needs to be done to get things back on track, I was told we were writing a fair-sized piece of middleware to transform incoming web requests and then shove them into various databases, replacing a bunch of SQL stored procedures that nobody at the customer's company is qualified to maintain. That all sounded decent enough, until I asked to see the Requirements and Tech Design Docs... which didn't exist. That's not to say there was nothing, we had piles of documentation on the assorted use-cases for the middleware, mostly made by the single junior dev who did 90% of the actual code work, who extracted the data from the customer's team via an absolutely grueling series of meetings. We also had piles and piles of other documentation from the 3-ish prior attempts to inject some amount of sanity and order into the process, which were all put on hold by the CEO, since ""the team needs to be writing code to show the customer we're working hard"". Needless to say, those people quitting was a complete surprise to him.


So, in short, we've got a project with little-to-no documentation, but on the bright side, that one junior dev had been soldiering through like a champ, working with the ground-level folks at the customer to generate requirements and design on the fly so he could keep writing code, and GOOD code at that. Honestly, it looked to me like all we really had to do was shake some concrete OFFICIAL requirements out of the customer and draw up a decent design docs, and then just let the junior dev keep working without the CEO or Customer jogging his elbow all the time. I relay this information to the CEO, and volunteer to be the customer-shaker for this so I can make sure we actually get what we need... and then get told not to worry about it, he'll handle it personally in his meeting with the customer's Chief of Ops coming up that week.


Well, after several days of working on getting internal documentation straightened out with the team (Junior Dev and a newly-hired mid-level guy, who the CEO fired for ""not being a team player"" within the month), I finally get the word back from the CEO about how the meeting with the customer went, and the word is ""Stop"". No more coding, none at all, just sit there and document stuff. I was honestly elated, since this was what I'd been telling him was needed since the start, but then I found out the reason why: The customer didn't want our code, not because it was bad, but because HE'D NEVER ASKED FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. The contract was apparently to analyze their internal system and generate a requirements doc FOR the customer, preferably without wasting any of his people's time asking silly questions like, well, what their damn requirements are. This is where it finally clicked for me and I realized that it was the leadership on BOTH sides that was crazy, not just ours.


See, anyone who's been around the block a few times as a dev can tell you that Requirements are a huge, absolutely crucial, and easily fuck-up-able part of any project, and the surest way to torpedo the whole project is to have the Requirements written by people who aren't the actual users. While it's possible to hire a consulting company to HELP you make a good requirements document, telling them just to do it for you is a catastrophically stupid idea, virtually guaranteed to end with the Customer holding a completely useless pile of garbage and lawsuits about how much they'd paid for it. The customer's COO didn't agree though, he didn't want his people wasting their time on planning their own system's upgrade, those are hours they could be doing REAL work!

This COO guy had gone through negotiations at least five different larger contracting firms, who all dug in their heels on the requirements issue and refused to take on the project. So, rather than take the fucking hint, the COO decides to hire a separate firm just to make the Requirements documents, so he could then take them to the larger companies he'd already been negotiating with. Of course he didn't have much better luck, since now he was just explicitly asking for the stupid part up front, but then enter our CEO... who happily agreed that it sounded totally reasonable and he'd get a team on it right away.

The first two senior people our CEO tried to put on the contract flatly refused, but one of our Project Managers was incapable of telling him ""no"", so the project started with the PM and a few devs, who quickly realized what a shit-show this all was and all took turns quitting, until (after four complete team changes) it was just the Junior Dev doing the work and the CEO acting as the Project Manager. Despite all this turnover and our CEO's magical ability to reshape his perception of reality to fit his internal narrative, this shouldn't have been enough to forget what the whole point of the contract was, but he maintains that the initial customer contract was for a whole Rebuild, not just generating the requirements for it out of thin air. Fortunately our CEO had a moment of lucidity and dropped the contract rather than press further.

The final cherry on top of this that led to so much wasted code, was that the customer's leadership was just as bad at communication as ours, AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM THOUGHT WE WERE THERE FOR A REBUILD TOO, hence all the time they were willing to spend talking with Junior Dev and testing his work. We had to tell THEM what was going on, and at the final meeting where we handed over the jumbled pile of documentation we'd accumulated and the 85% complete piece of middleware, you could just hear the frustration and resignation in their voices as they talked about how close they got to replacing all the SQL spaghetti they'd been dealing with for the last 10 years.

And thus ends the Tale of Two Idiots."

I feel like I often read this sub and get very mixed messages about what entering the workforce is like for people who have done it already or are struggling to get into it. 

I realize that some of the back-and-forth on the sub is due to the nature of the subreddit since more active members are usually trying to find a job and need help and are thus over-represented. My brother who is three years older than me currently works for a Big-N and that is basically the goal, but I want to be realistic if I can reach it in my case.

You can stop reading here if you want to give a general reply but I'll put some info for tips and advice on what I might improve on. I can also send my resume if somebody wants to take a peak.

***INFO ABOUT ME***: Like I said I go to UNT for CS, I transferred from A&amp;M where I wasn't studying CS because my grades, but have since improved them steadily. I have two and a half years left and I think I'll likely get a 3.3-3.4 final cumulative GPA with a much higher major GPA. Haven't taken tons of CS classes (only two), but I will be taking DS+AL &amp; more in the spring/fall to hopefully get my technical ability to pass more than hackerrank easy questions. I have no internships, but I have a decent amount of simple coding projects from my previous major although I know I should work on a project outside of class to stand out and I really should get a GitHub and put things on it.

I'm teaching English in a beautiful city and my contract is almost up. I've been here since  2019 and it's been great. I like teaching English well enough and I love the students. However,        
I definitely don't see teaching English as a career. I'm entering my 30's and  want to transition to a career in Web Design/Development. I have a lot of reasons for this but also I want  to live as a digital nomad. (I cringe at that term but that's the lifestyle I'd want for the next five years). 

What's troubling me is the following.

1. SKILLS - My job was 40+ hours a week and also I got distracted by the novelty of living here. Because of this I didn't focus on coding, web design, or other technical skills these last two years. (Met tons of people and had loads of fun though!) I wouldn't say I'm at a complete zero competence with these skills but I feel that I'm a long ways from being employable. 
2. MONEY - I didn't save a lot since I was having too much fun. Because of that I can't really afford to get my own place right away. I'd have to move  in with my sister or parents. (I'm 29 -\_-) On top of that I'm from somewhere with high cost of living and where you need a car so most of my savings would immediately go towards buying a really cheap car to get around.
3. TIME -  Knowing the above, I'd have to grind and get my skills up while living at home, do low level freelance work, and maybe eventually start making enough to move out again after 4 -6 months. I want to avoid getting a McJob that just pays the bills because it would take away from coding and developing the skills I want to actually focus on. I've applied to quite a few internships and Jr. Web Dev positions but haven't gotten anything back.
4. Covid-19 and Japan - It's been a shitshow with how the Japanese government is handling the situation this year. I'm going home to get vaccinated next month and attend a wedding but there's still a lot of restrictions in place and people are sick of it. With the way it's going nightlife and normal social events probably won't resume as normal until spring.  Things open back up for a few weeks or a month and then shut back down again for just as long. It's lame. 
5. As far as technical skills go I'm still unsure as to what I want to specialize in. I need more time to explore and find what specifically I'm most passionate about pursuing as a career. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I have working for me.

1.  I've gotten used to working/living in Japan. I could save quite a bit more money this year that I know the ropes and gotten a lot of traveling done. 
2. I have a promising job interview next week. Less hours and more relaxed atmosphere so I would  have a lot more time and energy to dedicate to being productive. 
3. Japanese - I've been learning the language and using it is satisfying.
4. Food/Friends/People in Japan - Enough said. That being said I miss the friends and food at home as well. 
5. My family back home is amazing and super supportive. It's by no means a bad situation for me to go back home. It would sting my ego a bit but that's about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr;**

Final thoughts. Basically it comes down to this. 

Move back home and be broke, with no job, but a ton of time to level up my different skills.

oy75fo,2,2021-08-04,Advice for internship not giving me project they said they would/ruining course credit,tinyiguana56,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oy75fo/advice_for_internship_not_giving_me_project_they/,"So for some background, I am currently interning at a large-ish company and also getting my masters at a university. I am almost done with my masters but I need to get credit for this internship to graduate. 

My internship manager assigned me a project at the beginning and said my mentor would tell me what to do. But throughout the internship, my mentor has only been giving me assignments like ""write this report"" or ""proof read this document while we figure out where to start you on the project"" even though at the beginning I had a meeting with both my manager and mentor together to go over the project I would be working on. Just the other day, my mentor said ""the project is done now, can you proof read the report?"" . I did not want to be problematic because I am hoping to get an offer because I would likely get placed in a different team if i got the offer anyways so I just do the assignments. I know other interns on other teams got actual projects from start to finish so I just got unlucky.

For my university requirements, the internship needs everyone to work on one main project and demonstrate knowledge of course concepts with some language (Python, R, etc). The problem is that the internship course is coming to an end and I didnt get to work on the project because my mentor and team already did it without including me. I need to write a report for school and I will fail the course for sure if i just said what i did in the internship. I am thinking of just extracting things from the report they asked me to read and say that i participated in some of those test case writing. I am very stressed because if I dont pass the class I wont graduate on time, but also I dont want to lie and get in trouble with the company (if they would care). I dont think the school would send my report back to the company, but they do ask the mentors to fill out an evaluation of the mentee and I am not sure what is on that evaluation. I am super stressed because if I email my teacher, i will for sure fail the class at this point because the class is almost over. If i email my mentor or manager, I wouldnt be able to say ""i didnt get to work on the project"" without pointing fingers at my mentor and making myself look bad, and not getting an offer.

Should I just submit an exaggerated report of what I did and hope for the best or does anyone have any similar experiences with internships and school/advice?"

Sorry about the vague EC's! A lot of the application comes down to the story you are trying to convey and not the quantity of EC’s you achieved. 

Remember to enjoy the process of applying to schools and not get too frustrated with yourself. Taking breaks away from the essay is super  important

oya4mi,6,2021-08-05,apparently I know nothing,MentalButNoHealth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oya4mi/apparently_i_know_nothing/,"I am a sophomore in Computer Engineering and vying to get my first real internship for the summer of 2022. Buuttttt as it happens, it seems like I know nothing. I know how to use C and some amount of C++ but that's it. And I have got to know how to use HTML/CSS and Javascript and data parsing and everything about APIs and JSON and MySQL as soon as I can because recruitment season is almost upon us. 

I am just kind of mind blown by how little what I am learning in school is helping me in industry. Admittedly I am just starting out, but now I know that I will have to learn all of these along side my regular course work this Fall semester AND that too in time to apply to get an internship in summer, i.e., before October. 

How do I go about learning this stuff? In particular, this is for the HubSpot coding challenge  which says:

""We'll provide you with an [**API**](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/8341/a-marketer-s-guide-to-apis.aspx) which you can use to retrieve some data which will be specific to you and you alone. This data will represent a real-world problem which we'll describe to you in detail when you start the assessment. We'll ask you to take this data and modify it in some way to solve this problem. We'll provide you with a separate API which you can use to send us back this modified data as your solution.""

And to be able to solve this, I need to know:

"" The basics of [**HTTP**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) requests - performing GET and POST requests and understanding headers and status codes

The [**JSON data format**](https://www.json.org/) and how to parse from it or serialize into it

Common data structures and when and how to use them - arrays, maps, sets""

Right now I am just learning about binary search trees in C and practicing using classes in C++. Any suggestions on how I can proceed from this level would be very, very much appreciated."

I got the filings and cleaned it to the best of my ability to get tokens. To extract information for it, the task involved cross referencing a dictionary to get things such as number of positive/negative words, complexity, uncertainty, etc.
With a report of about 5.6k words, it takes my algorithm about 27 seconds to get the required info about the text going word by word from the tokens.
For something like 48k words it's taking 220s. 
There are reports with much higher word count too.

What do I do?,DumbassFromNZ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oyfjn1/just_graduated_recently_and_feel_a_little_lost/,"I graduated last week with a Bachelors in Computer and Information Sciences degree with a software development major and I feel a little lost on what I should be doing. I'm trying to apply for internships since I have no work experience but I'm having no luck. I don't know how internships work like do they start immediately or during the summer (I'm in the southern hemisphere so its winter) like how do I know if I get a summer position?

I honestly feel like I missed some opportunities when I was studying in my final year since I've read about people doing internships while studying. I avoided getting a job to focus on my studies and not put pressure on myself and it paid off since I was happy with my final semester grades. I feel as if I wasted my one opportunity in getting experience.

I honestly feel down because I want to get into qa/software testing but no one wants to hire me. I don't know how I can build that experience and I'm pretty much passing time. What I am afraid of is waiting for too long and losing some of the knowledge acquired from university and I'm already feeling incompetent with my skills. That is why I am avoiding software development roles because I feel like I am incompetent and that I should be doing something like qa/software testing. I do enjoy software testing and I am passionate about it but I think I can do better.


Do I start upskilling in my free time or what? 
What did you guys do after you graduated? 
Was it a long wait till you found something? 
Is there any recommendations that could help me?

For context, I started out as an intern right after college and slowly worked my way up into my current position.

I’ve dealt with mishandled sexual harassment issues, not being paid enough, getting a counter offer to finally be paid a semblance of what I’m worth (and then they tried to strong-arm me into a punitive contract), micromanaging from supervisors, lack of respect from leadership and department heads, lack of empathy or communication throughout the pandemic (no word from leadership for almost a year)…

And yet I still have a soft spot for this place because I’ve met the best people, learned so many new skills, it was my first job (and the first time I’ve ever resigned), and I cared deeply about the work I did.

Fast forward to this week (my last day is the 13th): they usually send out a staffing change email alerting everyone who’s leaving, where they’re going to (if they want to share), and just something nice about their time there. The managing director sent the staffing change email about my position since my supervisor is off this week. This is what it said (with parts redacted):

“___ will be leaving us as of August 13. ___ has been integral to the success of the company for most of the last decade. Please join me in thanking them for their years of hard work and wishing them well in their new endeavors.”

To me, I feel hurt because this felt bland, especially coming from someone I’ve know for the better part of a decade. They keep showing me that I made the right decision to leave the closer I get to August 13. I can’t help but feel bitter, though. I guess I’m looking for validation of my anger and saltiness."

Is it already too late for some companies? What kind of companies are recruiting currently/will be recruiting later? Is there a specific community resource like a spreadsheet or website that we can use to gather this information? 

Hope the answers to these questions will benefit a lot of other people here as well!

I applied to JPMorgan for their intern program last year and even though I answered the coding questions easily, I think I took too long to take the assessment as slots were already getting filled. 

I've been out of practice for a bit, so I'm prepping with leetcode to refresh my memory and skills but are the coding questions here typically any harder than the ones for the internship positions?

Update: 

I took the coding challenge assessment and I managed to answer one of the two questions correctly. The one I didn't answer correctly, I did know how to solve but I was really unfamiliar with how the values were being read in and looking at my test output wasn't helpful. Overall, I'm not feeling too hot because I missed that one question but hopefully I can make it onto the next round."

For context, I currently live in the US and have been looking for a new job. I have applied to the same company in the US, made it through 2 rounds of technical interviews, and was recently offered a US role at that company on a contract basis. Unfortunately I could not take it due to visa issues. It was a Embedded Software Engineer III role.

The engineer manager in India is aware of the backstory. As part of the initial discussion, he asked me about my salary expectations in India. It would be a similar engineering role. Should I use a number I’ve seen on Glassdoor as a reference (14-18LPA) while mentioning my salary expectations or is Glassdoor unlikely to be accurate?

I did my B.E in India (EEE), and MS in the US in a CS related field. I have 2.5 yrs of full-time work experience in the US + a 3 month full-time US internship at this company while doing my Master’s. I am trying to find a fair amount to mention that does not undersell my skills.

(P.S if this is not the right subreddit for salary advice, is there a specific subreddit for salary tips?)

I just finished a summer internship and was offered a choice of a few other roles within the company to jump into this fall while I finish my degree (I graduate in December of this year). One thing that hasn't been discussed is pay. I feel like these roles will be more reliant on my engineering knowledge than the scope of my prior internship.

Can someone in my shoes expect a pay bump as they move forward from an internship into a  less-temporary role, even if it will go from full-time to part-time as I begin the fall semester?"

oynbry,3,2021-08-05,4000 COVID sequences,ML_Science,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/oynbry/4000_covid_sequences/,"Hello, 
I'm new to processing NGS data. Im an RnD scientist at a diagnostics company and they began sequencing SARS-CoV-2 samples 3 or 4 months ago. Initially we just sent the data through the Illumina BaseSpace pipeline for lineage tracing, however most of my work at the company revolves around data workflows for the ins and outs of all labs (including the covid lab).
Because I'm the only person with both science and coding background I was tasked with creating our own pipeline. Because if we take it a diagnostic route we need to have all of the methodology tweaked to our purpose. I know bioinformatics isn't something you pick up in a few months :). To fix this I hired an intern from a local uni who is currently in his last year of his PhD research for a similar topic. I've got him working on a pipeline for a singular sample, while I work on automating it for hundreds of samples. This is working really well, and the pipeline is producing very similar results to the currently trusted Illumina pipeline. I've learned so much and it's actually pushing me back into school to complete my own PhD. (Please, check my other posts if interested in helping with that decision!)

For now though....
What would you do with nearly 4000 covid sequencing data sets (fastq for both PE reads, but the BCL files are stored within the instrument still if we'd like to go that far back). The data sets includes a lot of demographic data, and is from a decently condensed geographical area. The data has a subset of about 80 people who were swabbed multiple times throughout their infection. There are also about 65 subsets of families who got infected together (presumably being exposed to the same virus to start their infection).

I personally have little to no knowledge in the biological space, but that's something I've really been building over the past 6 months in this position. I know there are things I'm over looking, but producing and analyzing the vcf files for these subsets has been getting my brain going on different ideas for research projects.

What would you do if you had all this data?"

I have almost 3 years of experience managing the data warehouse (with SAP Business Warehouse (BW) R3, SAP Business Object (BO), BMC Software: CONTRO -M, Korn Shell Scripting over UNIX Solaris, Oracle Database) in the third largest mobile operator in the country. I also have one year of experience as a pre-sales engineer for the only Alcatel Lucent Enterprise business partner in Venezuela.

As you will know Venezuela, currently for a quite complex situation so it is worth bearing in mind that I do not have great savings and one of my barriers could be the language (although according to several evaluations I have a B1 / B2 in English). In this sense i would like to know if is there any chance i will get any work that allows me to work remotely from Venezuela in Ireland? 

PD: I do not have any problem if for that I have to get start working for a fixed term or in the short term or like internship or like junior level or even for free or  whatever it takes to enter on the Ireland labor market. I just don't want to loose my little experience as a datawarehouse's administrator, get international working experience in Ireland, improve my English skills and in the long maybe go there.

I am hoping to find a program in London, or in the UK to make it easier to move to London when I finish my degree.

I have been through the whole list of universities from Fulbright and The Russel Group, but either the websites have very little information or there are no programs with what I'm looking for. Right now some possibilities on my list are:

* King's College London
* Goldsmith's
* Queen Mary - University of London
* Northumbria
* Manchester University
* Lancaster University

I still want to move to the UK, but am struggling to find a university with a solid program that includes an internship and is well connected to music. Would you please let me know if you have any suggestions?"

I got a professional resume and cover letter writer who wrote an amazing package for me, and cast a wide net. I've applied for over 200 jobs, got about 15 responses, but have been ultimately unsuccessful.

I don't know what to do. I finished my bachelor's in interdisciplinary studies (marketing, comm, digital storytelling) in 2018, took a year, and am finishing up my master's degree in media entrepreneurship this September from a university in England. I want to start my own business, but I'm looking for a job to pay my bills and make connections in relevant industries while I work on my own things. I applied for marketing positions, it's where I have most of my experience, in every industry from tech and entertainment to cosmetics and real estate. I worked for my school's marketing department in my senior year, as well as with a business consulting company concurrently with that internship. once I graduated I froze, was too anxious to apply to anything in my field, and ended up working in early education, while also freelancing for a small business, to save for grad school. I worked a student job and then lost it during the pandemic and haven't worked since, that was over a year ago.   


I think my spotty experience and time passed since my last formal marketing position (not freelance, but hourly - 3 years) makes me an undesirable candidate. I have skills and education, but it seems like no one wants me. the longer I go with nothing, the more undesirable I become and the more explaining I have to do. I'm in my 20s and I'm going to lose momentum and rust if I don't figure out something. Im applying for jobs at the bottom of the entry-level, as marketing assistants and coordinators, and still get denied.  


What do I do? should I take a step back and be an intern? I could get a job in early ed, but it would be as a sub and basically a dead-end move. Im so mad at myself bc so much money was spent on my education, and I'm doing nothing with it."

At the time I was just a naive teen looking for money. Now that I know the true horrors of this realm I wish I hadn’t found this place.

The job itself was with this medical firm connected to the main city hospital and the coroner's office. They said that they wanted me to do some secretarial things like organizing filing cabinets and taking calls. It seemed too insignificant a job for $20 an hour but I was ecstatic to have found it so I thought nothing about the fishy undertones. 

I walked into the building on that fine first day and as if it was Cinderella’s carriage turning into a pumpkin I saw a foreshadowing glimpse of what really lurked within. The gleaming windows and cream colored exterior topped with a cute mural seemed like such a facade. Looking back on it all I remember the inside was ratty. Peeling paint and flimsy folding tables made for the sight called the front desk. “This was it? Well it was an internship paying 20 dollars an hour so how bad could it be?” I thought to myself. Looking back now I know that all I could see was promises of money luring me into a false sense of hope.

“You're the new intern, -___deleted___- right?” said one of the front desk ladies. “Yeah that’s me.” I replied, hesitation brimming in my tone. “Nice to meetcha! I’m Carol. The boss would like to meet you so he can get you acquainted with things. He does that for all the new hires and interns. Company protocol I guess.” She was a short lady with a kind attitude. Maybe through her I would find someone to connect with around here. “The boss's office is downstairs. Take the elevator to the floor below and you can’t miss it.” She instructed. “Alrighty then. Well I can’t wait to start working here.” 

The elevator was on the far side of the room and only one button lay on the wall next to it. Strange since most elevators had two. One for going up and one for going down. This button only had a down arrow. I shrugged it off. Pressing the button the elevator doors opened and I stepped in. Without prompting the doors shut and it began it’s way downstairs. It was funny considering I hadn’t pressed anything but I let it slide. 

The doors opened and I stepped out into a hall lined either side by white doors. At the very end was a wood door with a plaque next to it. “Private office of Hesi Levid, company boss” “Huh strange name.” I muttered quietly. I knocked on the door. “ It's open.” A deep raspy voice called out from behind the door, but at the sound of a cough changed to something more normal. “I mean it’s open” the voice hastily repeated the statement with it’s more normal tone and I frowned hoping the previous sound wasn’t my ears going haywire. 

Cautiously I opened the door and stepped into a white walled office.  A strange man with a tall and unsettling figure looked up from between piles of Manila folders on his desk and spoke. “Who are you?”  He asked “Oh I-I’m -___deleted___-, your new intern.” 

“Oh well hello. I’d been expecting you.” He stood up and walked over to a box on a stool on the other side of the room. “You probably read the plaque outside the door but I’m Hesi Levid, although you can just call me Mr Levid. Your assignment is to file these death records alphabetically. Down the hall is a door labeled filing room. The cabinets in the room should be in alphabetical order and the rest should be self explanatory. Hopefully you're up for it all. Many other interns thought the workload was too hellish and quit so I’m glad to have new hands on the job.” “Filing was too hellish? Come on, how hard was it.” I thought.

As I stepped Into the hallway right before closing the door that deep raspy voice echoed out again. “Don’t open the files! You’ll be scarred for life!” The words boomed in the space around me. I turned back, staring at Mr Levid. “Did you say something sir.” He looked up again from the piles of Manila folders around himself and spoke with that same normal voice. “Huh? Oh no I didn’t say anything. Anyway you better get started, I don't want to pay you for just standing there.” 

Box in hand I began my treck over to the room. And like Mr Levid had explained, there were indeed a lot of cabinets. I put Manila folder after Manila folder into the drawers and the box seemingly never emptied. How could this be? It’s not like the files hopped out of the cabinets into my box to just be put back. “Huh maybe I’m just too slow.” I thought. So I went faster grabbing files and cabinet handles and smearing everything in my blood. 

Wait, blood?! I stared dumbfounded at my hands. Holy shit I was bleeding! It seemed that the rough Manila folders had left ragged paper cuts across my palms and fingers. “I was clumsy. Awfully clumsy,” I told myself. That had to be it. Most of the cuts weren’t too deep except for one or two that bled like hell so I kept going. I wanted the pay badly, so I would do just about anything for it. Besides, I'd get some bandaids when I was done. I grew weary. Each folder seemingly the last one before another appeared. Something was up. I decided to take an early break and head to Mr Levids office. 

I knocked on his door. “Come in.” He said. His tone was like a calm sea before the storm. I opened the door and stepped in “Mr Levid, are you sure you gave me just a box full of folders? It seems to be much more than one box.” “ Yes, now go back to work.” His tone was easygoing but a tad bit unnerved. It was as if he had been agitated by that question a million times before. 

Since I had the time I decided to ask. “Not to bother you again sir but you don’t have any band aids do you?” “No.” It was a snippy one word answer. Mr Levid barely even looked up from his papers to say it. I looked around nervously, feeling shaken by his sharp response. I paused hesitating to ask again but I eventually asked. “Mr Levid uh when does my shift end? It’s been a while since I got here.” He looked up from his papers and walked over to the door. “Listen here you. Questioning. Piece. Of. Shit. Your shift ends when I say it does! Now back to work or I won’t pay you anything!” As his tone rose in agitation that deep demonic raspy voice crept out again and I stepped back cowering in fear. 

He slammed the door in my face and right then I knew this job was hell and I knew he was the source of that voice. I stared at the plaque by the door and suddenly before my eyes the words shimmed and the letters of his name swapped about. Hesi became the words he is and Levid became the word devil. The spot on the plaque declaring his job title became the words this is your hell. A cold fear gripped my body and I ran back to the filing room. It confirmed everything.

When I signed up for the job I had no idea the company I would work for was associated with the coroner's office and the town hospital. It was a last minute discovery when I googled the building before I arrived for the job. I thought nothing of it until I remembered there was a string of murders on the news linked to this address. Each person was found dead in the basement right where I was with cuts on their hands that had made them bleed to death. Each body lay next to a box with file folders covered in bloody prints. At that moment I knew that if these files were death records from the coroner's office like my boss had said then there should be records about what happened to those people. What happened to those people seemed like what would happen to me if I didn't do something. 

Tentatively I grabbed a file and opened it, but what I found in that moment was way worse than anything I could have imagined. In the upper corner was a name and a cause of death and below that was a line labeled Number of years working before death. The top of the paper had not the name of the coronary office but instead the name of the company I interned with. I grabbed another file and opened it. It was much the same but with a different name. I grabbed another and still it was identical. The unifying factor was that every death was caused by paper cuts.

I bolted, realizing I was the next soul to die if I didn't get out in time. I ran to the elevator but nothing was there. The white doors lining each side of the hall kept going. I opened one hoping for an exit, but alas I ended up back in that hellish room with the unending cabinets full of folders. Each door was much the same as if the sole elevator exit had disappeared. At that moment I realized that I had gotten a job that transported me to hell where I would die at the hands of a demon called my boss who wanted me to file his records of every soul he took. I turned around and my boss stood behind me. In that horrid demonic voice I heard the words that haunt me to this day boom out from his lips “There's no use running kid.” He shoved the box of files back into my paper cut covered, bloodied hands. “Just keep filing!”

There is no $20 per hour and there is no leaving. I'm in my 30’s now and as my hands grow bloody and my life becomes sucked away my only hope is to ask you guys for help so I don't die."

It used to be a fun hobby that I loved in high school, but now it feels like a chore that I must do in order to get an internship and ultimately, a full time job. In addition, being an international student makes it even harder because not getting a job at a good company means reduced chance of immigrating to the US. It's time to apply for internships, but I don't even have projects to show because I didn't do anything this summer.    

Have you guys ever gone through this phase? What can I do to come out of it and rediscover my passion for coding?"

What do I do to get my life back?",KansasKhan,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/oyvra0/formerly_highachieving_student_now_underemployed/,"Background: have consistently done well in tests of general mental aptitude (for example, recently got perfect GRE score). However, have long struggled with ADHD and major depressive disorder, which worsened substantially while at college (Dartmouth). Had mediocre grades and lack of professional experience; I spent summers at home helping my single mom run a paper route rather than doing internships. I failed to get a job related to Econ degree. Went back to school, TA'd a bit in the machine shop, ""learned to code"" at a pretty well-regarded bootcamp (which I scraped through, coding is one area I don't feel naturally very gifted), got a remote job at a crappy startup. Startup quickly folded and CEO scampered off, RIP references. At this point, I felt just done. Spent years back at home, half-heartedly firing apps into the void, working as a package handler at FedEx, and irregular online tutoring jobs. Get in an argument over politics around Jan 6, get told to leave. Move in with old college friend and work as a package handler somewhere a thousand miles away. College friend gets married and moves out. 

Currently six years out of college, feel very stuck. My resume is a big fat load of low-skill manual labor. I can put the perfect GRE and the Ivy degree from 5+ years ago on there and say ""see, I'm actually smart!"" but frankly I get the sense they look at that and think, ""wow, something is seriously wrong with this guy."" And they wouldn't be totally wrong. Personality wise my neuroticism is high and my conscientiousness is low, which is not a recipe for career success. I have a couple thousand dollars, a long term AirBnB rental that expires at the end of August, and an old car to my name. 

My best ""plans"" are getting a master's degree in computer science in Ireland (cheaper, shorter master's programs) so more web developer jobs will actually take me seriously, or teaching English in South Korea/Kazakhstan while pursuing by semi-successful but unmonetized blogging hobby and attempting to write a sci-fi novel I've been thinking about. You may have noticed these plans are completely different from each other and the only commonality is they involve leaving the country. That's because I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing, all I know is I have very few attachments here in the US and feel done with the place. Did I mention I've never left the country before?

Both of these plans will mean I have at minimum until the end of the year with no clue where I'm going to be living or what I'm going to be doing. I think I may have to give up/transfer the package handler position and move back to the general vicinity of home for a bit at the end of the month.

What do? Get back into applying for web dev jobs even though I doubt I'll find anything in the next few months? Pursue the master's degree? Try yet another totally different thing? Join a cult, commune, or left-wing militant organization? Fuck it, I'm broke, aimless, and up for whatever. Give me your best pitch."
oyw0jx,4,2021-08-05,21M Want to find the optimal route to getting a Masters in Biotechnology.,Bart_Dudley,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/oyw0jx/21m_want_to_find_the_optimal_route_to_getting_a/,"21M, I am currently going through a program through my employer and a less than worth mentioning college that is entirely paid for by said employer...The problem is that I make almost nothing working for this employer, and the work itself is in an extremely abusive environment that has nothing to do with the college tuition reimbursement. I am currently enrolled into a Computer Science program and I have 51 credits with me coming up on 60 relatively soon, but I am going straight for my bachelors without an associates which will require the full 120.  


Here's where it's interesting and why I'm turning here of all places, I have no idea with my life experience or who I am how to get to that point actually. I was raised indoors and never allowed to leave which lead to me needing to become an autodidact (self taught) in order to even get into a sub-par college in the first place with a GED. My family is poor and unhelpful, I live by myself currently, and I wouldn't say that I'm stupid at all, everyone tells me that I'm one of the smartest people they know, although considering my current workplace and how little I actually do know, I would call myself average and ignorant if anything else. Let's humor them and believe that I am smart enough to take any degree or whatever for the sake of my goal.  


I don't think Computer Science is going to be right for me, priming myself for a degree that lines me for something like web development is horrible in my opinion and I think that it generally will not even lead to me getting a good foot on what I really want to do, albeit this is the only degree that my employer will pay for. I was considering taking my credits after I finish up at around 60 and transferring to a community college across the street from me to get an associates in mechatronics soon before going for an alternative job at a car manufacturer that might also potentially pay for going for a bachelor's in engineering, but I have no idea how realistic this goal is at all.   


I want to find whatever path will get me a decent job, even if it requires taking a concentrated coding certificate course or a backwoods internship that involves floating my bills directly, I want to find a way that I can take without going homeless or ending up in debt behind wanting to better my future like most. I am also assuming that really any STEM degree can lead into biotechnology at an advanced level, and I don't want to go right for a biology degree due to hearing that they are generally worthless unless it's a masters.   


If there's anything wrong with my framing or ideas, or how I'm approaching this or anything that I can do, I am more than happy to hear any form of feedback in the slightest."

Mostly C/C++, some C# and a tad of Python. the developer jobs closest to where I live do not mention C/C++. Some are for C# but most are for java, Javascript and python (in that order) and most internships are for java. I had tried to give up C++ before for C# and learned a lot of C# syntax and nuances but ended up going back to C++ because I first wanted to ingrain the C++ knowledge more and I also liked it more than C#. But now it is seriously looking like I have to learn Java and/or Javascript if I want to get a good chance at getting employed sooner. 

In all honesty I think I would have needed 3-4 months at minimum of doing only  projects  just to make much of the basics of C++ feel second nature to me, but not only do I not have any stimulating ideas for projects, I now feel pressure to learn different languages before I really feel as comfortable with C++ as I would have liked to.

But again, I do not want to forget the C++ I have worked so hard to learn so far. What is the best happy medium of learning another language and not forgetting another that was not learned enough? Or should i stick it out with C++ and not move around until I have the basics of C++ more ingrained?

oyx5kk,1,2021-08-05,Just Looking for some Job Advice,125098124,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oyx5kk/just_looking_for_some_job_advice/,"Hello again folks,

After having had a whole summer to sit around and mope and feel depressed, I have at least come up with a list of sorts of things that I might still be able to do for work. But I have no idea how to proceed really. So seriously, any and all advice is welcome.

My situation: 21(M), fairly prestigious university with a useless major (History) and just a mediocre GPA, some work experience teaching and running an English language education program at a private school abroad, limited fast food experience, unable to get an internship (which was what really started the alarm bells for me). Family running out of money, father has cancer, plans to retire as soon as I graduate. Fairly low student debt, after dealing with most of the debt I'll have about 1.5k to my name. I have some ""connections"" but they're in career fields that require specialized degrees. Fairly weak physically but working on it, high walking endurance at least. Proven dependability from my job in fast food. Living in the Boston area, hoping for approx. 30k/yr so I can at least afford to live in a crappy apartment with a million roommates and walk/public transit everywhere. Not enough money or connections to really move anywhere else for now. Horrible at math, but working on it (taking a few classes on my own, reading a few books). And probably absolutely fuckin' depressed. Originally wanted to get a masters in Education and become a teacher, but . . . the money.

Job/Path ideas:

1.  Apply to masters programs and become a teacher anyway. Pros: even with the extreme burnout and depression I'm still mildly interested. I have relevant work experience in a way. Cons: No money to do this. Completely oversaturated job market. Difficult to justify pulling ruinous student loans if I can't make this work (see: oversaturated job market).
2. Apply to a master's in some other more useful field. Pros: An actual useful degree. Cons: Might be hard to get in with a useless degree and very limited relevant coursework. Money again.
3. Try to get into law school. Pros: Useful JD. Cons: I tried damn hard and my GPA is only average, even if I got into an actually decent law school could I actually keep up? No money. Conflicting reports that this job market is also fucked anyway.
4. Try to get certs and take some classes to learn how to code. Pros: Useful skill. Somewhat cheaper than school. Cons: A ton of Boston area companies now require the computer science degree anyway. 
5. Just become a landscaping laborer. Pros: after careful thought, surprisingly safe from automation. Upper range of pay can enter the 20/hr range which is nice for my situation. Maybe even Sundays off. No drug history so I guess I beat 50% of applicants already. Saturday work can get time and a half which is more money anyway. Get paid to work out. Learn some skills and experience on the job that might translate to other blue collar work. Cons: Seasonal. I have zero experience besides mowing some lawns. Already applied to a few and never got called back, so I guess I'm just not that attractive. Probably because I'm not exceptionally fit.
6. Construction laborer. Pros: definitely hiring in my area. Laborers union can give me excellent wages. No drug history. Cons: No experience at all. Not exceptionally fit. Laborers union in my area according to a friend basically requires you to know a person in it to get in.
7. Trades. Pros: aging workforce offers a decent chance of good work in the future. Decent pay at journeyman level. Get paid to learn as an apprentice. Cons: For some odd reason, the trade schools in my area are still ridiculously selective. No experience at all. Not exceptionally fit. And for some damn reason, they still want you to pay hundreds for a textbook in my area. I guess we're copying college now.
8. Just convert my current part time fast food job into full time. Pros: I work hard so my manager's already told me that he'll give me as many hours as I want. Take leftover food. Cons: If I have to do this for more than two years I'd literally rather kill myself.
9. UPS Store (got an interview coming up next week). Pros: slightly higher pay. If I work well enough they'll pay me to take classes to get some random certs that bump my pay a bit higher from there. Slightly more ""professional"". Cons: horrible workplace stories (but I work fast food so that's honestly a pro). Unlike warehousing, there's not much room to move up from here.
10. UPS Warehouse (just got a PT job offer at a locale far away). Pros: A possibly heavily inflated and made-up pay potential of 24/hr. Slightly better chance of moving up the chain. Cons: Probably going to get automated really soon. Horrible workplace according to many other folks that work there. No public transit at this location so I'll need to own a car and drive it a pretty long way, negating the potential earnings.
11. Car sales. Pros: A ""professional"" job of sorts. Good earning potential. I'm fairly good with people. Cons: I have no experience and my degree is only relatable if I stretch it a bit. I don't know cars super well. Commission structure leaves me no room for failure or learning (but its not like I have much to offer, so that's kind of a given at this point)
12. Nautical academy. Pros: Two years and get a job on a cargo ship? Cargo ship captains make hella money. Don't worry too much about utilities on the rent since I won't be living in wherever I rent for pretty much most of the year. Travel I guess. Cons: No experience. Not even sure how to get a job in this industry. And I really do prefer being able to go home at least once a week.
13. Just go back to teaching English abroad. Pros: Hella qualified and experienced, and my connections are actually useful. Pay is good enough to live abroad and they will likely pay for the plane ticket over given my existing experience. Cons: After two years you kind of become poisonous to any other job, so I guess I'll be banishing myself to exile forever. Which sucks.
14. Office clerical work. Pros: A ""professional"" job I guess. Cons: Literally every other grad with a useless degree like me is trying to get one of these, and with no experience, I don't know if I can compete with all those other folks who have internships and such.
15. Police. Pros: One of the best blue collar jobs. I took the practice test on a whim and aced it, so I guess I'm qualified in that area. And honestly, I'm kind of interested in it. Cons: Waiting list for Boston Police is rumored to be years and years long. I'm not physically fit (yes, working on it). The test is only administered every 2 years or so. (I like this as a long-term option, but pretty much all factors involved indicate that I need a short term option in the meantime)
16. MBTA. Pros: An honest job driving subway trains, I should be qualified by virtue of being able to drive. Apparently the union is stupid powerful so they apparently have guys pulling 300k through ""overtime"". Trains are pretty cool I guess. Cons: The hiring process is kind of random, and the entire city's population applies for these jobs as soon as they open up. Apparently they haven't held another round of mass hiring since 2009 so it might be a bit tricky to break in.

Other semi-related things I've applied for to no avail that I'd be down to do or endure: Bank Teller, Mover, Electrician/Plumber helper, every single damn internship I've applied to. Proofreader, Tutor (online services, maybe if I find some other way of getting the word out?), Personal Assistant (having run an entire department in a school abroad I thought I had the management skills to handle this one), Self-Storage office clerk person (I don't know what the official title is, really).

Let me know if there's any additional information that might affect my evaluations on these jobs, or any advice on how to break into any of these fields. As you can tell by now, I'm really desperate. And depressed of course, but I guess having a stable job would fix that maybe. Or maybe this depression is also caused by my inability to find a girlfriend, which in case, many of the jobs on this list would just make it worse. But that's not this subreddit's problem I guess.

Advice on other jobs that I'd be qualified for with a good shot to get are also welcome. Especially advice from the Boston area or another urban area. That's pretty great.

Thanks for enduring my rant, looking forward to the responses!"

However, as an intern, it is important that I keep gaining professional experience in web technologies like react, node/express and other database technology. I realize the owner will be more accepting once a client asks us for a more complex web app, but is there any way I could just persuade him for us to use simple react? This is our business site (One Eleven Web Design): [https://oneelevenwebdesign.com/](https://oneelevenwebdesign.com/) . He did say he'd be down for me to code mobile apps in react native if ever given the chance. However, I'm even amazed myself that he doesn't know JavaScript at all, but is at least familiar with HTML/CSS. He has so far liked my coding solutions to rendering different text on the page based on selected pictures. For anyone wondering about the business saving cost, my school pays for my wages not him. I just eat up a lot of the snacks lol."

So I finished the project really early, and contributed many features to the system but I was not proactive in finding more problems to solve, and they were looking for people that can do that. Mentors didn’t really mention that, and kept saying that I was doing an excellent job. So make sure if you have internship, ask your manager to tell you clearly what you need to do in order to get a return offer. Sometimes, only finishing a project is definitely not enough.

Update:
Having said that, I still think it’s a great company to work for (free lunch, high pay, smart colleagues, lots of responsibility, interesting problems to solve, decent wlb). Got to push code to production from the second week. It’s just that they’re still figuring things out with management."

Data Sciences.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I am a student in VIT, Vellore, currently pursuing my [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) Degree in CSE. Since the lockdown, I have been under pressure from mostly terribly teaching and uncaring professors. I tried to focus as much as possible to study and gain knowledge in a wide arity of topics related to my courses. The lockdown made it virtually impossible to look for an Internship in my 2nd Year. I was depressed and my grades suffered for a sem (not in all courses though...).

I have managed to pull myself together and started doing my best to improve my grades and compensate for any previous lack thereof. Then I was infected with COVID and then again some professors refused to take my assignments because I didn't upload them in time (Even after explaining my situation).

So here I am, my academics have taken a significant hit. I had to take a course again for grade improvement and am wondering how to fix everything.

Btw, I consider myself a sincere student and almost never cheated. I got an 8.6 GPA and 7.4 GPA in my 1st and 2nd Semesters followed by around 6 in my 3rd and 4rth Semester

I need advice on how to get my academics on track and compensate for my poor performance previously.

Will this leave a mark on my resume? if so what do I do to make sure it doesn't affect it too much?"

This is my 1st job in DS, but I joined straight out of completing a PhD. The position is quite junior, but I feel that I have taken a much more impactful role in the team, having already deployed ML models in production and taken on a semi-mentourship role for our intern.

My probationary period was at three months, so I dont know what would be the next best time to raise the subject. 

The project that I am working on atm is somewhat of a flagship project for our company, with both CEOs being heavily involved, and the pilot for it is due to end at the end of next month.

I feel that if I were to apply for a new job, I could expect a ~30% pay raise, so I feel like this is the baseline for what I am hoping for, which sounds like quite a large jump for the company.

How should I best approach this? Should I try and secure offers from other companies to gain leverage? I dont want to be considered a flight risk, and I would not feel comfortable leaving in the middle of this pilot project as I feel they would struggle if I left at this stage. I like the company and the culture, but feel that I am under selling myself with this wage. 

Does anyone have any good advice / resources on how to negotiate a pay rise, or any simalar experience that they can share with me?

Thanks!"

I am a French student in computer science, artificial intelligence and specialised in image processing. I'm doing my end-of-studies internship in Germany, where I speak English (fluently), and I'm slowly learning German on my own. In 2 months, I will have finished my studies, and will have a French engineering diploma (equivalent to a MSc) and a Master of science in pattern analysis (image processing). 

I'm looking at job offers in Germany, Austria and Northern Italy, but I mainly find offers in big cities (Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg,...) and I'm not sure I will enjoy this type of living environment.

I love mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, and generally every sport you can do in the mountains. 

Do you think I should really be picky about the location of job offers, since it would be my first job? Or should I wait for a few years before really choosing the perfect place to work, by building experience in big cities?

If that's a trigger for you, read no further. This is a throwaway account and I'll be using fake names throughout. If this isn't appropriate for this sub, please let me know a better place for it because I'd really like some opinions on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Whew, here goes....

&amp;#x200B;

So, some background information - my best friend since pre-school, Dan, got engaged last year and has been planning to have a small, intimate bachelor/bachelorette party so that everyone can feel comfortable with COVID. We no longer live in the same state, so I'm really looking forward to going back, seeing old friends, and meeting his fiancee's friends. Here's where things get sticky, and I need to rewind 4-5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in college, me and Dan had a mutual friend, Jenna. There was one semester where Jenna and I got to fooling around a little bit at parties. I always felt really weird about this whenever it happened because I had had some not-so-great romantic experiences during an internship earlier that year and didn't really want to get that sort of thing all tangled up in my friend group at school. But I was also a young, drunk, horny male and a pretty girl was coming on to me so it's not like I put up much of a fight. I just say that to make it clear that she was always the one to initiate; never me. I did eventually put an end to it after a few months when she tried to start something while I was sober enough to think with my head and not my dick. I'm not perfect, though, and I know I hurt her feelings by doing this. I figured that was better than letting it progress further.

&amp;#x200B;

That only lasted a month or two, though, because eventually I found myself waking up in Jenna's bed after a party; clearly having slept together. I felt really awkward about this, and a little bit taken advantage of, assuming that she had initiated this again after I had told her weeks ago I wanted to stop. I didn't say anything, though, and we never talked about it. I graduated not long after and left the state for a job. Jenna and I haven't spoken since.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward back to present day. Jenna is coming to this bachelor(ette) party, and I've been expecting it to be pretty awkward, but I've been planning to just sit through it for Dan's sake and focus on my other friendships there. However, a few days ago Jenna talked to Dan and told him that I raped her at this party. The details given were that she remembers going to bed alone and waking up together. I'm not disputing that that was her experience, and I feel horrible that I was a part of that, and especially that I didn't know she was feeling that way. If I hadn't been too cowardly to talk to her afterwards, we probably wouldn't be in this situation, but here we are. I don't know what exactly happened that night, either. The last thing I remember is drinking on her couch after a night out. I'd talk to her, but Dan asked me not to, saying she isn't ready to hear from me.

&amp;#x200B;

After telling me this, Dan said that he doesn't think it would be a good idea for me to come to the party, and he's having second thoughts about inviting me to the wedding. I'm really hurt by this, because I don't think I did anything wrong - aside from being a coward. Still, though, we're talking about the wedding of my best friend of 25 years and I think I should be there. If Jenna and I really can't be in the same room (which is understandable), I do think that I should be the one who gets to go to the party, since I live out of state and don't get to see my old friends that often. She gets to see them whenever she wants, and I don't think it's fair for me to be boxed out.

&amp;#x200B;

During our first conversation, I was too shocked by this to know what to say. We're going to talk again soon, and here's what I want to do - tell Dan all of this, say he's not being reasonable and of course I want to attempt to patch things up before the wedding and am willing to put in work to do that, but if that's not possible before the bachelor party, I still want an invite. It's not fair to just push all of the blame on me when there are so many unknowns to all of this. I also want to tell him that if he doesn't want me to be a part of his wedding, he can't expect to be a part of mine. I feel like a complete asshole for standing up to a rape accusation like this, because I really strive to be an ally for women who are victims of assault like this, but this friendship is too valuable to me to just back down without a fight. How can I handle this responsibly?"
oz9wlb,1,2021-08-06,Mechanical Engineering to CyberSec,Matt_Shatt,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/oz9wlb/mechanical_engineering_to_cybersec/,"Back in HS (2000-2005 ish) I went through a major computer phase where I was all into Linux and creating websites, etc. I did IT tech support in HS and all so naturally I went into Computer Engineering in College but after spending a summer doing campus IT help desk and doing similar for a Fortune 500 as an internship, I decided I didn't want to fix printers for my career (ignorant) and switched to Mechanical Engineering. I graduated ME and have been in the ME industry for 10 years.

I'm interested once again in getting back into computers as well as pentesting (electronic and physical - I like to pick locks and mess with physical bypasses). Not only because I still find it interesting but I want the job stability and potential (depending on position) flexibility. I was planning to work on my A+ (to get up to date on the most recent stuff), followed by Sec+, Net+, and Pentesting+ and ultimately my CCISP maybe. Still trying to work out if my mindset is more suited for Red Team, Blue Team, or none of the above. What recommendations does anyone have regarding my plan of attack and/or other ways I can learn and get into the industry?

Part 2 is, regardless am I likely to need to start out at an IT help desk? I'm not above that work at all but I know it'll be hard for my family if I go from a 6-figure salary to a help desk salary while I work up in the industry. Just another wrinkle I'll need to consider."

Please help.",imsomewhatsane,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ozcl2u/i_want_to_get_the_vaccine_for_covid_but_i_am_too/,"When Covid hit in 2020, I was newly pregnant. I did everything to protect myself and isolated for my entire pregnancy and months afterwards. I still isolate myself and my child, aside from going to college (very seldom) and internship 1 day/week. If it wasn’t for my baby, I’d probably be vaccinated. But instead, I fear it will kill me. I know this isn’t rational, and the chances of this happening are slim (I’ve never had a bad reaction to a vaccine), but I still live in fear. I also feel guilt that I’ll be protected and my baby won’t. So I still have to isolate either way to protect my child. Then, I’m also afraid of covid, too. I’m paralyzed with fear of my child getting it, and I have lost many friends and cut off family who don’t take the virus seriously. I don’t understand why I just haven’t gotten the damn vaccine. I’m not anti-vaxx. I’m so for it, but hesitant to make the appointment. Can someone give me the push I need? If you have anything negative to say or make this about politics, please just see yourself out. I am here for encouragement/advice on how to overcome my irrational fear and take the plunge."
ozczmr,2,2021-08-06,Looking for advice,_bad-bitch_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ozczmr/looking_for_advice/,"Hello,

I recently got an SWE internship offer in the fall for a small start up company (1-5 people). It's unpaid and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. Part of the reasons is I'll be working 20 hours per week during the fall quarter while having 2 other jobs (part-time) and that I'm not sure how much I'll get to learn from such a small team with only one senior developer.  

I know unpaid position is bad but I'm quite desperate for some experience before I graduate. 

I'm a Stats major with a minor in CS. I only have a previous internship as a data science intern but I didn't really get to do any data science related stuff so I don't think it's much help in my resume.

TLDR; Should I take an unpaid internship while still in school and working 2 part-time jobs (20-30 hours a week total) just to get my foot through the door? 

Thanks for reading!"

I’m a girl in Computer Engineering and I really like what I do and have always felt intelligent and like I belonged, I never really struggled with accepting praise because I tend to know my worth. 
But this internship, firstly it’s fully online so it’s difficult, and secondly I’m not sure I’m doing much. I keep asking questions bc I get confused easily, I feel like what took me six weeks to do could have been done by another employee in a matter of hours, but yet my mentor and manager keep praising me, and while I say thank you I genuinely don’t feel like I deserve it. The thing is, most of the time I do feel like I deserve the value I receive, but I’m also good at knowing when I feel like I’m not doing enough and I think with this internship I really really didn’t. I’m
Not thinking this bc I have imposter syndrome, I just genuinely didn’t do much but they keep praising me and this week my mentor gave me a $250 gift card for the code I wrote which was LITERALLY 15 lines that took me forever to understand how to write, and I lowkey copied it from a different file I found that had similar lines of code. I also ask so many questions and feel like im being really annoying but now they’re talking about extending my internship ?
Normally I’d just pat myself on the back and be proud of myself like I usually am but I TOOK SIX WEEKS TO WRITE 15 FUCKING LINES OF CODE (and like four of those
Lines are just opening and closing brackets let’s be real) ! I can’t help but ask myself if they are just babying me, if people just genuinely do nothing, etc bc I very genuinely feel like I did so little and their praise is driving me insane (even though I appreciate it) because I feel so so fucking confused by it. I lowkey just want to yell “tf did I DO ?” 

Anyway I was wondering if other ppl had similar experiences because I SWEAR I’m not doing anything worth praising. I’m very good at recognizing when I deserve to be praised and am normally really happy to receive praise so I don’t think I’m coming from a place of insecurity or imposter syndrome. I just genuinely have no clue what I did to deserve praise, an extended internship, and an extra $250 giftcard for doing nothing other than annoying people with my questions and writing code thats half based on someone else’s code I lowkey copied from another file I found."

I will be starting on my fourth year of university on August 30th, and I was really wondering what to do to prepare myself for the future, so I'm trying to see what anyone wiser would suggest to do for now.

A bit about me: I've never been super interested in Computer Science in all honesty, but I stayed because I didn't think I was more interested in anything else either. I currently work as an intern until August 30th at an AI company, but it's unpaid and I don't do too much aside from just labeling pictures for them. I do plan to stay and still work for them until my internship is over just because I do want it on my resume. I should mention that my school only teaches C++, along with a bit of hardware and Python. I wouldn't say I'm really great at coding, and mainly just have some basics down at this point. I passed my Data Structures class with an A, but honestly I'm still pretty confused about data structures.

I had a second job(min wage/not cs related) as well, but I did roughly earn enough money to last me for next semester so I decided it would be good to leave and use the rest of my summer for something else more productive. I do own Cracking the Coding Interview, and plan to sign up for LeetCode, but I'm honestly not sure how much of each to do. I find Cracking the Coding Interview really difficult, not only because I don't have a god understanding of Data Structures, but also because it's purely in Java for the most part. I also don't have any real ""experiences"" with CS careers aside from my current internship.

I'm about to graduate next summer, and I do need to get a job by then as well, and I haven't really put out any applications as of late. I am thinking about looking for stuff on HandShake though, although I'm not too prepared for interviews.

So what would you recommend me to do for now? I have roughly three weeks remaining, and I'm pretty free for the most part during this time(My internship isn't too hardcore so I have plenty of free time). I want to set myself up to find a job after graduation, and I'm going to be pretty busy again once school starts. What would you advise for me to do until school starts? Like should I be doing either CTCI or leetcode? if so, how much of either?

Thanks for reading and any advice in advance"

Not gonna mention awards due to being able to find my full name, but I've won a few international's physics awards, community awards, won $25,000 scholarship, and awards back in my home country.

I just feel immense pressure from my community and parents to get into a prestigious university. I didn't do any of these things to get into university, and tbh when I first started doing them I didn't even know about colleges apps. I truly wanted a way to experience things, give back to my community, and work to help support my mom. Due to my parents status in the US they get any healthcare my dad had really bad diabetes and I started working at a hospital ignorer to provide him medication and care. Lots of people at prep schools in LA who pay $60k tuition who I have recently been doing summer programs with genuinely make me insecure about my ability to get into university. I don't have a college counselor or legacy, my parents can't even read over my app and I dont have a perfect GPA either. I want a realistic idea of what my chances are into some of my top schools

Sorry if this was annoying or I overshared, just having a mental breakdown atm about this

BEST OF LUCK, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO AMAZING WITH YOUR APPS &lt;&lt;3333 plsss let me know if I can help with anything don't hesitate to message me :)"

Please Read!,steve__81,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ozigh2/guys_helpone_week_to_decide_between_two_programs/,"My goal is to work in the field I cyber security… I know there are many different specialties and areas within the field. I am in a state of paralysis at the moment in regards to making a decision. Both programs are 3 years long, at the same college and both programs offer paid internships. I can’t mix and match courses, meaning you only study the courses that come with your program of choice. The ITNetworking program is all security related third year. Some people say go the networking route and others say the CompSci route. I am so stressed in deciding. At this point I might just flip a damn coin!! Please guys tell me what you think. I can even link the program websites."
ozjce7,2,2021-08-06,Feeling discouraged about internship search,StandardMediocre4748,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ozjce7/feeling_discouraged_about_internship_search/,"I started applying to internships pretty early on, and so far I've applied to about \~80 companies and have completed around 70 LC questions. I see that many companies have been sending out final interviews or hirevues after online assessments, but I have yet to hear back after any of my OAs. :( It's been &gt; 1 week since having completed my online assessments for Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Cisco, and etc. I see that people have already begun received phone interviews for Microsoft SWE and Explore, but I have not heard anything despite applying quite early on with a referral.

Of course, I know I just have to keep looking forward, continue doing Leetcode, and keep applying, but I am feeling a tad bit disheartened already.

To anyone reading this and feeling similar things, we got this! We will power through, and I know the journey often matters just as much as (if not more than) the destination. To others with more experience, would you be able to give any advice for improvement? What are some possible reasons for why I might not be having much success getting interviews or hearing back from most places yet (besides it being early)? For context, I'm a rising sophomore female at a target (top 5 CS) school with 4.0. I've had my resume looked over by multiple people. Could it just be that my coding skills are.. sucky? LOL"
ozju16,6,2021-08-06,What would you do if you are in my situation?,Televa-sion,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ozju16/what_would_you_do_if_you_are_in_my_situation/,"Hi, I just want you to ask your opinion.

Beforehand, apologies for the long text!

I finished my first year of the university in UK with chemE major.(International student)

When I was in high school, I was sure that I am a person to be a researcher and chemical engineering would be perfect major for research as both chemistry and physics are the most familiar fields to me.

After I found out they aren't, and even feel hatred to them, then eventually I could found the field of interest. They are HCI, moreover BrainComputerInterface which are completely different from my major.

However, I am completely sure that I need to major CS at least electronic engineering in US which are extremely competitive for researching such interdisciplinary work as my focus is more on technology and applications, not brain itself.

Pursuing doctoral and phD (in US) also hesitate me to choose not having technical and theoretical basis from bachelor degree(hardly to be accepted as well).

If I am decide to transfer to CS in US, it is apparent to be  a significantly tuff one, which would entirely change my 2nd year uni life(keep GPA higher than 3.9, having internships on software companies, join research, look around references...)

Even though, the UK academic system doesn't have any electives, I should miss so many good unis beforehand due to prerequisite. That causes me to go lower unis even if I am success to transfer.(+takes one more year)However, here is also possibility for failure exists.


If you are in my situation, what would you choose? 

Severe path for dream with possibility of entire spoil or comfortable path for settling?



Please feel free to express any opinion about it."

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student :)

Does anyone know the best way to find an internship for software development in Australia? I have been keeping a keen eye out on LinkedIn, Jora, Seek, Indeed and GradAustralia. However, I probably find 1-2 internships posted per week.

I have tried cold emailing local development companies, however, most (all I have message) do not have a program or time to train up internships. 

I viewed a previous post on this subreddit suggesting to use Forage. However, that is a single day virtual internship, which I can't imagine employeers being intriuged by a one day internship.

So I was hoping to see how anyone else ended up getting their internship? Should I just move on and get a part-time job teaching children coding to get experience (a lot of jobs doing this)."

To me the ""No juniors"" attitude in Europe is really self-defeating because the tech scene here is underdeveloped to say the least, with some exceptions, which is a source of constant hand-wringing by CTOs.

Don't you think that a policy like that affects the entire ecosystem and recruitment pipeline of developers and related positions and is also bad long-term for the industry? If so, have you given thought to what the long-term effects are, or is it really just a matter of meeting quarterly/yearly goals without thinking of the future?

I'm a career switcher coming from 10+ years in an industry where growth was fostered from colleges to apprenticeships to observation hours and trade associations, and even though not every professional ""gave back"" with helping the newbies out, there were enough opportunities out there for entry-level starters after finishing their education... because we all knew that if the industry didn't keep filling the ranks with new recruits, alternatives would be found either through tech solutions or outsourcing.

I get that it's difficult to allocate resources to training, but what would it take to get this more players in tech to take a risk every once in a while on a promising junior candidate?"

* Have limited work experience

Hey guys. During college, I picked up a couple of internships in a career I briefly identified with. I did campaign design and copywriting for a marketing firm. It was fun while it lasted. They kept buttering me up because I was a promising intern who I sensed they were looking to hire. Within that same firm, I interned as a staff writer for their subsidiary company which was an online magazine. I knew writing was something I was good at and felt I could appease my boss while exploring article writing as a career choice. I ended up enjoying the research involved, and ultimately poured a lot of passion into my articles. I felt for sure this is something I could do and not feel like I'm wasting myself. It's worth mentioning in all of the aforementioned experiences, I also performed graphic design because I knew how to use photoshop sufficiently well and everyone pretty much milked me for that.

Internship ended on rocky terms due to poor management and almost the entire team left before the founder gave up too.

A year later I applied for my first paid job at the same company. This time I did social media – which was more or less similar to my first internship as a copywriter. The job was a lot less exciting and unintuitive as my previous experiences. It felt like grunt work and the creative moments were few and far in between. Ended up leaving to focus on my finals and graduate. I'm probably still a prospect there if I choose to re-apply. Right now though, I don't know what's next for me.

**Things about me:**

* As surmised from above, I'm a creative person. When I was younger I picked up video editing and screenwriting. Had hopes of becoming a filmmaker. Part of me still does. I've uploaded a couple of youtube videos, as I occasionally get the kick to create that kind of content. Overall, I like content creation.
* I love gaming on a design level. I have zero experience in programming or game design but I'm fascinated by level design and game mechanics. I often look at people Sam Lake, Neil Druckmann, Hideo Kojima, Dan Houser, and more, who are aren't all just programmers but are also game directors and writers. Part of me wish I had embarked on that path early on so I could have enough footing to chase it as a career choice.
* I'm somewhat anal about ethics. I don't know if I'm generally popular but I consider myself to be a very moral person. I have huge respect for social workers and anyone that contributes to society in a meaningful way. At the same time, I do want to be on path for high-earning jobs. I come from a family of virtually irresponsible people with limited ambition. I dream of breaking that cycle in hopes of living a good life but also elevating my parents' living – for the years they have left.
* I don't enjoy formulaic, standardized, ""9-to-5"" office work. For most people it's inescapable and I shouldn't believe I'm entitled to a permissive and loose job. But I'm just incompatible with that system of work. I'm only able to be an office worker if I like the work (content creation, writing, etc.) If it's relevant or meaningful at all, my personality type is INFP-T aka 'mediator'.
* Part of copywriting is sort of the objective but often positively toned coverage of the subject. I think I'm good at diplomacy and subconsciously exercise it. I'm open to careers that can harness that.

**In conclusion + more info:**

* I like creative work
* Jack of all trades, master of none: I know a lot about a lot, but I'm an expert in little if none. This lends to writing articles, presentation. Despite my anxiety, I was often quite good at presentations because it seemed like I knew, *and was interested in*, what I was talking about.
* I produce music as a hobby, I'm good at writing.
* I did freelance work as an audio transcriber. Hated it.
* I did freelance graphic design and editing for a local business.
* I'm open to freelance work as a career.
* I'm open to pursuing further education considering how young I am."

For the past year, I’ve been working as a data scientist at a not famous but fairly big company for my placement year, meaning that I’m between my second and third year of university and will graduate next june. 

Let’s say that, while on one hand the team I’m working with is amazing and the work culture is great, I really don’t like the job I’m currently doing, so until now I was 100% I was going to do a masters and then come back in the industry, as I think I could still improve some of my stats/maths knowledge and I don’t really come from a pure computer science background.

During my exit interview however my boss made me a HUGE offer - top salary for graduates in uk and a signing bonus equivalent to 25% of the salary, but I’ll have to come back next june and my role will be retrograded to analyst.

At the moment, I think I would prefer to take a master in ML, but I would love to hear any of your opinions as well! Do you think masters could be useful? Or would you just jump back to work?

Edit: I feel like I should give more context to the reasons why I don’t like my job that much. While the team is amazing, in the second half of the year I felt like every project I was getting involved in was the same, I didn’t feel like I was learning more along the way.

I've been working in the data field (BI developer/data analyst) for 2.5 years now (plus internships, etc. before that).   
I've come to realise that I actually really dislike the more ""hands-on"" parts of my job (i.e. development, writing code, all the technical stuff), and I'd much rather be a project or product manager coordinating  all the other aspects (requirements, timelines, meetings with users, etc.).   
In my current job I feel like it's not very likely that I'll get such a position anytime soon, even though I get great feedback (but they're mostly filled by MUCH more senior employees, and I'm still seen as very young and junior). 

  
So I guess my questions are:   
1. Am I actually way too inexperienced (26y/o with 2.5 years of full-time experience + 2 years as a working student) for a project/product manager position? Or does that really depend on the company/job?

ozvv1d,731,2021-08-07,"Got my first programming job, here are my job hunting experience and tips...",RedLibra,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ozvv1d/got_my_first_programming_job_here_are_my_job/,"So I got my first job job as a Software Developer last week, I studied MERN stack, both free courses online and on udemy. I also am from Philippines, I think saying where I'm from is important since things might be different in your country. I'll jump straight to my job hunting experience and tips...

&amp;#x200B;

**First Job Hunting Experience**

I finished learning React last April and since I believed that I am now qualified as a front end dev, I started looking for jobs on Junior level and Internships. I got two job response, one for junior and the other one for internship.

I believe I did well in the interview/screening on the junior position but I have this feeling that they are looking for someone with backend knowledge even though job description says frontend.

The internship offer had me do a technical exam, they want an app with basic login/register/dashboard feature. Code is in github while app is in Heroku. I did not know backend so I failed this one.

After this experience, I realize that I needed to learn backend too. I thought that maybe when companies say Front End Developer they meant a Full Stack Developer who will do Front End. So I stopped job hunting to learn backend...

&amp;#x200B;

**Second Job Hunting Experience**

Fast forward to Week 1 of July, I finished my first full-stack app project. I immediately looked for job. Basically I got 4 response this time, I got the job on one and I did not get far in the other three (they say they will update me, etc).  Based on posts I've seen here in reddit, I was expecting that it will take me a lot longer - like months - to find a job, so I was truly happy that I got one within a month..

&amp;#x200B;

**My Tips**

I would like to add first that I am an engineering graduate. I don't mean to discourage people, but I believe it definitely helped me land the job.

1. Most important is to improve your resume and/or portfolio (I do not have a portfolio website btw). I recommend Joshua Fluke's resume and portfolio reviews.  Just search his resume/portfolio review in youtube. I'm not a fan of his latest content (corporate cringe) but his reviews helped me to keep my resume short and simple.
2. Second is include your last job experience even if it has nothing to do with programming. My resume has 0 job experience because I read that you should skip it if it has nothing to do with programming. Based on my interview with my current employer, I certainly get plus points when they found out that I have worked before, even if it isn't related to programming.
3. Make sure you google interview questions. Just because you are coding regularly and/or confidently, doesn't mean you gonna pass the interview. Google things related to what your learning (example: JavaScript Interview questions, React interview questions, etc.), you'll be surprised by how much you don't actually know.
4. This is the tricky part: The projects in your resume. Make sure they aren't straight from youtube or paid courses. I have something like a TODO app and tic-tac-toe in my resume. I can feel their disappointment when they saw that... They probably would react the same way even if I have a social media or e-commerce app there since those can be found everywhere. Thankfully, I have one app there (full-stack) that, although is very simple, you can tell that there is some originality in it...
5. If you're also web dev like me, make sure you put a ""Login as Guest"" or something similar like that. Something where users can test the app without creating an account, since those checking that app will probably not bother to create an account.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that's it for now, just ask if you have anymore questions. I really consider myself lucky getting a job within a month. And in the job we use React, Laravel, mySQL... all are pretty great technologies. One of my fears in job-hunting is getting a job in a company whose tech stacks aren't hot and trending...

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Just want to clarify some things on #4. The tip #4 is based on my current company. As other people here said, it might depend on companies. In general, just put something there that is worth talking about in several minutes."

wondering if there are people like me, either in same situation or were in the same situation in the past.

I spent one year internship in Devops team, one year in QA automation and newly employed as a junior dev.

I kinda liked devops position, it felt like i was dealing with bunch of different things each week. Once it was builds in Teamcity, other weeks it was Chef work. Some scripting, python, bash. Little bit of AWS. But i was missing ""real coding"".

These days i mainly get a feature and try to implement it. Its like i am focused on one small part, and it doesn't matter whats happening around it. I kinda miss Devops, it felt fast, different tools, but as i mentioned, i missed coding. 

I will stay in developer position for now for sure, but wondering if anyone was in the same position and can tell his thoughts about it. Maybe more insight about becoming more senior in devops or developer position.

My end of studies project ended in August 2020 (it was a six months internship) and in september I got my computer science engineer degree. The next obvious step, that both my parents expected me to do, was to begin my data science career.

But something felt wrong to me. When I pictured myself working in this field, I felt extremely uncomfortable. My heart sped up each time I read a job offer on LinkedIn, and I just couldn't focus more than ten minutes seeking for a job. At some point I would just close my laptop and stop thinking about it. I was screaming inside my head, but unable to explain precisely what was my problem. Something in my head just kept telling myself *no you won't work.*

I wasn't depressed at all. The strong emotions that I felt wasn't sadness, depression or fear, it was anger.

A lot of bad things happened during my three interships, I couldn't even list all of them. First, I worked unpaid in a factory using dangerous machines with ninety decibels for seven hours a day, with itchy dust on my clothes that prevented me from sleeping well. The following year I've been in a company in which my boss wanted me to work more than what was on the contract (paid five hundred euros each month, this is the minimum in France). For my last intership, my supervisor misled me about how much paid holidays I had the right to take. He then told me something like: “Yeah but most of the time, students write their end of studies report during their holidays, you did it during working hours so it's ok”.

Reading the LinkedIn offers, I decided not to work. I didn't want to live those kind of nightmares again.

**It was the best year of my life. I learnt how to use Ableton Live, played video games, did a little bit of programming for leisure, visited my grand parents, read some maths books, and some days, I did nothing.**

Next month, this very strange year (probably the best of my life) is going to end. I won't give all details, but I'm back to school. This is delaying the beggining of my career (and changing my career plan too). At least I'd rather be at school than in an office.

I'll end up working anyway, which is why I still think daily of how to quit this bizarre society without becoming homeless.

I recently graduated university with a retail management degree. I was blessed with the opportunity to work as an intern with a digital hospitality company as a desktop technician role every summer throughout my education.  I loved the position that I was in, and this gave me the passion to push into IT. Unfortunately due to layoffs and company downsizing I was not able to get a full time position at my internship. 

This caused me to panic and apply to everything I possible can. I got a position as a helpdesk within a msp which I was happy about due to them saying I was able to work with servers and AD, so I accepted immediately. But after my first week of work I realized how restrictive my position is within the company. I am not able to do anything other than resetting passwords and escalating tickets more complex to system admins. I've realized how much I dislike phone support and preferred the more hands-on approach that I've done with my internship. 

I am starting to regret that I accepted this position and feel bad as my boss has good intentions but I'm feeling more depressed every passing day. These past few days a lot of the L2 desk-side support and data centre positions I've applied to have replied with interview requests. My mind is going everywhere and I'm not sure if I should follow my mind and quitting or gut and staying. I'm feeling FOMO.

Don't know what to do,DiligentOcelot9050,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p02590/failed_an_internship_in_a_highlyregarded_tech/,"I just finished interning at a highly-regarded tech company and resolved to avoid the same mistakes that I made during my first (F500, not tech company) internship which led me to not receive a return offer. TL;DR: it was almost as bad. By Week 3, I couldn't focus on anything due to distractions and mental health issues which I was too scared to disclose, which ultimately caused me to be put on medication by the end. I also failed to write more than 5 lines of code per day until Week 8/12, submit a code review until the end of Week 10/12, repeatedly failed to communicate about expectations with my superiors, and lied on occasion to escape criticism. In the end, while my final presentation went well, I was eventually exposed as having done significantly less than expected given my resources, causing me to not receive a return offer, at a company where over 80% of interns receive one. At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. I tried changing my schedule, reducing distractions, improving my health, and going to therapy, yet I simply could not focus for my life despite knowing how to complete everything that they asked (which I was finally able to make progress on by the very end). I don't understand how almost everyone can concentrate so easily and confidently; worse yet, I don't know what I can do to recover afterwards. This was my dream company, and I am terrified that I will be effectively blacklisted from returning, even for a different position in its research division which I have a referral for, based my mentor's highly negative view of me. Ultimately, I feel that I have disappointed everyone: my superiors for failing to achieve their tasks, the person who I worked closely with for many years and who referred me for failing to perform, and myself for having taken this internship so lightly and for having not learned from my past experience. What should I do to get back on track and ensure that nothing like this ever happens again?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice; I now know what to do from here."

Would I be allowed to apply for both programs?

Also, what exactly is the application process for the summit and for obtaining an internship after the summit?"

Now I am planning on going to industry like FAANG. I have been brushing up with leetcode. I have couple of questions hopefully you guys can answer.

1. I see people taking about SWE internship interviews here. Is this for the Summer 22 already? I feel like this is too early.

2. Since I have work experience, will my questions be much tougher than lets say an undergrad intern interview? I am guessing some system design questions as well?

I appreciate any feedback."

I am just interested to see how many students right now are intending to get an engineering degree to use it in the entertainment industry somehow. If so what internships are you looking for/have and what do you want to go into? 

I’m going into college in a week so and I think that’s the direction of my interest with engineering but I’m still figuring it out! I just wanna know what people are doing so I can start getting an idea of how to plan out my way! 

Also just any advice on college before I leave would be nice too!

The reasons I don’t want to go to my local uni; ANU are:
ANU only has computing (hons) which is a 4 year degree and I want to finish in 3 years.

ANU degrees are research-focused. I’m more interested in market-focused studies.

Sydney has much more internship opportunities.

I think I’d benefit as a person from having to be more independent.

UNSW is said to be the best CS uni in Australia - this means better education right

However, seeing as how the Covid situation has deteriorated in Sydney, I am wondering if I need to take covid into account when deciding on which uni to go to. What if I spend half of my first year in online school next year? I want to go on exchange in my 2nd year- will that even be possible due to covid if in Sydney?

Having done online school before - I’m extremely unproductive and depressed. I prefer face to face 1000 times more.
It’s been 13 months since ACT recorded a locally acquired case. ANU is functioning as normal. Even ANU open day isn’t cancelled. To me, this makes ANU more appealing in terms of covid.

Since UNSW cancelled open day, I couldn’t check out the vibe of the uni too.

To sum up, should I factor covid into my uni decisions or am I being too paranoid and it won’t make a difference?




edit: thanks sm for the help guys. I've decided to go to UNSW. because:
I don't want my adulthood stunted (won't get freedom/experience if in CBR),
I want to be surrounded by motivated students like myself (I've been to ANU, a lotta people only there to get the paper so they can get a cybersec government job),
live in a bigger city (personal dream/usefulness with internships),
save a year of studying.
COVID won't be taken into account since NSW's at 80% and it's only september."

* I graduated a tier 1 univ with good grades and relevant intern experience.
* I was extremely, extremely, lucky to have found a salaried position in my field bc no one does during their first year of entering X field. The employers really liked my resume. Before this, I was completely unemployed. Finding this position took me 2 months, not many other places were hiring me.
* Once I got hired, I liked going to work bc it was for a big company in a prime office location, which is what I always dreamed of
* I had little desire to do the actual job itself, it was more like a stepping stone for me. On top of that, some of the people I worked closest with treated and spoke to me horribly. While there, I never forgot about my goals, but everything aboutt the job wasn't normal. Was never what I pictured myself doing, which was OK. But worse than that, I was belittled, undermined, or excluded every day. Whether it be explicit, or simply being left out of important work related conversations. I just feel subhuman, to the point where I didn't see much point in the job bc even if I got paid, what was the point of being paid for the specific purpose of feeling belittled?
* should've realized that is just reality though, esp when you're lucky enough to find a job that pays the bills. Well, I didn't realize that and got sucked into work politics that others around me created and my emotions instead. I got let go from that job which has been really hard.
* I recently found an hourly position in the same field, but pay is very low. The work environment &amp; manager are worse than my old place. Even reviews from former employees stated that a con about working there was that you get in trouble for things that aren't communicated properly.
* It's a part time position (35 hrs/wk @ 15/hr) . I really miss having a salaried job bc I crave miss being able to support myself financially. My end goal for the past ten years, and still is, going to law school with minimal debt
* **my question is, after being let go from my first position and absolutely hating this current one, am i wrong for wanting to continue searching for jobs**? I am even going to apply to the police deparment (FBI was dream job for me growing up) among other office jobs.
* I will be studying to get into law school after my full time job. While many people crave the flexibility that having a part time job (such as the on I currently have) allows in order to get a good score which is crucial to get into law school, it's also hard to study knowing that you can't financially support yourself fully.
* I hope that my decision to continue applying for other full jobs rather than settling for the one I currently have and studying is something that resonates."

I had an internship in retail management this summer that just ended last month and wasn’t extended a job offer. I didn’t love retail anyway and took the internship because there wasn’t any Human Resources internship that were paid. Now that I am graduated I have been applying for jobs for the last 3 weeks. Human Resource positions have all said no even though that’s what my degree is in. 

I thought that’s ok something in the service industry I am not opposed to either as I was an Assistant Store Manager at a pizza place full time while in college. However after applying to some of these jobs I have either been automatically ruled out and others that I have gotten phone interviews I have been ruled out as well. 

My question is what am I doing wrong and what can I do in interviews to impress more? In school I have taken several classes about how to interview well, dress, etc. But none of these tips have seemed to help so far, and I really didn’t have major issues with interviewing for internships either. I have an interview Monday with a large insurance company and hoping to impress them!"

The interview format was VERY different from a typical interview with amazon. The interviewer started off saying I had a great resume and just asked me to introduce myself (asked a couple small questions about a project) with no typical behavioral questions. He seemed interested in the project and said he liked my approach for some parts of the project. Then he just told me to do a coding problem with no prompt, barely any instructions and nothing like a leetcode problem, I asked a ton of questions and got help from him but figured it out pretty quickly once things are clear (the coding part took me over 30 minutes). Interestingly, he seemed pretty happy with my code. He later said I was the first student to ever do the problem in an interview and it's actually a real-world problem he did a few days ago because he doesn't like leetcode questions. He also said he was trying to figure out how long this problem should take for a student. He seemed pretty nice and allowed me extra time to ask questions even we went well over the interview time limit. But I have no idea whether this is a satisfactory result for him because I’ve never heard anyone had an interview process like this before, and I’d really appreciate some insight.

Questions about OMSCS:

1. Do you think this degree is good for a EE looking to pivot into the Software industry?
2. How will this look on a resume?
3. Has anyone had trouble finding a job/internship when pursuing this degree?
4. If I thought EE and my programming classes were easy in undergrad (and I'm hardworking) do i have a good chance of doing well and getting through the program?

I'm finishing a graduation in Computer Engineering and just got into an internship! There I will be working with Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU106 Evaluation Kit for developing embedded linux applications. We will be using vivado for the HW design and Petalinux for the SW. My supervisor has given me a few references to study from (mainly Petalinux's and ZCU106's user guides). In those, I could find very good explanations of how to configure, boot, and run applications using the board. However, I feel like I'm missing something... This will be my first time developing an embedded software application for linux ( I have had previous experience with MCU, arduino and rasp) and I'm not quite sure how the system as a whole works... Also, I still have little knowledge and zero experience with fpga (we will use fpga in the design, but I won't be the one programming it) and how it communicates with the board processors.

That being said, I would like to know if is there any book/videos/courses that could also help me along the way (besides the reference manuals), so I can better understand a SoC and/or MPSoC sytem. Any help or advise are very welcome.

Thanks in advance, 

A worried intern"

Hello everyone. As most of you can probably relate, I've spent the past year and a half of my degree online. To say it was the most stressful and horrifically depressing time of my life would be an understatement. I suffered. We all suffered. The suffering was indeed...great. But look at us, we're still here and working hard towards completing this uniquely difficult journey. 

I'll be starting my junior year as a computer engineer major in about two weeks. Classes will be in person. Straight up, I'm nervous as hell. I'm worried about my ability to keep up with the course load. I'm doubting my ability to understand the material and to be successful at the level that I want. I'm worried about maintaining my GPA. I'm worried about being the only girl in my classes (this is a unique concern). I'm worried about having shitty professors or indifferent TA's. I'm worried about having to go back to online classes a month into the semester because of an outbreak...etc, etc. 

In summary, a lot of worries. 

That said, I wanted to make a post on here that I can go back to when shit starts to hit the fan. I want there to be a post that people can come to and read the comments to feel like they're not alone. 

I'll start...

To my fellow engineer students in the US and worldwide, 

From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely wish you good luck with the upcoming academic year. Some of you may have already started and some us will be in a few short weeks. Remember,  this journey is not meant to be easy and that's okay. We will make it to finish line. I wish you good luck and success on your exams, projects and internship pursuits. I wish you the best of sleep and the healthiest of times. Please make sure to take care of your health. Please make sure to sleep enough and to set time aside for exercise. 

You are smart. You are hardworking. You are here because you deserve it! Imposter syndrome be damned y'all. No one comes out the womb knowing this shit. The Greats all had to start somewhere. We are students so naturally, we don't know shit and are here to learn. Ask that question in class, raise your hand if you don't understand something and who tf care if Billy fucking Bob gets it and you don't. Again, you are here to learn.  

&amp;#x200B;

From a computer engineer student in the US about to start her junior year, I wish you all (all engineer students, regardless of field), the BEST OF FUCKING LUCK with the upcoming school year. We will get through it. 

If you feel like it, please comment and share words of encouragement below. 

Good luck."

Hi, I'm a female Civil Engineering Student, on my last year at college, and I have many doubts about my career right now.

Well, I started working about a year ago as an Assistant to a female Civil Engineer, I don't have any complaints about that first job, the payment was good, the schedule was flexible and the job was easy.

However I felt stuck and wasn't learning much, so when I felt too comfortable on that job I decided to find another one, no matter what the payment was, and I was really open to learn as much as possible.

I found an Internship on a Public Institution, the Works and Urban Development Area, where all the projects are born. The place was quite small and the job was going well for some days, untill my coworkers started dropping out, because the payment is really bad, just enough for food and daily travel from the house to work.

I realized there that I have a lot to learn, not only on the academic side (I was asked to get my curriculum ready and I realized I haven't take any other courses outside college, wich are highly necessary like Civil3D, Etabs, Revit, etc), and also I got stuck on paperwork, wich I don't dislike but I would like to do more different work.

So, I turned it down to study everything I needed, and my doubts right now rely on the fact that my classmates are working and doing well, however I'm stuck at home, and feel like I'm not recieving experience on the field.

I'm the top student on my class and I'm starting to feel like an imposter.

I would like to listen to other opinions about this topic, thanks."

Does anyone know why that was? Could it be because the interviewer just really wanted to fill the position and was tired of interviewing candidates?

At the end of the interview, the interviewer also advertised the role to me, almost like a salesman pitch. Is this a sign that I have a chance to move on to the next stage, or is this wishful thinking because I didn't solve the problem?

Overall weird interview experience and I'm assuming rejection. It just really sucks because I worked so hard to get this interview, my first Big N, and bombed it."

It's weird and a very new occurrence so I really would like to see other opinions on it!

some backstory: I (23F) graduated university this past May and was super lucky enough to have a job lined up for me with a company I was an intern at. I work for the entertainment industry, so things like tv/commercial/movie etc, and its a stressful environment. I knew this all throughout studying for my degree and felt that I was prepared for it, even getting a taste of how stressful it can be through my internship, though I've been more stressed now than ever. I work long and hard hours to make sure to churn out my work before deadlines and to meet my quotas. All in all its safe to say that while I do actually love what I do, its a stressful as hell job. 

Now for the problem at hand. Recently, I'd say for the past few weeks, I've been seeing things that don't exist. It started off very very small, where I would think I saw a spider in the corner of my eye, or thought I heard someone walking around when I'm alone. I'd brush it off since that's not really out of the ordinary because bugs exist and houses creak. But it's gotten a bit more intense where I would see something move over and over again (kinda like a glitch) until I turn to look at it and nothings there, or seeing larger figures move around, things on my desk moving when they aren't and worst of all, hearing people call my name when I am all alone. 

I'm quite a rational person, so I kept brushing it off as just my mind playing tricks on me until now, where it gets to the point where I keep whipping my head around because there's always something moving in my peripheral. I try to get good hours of sleep, I eat well and there is no known mental illness in my family. This is a very new occurrence and I really have no reason to believe that this is caused by anything other than stress, but I do feel a bit worried that its progressing and want to ask for some peer opinions before I go to any professional. 

can all of this really happen just out of stress?"

Wade sat alone at lunch, headphones in, under the massive canopy in the back of the quad as he usually did. It's not that he didn't have friends he could sit with, he had quite a few actually, but interacting with people, more than he already did at least, was… tiring. He didn't think he could take hearing much more about Johnathan's *very* exaggerated accounts of how many teachers hes “totally been hit on by ''. On top of being kind of a weird thing to brag about, just...no. Well. Maybe. Mrs. Cresfolt was pretty *liberal* with her affections, and he’d *sworn* he'd caught a glimpse of her feeling up one of his basketball teammates (Was it John? Might've been...), so she might catch a case soon. 

“Eh. Whatever. I’ll ask around, she's always showing up to the swim teams’ meets... maybe Eric knows something, or Paul... “  He shook his head. He’d think about that later, right *now* was the time to indulge himself in his daily ritual of browsing shitty internet videos until the bell rang.

He scrolled for a few minutes through his recommended feed. Drinking TuberJuice at 3am... Memes That Will Make You Lightly Exhale Through Your Nose #45… KISSING MY GF PRANK (GONE WRONG)

“Damn. Its all shit.” He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. Why was it all shit? He sighed again and shook his head lightly, feeling his bangs fall right in front of his eyes. Wait, in front of his eyes? He needed a haircut soon then, any longer and he’d start to look like a hentai protagonist. 

Welp. Hentai-protag lookin-ass or not, he still needed a video to watch. He scrolled for a few more minutes and decided. 

“Fuck it.'Restoring a JamesBuck tractor from the 1960s' it is.” With no further hesitation he clicked the link, eagerly awaiting whatever tractor-based content (courtesy of SouthWest Tractor Repair and Restoration) had to offer him...

Only to be greeted by-

“A TWO MINUTE UNSKIPPABLE AD? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT!?!?” He shouted, looking at the ad *still buffering* for some fucking reason. He glanced up, and saw some of his fellow classmates looking at him, some nodding their head in sympathy, others edging away from the clearly deranged upperclassmen that he was, who shouts in public like that anyway? Weirdo. 

He stared numbly at his phone, resigned to the fate that the uncaring internet had handed him.He should really look into getting ad blockers on his phone. Like, today after school. 

He eyed the despicable unskippable video, now almost loaded, vowing it was the last one he would ever watch without proper countermeasures. As far as he was concerned, *this was war*.  

Finally, the Ad (yes, now capitalized, it had earned that right being as horrible as it was) loaded, revealing a slightly disheveled man in his late thirties, wearing glasses and a lab coat set against a gray background. The fuck? The man cleared his throat and some upbeat music began to play.

“Hey you! Yeah! You! Are *TIRED* of living an AVERAGE, *BORING* LIFE! Are you *ADDICTED* to online MMORPG'S, getting lost in books, or finding yourself daydreaming about living life in an alternate reality? Do your friends, family, and the whole world simply not understand your desperate need for escapism? Do you crave... a Better Life?” 

Uuuhm. No. He was none of those things punctuated by well edited visuals… well. Except for the book thing, but that was because he enjoyed reading.  But still. This was turning out to be entertaining at least. 

“Hey there, dweeb! My name is Cliff Paxton, and we here at **Isekai Incorporated** have *just* the solution for you! Using our Protagonist and World Alignment Algorithm *(patent pending)* we can calculate *YOUR* ideal escape from the crushing reality that is your pathetic existence!

Wade snorted. This must be one of those parody videos that shit on anime and otakus, and a pretty good one at that. Why they would have taken out an ad slot was beyond him, but at least the quality was worth it being a two minute ad. Cliff was now gesticulating wildly at graphics as they appeared around him.

“Want to be a hero and save the world? Prove yourself to all your haters that you *totally aren't* a spineless coward? DONE! Maybe you are having trouble finding that one true love, *(or any form of love and affection at all really, let be honest here)* and just need that little extra *SOMETHING* to spice up your life?

Wade laughed at the super fast disclaimer scroll in spite of himself. Man. That in itself was almost worth it, but it was still a two minute ad, which was gross. 

“Well. Good to go out on a high note i guess, before i install the ad-blocker. I should look into that after school-”

“Hey there Wade. Still with us?”

He jumped looked down at his phone The Ad was still going, and it looked like Cliff was staring right at-

“Yes you, Wade, Huston. Can you hear me?”

“What- what in the hell? Are you talking to-”

“Yes yes I'm talking to you. Only you by the way, no one else. Just in case you were wondering”

“I- what- how-”

“Look, I’ll make this quick.” Cliff took a deep breath and re-adjusted his hair and glasses “Listen. There was a glitch in the World Alignment Algorithm, specifically in the “Protagonist Search Subroutine. Well, I say glitch, but it's more along the lines of ‘some interns of mine fucked up by hitting some buttons he shouldn't have, and spilling their coffee.’” Cliff glowered and pointed off camera. “Yeah that's right. Lookin’ at you *KYLE*. *MARCY.* See me in my office in five. Ah ah! No buts! Thank you.” 

Surprisingly, all of this was *also* accompanied by info-graphics, somehow, showing two stick figures, presumably KYLE and MARCY wearing dunce caps. Cliff looked back at the screen- no at *Wade*-and ran a hand through his hair.

“Fortunately, my programmers and engineers were barely able to contain the damage. Unfortunately, what we were NOT able to contain was the fact that you are about to be Isekaied.”

“Bullshit. What kind of sick prank is this? Who gave you access to my phone!? What-”

“Wade Wade Wade, my boy! Don't worry! Everything is under control now. Mostly. I modified the Soul Catcher Protocol and am spinning up the Bio-Printer as we speak for your new body. With some upgrades, free of charge, the least I can do. Hopefully this should work, but if it doesn't, I’ll send an anonymous gift to your family, set ‘em up for life. Actually now that I said that out loud, given the current circumstances I’m gonna do that anyway-”

“Whoa whoa, slow the fuck down for a sec! Soul Catcher? Body modification? *I’m gonna get isekaied?* What the hell-”

“Look, Wade, look,” He held up his hands in a placating gesture. “I've seen your browser history, enough of it anyway. Enough to know that you watch anime, and you’re a fucking weeb. You know *damn* well what an “isekai” is. So tell me Wade. What do like, ninety percent of the methods of getting reborn or reincarnated or teleported or WHATEVER into another world have in common?”

“What? The fuck are you- ugh. Fine.  You die. Or the person getting isekaied... wait-”

“Exactly!” Cliff beamed, clapping his hands together. “Congratulations my dear Wade, you are about to die! Don’t worry though. If I have anything to say about it, *which i do*, Charon won't be leading you across the River Styx any time soon.”

“I’M… IM *GONNA DIE!?!?* Wade shouted, not caring at the now *many* stares that were coming his way.

“Yup! In aaaahhhh… huh. A few seconds actually. Good luck my boy, and I'll see you soon. Oh by the way... don't look up.” With that, the clearly off kilter Cliff winked and pointed at Wade, and the connection cut off.

Cliff numbly stared at the screen. It had switched to the tractor repair video that he originally intended to watch before lunch was over, but for some reason he didn't really feel like watching anything at the moment

“...What the *goddamn fucking hell* was that all about?” he muttered to himself, thoughts racing. Was it an elaborate prank? No, it couldn't be, his friends were too dumb. Ok, a threat? But he hadn’t done anything to anyone as far as he-

A deep groan of buckling metal ripped him from his thoughts. He looked up and around him and saw his classmates shouting and scrambling out from underneath the canopy he was *also* currently sitting under. The last thing that Cliff had said to him echoed through his mind: 

“*Oh by the way... don't look up*”

Deafened by the screech of twisting, failing metal, Wade slowly raised his head, and found that he was sitting right underneath the support for the upper part of the canopy. Which was now hurtling right towards him.

“Ah... shit-”

There was a flash of pain, followed by a deafening *BOOM*, and he thought no more. 

At least... For a little while.

Well there you have it folks. Hope you liked it. Like i said, not sure if im gonna continue it, depends on how im feeling tbh. As always, feedback and criticism is welcome, and i hope you, dear reader, (yes you specifically) have a lovely day. Peace!

So, I'm going to be entering my third year of university (at the University Of Windsor), this Fall, and I'm coming off of completing my second internship.

My goal is to complete 5 internships by the time I graduate (I graduate in May 2024). On top of internships, I'll have a 3 year long research project with a professor from my school's Biochemistry Department. This project will encompass Machine Learning (NLP), Data Mining, Web Development, and some other CS topics. On top of that, I will be doing undergraduate research with some other professors from my school's CS department.


The companies that I've interned at are quite small, but I've learned ALOT during this time. My goal is to work at one of the big banks / fortune 500 companies.


Now... the thing is, I was wondering, how much do new grads usually make in Canada... is it unreasonable to expect 80k - 90k in Toronto, 75k - 80k in Ottawa, and about 70k in Montreal for non faang companies, but bringing lots of experience + many projects (research and side projects) along?

How much did you make when you started?


Thank you!"

Ive had a few interviews for Level 1 help desk type of positions but it seems like I'm ""overqualified"" for these. This is coming from 2 places that I know people working there and don't think they would have any reason to lie. One place even gave my resume to the networking team but they aren't looking right now. 

My basic history is small computer repair and everything to do with communications (2E2X1 was my AFSC) in the Air Force from 2001-2008 (Lucky me getting out right as the economy collapses right). Worked for 5 years over seas working on circuit cards doing testing and helping the engineers with setting up the test rigs for those cards. Came back to the states and started working on my degree with my GI bill. Really didn't work during my time in school but I did try to get some internships but no luck. Got my AAS in network admin in 2017. Went to a university and got my BAS in cyber operations/cyber warfare in 2019 (Lucky me graduating right before a world pandemic, Ive got great luck). Worked some retail part time during the last bit. Currently working for a car automation company basically watching cars drive, although I can make it sound better than that lol. I recently got my A+, Network+ and Security+ certs. 

End goal is cyber security with end, end goal being a red team. Seems like I haven't gotten any call back about anything higher than the tier 1 since I don't have any experience. I will admit I haven't look really hard since I got my certs. I'm just lost at what I should be looking for. I read the job descriptions for network admin and I don't know what 80% of the stuff they require is.

TLDR: Don't know what to look for, for work. Have just enough experience to not get lvl 1 help desk but not enough for anything higher."

**Example Scenario: You're a computer science geek.**

For college supplementary essays, do you think it is a good idea to

1. Introduce something new about yourself (that isn't mentioned in other parts of the application)  
i.e. you love to knit and sew (or something like that)
2. Stick with your original persona (to reinforce your deepest core values/experience)  
i.e. elaborate on another computer science internship experience or research project
3. A mix of both (make sure your experience are relevant but also introduce something new)  
i.e. one of your tech projects may have taught you leadership, so you briefly touch on tech before trying to segway into leadership

P.S. The situation above are hypothetical situations but I've been thinking a lot about this during the past few days haha.

Some background infos on my person:

Im from Germany and studied International Taxation and Law. Know some. Basics in accounting, national tax law tax treaties, some intra eu tax laws and so on, knowledge still on pretty basic level, as it is a bachelors degree.

Last monday I started at Deloitte, Business Tax Compliance.

And I have the anxiety of not being enough for the work. The onboarding days were the inteoduction of what the company is and what their valuss are, nothing more.

I never touched a tax return, never prepared it, neither during my studies and in my internship during my studies.

It doesnt seem like there will be a training and its more like learning by doing.

I am woorried about doing mistakes, underperfoming and then for them realizing I am somehow bad. And them thinking they made a bad decision.

Or if they start thinking: ""Hey, you studied taxation, why dont you know all that stuff?""

I grew up in an awesome family, good school district, and I had a huge support system around me from doing activities like swimming, lacrosse, marching band, honors society, you name it.
I was always naturally talented. I had a 4.0 GPA in all my time in school, I was popular, I had friends, and any person looking from the outside would say that I was set up for success.
However, there was a deeper darker side to my success all through my adolescent and late teen years. I knew I had issues when I would forget everything. My mom would tell me to unload the dishwasher or fold my laundry. I would immediately say of course and just sit there in bed. I couldn’t get up- I couldn’t even start to think about doing the task. Unexplainable waves of exhaustion and dread Would build up in me. I would say “yea give me just a minute” and next thing you know, hours would pass by and soon to follow would be the lecture of “you’re so lazy- we do everything for you- you don’t forget you just don’t want to help”
And god was that far from the truth.
This applied to everything; I couldn’t clean my room (and if I did I would shove everything into my closet and dressers so no one could see the literal hundreds of THINGS I would hoard or shove away), I would wait last minute to study and I would then proceed to spend hours in the middle of the night rushing to learn (all the while picking my skin every couple minutes to look away from the book- and my whole family would say “stop picking you’ll leave scars” and I just couldn’t and I didn’t know why. 
It worked for a really long time to do so. My grades were fine, I was always respectful of my peers and I had so much in front of me.
I didn’t think anything of it as my whole life I got so much praise and maybe everyone does this right? 
But then I started college. The first two years were a breeze, my gen Ed classes were easy and I even had more time in between classes to lay down or chill out. I got accepted into the pre nursing program at my school and I had never wanted something more. I switched majors constantly the first two and a half years because I wasn’t sure what I wanted. I found a love for the human body and people. I even had multiple internships where I thrived under physicians. (All at the same time I would continue the habits from when I was younger; I couldn’t even get up at night to fill up my water bottle)
Then the hard classes came. Chemistry, micro biology, anatomy and physiology. I was shocked. I couldn’t do the same things I had done for so many years. So as any normal person- I tried to change my study habits. I thought this would work; and it did for a while… but I realized I was spending almost 10-12 hours a day on school work compared to my nursing cohorts who could spend 3-4 at night to get a concept. I was confused… and jealous.. and I built a lot of self hatred.
I decided to go see a therapist towards the end of my fall semester. COVID school started (and I struggled so much… thank god the teachers were more lenient as I do not believe I would’ve passed the classes having to stare at a screen all day)
She gave me a lot of new coping skills and was able to ease my anxiety. 
But one day she said “I want you to go see a psychiatrist- I think you have some issues with your attention and I really believe it will make a difference.)
And so I did; and a month later I had seen the doctor a few times and done a lot of tests- and I had the paper in my hand that said I had ADHD.
My whole life literally felt… so wasted… I had spent so much time trying to figure out my brain and why I couldn’t finish things and why I talked over people and couldn’t finish to do lists or organize… and here it was.
I started vyvanse the next day. And wow. Just wow.
There was no words to explain how I felt after that first day. My life felt normal. I could read my textbook and retain the information. I didn’t have to pick my skin or go and walk around every few minutes to break up the studying. I was able to spend less time on school and I made so many good connections with my peers and teachers. My room was clean for the first time in literally my whole life. I threw away clothes and old school supplies I “might need” someday. My anxiety about “always doing something” went down. I was able to see the light of my effort but I didn’t have to worry about struggling. I kept seeing my therapist and we made plans for studying, time management, and coping skills for the future.
It had made such a difference- and I was so unsure because I was so… successful.
But I’m going into my nursing program this spring. I aced my nursing entry exam (that I previously did poorly on for what I believe was due to my burnout and lack of organization)
I’m about to start nursing school come spring semester and For once do not have a pit of Dread about the wasted hours and frustration. It truly has felt like a weight has been lifted off me.
I know not everyone’s story is like this… but coming from someone who had so much self doubt and struggling.. I hope someone can read this and empathize and somehow pursue a diagnosis if you feel you are off.
Just wanted to share because I know the stories on here have helped me tremendously the past few months. Thank you if you read this far!"

The Good:So during my time, I took off school for the past year and a half I've been interning as a software engineer at ""elite tech"" companies Like Linkedin, Microsoft, Twilio, Twitch, Zillow, Pinterest, Facebook..etc. Also I've been accepted to a prestigious fellowships (e.g. Kleiner Perkins, Bessemer, 8VC, Contrary Capital)..etc

The Case:I want to return back to school but I burned a lot of bridges at my previous institutions; plus I just want to start over to be honest. I most likely am going to start work for full-time in the next year. I am just wondering what should be done so I can be admitted to a Comp Eng/Comp Sci program that I can finish part time while I am working full time. I was thinking going back to community college and getting an associate's and applying to  resumed education programs for students with unorthodox backgrounds  such as Yale's Eli Whitney and Brown's RUE.

Thought, advice, data points, information..all is appreciated thanks."

I came into college  with enough credits to get past general ed classes and am able to  graduate in 3 years. My problem come when weighing which majors to get.  Right now im double majoring in business information technology and  finance. However i am taking student loans in order to pay this off,  about 7k per semester. I could graduate within the next year with either  BIT or finance degrees or i could stay and extra year and graduate with  both. I just wanted to get some opinions on whether or not its worth  taking on 14k in loans for an extra finance degree or not. Additionally i  haven't interned anywhere yet so im wondering if the extra time is  worth it in order to get internship experience as well however that  obviously comes at the opportunity cost of a year in the workforce. To  summarize is it worth it to spend an additional year and 14k in loans  for my finance degree or should i just try to graduate in a year with my  BIT major and get into the workforce."

So I'm on the LeetCode grind but am still far from prepared, definitely getting somewhere though. The JP Morgan Software Engineering internship is based on a rolling admission and applications close on February 2nd. I was just wondering what the difference would be if I applied now vs applied say two months from now, b/c I'm unfamiliar with how rolling admissions work. 

Like if I wait two months I should be more qualified and learn a bit more from my classes in Uni but is there any advantage to applying earlier?

Thanks in advance."

p0nul1,192,2021-08-08,[O levels] don’t underestimate the workload and stress of poly!,ripthatpussyaye,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/p0nul1/o_levels_dont_underestimate_the_workload_and/,"hello, i’ve been seeing a lot of posts from sec 4 students debating between poly/jc so i thought i’d give my personal opinion + experience as a poly student - hopefully this can help y’all a lil 

so for context, after i received my o level results, I JAE-ed into jc bc i was influenced by what my parents and relatives said - “it’s easier to get into uni from jc” “you just need to mug for the final exam in jc” etc. but soon after i attended lessons for the first month, i started to regret my choice. the academic year barely started and we were getting plied with different assignments and notes and homework and it was extremely overwhelming for me. when CCAs ended and i went home, i would just crash on my bed and dread waking up early the next morning. i wasn’t used to the level of academic rigour AT ALL, and i didn’t like that it was essentially a repeat of secondary school (where you’re treated like a child with no autonomy) except more difficult. 

so i appealed to a poly course that i originally had more interest in but was dissuaded against entering it by relatives and parents. and i got in, so i dropped out of jc after a mere month and a half and had more holidays left (ngl was really lazy then). 

so at this point everyone around me told me poly was gonna be very slack and less stressful compared to jc, so ofc i went in with that preconceived notion. but my end goal was to study in a local uni, so i thought i could breeze through and get a 3.7+ gpa and get in. 


omg, boy was i wrong. poly was a whole different ballgame from secondary school, with credit units, modules, lectures, tutorials, and irregular lesson hours, so i took a while to adjust to that. not only that, but from my experience, there’s not much support from your lecturers or tutors when you’re struggling so it was really tough as compared to sec sch when you’re spoonfed everything and cared for. and ADDITIONALLY, for my course, we were expected to do many things (statistics program, APA citation) without much guidance at all. lecturers will just throw you a guide and expect you to use these things in your essays. a lot of it was playing by ear and getting help from classmates. we had to learn how to use graphic design, video editing softwares, and photoshop AND WE WEREN’T EVEN FROM A DESIGN COURSE. 

also, the final exams were rlly stressful. some lecturers are nice and will give you hints during lecturers, but other lecturers will expect you to memorise a 300 page textbook for that ONE exam, without any hints or whatsoever. also, for my poly, they did this system where they sent u your 70% grade for the module right before the final exams, to motivate you to bring it up to an “A” or something i guess. all that did was stress me out further bc i’ll be calculating how much i need on the final exam to bring up my score. 


so the first sem did take some getting used to, and i ended up with an average gpa - 3.50/4.00. and i was rlly disappointed so i knew i needed to bring it up for the following sems in order to qualify for local uni. 


so i mugged nonstop for the next few sems (except intern + fyp), i consulted lecturers, i attended every single lecture and took notes etc etc etc. and let me tell u, it was so daunting to know that EVERY assignment, EVERY group project, and EVERY exam you did ultimately contributed to your final CGPA. and honestly, it doesn’t all boil down to individual effort, bc sometimes you get stuck with free-loading group mates who REFUSE to do work and generate ludicrous excuses every time u try to meet up. and group projects were about 30% of my overall grade; so it’s the diff between an A and a B+. 

i managed to graduate with a 3.85 gpa and was accepted into one of the so-called “elite” courses in the big 3. also it’s entirely unrelated to my diploma LOL. looking back, at that point in time of my life i wasn’t even sure of my passion and future career option. 16 is honestly a young age to have such a decision weighing over you so unless you are VERY sure you want to embark on that specific career area, otherwise keep ur options open! 

also i feel like i’m being v negative in this post so imma reiterate my point being that poly is NOT as stress free as people make it out to be. it’s a lot of frustration, anger, stress, sweat and tears, so don’t come in expecting to relax or have a good time - if you’re aiming for local uni! although i definitely do not regret my choice of poly &gt; jc bc the learning style is more tailored towards my personality. i also met great people and learnt many valuable lessons in poly. (also can i mention,, the 1.2 months holiday in between) plus the amount of presentations i went through in poly equipped me with p good public speaking skills. also poly to local uni is def possible but it does take alot of work to maintain and even pull up your GPA for 3 years straight. if you can’t envision yourself doing that then i suggest JC instead!  although since it’s 2 years only, the stress is definitely unprecedented. i have friends who stop eating entirely/binge eat during the A levels because all the mugging they do is deteriorating their mental health. 


it’s def NOT an easy choice deciding between jc and poly. ultimately i would advise you to think about your personality style and whether the JC/poly teaching style is tailored towards yours. also check out the subject prerequisites for uni courses if u have an idea of what u wanna pursue in the future - cuz it does depend on ur subject combi/poly course. and most importantly, DO NOT associate grades with your self worth - you are worth so much more than an O level cert. and try to have a few healthy coping mechanisms when studies get too stressful. jiayous for o levels y’all can do it ."

Recently started a new IT internship. I'll be working in a D365 environment using Azure DevOps, CE, and more. Overall it's a great learning environment to be in for someone like me (an amateur) and I can't  be blessed enough to grow in such an environment.

I've been chatting up with my IT Support Supervisor and noticed that we *had* a pluralsight account. The subscription expired, but the team wants to consider all other possible learning materials before they go ahead with another year subscription.

I was wondering, for someone like me - wanting to learn and soak up as much as material related to IT as a whole, would pluralsight be best for this case? This material would be mostly supplemental in comparison to the job material, but would still be great to have. 

I've mostly used Udemy in the past, and while it's great to learn from, the individual class purchasing idea might not be so great...

A certification isn't guaranteed to get you a job. If lets say you want a networking job, just getting the CCNA with no experience at all won't magically get you the job if it requires that experience. I have no idea why the hell people tell others asking for advice into getting into a certain career to get a certification if they lack experience. If anything with my advice, you have to work your way in. Instead of getting a certification, literally start at the bottom and work your way up.   


Get an internship or volunteer. Employers don't give a shit if you have certifications if you lack the experience. If you have experience then a certification will make you a stronger candidate. I got the CCNA, A+, Server+, and ITIL certifications while in college, then after graduating it took me 3 years to get an IT job. Why? Because I had no experience at all. If you're looking into getting into IT, don't expect to automatically get a high salary or a very high level position job with just certifications alone. In the real world, you have to work hard and earn the title, certifications won't give that to you."

I don’t have any internships. But I have listed all the projects I have done on my resume. (I also have a low GPA, which I do not show)

Do I have to use a modern template? Or just word?

Are there any alternate jobs that I can apply for where I’d have a easier time getting interviews?

Are there certifications that I can do that will help me?

I currently have experience in OOP languages such as Java/Python/C++.

Should I learn some newer tech such as Angular, React, AWS/Azure? 

If so what’s best to learn in terms of landing a job?

I’d appreciate your help. Thanks."

For example, I see a lot of posts asking for Frontend stuff like JavaScript and React, database stuff like SQL, or C++. I will taking classes this year that are focusing on databases, Systems programming, and some web apps, but I don’t currently know enough about them.

Lastly, I looked up what people are getting for interview questions so I can see how far I need to go with Leetcode, and I saw some questions involving Dynamic Programming and obscure algorithms.

p10bde,1,2021-08-09,Advice for a new grad working a job that isn't working out?,wanderzap,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/p10bde/advice_for_a_new_grad_working_a_job_that_isnt/,"So I have come to the realization 4 months after starting my first job that it is not right for me.

I took this job because I was depressed at the time following graduation and it was the first company to offer me a position. I felt like I just needed to get a job, but I also thought that I could learn a new skill along the way since I had never worked in paid social.

When I took this position, they said they were fine with me having little experience and that they would train me to work in this field. During my first two months, I was trained (mostly in a learn by doing capacity) and slowly got used to the position. Everything was going great, I had friends at work, there was a great work-life balance, I liked my job. But, I sort of began to notice that I didn't enjoy what I did the majority of the time and I only got excited over a small portion of my job - the majority of which was extra work I volunteered to do to help our marketing team internally.

This realization that I truly hated what I was doing was made clear last Monday when I realized that I made a mistake at work that cost the company money. These mistakes happen at my company, earlier that year someone had lost twice as much, and although it isn't ideal, people usually move on from the situation and just tell people to do better and we put new checks in place to make sure this doesn't happen again. However, I realized that this mistake was not 100% my fault - we have ""checks"" in place to help catch these things (like not hitting a correct button), but no one said anything when they were double-checking my work. I'm also being solely blamed for this mistake despite the fact that a contract was sent to the company that wasn't even signed by the client (which isn't my job to check), meaning I spent money that didn't even exist... (this is not my job to check the validity of contracts, my account manager should have done this).

I felt awful at the beginning of the week, I literally couldn't eat because I was so anxious. The idea of opening up my laptop to work was nauseating. On top of everything, I had a COVID scare and I hurt my back and had to work from bed.

On Friday, I was asked to report another mistake to my supervisor (this was a small mistake that had already been fixed a month ago, but still had to be relayed to my supervisors). This is when I got a verbal warning from my boss - where I was told that ""yearly bonuses could be at risk"" and ""that certain perks could be taken away from the company because of my mistakes."" I was also told that some people in higher positions don't see me as a hard worker and I need to prove to them that I am...

This conversation immediately took away all the guilt I had about my mistakes.

Over the past month and a half, my workload has gotten significantly more extreme. I work from ""8am-5pm"" - but I do not get lunch breaks due to my workload. I have also started to work early in the morning, sometimes 6 or 7am just to have time to complete my work in the day. On the day I made the more serious mistake, I worked from 6am to 6pm without a break... I am asked seemingly simple questions by other people in the office that they could look up themselves, and have to spend hours researching to answer them. I simply am doing too many things outside of my scope of work to succeed and not make mistakes. 

During my meeting where I was verbally warned, I told my supervisor I felt overwhelmed and was ignored. She gave me some advice on how to get more organized and that was that - however although I said I was unorganized, I truly don't think I am. In every other internship or job I've had, I have never struggled to keep up with work and have always stayed on top of deadlines and have been organized. My feelings about being overwhelmed by the number of clients I have and the workload I am expected to complete were pushed aside - and I was given another client instead of having clients distributed to other workers.

If you were in this situation, what would you do? The idea of being fired from my first job where I am working hard and I am trying yet people don't see it is just so disappointing. I have always worked hard at every job I've ever had. I know that mistakes happen and I told them I would be taking steps to make sure they don't happen again..."

p11835,1,2021-08-09,Should i try to become independent from my parents?,kettenschloss,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/p11835/should_i_try_to_become_independent_from_my_parents/," Obligatory ""i am not a native speaker so sorry for bad englando""

First, the situation: I am a 24yo male, and i have studied at university for a few years (mainly psychology). I atleast dont have debt from that, thanks to the austrian welfare state. Last summer i fell into a depressive period and after rethinking my life, i decided that i wanted to become an artisan/handyman/craftsman/metalworker. I had a few internships at factories and also tried out a few courses for mechanical engineering at University (since its free). It was a tough decission, since i lost a lot of my identity quitting uni, admitting to myself that i somewhat wasted my time there (though the life experience and other stuff i learned there surely counts for something). In the end though it was the right decission, since i my mental health has improved supstentially. I overcame my depressive period and now feel even better than i ever did in primary or highschool. Come to think of it, compared to now i was somewhat depressed even back then (mightve been dysthymia maybe).

My ""life decission"" now is between two scenarios that i have queued up in order to get a stable job in the field:

Plan A for the longest time was an apprenticeship. Its a programm for austrian tradespeople (usually for people just out of school age 15-16, but older apprentices are not unheard of) where you are already hired at a company. There you recieve very little pay, but they have to focus on teaching you skills and you also spend one out of five workdays at a tradeschool. The pay is too slim to feasably support myself, atleast for the first 1-2 years. But my parents are very supportive and will pay for some expenses just as they did in uni. I will also be able to pay for my rent and most of my food atleast, which I quite like compared to being a full time student. I am already ""hired"" to be an apprentice surface treatment technician, in the same city where i studied. This is also very good since i could keep living with my friends from highschool who will be studying for a while longer and also keep the rest of my support network.

Now for option B: Last month i had a summer job at a coke oven plant and enjoyed it quite a bit. The supervisor also seemed very satisfied with me and even offered me to call him, should i decide that this work could be for me long term. Now thats not a job offer, but the company is gigantic and always in need of people (yay to upper austrian industry), so the general possibility still stands: I could make a decent living there, with my own flat while even saving up money for a car or house. Also, i might be able to aquire additional skills for the field in an evening school, though that might mean 50-60 hour weeks. I would need to move to a city about an hour away from my parents and from my friends too. But i would be able to support myself.

I am quite torn actually: Plan A would be much more convenient for me, staying with my friends and working less in total, staying in a more beautiful city (vienna instead of Linz) and so on. But with the second option, i could be my own person, independant from everyone. Now my parents are not monsters of course, but they do annoy me at times. Especially when they treat me like a child or when they preach their new age BS and vaccine skepticism.

I think with respect to achieving my modest goals (owning a home and supporting a family one day), both paths will lead to a satisfactory outcome. It would definitely be more meaningful to me to take path B. But i am not sure if my psyche can take that. I am quite worried about slipping into depression again. I dont know if i can take moving away from my friends, reducing contact with my parents, all while working and studying a lot. On the other hand, in the past my mental health improved when i took on more responsibility, made decissions for myself and in generall ""took the harder path"".

I know that the internet can not make that decission for me, but i am sure there are some people out there who can offer some advice on this. Thank you in advance if you decide to read this wall of text and still have enough motivation to write out your thoughts."

I failed my exams and I lied to her because I didn't want to disappoint her. She needs me to work due to her being a single mother taking care of two kids so when I failed some very important exams I didn't have the heart to tell her I did. Instead I said I passed and that I'm currently looking for an internship in my field when in reality I'm looking for any kind of job where I can earn money and pay for and attempt my exams again so I don't have to ask her for money. I'm 23 and those were supposed to be my graduating final exams but I failed them. I'll try again with my own money this time and try to pass them in the next attempt in a few months. Thing is, today, my mom came up to me and told me how proud she is of me trying to find an internship in my field and of how hard I'm working to get one and how much she loves me and is proud of me... And it really hurt. I held it in and when I went back to my room, I just broke down. The guilt was absolutely killing me but I can't come clean because that would completely destroy my mom. I'm a coward who should've just told her the truth, yes. I shouldn't have let it go on this long. But I can't come clean. I will try to find a job and try to attempt my exams again with my own money this time. I'll work harder to become the son my mom thinks I am.

Thank you for reading this, I just really needed to get this out."

I just received my unofficial score of 324. I was aiming for a 330+ but am stagnating at a 165 in the quant and 160 in verbal. The medium section today was okay but the 2 other quant sections were pretty hard. I got a box plot question and a standard deviation too. Overall, i realised i need to practice harder questions for quant. I aim to get a 170 in quant to be a competitive applicant.

Background on me: I graduated this year from the University of Waterloo in computer engineering (Graduated with distinction overall 80%) and am looking to do a masters in CS. I really want to go to UC Berkley or UCLA and probably dont wanna settle for less. I have done 6 internships and will start work full time in October so i have nothing to do right now as im done with school just waiting to start full time.

Couple questions:

1. I have exhausted all ETS material including all 3 PPP's so where and how do i practice, especially math
2. I want to practice hard math as the questions were harder than the ones i had practiced on the ets tests. So again what resources should I use
3. For those who are aware of the admissions process, looking for your opinion if you think for my profile this score is good enough or i should give another shot

I had mostly As in tough AP courses and pretty high SAT scores during High School. Then senior year, a medication I was on made me severely depressed and I failed nearly all of my courses. I barely got my diploma. Almost every university I applied to rejected me that spring, even my state's flagship school. To tell the truth it still bothers me.

This continued for another year at a state university that admitted me. I dropped out summer of 2019, came home, and began attending a local community college. I am finally off that medication and I'm doing well in my CS classes now. But the damage is already done. All but one of the transfer schools I applied to last year rejected me. I assume this is because I failed all my courses freshman year at my first college, before I pulled out. These weren't like Ivy Leagues either, just really good public schools in my region.

The local school that I am attending this fall is decent, don't get me wrong. Great CS and cybersecurity program in my opinion. Fantastic location for fintech internships, and the tech hub for a pretty huge company is opening here soon. But I still feel like a fucking failure y'all... because I am. How else do you describe what I did? I failed. I see all the people I knew in high school attending Cornell and UNC and Bowdoin and Duke... ugh.

I want to get a full time role in the IT field, I have done a IT help desk role at my school for a year.  I am currently looking for full time roles on my area, San Diego, (preferably not help desk). I live in a small town and was wondering if it is smart or good to work/shadow/intern/help directors of technology or information systems managers at the schools near me for good experience or to learn more.

Let me know what you think!"

Now I'm going into junior year just knowing I'm gonna get my hopes up again seeing all sorts of cool internships and my friends getting stuff lined up, just to get crushed, and I don't know if I can deal with that again. I hate how fucking stupid this bullshit is."
p19t7f,2,2021-08-09,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (8/9/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/p19t7f/weekly_job_qa_thread_892021/,"Hi all,

Here is the seventy-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

p1a7uo,16,2021-08-09,How can I get a job with no experience?,ic33hot,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/p1a7uo/how_can_i_get_a_job_with_no_experience/,"I graduated college in May and have been applying for jobs since. I couldn't help but notice a lot of these ""entry-level"" software engineering positions require at least a year of experience. I didn't take any internships or work anywhere relevant, much to my regret. I mistakenly thought maintaining a good GPA through college would be enough to get a job out of college.

I've only heard back from a few companies I've applied to, with none of them considering me a serious candidate. Most of the calls I've gotten are random contract-for-hire jobs that I didn't apply for. I'm wondering if I should be taking the contract jobs with no benefits just to get some experience in the field, instead of a permanent one. After talking to some other alumni, I realized I've made a mistake applying after I graduate, rather than before. My parents have been really putting pressure on me to find a job and I've been feeling really stupid not taking any internships. I would really appreciate some help on how I would go about getting a job with no previous professional experience and if anyone else was in the same boat and secured a job."

(United States),Buckethead1907,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p1cdqq/can_you_help_me_pick_a_reliable_option_for_an/,"Hello all! I first would like say that this is a great sub and I regret not knowing that this place exists before.  


The title says it all. In my college I have many options to choose for IT (using this term as broadly as possible). What I look for in a degree is:  
1. Must be able to get my foot in the door easily or get an internship easily. I know 3 figure salary right off the bat is unrealistic, but it should at least be paying 50-60k, doesn't matter that I am doing exact thing I graduated from.  
2. I know this is a bit unreliable as IT sector can change easily, but it should have a forecast of being in demand for a few years down the line.  


I should be getting the point. From what I have read ***Cyber Security*** is a mid-career option and it's at least plausible. Cyber Security also have few branching: Cyber Defense teaching Windows Server administration, advanced Linux, ethical hacking, and firewall security. The second one is forensics. Third option is Network security. This one also mentions CCNA. And the last one is Network security, teaching server infrastructure implementation. ***It also has internship opportunity***  


Second main pathway is Cloud Computing. It teaches Linux, Python, and PowerShell, coupled with CCNA and mySQL. It also prepares for AWS and Azure. ***It also has internship opportunity***  


Third option is Cloud System Operation. Same as the above, but with Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry. ***It also has internship opportunity***  


Fourth is developer. It teaches microsoft SQL or Oracle SQL, Introductory Java, web design, Linux,  LAN/WAN Management, system networking, and later can have  Visual Basic.NET, Java, C++, C#  
***It also has internship opportunity***  


Fifth is Web services. It teaches C#, introductory mySQL, web design, ASP.NET, PHP, and visual design.  


Sixth is Networking security. It gives you option to pursue one of the few choices: CCNA, CCNP, Convergence Technology, Virtualization, Securtiy, Unix/Linux, or Microsoft.  


Seventh and lastly is Internet developer. It teaches  Visual Basic, JAVA, JavaScript, XHTML and HTML5, CSS3 and Microsoft SQL Unix/Linux, and databases.  


I should also say that I have worked in hospitality industry before. I feel like this is important.

In June 2021 graduate with my BSc in Computer Science, and I'm continuing onto my masters. As well, I'm currently working for my permanent resident status (PR) to be confirmed. I have my work authorization, which allows me to work for any company, and there's no need for sponsorship. 

Before I graduated, I found an internship in November 2020. However, that offer fell through because the position was eventually put on hold. They finally reached out to me again, but the company ghosted me. I continued to apply for jobs just in case. In March or so, I found another remote internship, and the company said they'd take me on. Awesome. They then told me the position was put on hold - again. 

Fast forward to April of this year, I got a written job offer, which I was pretty excited about. However, they said the company wants me to have my PR status fully confirmed by the end of August (which is technically illegal). I tell them this may be possible, so we sign the confirmation of employment. At the start of August, I tell them my PR status isn't likely going to happen. My recruiter says they'll need to reach out to their HR and get a confirmation. I'm still waiting to back regarding their decision.

During this process, I had another company reach out to me. We scheduled an interview and all that. The time comes for the interview, and the interviewer never showed up.  I reached out to this recruiter and told them what happened, and they apologize, and they'll inform with a new time

 I did another round of interviews for another company, which I made to the final round. This company had to cancel due to my interviewer being pregnant (?!) and they said they'll need to reschedule. After not hearing back from this company for over a week, they eventually said, ""Oh, this position is on hold."" Even though this company was looking to bring on 75 people and claimed to bring in over $13B last year, I thought this sounds sketchy, so I let it go. A couple of days later, I see the same job posting for the position I was interviewing for. I reached out to the company's HR and told them I'm interested, yet they don't reply

I have tweaked my resume numerous times. I completed projects which use new technologies, such as AWS, React, and Docker. Using resume parsing sites like WorkDay is growing exhausting. The constant rejections are really starting to take an emotional toll on me. I have reached out to recruiters, yet hardly any reply. I know this is a numbers game, but bloody hell, I'm genuinely losing all motivation to do this.  I know I lack internship experience, and that is my major drawback, but even those are hard to come by at this time of year

Does anyone else have a similar story or experience? Perhaps some wisdom they can share with me"

Hi, I am in the middle of a somewhat weird situation. After completing my undergrad in CS at the University of Minnesota twin cities, I got into the MSE in CIS program at Upenn and was planning on going there after working for a year. But then the pandemic hit and I stayed back at U of M for grad school and was able to intern at one of the top 4 for the summer. However, it was for a position that I don't really like as much so I am still going to be recruiting for the next year.

This is why I am looking to transfer into the MSE in CIS program at UPenn for this upcoming semester (since I never rejected them and only deferred it by a year).

I am looking for any insights into how much of a difference I can expect at Upenn when it comes to recruitment from big tech firms. I also wanted to know if the quality of education/connections would be considerably better at Penn. My area of focus is Computer Vision and AI. I understand that the research lab at Penn is way bigger than UMN but I am not sure if the work being done there is super cutting age.

Any insight would be really helpful thanks!

PS: If I transfer, I would have to spend considerably more money and spend an additional semester for graduating."

I realized that my depression is so bad that without my friends and families I would literally die because I am incapable of working, cooking, doing chores, etc. I am pretty much uncapable of doing anything right now. It sucks because there was a time where life was good - I was getting good grades, played sports, had friends and girlfriends, and got into a good engineering program with a bright future. But I failed myself. Everyone was excited for me, and I failed them all.

Honestly, I have been struggling with mental illness for most of my life but I was high-functioning. Things started spiraling out of control before college, but I got to a doctor - I got on the right meds and everything went back to normal. Two years later though my life situation was different - I found myself questioning my major, friends, and the college I was at. My mental health started to get really really bad - I could barely get out of bed or study. My doctor literally said I had the worst anxiety/depression she had seen in her entire career (She had a long career. They had to give me some real strong meds (Amphetamines/benzos/other pills), so I could get back on my feet. It helped and got me through college, but in the long run I got fucked because they stopped working. I got off the amphetamines and tapering off the benzos, but my depression/anxiety has rebounded with full force. My best days would be a somewhat shitty day for someone else. If you ask me what I am depressed or anxious about, I wouldn't be able to come up with an answer because there is nothing bothering me - its just there. Therapy, counseling, and journaling hasn't worked. Talking to people hasn't helped either.

My brain doesn't work, my body is in pain, and I can barely move or do any chores anymore. I have just become a burden in my house - I can sense the dissapointment in my mom's voice and see the despair in my dad's eyes. I enrolled myself in an online courses so they would stop yelling at me for doing nothing. They think I am doing well but I am not. I have gotten some interview requests for some company through my college, but I am unfit to interview since I literally can't think or focus for more than a few seconds. I am doing an unpaid internship which I can't perform in without taking a shit ton of pills, which help me barely scrape by.

My mental health and physical health just doesn't work. My love life and social life is just fucked up. Anyone one from college or high school who would meet me now would be shocked at what happened to me - I am to embarassed of myself to even meet close friends now a days. They are friends from hs and they aren't judgemental, but my anxiety is so bad I am paranoid that they will abandon me and leave me.

I am going to try TMS therapy - it is a magnetic therapy which has helped people improve there mental health and even caused neurogenesis. If this doesn't work which most likely won't considering nothing is helping me, I have no more options.

I am going to either take sleeping pills for the rest of my life to avoid the pain or just end it all. I don't want to die, but I want to end the pain and I have run out of options. I have lost all self esteem, confidence, and energy - I barely have any self respect left and I want to die before I lose that. I want to be gone before my family loses all respect for me. I tried loving myself, but I can't help but hate myself and hate everything about me. I am a lost cause."

Hi everyone, not sure this is the best place to post this but I will try anyway. I’m currently about to finish my second last semester of computer engineering at university, then I complete a 4 month internship, and then my final 4 month semester and I’m done!

Ive always had huge entrepreneurial spirit from a young age doing what I could to make some money and even to this day, whether it be shovelling driveways in the winter or creating logos and digital work for people or many more things. 

I have a startup idea that I’ve done a bunch of research, market research, product validation, customer validation l, etc. However I have not done any work to start building an MVP. For my internship I actually got approved to start on my MVP for my internship instead of doing a normal internship at some company which is great. 

My main question is, how do you stay motivated when you feel like you have/want to finish something you’ve started just to get it done? I have no motivation left for school, it’s not that I don’t enjoy learning or don’t enjoy this degree, I just want to sink all my time into my idea. The past 2 semesters I have been dragging myself through the courses and just barely getting by, very little effort and very little studying. However I have been spending lots of time researching. It’s only 4 months of school left technically even though it will be the end of April when I graduate due to the “internship”, I could drag myself through I’m sure however I would like to finish on a high note. 

This ended up being longer than I expected, any help is greatly appreciated, best of luck to everyone and their journeys.

I have not had any internships or related work experience so I am still quite blind to the real software engineering world. It makes me quite scared and anxious because I feel like I'm light years behind. I did take a break from school so all my friends have done internships already and will be graduating before me.

I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, but when everyone around you is actually building something, it's hard not to. They talk about what they did at internships and all these technologies and tools I don't know anything about.  

This past summer, I just finished building a web app following an online course. It was mostly following the tutorial except for some very tiny improvements I made on my own. I am proud of those improvements I implemented but at the same time, I feel ashamed because I had to google and find other people's solutions to apply the same logic to mine. I am thankful that other people have figured it out and shared it online, but at the same time I feel stupider and stupider. Why can I not figure it out just reading the documentation? Also, the vast majority of the app is basically coding along the tutorial videos. I don't even know if it's ""mine"" enough to put on my resume.

Even though I have completed this online course and now had experience building a web app using React and all relevant technologies, I feel so behind. I still have to look up everything if I want to build another web app because I'm not proficient in those tools yet. How do people master skills in these technologies? Is it even possible? Why is it that other people seem to know it all while I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed by so many technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node, Express, SQL, JSON, AJAX, Redux, Hooks, API, Django, AWS, Docker, etc. etc.). It takes me a couple of hors to few hours to implement something small. I feel so slow. Also, I don't think my code is clean because I try so many solutions before getting it to work. ""Know how to write clean codes"" on job descriptions now scares me because I feel like a fraud.

I feel under pressure that I need to improve this project with new features while starting a new project, contributing to open source projects, learning new languages and tools, etc. so that I can have something to show to my future employers. The thought of it is already exhausting. How do people find time and energy to learn so many tools and develop so many projects? 

Also, there still are so many fields within computer science that I know nothing about. It is very daunting and overwhelming to a point where I feel anxious each night before going to bed. I just don't know where to begin or which direction I should go to. 

I would appreciate if you could share your own experience or give me any advice."

I just need advice on how I can pick myself up from the ground and get on similar footing with my peers, at least.


I start senior year in September and a recent rejection from a tech internship at a university is what got me started on this whole train of thought.

I want to preface this by saying I don’t want to stay in Canada after graduating. The pay here is abysmal compared to America for a similar COL (e.g. Toronto vs California). So that naturally leaves me with UWaterloo or UofT as the best options due to their international prestige, but I feel like I’d end up dropping out due to how stressful the programs are along with their tuition costs. I’ve been looking into places like Queen’s or McMaster instead. And those are the better options; I’d even settle for Ryerson.

I’ve always loved computers since I was a child. My father works in IT, so I was introduced to technology at a pretty young age (it wouldn’t be considered so young now, since so many kids are getting iPads and stuff before they can even walk).

Sophomore year was when I was actually introduced to a programming language (it was Visual Basic, but still). I had fucked around on Scratch in elementary school and made some games but that class was my first proper introduction to logic and syntax etc. I absolutely loved it and would constantly make things I found interesting (within my scope at the time) such as a rudimentary drawing program. 

I switched to Java for junior year and we obviously never got too far but I understood everything very intuitively. The logic side of things was never a problem for me. My issue lies in using everything I know to create something practical, and the internship was sort of a wake up call for that. 

A very well known university was offering tech research internships for high school students over the summer. It was even paid, but I didn’t care about that. It would’ve looked great on my resume, considering I had- and have- no relevant experience whatsoever. I had my computer science teacher write me a reference letter and he was more than happy to, writing that I was one of the top students in his class with perfect marks etc. When I was rejected, I honestly wasn’t surprised. But what really hurt was the fact that my classmate got in. There aren’t many differences between us academically; we both had 100% in the CS course. The only major thing he had that I didn’t was that he’d created a web scraper using Python. I didn’t even know what that was until I heard him talk about it. And even now, I don’t know how the fuck I would make one. How do I make something that “interacts” with content online? That seems like such a broad question to even begin finding answers to. 

I want to teach myself these things, but every time I start thinking about it I feel hopeless. It already feels too late for me. There are twelve year olds here who’ve been coding since six, classmates who’ve won countless coding competitions while I’ve been struggling to even get through the day without losing my mind. University isn’t going to be any easier. It’s an obvious point, but it’s especially true for me. I cheated through practically all of this year’s math and physics classes because online learning is impossible for me. I’ve been teaching myself online over the summer to catch up. I’ve learned much more than I had in class and I’m not even finished, but none of it feels worth it to me. 

Say, by some miracle of God, I get up to speed for this upcoming year and achieve decent marks in all my courses. I get into an acceptable university and somehow don’t end up killing myself from the stress. What then? I don’t know how to network or talk to people in a professional setting; my parents pretty much isolated me throughout my entire life and never taught me these skills. I wasn’t allowed to get a job and was constantly told to only focus on my studies. They aren’t willing to use their connections to get me an internship at their companies. 

Let’s say I graduate and move to America. I’m still stranded. There’s countless people like me, many more that are even better, graduating from top schools with impressive portfolios. Yet they can’t find jobs. I don’t want to move all the way to America only to end up poorer than before, only this time I don’t have healthcare and housing. But I can’t survive in Canada. It’s always been my dream to live in America and I love the culture and job market there; it’s many times better than Canada’s. I won’t ever forgive myself for spending the best years of my life in a country I hate. But it seems like my future is bleak no matter where I go. I just need advice on how I can pick myself up from the ground and get on similar footing with my peers, at least."

Do I have enough for at least a decent junior dev position? I feel like I don’t, and a part of me feels like o should wait until I finish my M.S. (Dec 2022)."

I'm a newbie here, don't know how this group works. please ignore my mistakes.

I'm an Indian. I did a diploma and Graduation in Mechanical engineering. I loved coding. The circumstances were not in my favour, so I couldn't opt for it anytime sooner. but was fortunate enough to secure an internship in a product based IT-Company in the last semester of my graduation. now I'm working as their full-time employee. I have always dreamt of living in Europe (maybe the grass is always greener on the other side). but I don't know where to start? I applied for hundreds of jobs on Linkedin and StackOverflow but was rejected every time. I don't know what I'm doing wrong? I want to work in either North-West Germany or Amsterdam, Netherlands, is it possible for me? what do I have to do?

Technologies &amp; Programming Languages I am learning and made some personal projects are-

C#,.NET, NodeJS, ReactJS, PHP,  Bootstrap, OpenCV, Android Studio, MongoDB, SQL, C and Python.

I have done 5 months of internship and 10 days in the full-time role.

I would be very much thankful if you could guide me!"

I’m a generic NTU Computer Science fresh graduate who happened to have some spare time on my hands. So, I wanted to distil some things I wish I did / I’m glad I did. Hopefully this will help some of you 😊 (Might not be as applicable for other majors but hopefully there’s some transferrable info)

\- If COVID goes away by then, start planning to go for overseas exchange or internship from Y2S1 onwards, don’t push it off because you can never anticipate if something like COVID will spoil these plans!

\- Don’t be too fussed about a good GPA from Year 1 onwards. If your goal is to get a short-term scholarship, they are extremely difficult to get, and the margin can be a bit of an RNG at those levels.

\- Even in Year 1, you can afford spend a bit of time outside of studies to get some perspectives and experiences you’d otherwise not get outside of schooling years.

\- Finishing tutorial assignments by yourself and trying to understand the content as much as possible before attending them consistently is enough to minimally put you slightly ahead of the median

\- Stay in hall and be open-minded when making friends there to make the most of it, if you can afford to do so, don’t be too hard-up on the hostel fees because you’ll earn it back next time.

\- If you stay in hall, enjoy suppers with your friends because you don’t get to do it as much once the grind starts

\- If you’re an introvert like me, becoming a group leader in an orientation camp helps you to step out of your comfort zone significantly – admittedly the bar can be lower for the school-based ones as opposed to hall-based ones so you can try your luck over there.

\- Specific to computer science / software engineering: the curriculum is a lie – what we learn barely scratches the surface, get the practice of doing Leetcode as soon as you have learnt data structures and algorithms because they’ll be asked for as early as when applying for internships in some big / overseas companies

Tl;dr: Life is short, enjoy your schooling days. However, plan and execute your plans slightly in advance so you can maximize your long-term enjoyment."

I had given coding exercises , to do. I did in both R(dplyr) &amp; Python(Pandas) and sent it to them yesterday.
There was no proper questions asked in the interview.
One question they asked me is how long you have been programming , to which I replied , actual coding is from February , but I was learning it from last year in course.

Then they said you are good fit, and one guy even asked another guy to ask me a question and he said no , and said I am smart and they started laughing. Atlast they told me , they will interview 2-3 people and get back to me.

p1s0vm,1,2021-08-10,No more video games just before bed,Bigbuckrocks,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/p1s0vm/no_more_video_games_just_before_bed/,"I have a sleep disorder so I can’t sleep without taking medication before bed. It takes about half an hour for it to go into effect, so lately I’ve been spending that time staying up for a little bit and playing some Assassin’s Creed. I know, not the best decision.

Here’s why I couldn’t play AC before actually taking my medication last night. My job (well, technically internship, but it’s paid) is located an hour away from where I live. They do allow me to work remotely but I feel there should be a balance of working on-site and working remotely. I went to the office yesterday so I was commuting for a total of 2 hours. After I got back home, I had to change, have my dinner (my mother does cook so that’s a plus), and do some of my chores. I also pleasure myself to release the stress of the day. This would all take about an hour to do, maybe more. In addition, I set aside an hour for video games.

I know what you’re thinking: “Why not use that hour for Assassin’s Creed? You’re having fun with it, why not set your time for that?” Well, I can’t. That hour I reserve for video games is for ONE game in particular.

Every year I participate in the annual Big Buck Hunter World Championship. In case you’re not familiar with it, BBH is an arcade game where you shoot deer and other animals. The World Championship has a huge grand prize every year. For the past several years (before the pandemic), I would go to (mostly) Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants that have (or had) an online arcade machine to qualify for the tournament, and to do my practicing. The game has to be online because the scores are displayed on an online leaderboard.

This year, it’s different. I have my own personal machine this time around, but I still have to go out and qualify on public machines because the rules don’t allow home machines to qualify. However, I can still practice on my home machine without paying a dollar every time. I am already in good standing on the qualifier leaderboard right now, and we have a month left until qualifying closes, so I spend an hour a day practicing on my machine. That’s what the hour for video games is for, and I always set aside time for this because not many people can say that they have a personal machine to practice on. They’re really expensive. I would say my machine is worth about 6 grand or so, but I got it for free (it’s a long story).

So after I did my World Championship practicing and did some other small chores, I took my sleeping medication. While I was waiting for it to go into effect, I spent some time playing Assassin’s Creed on my Xbox. Eventually I went to sleep after looking at my phone in bed, but I accidentally overslept. Luckily the company I work for has made it clear from the start that they are flexible with their hours, and I can work whatever hours I want to. Unfortunately I do have to stay a little bit later today to make up for the hours I missed today, although that was my decision.

I learned a lesson today, not to play any video games before going to bed. I will have to accept that some days there won’t be time to play for fun, and I have to be responsible."

2. (9th-10th) Member of the content creating team in my school's quiz show organization that is organized for the 8th graders across the province. Advanced to the Executive Board Member in my sophomore year, and tracked the procedural process of the organization.
3. (9th) Organization team member at my school's MUN conference and member of MUN club. Attended +10 MUNs, won +5 awards and chaired in couple of them.
4. (10th-current) President of an MUN club that has +50 members (biggest student-led club in my school). Currently, bc of the pandemic, organizing virtual sessions to teach the basics of attending/organizing a MUN conference to the incoming students of my school.
5. (10th-current) I have served as the Secretary-General of one of the most eminent and largest conferences in my city (+150 applicants in the first week). Leaded a team of +10 students (of Academic Team) and +25 students (in total). Due to the current pandemic outbreak it has been postponed.
6. (11th) One of the mandatory projects of my Language and Composition class was writing an academic article after researching a topic thoroughly. So I self-conducted research on Gender Pay Gap (I'm a hard core feminist lol) and wrote an article.
7. (11th) Founder of a project which aims to spread independent and right information online in the days of isolation. The organization is operated by members of Gen Z and focuses on the topics that are needed to be furtherly discussed by our generation. I worked as a writer for science topics. (wasn't a really big project tho so I'm not sure if I'll mention this on my application)
8. (11th-current) The captain of a team that competes in the biggest tech-related competition in my country under the flying car category. Besides leading the team, I did the research for the vehicle's features and reported the progress we made. Apparently, the design is eligible for patenting, so we decided to apply for a patent next month.
9. (11th-current) Coded small projects on JAVA, but then I figured that I want to design mobile games using Unity so now I'm working on it. I started with simple popular games but I want to move on to more complex projects after I improve a little bit.
10. (Current) Thanks to MUNs, I'm interested in human rights so I contacted an NGO and got a 2-week internship. I'll start next month.
11. Since my major is engineering-related I've contacted some local start-ups for internship and now waiting for their responses.
12. Contacted a professor for an internship at the local bio lab. Apparently, the local lab is inactive bc of covid. But the professor said that I can work with them if/when the labs are open

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I expect my essays to be 8.5/10 I'm working on my common app essay right now and have written some of the short answer supplementals.

* Sophomore/Junior/Senior year math teacher (7.5/10) - one of my favorite teachers but I am not sure if he can write the best LOR for me
* (maybe) Sophomore/Junior/Senior year chem teacher (7.5/10) - he likes me but chem is not my strongest suit
* Junior year bio teacher (9/10) - my favorite teacher we are super close
* Counselor (7/10) - we are not so close but he knows that I am so enthusiastic about my ideals and helped me to gather official documents for my summer program applications before.

I went with law and realized I hate it and now want to get into CS.  I've already exhausted all of my HS and local college classes, but I don't know where to go beyond that.

Obviously I plan on applying to a bunch of reach schools, but what if I don't get in, y'know?

How do I find some safe and *good* coding programs/colleges, as a first-time college-goer?  It feels like the options are either MIT or community and I have no idea how to compare one school to another in terms of programs, job outlook afterwards, and internship programs I'd be offered while there.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or points in the right direction help -- I'm also down to answer any questions if I haven't included enough to gauge anything.  More than anything I just want to feel secure in a field I really enjoy, even if I feel like my lack of a constant ""something"" in CS might get in the way of a good cs school/program.

My preferred concentration of study is software engineering."
p1znrj,10,2021-08-10,How to get a job that uses Cloud if I don't have indurstry-level experience?,Mother-Bandicoot3802,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/p1znrj/how_to_get_a_job_that_uses_cloud_if_i_dont_have/,"Hey guys,

I've been a DevOps engineer at a major bank for two years and am looking for my next move.

I am in a hard situation where almost every job (SRE/DevOps/Cloud Engineer) that I applied for requires Cloud/K8S experience.

However, in my current position, it doesn't involve these technologies. Maybe in two or three years later, some cloud technology would be adopted. But it's too late for me. Inside the organization, there are not that many opportunities for cloud technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any suggestions?

How should I plan for my next move?

&amp;#x200B;

Some ideas that I can think of:

* Get Cloud Certifications.
   * The certificate could help on passing HR screening, but during tech interviews, the production-level experience is preferred.
* Personal projects deployed on Cloud.
   * It can pass HR screening but seems not preferred to tech interviewers.
* Look for an entry-level cloud engineer position.
   * Since I have almost 4 years of work experience (2 for current and 16 months for internship), I would prefer an intermediate/senior-level position.
* Even I ask for a reference, I guess I would be stuck with points 1 &amp; 2 again.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
p1zvz4,2,2021-08-10,Projects or Leetcode? (Senior looking for full time job),2Migo2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p1zvz4/projects_or_leetcode_senior_looking_for_full_time/,"I'm a senior (US) with 8 month until graduation. Have couple of internships at the same company and 2 projects (both web apps) from before I started interning.

I'm not aiming for FANGS or big tech companies. Just want to make sure I have a full time job lined up before graduating.

I'm considering either working on a project (fullstack web app) or just focus on leetcode. Part of me says I should do one more project since currently all of mine are b4 the internship, and a recent project should give me more things to talk about during interviews.

Then the other part of me says I should focus on leetcode since I'll prob get interviews anyway, and it's more important to ensure to pass the coding questions.

But then again, only 2 out of the 7 interviews I had b4 internship (so that's 2019) gave me coding questions, so I'm a bit skeptical I'd be seeing them a lot. Maybe things have changed in 2021...?

So would you focus on projects or leetcode? Thanks in advance, I really could use some advice."
p204rs,4,2021-08-10,"For those who went to college for IT, when did you do an internship?",uhohmykokoro,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p204rs/for_those_who_went_to_college_for_it_when_did_you/,"Background on me: I just changed my major to IT last December. I am about to begin what would be my senior year of college, but I'll have to take another semester of classes. 

To be honest, I have seen some opportunities for internships, but I haven't applied to any. I am insecure about the fact that I really don't know anything about IT because I'm brand new to the field. I don't think I would be of any use to an employer.

So, uh, when did you guys apply and work through your internships? It seems like most people do it either junior or senior year. Also, what area did you intern in? Help desk is usually where people start out, but I'm interested going for the sys admin route or maybe the security route after that."

The careers site says they're looking for Class of 2024/2025 students, and I'm graduating in January 2024. Does this still count, or are they only looking for typical Class of 2024 students graduating in May? Any info would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"

I thought I was a pretty decent CS student (decent gpa + 4 internships). But I open the easy level leetcode questions and suddenly everything goes away from my mind. Datastructures? *poof* Java shortcut methods *poof*. I'm honestly discouraged and quite frustrated with the LC bullshit.
p211wd,26,2021-08-10,IT paths that aren’t helpdesk! Any advice that would be helpful,howlingtaco,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p211wd/it_paths_that_arent_helpdesk_any_advice_that/,"Hello,

I recently started an internship and I am learning a lot! The one thing I am glad to know now is how much I dislike helpdesk. I helped an executive a few months prior and now he is going around telling everyone I broke his laptop…just for telling him he should probably do the windows updates on his laptop. He told my boss who just brushed it off (because he knows the guy is an idiot) and he even went up to my CTO regarding it. There’s other things that happened along the way. I sometimes think I’m not cut out for it. I can’t imagine doing this for a long time. 

I am one semester away from having my bachelors degree in IT with plans to go back next year (or the following year depending with COVID) for my certificate in data administration and masters in comp sci 

Should I just deal with it as a tech till I get my certificate/masters or what other options are there for me? 
Just need a little advice with how I’ve been feeling lately."
p2175z,1,2021-08-10,Laptop for college and streaming switch on twitch,TensaiKuzuri,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/p2175z/laptop_for_college_and_streaming_switch_on_twitch/,"Hello everyone,

I've been looking for a new laptop for myself the past few weeks. I kinda want to do everything with it because I only have money for 1 laptop. I've been checking sites like cpubenchmark and userbenchmark to try and figure it out by myself but I can't figure it out. I've seen too many laptops that I've become confused. My question is whats most important for streaming or what combo is better.  

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

· **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

Up to 1200 euro, in the Netherlands.

· **Are you open to refurbs/used?**

Nah, I would like to buy it new.

· **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

The most important things for me are build quality and performance. I don't care about ultrabooks or 2-in-1 and I almost always have the laptop connected to a socket anyway so I'm indifferent to battery life.

· **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

The lower the weight the better it would be because I do plan on using it for my study and internship but I understand that what I want my laptop to do means it'll probably weigh around 1.8 to 2.4 Kg.

· **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

N/A

· **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

I want to use my laptop to stream switch. So I'll probably use OBS for that. I might do some video editing if I post the streams on youtube but no idea on what program I would run. I play some CSGO but I don't plan on streaming that.

· **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

I play CSGO but tbh I just want to run it decently with no lag. I'm not looking to run the latest games at the highest FPS.

· **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

Definitely reliable build quality and good keyboard because I'll use it daily and I'll have to type a lot. No need for touch-screen or something. 

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

So I would like something with which I could stream me playing switch without lag or my laptop getting too hot to touch. It would also be nice for it to be good to use to spend lots of time researching topics and then writing essays.

I have found some laptops but I don't know what I should prioritize for streaming. Like is the CPU more important or the GPU. What about the ports a laptop has etc.

p21rvu,2,2021-08-10,"Stuck in a field i am incapable of working on, please let me know what i can do.",madeactoaskthisq,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/p21rvu/stuck_in_a_field_i_am_incapable_of_working_on/,"I have always wanted to have a career related to IT. Based on my country's job opportunity i chose to move forward with specialising in software engineering and started my bachelor's degree in it. 

However halfway through i started to realise that i was way behind my peers and also unable to catch up to the curriculum. I put in more effort than i usually would but still couldnt catch up to speed. But with the help of some close friends i have been able to complete my degree and luckily was able to pay for it without any debt.

I then thought that i might be able to figure it out once i join an internship at a company. I applied for more than 500 vacancies throughout a period of 1 year and received only 15 responses. Of that i got through to the technical interview for 8 companies and i FAILED all 8. Just writing out this sentence makes me feel dreadful and bring back the anxiety i got when in interview. At this point i have completely lost hope.

COVID hit halfway through my job search so that also effected up to a certain extent. I have asked for advice from many people and experts as well and the general response i received was to increase my programming skills through self study and practice. I gave around 5 months trying to learn intermediate python stuff and couldnt understand at all. I tried online forums and even reddit but i just cant understand. Knowing that self study is the cornerstone of the programming world.

Now that I am stuck with a degree that i hate, cannot get through for any job opportunities and unable to increase my skills i am unable to see a way forward. Especially with COVID i cant seem to find a way as right now i am financially not well also. 

What kind of advice would you give me in this regard? Is there any way i can salvage what i have learned and find a way or should i look for other stuff? I will value all your inputs.

Tldr: did an IT degree. Realized later on that I am not really good in IT and unable to find relevant work. Lacking ability to self study and no money for additional education. What path can i take next?

Sorry for spelling and grammatical mistakes. Made this post through phone"

About me
- 

Graduated 2020 from a normal university. 2.8 GPA (not listed in resume), no internships, 3 projects.


Timeline
- 
175 applications over 2.5 months. About 95% remote job applications. about 80% mid level (remote junior roles were scarce for me) and 20% junior. 
About 24 callbacks of which there were about 18 interviews that I decided to pursue. 

2nd/3rd round : ~10

final round: 3 (2 mid level and the one I accepted)

offer: 1 , junior devops engineer


_____________________
Why did I wait so long to apply for jobs? Well I worked on a full stack website project since graduation that I really believed in. About the 1 year mark I decided to look for another avenue in life and I started applying for jobs.


About the Job
-

TC 65k great benefits and PTO, remote software engineer I. My cost of living is low-mid. Company size: mid.


Notes from me 
-
I always found it strange that all of the junior roles I applied to just straight up denied me or ghosted, but that mid level positions were almost within my reach. I found this job after applying to a junior level full stack position, but was instead offered a junior devops role. I'm pleased this job is going to be remote and that the compensation they gave was what I asked for. 

I always thought that during live coding interviews I did poorly for my standards. In fact one mid level role I was purely denied for coding too slowly and another one because I froze up for a bit and overall worked much slower than usual. The anxiety can really kill performance.

I got feedback on my resume a total of 1 time. I had been pretty frustrated with the process because of all the ghosting and denials, so I'm glad to have found this opportunity. 
I know the struggle for all you new grads, especially people in my shoes that didn't get an internship. shoulda woulda coulda, am I right?

If anyone has any questions, I'll bite.
Thanks a lot to this community, I got plenty of actionable advice. And people put up with some of my rants lol."

p23a9q,13,2021-08-10,I finally did it!,Annual_Search_6812,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/p23a9q/i_finally_did_it/,"After 2 years of looking for an internship and countless applications and interviews I finally was able to land a job…through a family connection.

At a 4th of July party I networked with a family friend who ran a software startup. I mentioned that I was a third year college student looking for an internship and he asked what I have done so far. I summarized my 3 years of Software Engineering major courses and described some of my personal projects that were focused on front end development and he said he would get in touch.

After some preliminary emails and calls with this family friend I am officially going to be a Software Engineering Intern primarily working in front-end (Angular, Express, Tailwind)!

p23dcl,0,2021-08-10,Issue whenever I have a new job,Objective-Designer45,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/p23dcl/issue_whenever_i_have_a_new_job/," 

So theres this problem I have in every new job I take, I dont know if its professional, but I think its completely messed up. So basically the problem that I have is basically coworkers/managers basically talking behind my back and not telling me shit to my face. For instance, I had one job in which I basically was being talked behind my back about my work performance. Not once did anyone ever come up to me and talked about my performance or giving me signals of how my performance is. I even asked questions, but some asshole talked behind my back to someone and talked about my performance. Manager never addressed anything to me directly, but instead got the word about how im doing about me through someone else who never even offered help nor addressed my questions, but instead acted like a jerk and just told me to do my work while rushing me.

Fast forward to recently I had an internship and same crap happened again. I worked in this internship for a short time and it was only amongst me and two other guys. So I have one of the guys basically bad mouthing me to the other guy, but instead of addressing things to me directly he basically tells other people that I sit around a lot when I didn't really have much work to begin with. To describe this situation I'll label the two guys as guy A and guy B. I wasn't really tasked with much to do and in a situation where I was in the environment trying to figure out what the hell to do, my coworker, guy A, was basically just like ""just handle everything on your own"" then basically says that i'm not doing any work when the guy isn't even offering to help me with what i'm doing. In a lot cases, I actually had guy B take over most of the work so I didn't really have much to do and it was being addressed by him so I have nothing else to do and just sit around.

Got a job a month ago, same bullshit happening again. I have people talking behind my back and basically not even coming up to me to see whats up. Its an IT job and apparently they can see everything I do on my work computer. So I just was just wondering what kind of experience the job I have now would be relatable to in another job so I was looking at other jobs. Apparently they asked my coworker why i'm looking at other jobs instead of coming to me. So its just kind of like why the hell does this always happen? Is this professional? Am I in the wrong in thinking that this is abnormal?"

I switched into CS in the beginning of my junior year and I was not able to get an internship this summer because I had to take classes to catch up.

I have also been grinding LeetCode for a few months and will continue to do so. I have just been worried about finding jobs because I have read posts on here before about students with no internships struggling to find jobs.

I’m currently probably looking to apply as a bio major (non pre med), then explore more tech and CS in college, both related and not related with biology (I’ve started going more into programming recently with my internship, and thought it was pretty interesting. I’ve also been kinda involved with biotech). I’m a rising senior btw

In this case, it seems like it can be kind of hard to make that switch? Although many other things will likely be hard too, so maybe it’s just what it’s like for everyone. I’m just hoping to still be able to reasonably explore tech-related fields w/o feeling/being too behind I guess haha

Not sure, but I’m curious if there are any actual general requirements that some colleges may have for declaring majors, and how they may differ, like with Duke/Brown or something

p26kua,1,2021-08-11,How to Leverage GRE Scores for a Lucrative Career Track?,Satgay,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/p26kua/how_to_leverage_gre_scores_for_a_lucrative_career/,"I'm a rising senior at a relatively prestigious college. I'm a double major in mathematics and economics. I have no real passion in life and no real promising post graduate prospects in terms of employment. I have considered multiple different career paths but have had little to no luck in breaking into any industry. I have programming experience through CS coursework but failed to get a Software Engineering internship. I have financial accounting experience but failed to get a Summer Analyst position at a bank. This summer, I've simply worked as a research assistant in my school's mathematics department. Overall, my employment prospects are looking bleak due to my lack of experience as well as lack of time. Recruiting for finance will be closing up soon and I have little time to sharpen my coding skills to prepare for tough interviews for full-time Software Engineering positions.

However, what I do have are high GRE scores. Figuring that I would eventually want attend graduate school, I took the GRE this summer and scored a 334 (169Q, 165V). How can I leverage these scores to maximize my chances of attaining a stable, ideally lucrative, career? I've considered the following options:

T14 Law School, Top-ranked MS Finance, MS Computer Science.

Of the options above, I think the GRE scores would be most conducive to admissions into a T14 Law program, since it's the most numerically oriented process, with majority emphasis on test scores and GPA. However, then I would have to be an associate at a big-law firm, which I've heard is a miserable existence.

I figured attending a top-ranked MS Finance program would afford me a second chance to break into large banks, which I failed to do as an undergraduate, and perhaps work as a quantitative analyst or an investment banking analyst.

The MS in CS would aid me in sharpening up my programming skillset, which could perhaps lead to a highly lucrative FAANG position. However, I consider this the biggest gamble of the options; I've learned that I'm not a very talented programmer, and that's unlikely to change.

As for the MBA, that seems to be the most unlikely, since the majority of MBA programs like to see work experience. However, if I ever decide to pursue it, I figure it could lead to a career in management consulting or something similar.

Overall, I'm relatively lost when it comes to establishing a career path. I've considered and researched everything, and yet still lie in a state of irresoluteness. Any guidance or thoughts would be appreciated."
p26s28,254,2021-08-11,Got fired 3 months ago. This is my story.,ssupdawgy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p26s28/got_fired_3_months_ago_this_is_my_story/,"Main question: How do you get a your 2nd job after being fired from the first? and what do you say when asked why you quit (fired)?

Quick background:

1. 22F, Graduated CS mid 2020, no internships.
2. Got first dev job in mid Feb 2021, fired in first week of May 2021 (just a week before end of probation period).
3. Story starting from getting job to getting fired:  
The job required 2 years of experience, but the lead dev (who is also the CEO) took a chance on me.

Tech stack: .NET (C#), React, TypeScript.  
Team: 3 devs full time including me+CEO, 1 dev part time (the dude i replaced).  
Had 2 React projects on my resume with JS. Never coded in TS before, and the codebase (which is a very large scale app for a big company was *massive)*. They started working on it in mid 2019 and was near completion when I was hired.  
Took me ***a lot*** of time to even do simple things.  
On my 3rd day I told him how dumb I felt on my first 2 days. He said ""*nothing to feel dumb, its my responsibility to train you; you'll get there*"" - took a sigh of relief  
For the first 2-3 weeks I didn't know SHIT, would try for 2-3 hours, try my best and ultimately would ask him for his help and he would come over and literally just code up for me and I would copy - paste.  
By the 5th week I was *slowly* getting there. I still take a lot of time, my code is messy but I am still contributing something.  
On 1st April I'm in the office alone in the noon meeting I told him I would like to work from home (he earlier told us to work from home for 3 weeks due to COVID situation going bad but I kept coming to office alone). He comes to office pulls his chair and politely says:  
""*See Ik you're working hard, putting a lot of time, but you don't know how reduce works in JS, we're a company at the end of the day and need to make profit, the goal is to be as self reliant as possible, I really want to be able to coach you but you see how busy I am* (he actually is very busy)"" - I said I've been putting in a lot of work, really striving to which he says: ""*Yes ik, lets see what happens next week*"". I *guess*he meant let's see how you work next week and if I should fire you the week after if things don't work out.  
Next week comes: I don't ask him for ANY help, do all stuff 100% on my own. I'm slow but a lot faster than my initial days but I'm getting shit done. The following week comes and he says **NOTHING**! Yeay I'm probably safe and I get to keep my job. Things keep going smooth, I'm given slightly easier tasks. He even tells developer x, to keep ""doable stuff"" for me.  
The first week of May comes and I'm very nervous. On the last day (Friday) of that week he says: ""*See you're not really enjoying work here. Coming to the office alone and getting stuck and not been able to get help (coz he is busy) sucks. Yes I know developer x helps you and you can ask him for help but thats no way of working and its probably not fun for you, you deserve a place where you can learn more and have fun*"". I say almost nothing and thats it was ***fired***.

Since then till today (Aug 10, 2021), I have applied to over 300+ jobs, gotten about 5-6 interviews, passed 2 technical interviews on hackerrank passed them easily (LeetCode easy problem types), but I guess I'm f'ing my behavioural interviews. The 2-3 times I was asked why I left my job, I answer **honestly** that it I was in fact

1. laid off.
2. First job after school so obviously didn't know everything.
3. Lead dev initially planned to coach me but got busy ultimately.
4. I was hired at a time when a large scale project that they have been working on for 2 years was near completion, so it took me a lot of time to catch up.  
\- I believe my explanation above is a big turn of for them and for those interviews where I got a phone call first and said the above, they didn't proceed and rejected me a day or 2 after.

Anyone who has been laid off due to performance/know situations like these, how did you get your 2nd job and what do you tell on the behavioural interview when asked about why you left? **Pls help a sister out with any advice on how to approach these behavioural interviews**. I'm decently sharp on my technical skills and das no problem.

PS: Currently working for a startup part time, its no official job, but I get paid every time I build a feature. Would have done it for free (was doing it only to keep my dev skills sharp) but the CEO is kind enough to pay me for the features I build. Good thing i can put it on my resume at least."

Started having unstable attendence, tried to rectify and explain, but got no proper feedback. Went down with stress and got ""sacked"" after only four weeks, even though I proposed possible solutions. Is now stuck in a deadlock of utter tiredness.

Strap in for a long one, because I'm bad at keeping it short. Sorry about that.

As part of my education (marine/offshore engineering and technology management), a 9 month internship in an engineering/machine workshop was required. Which sounded awesome, as tinkering with machinestuff was the entire reason I chose this specific education path in the first place.

I was enthusiastic and pumped up about it, even though I had been painfully late about actually finding a company to intern at. I did find what seemed to be a fantastic place in the end; it seemed like it was perfect for me, in that there would be loads of different tasks to do, instead of just the same dreary one over and over. Meaning a proper environment for dopamine release (yay brain).

It started out fine, the technicians took to me well, it seemed, and while there wasn't a whole lot of work in the beginning, it allowed me to get a little more accostumed to the place.

Then the first day of not being able to leave the bed at the proper time came. On only the fourth day. Alright, still came in to work, just late, and the technicians was luckily chill about it. I hadn't told my boss about the whole ADHD thing, becuase I was counting on not actually being a problem, what with me being actually really enthustiac about the work and liking the workplace, so I immediately talked with my boss about it and explained how it can affect me. Transparency seemed to proper, now that it had come in to play anyway.

Boss reacts well, and even tries to be accomodating, with propositions as to what he can do, should it happen again. All good, I intent for it to a one time thing. I like the work, so of course I want to do my best and make it work.

That's not how it turned out, however. Shocker, I know. Apparently, the stress I had build up with delayed search for an internship had carried over into the actual internship, and I kept on having days with late attendance, or even days where I just couldn't show up at all.   
Inserted edit: It wasn't that I was late because I didn't want to get out of bed and go to work, it was that I couldn't get out of bed INSPITE of wanting to go work. Just a little point I forgot to make, it might've not been a necessary edit to make.

I tried being as commucative about it as possible, but my boss went on vacation after the first week, and even though I tried to talk with the technicians about what was happening and such, they being my immediate superiors and all, they really didn't have much to say about administrative/management matters.

There wasn't really much that could be done until the boss came back. They told be to just take it easy and not think about it too much, and just wait until I could find a solution with my boss. It felt like they were trying to be nice and accommodative, but in hindsight it was likely a contributing factor in the eventual bad ending. This seems to have been fanning the flame of my already considerable level of stress.

The crux of it all came in the fourth week: Production was closed down for two weeks for proper maintance, cleaning and installation of upgraded/updated machinery and interior. My task in this was to clean and remove loads of residual layers of fat (the company is one of the biggest producers of cheese powder in Europe) fromthe interiorof  a turbine and attached boilers. Yucky work, but I've never been particularly claustrophopic, so no biggie. Or so I thought.

Monday was all about the turbine, and the last hour of the day was me slithering into, and under the turbine fan, to whack away at the fat. That's where my body began to feel anxious. I say my body here, because it felt like the buildup to a panic attack, but without the following anxious thoughts. Day ends, no panic attack came, but it was slightly worrying.

Tuesday was about a boiler pipe attached to the turbine unit. Which came with working very close to two not particularly pleasant (meaning actual physically dangerous) drops; one falling into aforementioned turbinefan, and the other into the attached boiler. With interior being quite slippery, this fact apparently decided to do the facehugger onto my subconsciousness, and, uncharacteristically of me, made me quite hesitant to climb in.

We whacked away at the fat until late noon, when it became break-time. I had become increasingly tense at that point, so it was perfect timing to calm a bit down. Turned out that I couldn't. I had to dissapoint myself and my coworkers, and tell them that I was on the verge on a panic attack, and cut the workday short. The technician reacted as could be expected, and while relatively calm, it was still very clear that he was frustrated, when he told that of course I should head home if I wasn't able to work, but that I had to sort this out with the boss; he (the technician) couldn't keep planning work for me, if kept being this unstable. Which is a completely understandable position to have.

Went home, and directly proceeded to do the nap. Aaand, that nap turned into complete breakdown; I just couldn't get out of bed the rest of week, nor could I even manage to communicate with my work. Or anyone else for that matter. Not until Friday was I able to contact a friend, and that just so we could play online together, sort of me trying to get back a modicum of normalcy. I finally managed to mail my boss about the situation on sunday, asking for a meeting to sort everything out. Keep in mind that my internship was only four weeks in at this point.

I met with my boss tuesday, and it was actually quite nice: He was very calm about it, and we just started it out friendly with a little small-talk. Then he laid out the situation as he had been told from the technicians, as well as what I had told in the mail. As it turned out, a full third of my time with them, had been, well, not with them. Just about 6-7 days was the time I had not been at work. And the time I had been at work, the technicians had apparently expressed that I didn't really live up to their expectations.

Note: I come from a highschool background, not a technical education, and as such my current education started out with 6-month introductory courses to workshop and technical work. Which had been severely limited in their scope 'cause of the whole Covid-19 stuff. And my boss knew as much; I had told him about that at my internship-interview. Whhile I had all the basics down and covered, I had only that: The basics. And the internship was about me getting experience with it to begin with, so they knew from the get-go that it was likely that I would start out relatively slow.

I expressed that I was working in the background to sort my personal stuff out, having talked with both my GP and a mentor that I am lucky enough to have been granted, and that I was hoping all the issues with late turn-up and missed days could be solved by shortening my workdays, and lengthening the interniship period, as had been suggested by my GP.

The came the kicker: My boss didn't think it could work out for the company, even with changes to workhours, nor what I did in the background. They had to terminate internship effective immediately.

To be quite honest, my immediate reaction after getting back home, was actually sort of pseudo-elation. Like my source of stress had been cut off. But it is has now been three weeks since, and the stress came back very quickly, since I now have to deal with the fact that I have no internship, as well as what the immediate future will be. I won't know until I have talked with my internship-supervisor about it all, but I just seem to not be able to actively communicate with anyone.

I'm just so damned tired, and anything requiring a minimal amount of efftort just seems so overwhelming. Like I'm completely mentally isolated. And all the tiredness and bad sleep means that my meds is way less effective, which certainly doesn't help the matter.

I was so enthusiastic, and actually invested in the work; it was fun and stimulating, it just felt so right. And now there is nothing but tiredness. And it's not even that I don't what to do. I just can't get it done. Like I'm blocking myself.

I did get to keep my issued safetyshoes, which are SO much better than the ones I already had. Which is something."

I have worked with excel for many years now and know my way around the programm but am also very far away from being an expert. I recently learned about macros and would love to hear opinions of experts if the idea I have is actually doable or complete nonsense. A few pointers in the right direction would be amazing.

So I work in marketing, tv advertisement to be precise. I am a media planner, which means that I buy tv advertising space for my client and create a spotlist with all the necessary information in excel. These lists include things like date, weekday, channel, placement ID's, format, price and all the other necessary information for me and my client.

Here is the deal. I get regular updates from the tv networks. If anything changes in their programm, they will sent me an updated list in excel. These lists are naturally completely different than the lists I am working with. Formatting said lists, copying the data over in my own list and deleting the old data takes A LOT of time. Time I could spend more productively otherwise. We literally have one intern (or myself at times) just for formatting our excel lists.

My question is this.

Is it possible to write a macro that changes the format of the lists into my desired format so I can just copy paste them and delete the old data. The necessary things to format would be shifting the order of the rows, changing font and size, grid and colour of the cells.

How realistic is something like this? Or is it too complicated?

The thing is I couldn’t get much help from other developers every time I ask help they’re not responding to my messages. It’s really hard to find solutions over the internet for some of the problems. I was assigned for backend and frontend tasks as well. Can you guys tell me is this normal when you’re in internship? Do you have any tips to improve myself?

So I go to a no name not even in Top 1000 CS school and have a 2.7 GPA so I wasn’t really expecting a very good response rate when applying for 2022 intern positions. For whatever reason I have got 5 OA’s so far, but I’m nowhere near ready in terms of leetcode preparation. So my question is, if I apply now and fail either the OA’s and/or interview, if the application is still open months later can I reapply once I’m more prepared? 
I’m thinking mostly in terms of Amazon, since I heard their application is open from now until next April.

Thanks so much for any help I really appreciate it"

Sorry about my grammar mistakes

Since school, I always had problems to study and to pay attention to class since I can remember I was always called the kid that didn't want to study and pay attention by my parents and close ones

Which created a deep scar that leads me to compare myself to my friends and their achievements, keeping me from enjoying the nice things that happen and their friendship

 Even after my diagnosis and several people telling that I'm smart and capable e me proving that I still feel like I'm not capable of doing anything

Been taking medication and going to a therapist to treat my depression and anxiety for 3 years, and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16, changed medication 3 times because they don't work

I'm a marketing major, starting my last semester today

Couple of months ago, I started working in a marketing agency my first real job until now I only worked as an intern in other agencies  since the first day I had problems because my boss was rude with everyone and abusive and most of the time I did not receive complete information about the clients and the procedures which led to mistakes

I woke up everyday anxious and went to sleep the same way, which leads to my ADHD getting worse

Today I was fired, and I just fell that I will never amount to anything 

I'm getting tired of trying and trying, I don't know anyone close with ADHD and my girlfriend tries to support me the best way that she can, so I'm here to put this out there and ask for opinions and support of people that go through this situations

I loved reading all those kind comments. After my previous post [The A-Z for Graduate Admissions MS/Ph.D.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/octr26/the_az_for_graduate_admissions_msphd/) I received a lot of DMs regarding my profile, what colleges I applied to, and how I went about choosing which college to attend. So carrying context from the previous post, in this post I will discuss what colleges I applied to, rejections I faced (over two admission cycles), and share some insight into my profile and what went wrong for the rejections I faced.

**Profile for Fall 2020**

GRE: 311/340  :(  
TOEFL: 113/120  
CGPA: 8.9 (Till 6 semesters)  
Papers: 2 (Both in sub-par venues, with absolutely no reputation)  
Internships: GeorgiaTech (4 months in Atlanta), Invento Robotics (2 months), IIM-A (1 Month)   
Patent: 1 (Filed)

&amp;#x200B;

**Colleges I applied To in Fall 2020**  


* CMU : MSAII
* UIUC : MS CS
* EPFL : MS Robotics
* USC : MS-CS, MS-AI
* GeorgiaTech : MSCS
* CornellTech : MS IT + Connective Media
* UMD (University of Maryland, CollegePark) : MS Robotics 
* University of Washington : CS
* UBC : MS CS
* Purdue : MS CS

Fate had it that I got rejects from every single program except USC and UMD both were my safe schools. Unfortunately, I received a rejection from GeorgiaTech where I went on to do an internship! The reasons for my rejections from a session of self-reflection were clear. I felt my GRE score was below par for the Universities I was targeting. Though I did include universities like Purdue, UBC, UIUC which did not require GRE scores, coming from an undergraduate University which is not an IIT definitely trimmed my chances at schools like EPFL, UIUC. So here is the learning I would take, If your GRE scores are below par for schools that generally take high GRE scores then the ground reality is your chances are slim to get in. So don't waste money on those applications. Yes, there are cases where people with low GRE scores did manage to get into dream schools (including me in Fall 2021) but it's not something I would keep my hopes pinned to. It took the life out of me when I received a rejection from GeorgiaTech because I had a LOR from a professor from GeorgiaTech and spent 4 months on campus and did some really good work for which I received ample appreciation. I also felt my LORs were a tad bit vague and really had nothing special about me mentioned. Make sure your LORs reflects not just your personality but your academic ability and technical skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward admission cycle for Fall 2021**  
**Profile for Fall 2021** (Highlighted changes from 2019 for reference)

GRE: 311/340  :(  
TOEFL: 113/120  
CGPA: **9.05** (Graduated!)  
Papers: **4** (The additional two papers were in reputed venues CORE A\* workshop paper, Core B full paper)  
Work Experience: **1-year Invento Robotics as Robotics Engineer** (a fancier term for an SDE who works on Robots)  
Internships: GeorgiaTech (4 months in Atlanta), Invento Robotics (2 months), IIM-A (1 Month)   
Patent: 1 (Filed)

  
This time around I applied to  


* CMU: MSML 
* USC: MS-AI (Was given a spring admit back then)
* GeorgiaTech : MS Robotics 
* Columbia : MSCS 
* Brown: MSCS 
* CornellTech : MS IT + HealthTech 
* UCSC: Ph.D Computational Media (Funded)
* University of Adelaide: Ph.D. Computer Vision (Funded)
* UMass: MS+Ph.D. Computer Science (Funded)
* UNCC : MSCS (Funded)
* MIT : Media Labs (Funded)

This time the pandemic turned around things, and every university except CornellTech waived their GRE scores for me. Now, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because for the same set of LORs and a few additions to the profile I got admits from GeorgiaTech, USC, CornellTech, UCSC, University of Adelaide. Another addition is a new set of LORs from Invento, though I had a LOR previously from Invento I felt it was generic at least compared to the latest ones. My manager and the CEO this time were really generous to acknowledge all my work over one year and write in great technical detail about my contributions which I believe is another reason my application might have stood out. The reasons I feel for me rejects are as follows:  


* Wrong choice of program in CMU. Looking back I feel I would have made a better candidate at MS Robotics at CMU and might have had a better shot at it instead of MSML. Especially with the one year of quality experience at Invento and a lot of my work being covered by the media, I should have gone for it. 
* Columbia and Brown possibly require a lot more, not sure what went wrong there. 
* UMass was a surprise for me, I had a fantastic conversation with a professor who also shared they are excited to work with me and encouraged me to apply. I was hopefully on it, but soon the Professor ghosted me :)
* UNCC is a very selective school and to my knowledge has funded masters. They pick students ideally with top-tier publications and also they have a fantastic NLP department and my profile had nothing to do with NLP. I guess I was just attracted to the funding. So choose to apply to schools especially those with funding only if you have a positive conversation with the professor and in most cases if you have an affirmation. 
* MIT being MIT. I applied to the personal Robotics lab. Deep inside though I know MIT is super ambitious I was a tad bit hopeful because of the pandemic I had the opportunity to develop robots in hospitals and the hospitality setting, which was super close to what people at the personal robotics lab were working on. At the same time, I was riding a wave of media coverage of the robots we built for Chennai Airport, Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Hospitals, CNN coverage I guess these really build my hopes which came tumbling. Looking at other profiles in the same lab I realize that MIT media Lab really stresses creativity, you might have done good generic work, but what is the disruption you have created is what they might be looking for. Still, do not go too hard on yourself at these places because the number of people who get picked lies less than 3 per lab. 

The core takeaways for me is profile improvement, do not just sit and wait for the next admission cycle but instead focus on areas you can improve on and focus per course. Working one year exclusively on Robotics in a healthCare setting opened up avenues in almost all Robotics, healthcare, AI programs I applied to. So being very specific on what you want to do might also help in choosing programs.  


Good Luck with Fall 2022! You guys will nail it!

thanks in advance

**Demographics:** Rising senior, Asian/white (MENA). Go to a new small charter school with graduating class of 100 (I am part of the first class to graduate.)

**Income:** we're at that spot where fin. aid is pretty minimal but we can't afford full pay either.

**Intended Major(s):** Neuroscience, Cog. Sci, Stats (if they don't have the first two)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** Taking it on the 28th, testing \~1500.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 4.0 UW/4.3 W (highest w/most difficult course load - school doesn't have many honors classes) - no class rank available.

**Coursework:**   
AP Stats - 4 (self-studied)  
AP Psych - 5 (self-studied)  
CC dual enrollment: ENG101, MATH116 (advanced pre-calc) - both A's  
taking a college class at USD &amp; doing MATH141 (some calc class idk) in the fall.

**Awards:** some MUN award for my school's MUN program but I don't think I'll include it.

**Extracurriculars:** (in no particular order)- leadership position at a neuroscience related-organization (sorry I have to be pretty generic here but its a legit org don't worry) \[early sophomore year - now\]

\- summer internship with chemistry prof (virtual, used R to run simulations and reviewed some papers) \[\~2.5 months\]

\- FRC robotics team (member, team won regional in freshman year, qualified for world championship for freshman &amp; sophomore year, also do community service with them) \[freshman year - now\]

\- Student senate (member, but I did so much shit you have no idea, I have a lot of specific things I can mention but I'd rather not) \[freshman year - now\]

\- MUN (member, was only started junior year) \[junior year - now\]

\- Varsity swimming (started sophomore year, got canceled before events happened due to COVID &amp; didn't start again in junior year for same reason) \[sophomore year - now\]

\- so yeah. not much here. my school is really new so there isn't much to put ig, and they don't allow any of the honors societies etc (which imo I like) so I don't have any filler content either. maybe I should've done more stuff. probably. kinda too late anyways.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I think my LORS would be pretty good because everyone I'm asking I know really well, and they know me really well. Too bad UC's don't read them.

**Schools:**(haven't researched into safeties yet, so if you any for CA that are good lmk)

UC's- Berkeley- LA- Santa Barbara- San Diego

others-applying to VBilt, Duke, CMU just for fun. probably can't afford if I even get in though.

thanks for your time"

p2jh2v,3,2021-08-11,Tesla Interview Opportunity - Need Advice,intrepid_ai,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/p2jh2v/tesla_interview_opportunity_need_advice/,"So I got an email from a recruiter at Tesla probably no less than an hour ago. They asked me if I have availability for the upcoming Fall semester. So here me out on this:

I had the intention of returning to my undergraduate studies this coming Fall, but this email came as a shock to me. My university starts in a about 1 week, so this Tesla Recruiter email came to me as a shock. 

On one hand, I was extremely excited and surprised that I was given this opportunity for an interview and potential internship. And it boosts my resume way out there (I mean it's Tesla, right?).

On the other hand, if I do get the internship and ai commit to it, it's really cutting it close to the deadline for me to get a full refund from my college (less than 1 week) and it messes up my Fall semester completely. And the several plans that I have already committed are quite large in numbers, such as thinking of potentially subleasing my off-campus housing plans, changing my plans to help out my professors that I have interest in their research, and etc.

p2khe9,2,2021-08-11,I got rejected from a job that I had more than double the experience and qualifications they're looking for because I don't have a Bachelor's.,mrmatchgame,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/p2khe9/i_got_rejected_from_a_job_that_i_had_more_than/,"For reasons not worth going into I don't want to mention my field of work.

I applied for my perfect job; I had double the experience they were looking for, hell it was my dream job.  I have a cast of thousands helping me re-work my resume, work with me on interview techniques, the whole works. I had references of well-known names in my industry and the city in general.

I have a connection to a VP department head who hand-delivered resume to the person who was doing the hiring in the other department, skipping over the HR people. So I thought I was at least guaranteed an interview. Today I got a call from the VP; they rejected me because I don't have a Bachelor's. After the call ended, I cried; I'm still crying. 

I worked in an industry that values experience more than a degree. I did an internship that turned into a job while still in school, and just a few weeks later, I stepped into a managerial role. All this within the span of four weeks. I dropped out of school without cashing in my credits for a certificate, a one-year degree. I couldn't juggle family, work, and school at that time.

I spent 11 years at my job, I was never asked for my qualifications, I trained people who had a higher education than me, I worked and met with well influential people, including politicians, I'm not bragging about who I met, but I'm bragging about how the company trusted me to work with these people, no one quested my academic background. Not. One. Person.

When I was laid-off, I was happy because the job was stressful, and my mental and physical health suffered. 

I told the people who were rooting for me to go get my Bachelor's. Logically, they're right. I understand it's the path I need to take if I want to stay in my industry. Emotionally, I can't. Academically speaking, I wasn't good. I had a special Individualized Education Program or IEP(also known in some circles as a ""Sped kid'). I did ok up until high school, I went to a charter school when it was all the craze, to enter the school I had to be ""taken off"" my IEP. My grades got so bad I had to attend summer school. I asked my family to transfer me to a ""regular"" school which they denied. For the first time in my academic career, I had to attend summer school and did so every year. The most embarrassing part was repeating the 12th grade and never smart enough to get my diploma, I just got my GED so I can move on with my life.

Because of how my brain works, I can't work and go to school simultaneously. I don't have any financial help, and I don't want to be stuck with thousands of dollars of student loan debt that would be impossible to pay off. I'm scared to fail, I hated that feeling when I didn't do well in school, and with money on the line, I don't know if I can emotionally take if I fail and try my best.

I'm entering my late 30's and don't want to go backwards in life. I know they're older people who have gone back to school and even changed careers. I honestly don't know what to do.

Before anybody asks, I have a person to talk to about my issues."

13th of september this very year, my internship will start. It'll take half a year, is required to finish my education(IT expert)(when it's over i'm at 50% of the entire eduation.)

I'm a decently capable guy, especially in a single subject; linux. I'm just decently good at it, I guess. People who do not, can not or are too stupid to work get their stupid government money and can afford to drive pretty nice cars while any and al opportunity for us to actually work and earn money, capable students, gets completely wiped away for the fact that we are completely required to work at least 36 hours a week, and any more would just be unhealthy.

Not just that but I also don't have any choice in when I do it. I know about myself that I just suck at being productive when winter starts.

I'm very scared I'll not be enough, or that I get fucked over. Not to mention that some companies do actually pay up to 100 euros per month for students, while others just give you a ""thank you and goodbye"" when it's over.

And there was an actual idea for a law that got more than enough votes, just to make a bit of compensation required, however, they couldn't pass it as an actual law for some(CORPORATE BULLSHIT)reason.

Tl;dr unpaid internships are bullshit in a country where companies and poor people are literally subsidized into heaven while the capable students get thrown into an ocean of dept with a block of concrete on their feet that has ""Thank you"" carved into it.  


EDIT: before the TL;DR I forgot to say that if we need money as students following an unpaid internship, then our own government pushes us towards a student loan, which was meant to not be in the way too much but I see a shit ton of people struggling to get a house because of it right now."

&amp;#x200B;

I did an internship at a small (&gt;10 ppl) independent testing lab between years 3 and 4 of uni, at which I made good friends with  everyone including the owner (lets call him Jim). I talked to Jim when I was approaching graduation and while he didn't have the space to hire me at the time he was able to get me in contact with a couple companies that interviewed me and I got my first job from one. I worked there for 1.5 yrs then moved to my current job back in October 2020 due to pay difference and a bunch of moral issues at job 1. I ended up applying at one of the places I interviewing at before job 1 and got another interview since a bunch of personnel changes happened while I was at job 1. I ended up getting the job and while my current job has its issues, it is not unbearable. The pay is good (55k salary), the benefits are alright, and the culture is passable. It is more of a large company and I fear that there is little in the way of upward movement in my near future here, but I think that is okay due to lack of experience anyway. I would probably have to change jobs for any large promotion anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and I was taking samples to Jim's lab for testing and he asked me to go to lunch with him. He asked if I would be interested in working for him again and made me an offer of 50k salary, a bit larger yearly bonus, and said that he was looking to train me to become tech director of the lab in the future. I don't really mind the money much and Jim said he could probably come up some if they get a covid relief check. I do feel indebted to Jim for hooking me up with the first job, and giving me a good recommendation when heard I had applied to the current job. I know that shouldn't weigh much in this kind of decision, but I would feel bad for a while if I turned him down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few concerns though, the first being that I don't know that I want to live in MS for the foreseeable future, I guess that is a personal decision though. Otherwise, I am not sure if I would be cutting myself short financially working there instead of looking to be a formulator for companies with deeper pockets. In the same vein, I would be missing out on a lot of manufacturer level experiences such as formulating, team work with other departments, and mobility from company to company every few years if I wish it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the short term though, I would have a lot more control and influence over my work at Jim's lab due to it being a small and expanding lab. Jim is a great guy and I enjoy working with him and the rest of the team, which I can't always say about my current or previous coworkers. The work is a bit less hectic since it is mostly just testing and reporting data for samples other labs send, and this would expose me to a lot of different contacts, companies, and approaches to formulating that would be difficult to see otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping for some wisdom from the internet on this one. Maybe one of you see something I do not.

p2nhgt,1,2021-08-11,Looking into the IT field as my future.

Considering this field, is college an absolute must? How much does trade school teach you in terms of IT security and is it worth the time investment, I get the choice between CCNA and A+ as a certification which leads me to my next question. Which certification should I go for? I've heard that A+ will get an employers attention and put me a little above the rest, but I've also heard a side where CCNA is seen as more impressive than A+. I'm choosing between which one I should take so input on that would be great. After my 2 year tenure at Trade school should I attend college or go for a entry level IT job for work experience? I've heard that most employers will also care more about the knowledge and abilities than a degree or certifications. Do High school internships in the field help gain the attention of employers? or is it pushed over because of how easily accessible it is? I realize it's recommended that I take college for this field, but is it still beneficial to go out and make money off the trade I learn anyways and take my work experience from an entry level job and take it to a better paying employer? Is it easy getting a job in this field? I realize nothing comes easy but I would like to get my foot in the door at least, and do employers often look for those who have taken trade school and take more consideration into them? Thank you for answering these questions, I'll probably be back for more but this is all that I could come up with so far. Much appreciated."
p2nktp,1,2021-08-11,Is this unpaid internship illegal?,sarakaychn,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/p2nktp/is_this_unpaid_internship_illegal/,"Hey y'all! I'm gonna try to keep this as brief as possible but I need your thoughts on this.

Basically at the beginning of the summer (May) I decided to work an unpaid internship for company X. I had decided to take this internship since I was pretty hopeless about receiving any other offers. I was fully aware that it would be unpaid and I signed an agreement.

Basically I had to commit to a minimum of 15 hours a week and go into the office twice a week with no stipend for transportation or lunch (Transportation was about $20 roundtrip). There was also a total of 5-6 interns. For the first month we were completely virtual and we would sign into zoom and stay on while each person did their projects. Everything was ok until I realized that the ""employer"" was the only person from the company that we would interact with, and as far as I was concerned, that was also the only official employee of the agency. This was weird, and as stated under labor laws, unpaid interns should NOT replace the work of regular employees. 

However, it seemed as we did most of the company's work such as developing websites, doing marketing for prospective and current clients, handling projects, etc. 

Around June, I was offered a paid internship at a larger and known company which I took since I am already a senior and looking for a future job. At first I tried to make it work with both jobs (both requiring 15 hours+) but it simply did not work. So, I decided to leave my unpaid position. 

Although my way of handling things was very unprofessional (I emailed the employer the day before confirming that I was 100% leaving because that was still on the air since the last time we spoke face-to-face) I had been very respectful in my email and reinstated that it was my fault that I could not deal with the pressure. We went back and forth a few times and I kept apologizing. I thought we ended well. 

Now I come to find out this employer has emailed my university stating they would not like to work with students from there and then dragged my name on the mud. I simply emailed back the university sharing my experience and screenshots of the emails. 

Redditors... your thoughts?"
p2nwyr,3,2021-08-11,"I (19F) have never had a job before, and I don’t know what to do.",tinfoilpinwheel,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/p2nwyr/i_19f_have_never_had_a_job_before_and_i_dont_know/,"I’m a college student heading into my third year, and I’m ashamed to say that I’ve never had a job before. During high school, I had terrible mental health (for context, I’ve been struggling with things like eating disorders, high anxiety, and PTSD since middle school), so my parents encouraged me to focus more on things like going to therapy, taking care of myself, and keeping my grades up, instead of getting a job.

I had originally planned to apply for a job during my freshman year of college. Unfortunately, a family member of mine passed away during that first semester, and it sent my mental and physical health back into a spiral. When I finally started applying for jobs again, during my second semester, the pandemic hit. One of my parents is extremely high risk as a result of chronic illness and other past medical problems, and I've been terrified of what could happen if she got covid. I talked it over with my parents, and we agreed that I should wait to get a job until everyone in the household was vaccinated. Unfortunately, the week I went in for my first vaccine, she got diagnosed with cancer.

She really hasn’t been taking the chemotherapy well, and while I hope she’ll be okay in the long run, she’s had several hospital visits since starting the treatment. Almost every other day, both me and my younger sibling will have to stop what we’re doing to prepare to leave for the hospital if her heart rate or blood pressure spikes too high. 

Because of everything, I’ve been further putting off both getting a job and looking for an apartment. I know I’ll have to move away for school, soon, anyways, but I feel like I should stay at home to help while she’s still doing chemo. I feel like I need to help take care of her. She’s encouraging me to continue looking for an apartment, but I’m so scared of leaving, it feels like I freeze up every time I try to make any progress in that area. I freeze up when trying to find roommates, and if I stop responding to their messages for a few days, I don’t know how to explain that my mom had another medical scare, and that it made me freeze up. I don’t know how to explain that I’m not ignoring them on purpose. I know it's still my responsibility for responding to them, but I don't know how to stop myself from freezing up.

Plus, I mentioned earlier that I have a younger sibling. They're five years younger than me, so they're capable of taking care of themselves, but I still feel like I shouldn’t leave them home alone with our mom. If our mom is in the hospital, and our dad is away at work, I worry about leaving them alone like that. When we drive our mom to the hospital, we don’t know if she’ll be there for five hours or three weeks. We don’t know if or when she’s coming back. I just feel so lost.

What should I do? Ideally, I’d like to wait to get a job until her health seems stable enough for her to be safe. On the other hand, I feel like I’m lacking job experience, and I want to have at least some experience under my belt, as I want to start applying for internships soon, and I’ve always been told that job experience will make you look like a more appealing candidate. **How do I explain to employers that, I swear I’m not lazy, but I just haven’t had the chance?** 

If I move out, I’ll be able to get a job without worrying about her getting sick, but if I leave home, I worry about what could happen when I’m gone. **Does it seem reasonable to keep holding off on moving out?** How do I make myself feel okay about moving out when I see one of my parents deteriorating right in front of me? I’m already in therapy, but **does anyone have advice for coping with something like this?** 

I’m sorry if this sounds a bit all over the place. I’m just really lost here. Any advice would help. If anyone has been in a similar situation, and would be willing to share their experience, it would help a lot. 

**TL;DR** \- I don’t have a job, as I live with a parent who is chronically ill, and high-risk for covid. I know I have to move out soon, but I’ve been putting it off to help at home. I feel like I’m freezing up when I try do anything involving moving out. I’m lost and I don’t know what to do.

Any advice on what to do or on how to cope with this would be appreciated."

I'm a rising Junior CS student and I wanted to know if right out of college, are there / is it feasible to think that there are Product/Project/Program Management roles for New Grads.

Previously I intended on starting off as a SWE and then eventually transitioning to some type of management role, but I realized that there's a lot of people who go to PM roles even without SWE experience.

Though I have fairly good coding skills and have internship experience in SWE, I think my talents in communication, leadership, analytics, and management far outshine my raw coding / SWE skills.

This is my take: If I get some more PM internship experience, then I'll be okay (in fact I'm co-oping as a PM intern this Fall and my plan is to something like that next summer). I know there are also APM (Associate Product Manager) programs, and I'd love to shoot for them too as they prepare you for the role - though I don't know much about them.

For context, I'm an incoming sophomore psych major and minoring in CS, but lately I've been considering shifting career paths towards CS. I've taken AP CSA in high school and took CS 125 last fall, so I'm pretty new to the field, but I've really enjoyed what I've seen so far. Still, it's a pretty big jump from clinical psych so I'd like to test the waters before taking the plunge.

Right now, I've considering either being a CA for CS 124 or doing an ATLAS internship through the College of LAS. On one hand, I should have a good enough grasp on CS 124 materials that I can be helpful, and it would be a good chance to get a better understanding of the topics covered in the class.   Still, I'm only minoring and I kind-of feel like I might not be as good in the position as somebody who's been doing it for longer and for more classes. I realize this is probably just a problem with self-confidence, but still. 

On the other hand, ATLAS internships are specifically to teach LAS students tech-based skills so they don't require any prior experience. Plus there's the chance of a more typical ""work"" environment that could be helpful for deciding if CS is really something I want to do with my life.  Some positions they have available are Software Development and Web Development, stuff that I think would typically be restricted to majors and people with existing portfolios but hell, no prior experience means no prior experience right?

I'm leaning towards the ATLAS internship but I'd really appreciate any advice, especially from other CAs or people who've done ATLAS in anything programming related. Sorry for the long post and good luck to everyone this year!"

I don't have many extracurriculars besides the startup, I literally spend every weekend and most nights working on it. Would this hurt or help me for grad school? (specifically targeting top CS masters such as Stanford, UC Berkeley, Princeton, etc).

Soon after graduation in 2019, I got the opportunity to work as an intern (on paper I am a consultant) at a multinational company that develops simulation software tools (CAE) for mechanical engineers. My role is in pre sales.

Basically I am paid well but I don't have a company email ID, I don't get regular perks like provident fund, health insurance, etc.

I have experience in multiple CAE tools, some coding skills for automation and scripting and a little exposure towards machine learning.

Due to the pandemic, the top management has frozen hiring, and so I am still a consultant after almost 2 years. Currently it does not look like they will recruit me as a full time employee soon.

Reasons I want to settle abroad-

1. Better work life - fixed working hours, paid overtime, weekends are generally off, vacation time. I have read that these apply more to Europe.
2. I always wanted to settle in a western country.
3. I want to get away from family and live on my own, for my personal growth.
4. For the western lifestyle, India is a bit conservative in that regard. 

My preferred locations to emigrate to are western / northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, US.

Does anyone know whether my experience as a consultant will be counted if I were to try for a job or a masters degree abroad? I feel like it may not be taken seriously by companies or universities, and I'll practically be applying as a fresher.

Also, if anyone could give some information on which countries have a greater demand for CAE engineers, or allow them to settle easily, that would be greatly appreciated. Just wanted to hear about your experiences and advise before I start with my research."

Thoughts ?,steve__81,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p2z0pw/compsci_degree_vs_it_degree_debating_between_the/,I’m debating between the two. A few people have suggested doing CompSci and then learning networking on the side. They say a CompSci background will open more doors in the future. One of my interests is cyber security(I know that’s a broad term). Apparently CompSci + learning networking is the best of both worlds vs just learning networking. What is everyone’s thoughts on this? I have to pick between these two degrees at college. They both offer paid internships.
p2z85t,15,2021-08-12,I feel like I'm always the one left out,throwawaygrad001,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/p2z85t/i_feel_like_im_always_the_one_left_out/,"I feel like I am always in situations where everyone around me becomes good friends makes plans without me. 

I graduated college 7 years ago and worked in 3 different workplaces since (grad school, summer internship, job). I worked with a lot of people around the same age as me. I would make it a point to talk to my coworkers, eat lunch with them/ask them go get lunch together, etc. I would sometimes invite them to do things outside of work but it would always fall through for one reason or another (they said were busy, plans don't ever actually solidify, etc) 

Then later on I will find out that my coworkers have been doing things together without me. They went to a BBQ one night at a coworkers house that I didn't know about. They went out for margaritas during their lunch break one day. They have a group chat. Some of them text each other frequently. The list can go on. 

The feeling of watching people meet and all become good friends with each other except you is hard to describe but that seems to be what always happens. It confuses the hell out of me to be honest. I don't know what I am doing wrong. 

It's not even limited to real life. I've been apart of some online communities/discord servers for a while but I haven't made many real friends from them. But, having been apart of these communities for a few years I've seen plenty of new people come in and become best friends with others who travel to go visit each other irl or even start dating. I'll try to strike up conversations in DMs with people but we will either have a nice convo and then they'll never message me again or they are slow to respond/seem like they don't want to talk. 

I sometimes am afraid I come off as annoying when I approach someone to chat. But if I didn't then I would never talk to anyone. How are you supposed to make friends with someone if you don't talk to them?

For the record, I have a few friends from high school and a big friend group from college I am still close with. But we are scattered between different states so I don't get to see them that often. I feel like I haven't been able to make any friends after college, at least friends that stick around for more than a year."
p304a8,826,2021-08-12,We tried to stop the humans.,[deleted],HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/p304a8/we_tried_to_stop_the_humans/,"Last visual recording of First Admiral Aferntal:

The footage kicked in and the dark room was lit up in a flickering artificial light. On the screen was a Lars, a red face creature that had similarly red protrusions coming out from the edges of her head like spines. Her eyes were completely red, but in a lighter shade, and she looked terrified by the way her spine like protrusions wobbled and in the way her hairless brow was raised. Her voice was shaken when she spoke.

“We were once a happy galaxy. We had shed our war-like tendencies in favour of peace and prosperity. Indeed the ‘Total Disarmament act’ had outlawed anything that’s sole purpose was to damage or kill”.

“We explored the far reaches of our galaxy, found other interplanetary communities and some still to venture towards the starts and taught them our pacifist ways. That is why when we reached system 26-8b, now remanded the sol system, we were appalled at what we had discovered”.

“Humans. The most self-destructive creatures of all time. We knew that they would be a hard species to convert to pacifism before we even saw them as we noticed their planet was a death world. We had just converted a death world to pacifist ways and we thought we could do that same here. But then a war broke out”.

“The humans call it ‘The Second World War’, we call it ‘The abomination”.

“We immediately broke off all attempts to contact them, they were far beyond our help, far too suspicious and paranoid. A few decades after the war we ventured back to Earth, even whilst the rest of the galaxy pleaded with us to not let the monsters out, but then we saw they had evolved into new barbarism”.

“A proxy war had broken out, they spied on each other, friend or foe for intelligence, betrayed and backstabbed each other as they threatened nuclear annihilation. We decided to leave them after we sampled their ‘culture’, if you could call it that, and saw their reaction to aliens and saw their reaction was shoot and kill”.

“There were many reactions to this. Even though we had created a paradise of pacifism some of us were keener to blow them up, destroy them in the exact way their moving pictures depicted. We rejected this, in their outermost asteroid field we set up impenetrable force felids. They couldn’t leave, no one could get in. We let asteroids leave and their probes too so that they didn’t suspect anything. Our hope was they would kill themselves and we wouldn’t have to worry. Actually using the force field was the worst-case scenario”.

“But they didn’t die. About ninety-five year’s after the abomination they started to set up permanent colonies on the fourth planet and within a century they were on the moons of the fifth and sixth planets”.

The First Admiral coughed up a bit of orange blood, which trickled down her front. She wiped it off her chin and began talking again

“We realised that they had nearly discovered FTL. They had advanced at unbelievable rates, far faster than any others before them. Their brains, it seemed, worked faster than the average sentient, this intern, lowered their life expectancy and their sleep times were amazingly long as the planet went for an intelligence over strength evolution”.

“Their first working FTL ship hit our force field and exploded. We all shrank back at this. They had launched a ship to the stars, asking what was out there, and the stars yelled back no. The humans didn’t do much else. They just stopped. Or so it seemed”.

“For the first time in a thousand years, we began military preparation, the entire galaxy. I was among those who joined. We hoped to talk them down with overwhelming size. But that wasn’t how it happened”.

“We were sat outside the force field, waiting, when more probes, more than ever before were sent out. We let them out, we had no reason to not, and waited even longer”.

“Psychological warfare they called it. They had a name for war to make your opponent mentally exhausted. Then their fleet came”.

“Impossible numbers at impossible sizes, they had expanded so fast, it was impossible to see how back then. Later we found out they always knew we were there. Their probes scanned us, the tech was so backwards we didn’t even see it coming, and they built their ships from what they saw of us”.

“They shot at the force field with a volley, unlike anything we had seen before. Then the force field broke. Overloaded by firepower. I am ashamed of what we did next. We started to shoot at them. Were we frightened? Definitely , but the humans didn’t fire at us when the force field dropped”.

She coughed up the orange blood again and the video started to fail, the ceiling spat sparks at the floor and over her body.

“The war, the horrible war began afterwards, the humans won the battle we began and the pushed. We tried to communicate our surrender but they spoke differently than we did. We could understand their writing but they couldn’t comprehend ours as we talked through releasing gasses, they made the air dance for them. So the war went on”.

“Battle after battle they won we lost. We had one thousand years of peace and they had two thousand years of war. They could fight. We could not. My ship was destroyed after the battle for the homeworld. They’ve glassed our planet, all the people there are dead like so many other worlds”.

A silent tear streamed down her eye. She was choking now, gasping for air. The sparks remorselessly spat down on her as if disgusted and she died. Not long after the recording itself failed. It was sent out alongside the emergency transmission.

On the other side of the galaxy, they watched horrified. Already they were removing logos and flags of association so when the humans came they would stop and see they had met the border. But now they knew, the humans wouldn’t stop, and they couldn’t stop them…"

I'm a mechanical engineer who has decided to change his industry just recently. I've started watching beginner tutorial videos of MySQL and Java for now and applied for an internship position for a company and let me post the job ad for you guys to have a better idea:

Requirements:

Grade 12 or equivalent certificate essential

In the process of obtaining, or recently obtained, a relevant postgraduate qualification

Working knowledge of a suitable programming language (Java, Scala, JavaScript)

Mobile and/or web development will be advantageous

MySQL (or experience with SQL), database design and best development practices required

GIT (or similar revision control) will be advantageous

Competencies:

Strong analytical and problem-solving skills

Attention to detail

Deadline-driven and able to work under pressure

Able to take initiative

Strong communication skills (verbal and written)

Duties:

Analyse and identify programming solutions for clients

Design and develop new software applications using best practice methods

Create and facilitate suitable testing methods for existing software solutions

Modify and improve existing software systems for optimal efficiency and effectiveness

Perform bug-fixing

Draw up relevant help files and user manuals for programs

Provide technical support on programs created

Conduct ongoing research and self-study to keep up to date with new methodologies

So they know that I'm new to this industry and don't know much about anything as I specified in my e-mail but the HR manager ensured me that one FE dev and one BE dev will be in the interview for the technical view. So my question is what might they ask me? My knowledge is quite limited so I guess my priority should be impressing them in a way that I'm very keen on learning but they still might ask me some basic technical questions. What those things might be? Is there anything super important I should definitely check before the interview? Thank you!"

New to this whole reddit thing, don't really use the platform much but I thought I'd give it a shot. A little background I'm going into my 7th semester at college as a Software Engineering major (financial difficulties caused me to have to take a break) and I got 3 more semesters left till I graduate in spring 22, so I will have done 5 years total. I have passed all my classes with mostly C's and B's, so I'm no genius but I'm not really failing either. I'm taking college at a slower pace but I'm fine with that, and I've been taking classes over the summers to stay relatively on pace. My problem is I'm surrounded by people so much smarter then me in my degree and field and I have yet to have an internship as I have been taking classes in the summer. The lack of experience and the way all my smarter buddies in my classes understand the material so much quicker then I, makes me feel like I don't know what the hell I'm doing. One of my friends assures me I'm fine, and that I'm suffering from imposter syndrome. Has anyone else felt like this or am I just not cut out for Software engineering?"

**When do/did Amazon apps open?**

This is only a rough estimate, but from my records, in 2021 the normal Amazon SDE internship opened on 5/17/21, and the AWS internship opened around 6/25/21.

**Should I apply to Amazon now or wait until I have more projects/etc. for my resume?**

Now. It's always better to be earlier for rolling applications (make sure to update your resume, list things you're planning to do, but be prepared to have good answers if asked during the behavioral part). Applying later increases your chance of being waitlisted, though there were people who got offers in the spring.

**Why intern at Amazon?**

Name brand on resume, high pay (\~$8500/month + housing), opens doors for future internships/new grad opportunities, Seattle in summer, FAANG

**AWS vs Amazon?**

From what I've heard, the workload interning at AWS is higher, but I also know many people who've interned at AWS and have said that they had a good experience and learned a lot.

**Is it too late to apply to Amazon?**

No--last year people were still receiving offers up until spring (don't rely on this though)

**Amazon sends OAs to everyone?**

No. (source: me from last year ;-;)

**What is the internship process like?**

After submitting your app, in 2-20 days you will receive either a 3 or 2-part OA, with each part sent approximately 24 hours after completing the previous OA.

**What happens in the OAs?**

The 3-part OA starts with a 20min debugging assignment with 7 questions in either C++ or Java. Your task is to find the bug in the code in order for it to compile correctly and pass the test cases.

OA 2 is a 70min coding challenge with 2 Leetcode-style questions (use C++, Java, *OR Python*), usually easy-medium level. Fairly straightforward, just try to pass as many test cases as you can.

OA 3 is a 2hr (though it shouldn't take that long) multiple choice ""work simulation"", where you are given a series of situations and have to select the action that you would take, or suggest a better implementation/give debugging assistance.

The 2-part OA is the same as the 3-part OA, minus the debugging section. I've also heard that 2-part coding challenge is through hackerrank.

**And after that?**

After submitting the 3 OAs, you will either be rejected or invited to schedule a virtual onsite interview. This virtual onsite typically involves 2-3 behavioral questions based on Amazon's Leadership Principles, as well as 1-2 leetcode-style questions.

After the interview, your portal will potentially update with a new location. This pretty much indicates that you will receive an offer, with the official offer letter sent a day or two after the portal update--congratulations!

**How many test cases is enough?????**

Nobody knows for sure, though it seems like in terms of importance, OA 3 &gt; OA 2 &gt;&gt; OA 1 (OA2 &gt; OA1 for 2-part OA).

\*\*Anecdotally, people from this sub have gotten 7/7 and 2/2 on OA 1+2 but were rejected after OA 3, but others have passed with 4/7 and 1/2 on OA 1+2\*\*

**Change location for Amazon internship?**

Unfortunately, no.

However I have been thinking my next job should be me being an intern again. I don't have much confidence, and I will feel more comfortable with interviews if the bar is set low and I can prove myself, because I don't have much to speak about even though I know I can do the job.  


But with my knowledge and experience, it's very small...only 5 years at one company. I don't remember much vocab from college, and I am don't really know how much theory I remember. I don't know many programming languages or libraries. I don't have any idea what side projects to work on and Hacker Rank only gets me to learn some basics. As far as open source, they are either in a language I don't know and/or the ones I find interesting are too complicated, and for most I just don't find it interesting at all, and I have no idea what I could do to help or even begin. To be honest, I enjoy programming and programming as a job, but not enough to spend most of my free time on it. I maybe do something programming related outside of work a few times a month.  


So I don't see myself really landing a job, but I can see myself getting an internship to brush up on things, and then moving up to junior developer and then developer after proving myself, and I would like to make that clear to employers too before they give me an offer. I will like to do this for any job I do, potentially for the rest of my life, because I am not looking to do any leadership role because I don't have the confidence or social skills to become a leader or manager...or the confidence to pass an interview above Intern (or maybe Junior Developer at most)."

I'm pretty unprepared this application cycle (only like 10 leetcodes done and a pretty busy schedule so I don't think I will be able to do that much more September) and, as a result, I do not think I will be able to get an internship this summer with such little prep. 

Will it be tough to get a FG/HFT internship the next summer in the case where I do not get any internship this summer? Will I still be able to get OAs/Interviews?

Would doing 1 year of research make up for my lack of an internship? Or, alternatively, doing a summer internship at a small startup/rsu?

p3euhi,275,2021-08-12,Roblox completely wasting interns’ time. Tread carefully.,xmzxmzxmz,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/p3euhi/roblox_completely_wasting_interns_time_tread/,"**Disclaimer:** I don’t work for Roblox. Everything in this post is backed by evidence, but I’m excluding it to protect the people who brought up these concerns.

I don’t think it’s fair to treat people this way and to expect your reputation to remain untarnished. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who was considering applying to Roblox. I'm now unsure.

Roblox is only offering half of interns a return offer despite a more than 90% manager approval rate. Multiple interns have been told that despite their great performance this summer, they might not receive a full-time offer due to headcount. Some managers have expressed that the return offer rate is 50%, telling their interns not to be discouraged or sad that they didn’t receive a return offer. As it turns out, this was quite common.

**Multiple managers reply they have no idea about the return offer process more than halfway through the internship**

About halfway through the internship, several people asked their managers what the process would look like if they wanted to return to Roblox. A common response was, “Keep up the good work! You’re doing great!” and nothing more (paraphrased). At least one manager even responded they have no idea what the return offer process looks like.

Question: Intern managers are supposed to receive training. There are supposed to be resources with answers to these kinds of questions. I would think the return offer process is something an intern manager should be very familiar with. It seems like this would immediately stand out as a common question to be answered in some kind of FAQ. Were these intern managers actually unfamiliar with the process, or were they trying to avoid the question because they knew it would be difficult to offer a return offer? Both cases are bad.

**Return offer review isn’t even done by your manager**

VPs receive a packet with manager feedback and code review details, after which the VP makes the final decision. Why is someone completely separated from the intern’s work making this crucial decision? To provide a point of comparison, the calibration process at Facebook involves multiple intern managers discussing their interns’ performance together so they’re able to come to a fair and unbiased conclusion on each of their intern’s performance. In the case of Facebook, your intern manager is still the one who makes the decision about your return offer. In Roblox’s case, it’s some random person who may not even know you making the decision.

Question: Why?

**Managers offer to help their interns find other teams with headcount**

Several managers express how sorry they are. Despite amazing feedback, they can’t offer their interns return offers because of headcount. Several managers offer to help their interns find different teams with headcount, to no avail.

Question: Why not assign interns to teams that will have new grad headcount? What several other peer companies do is hire new grads “unassigned” then assign them a team when it gets closer to their start date. Why doesn’t Roblox do this?

**Apparently, the return offer yield rate is 100%**

Multiple people’s managers ask if they would for sure be committed to Roblox despite the internship being more than 3 weeks away from ending. Someone asks and discovers the yield rate is supposedly 100%. However, multiple people also question this number, as they know people who turned down Roblox’s return offer.

Question: Why does yield rate matter?

**University recruiting and intern managers offer conflicting information**

Several interns express their concerns based on information they heard from their manager (about the content in this post) to university recruiting, after which university recruiting responds with conflicting information.

I think it’s okay to hire interns without the intention of hiring them back if and only if you make this clear to them before they accept their offer. For example, I’m sure no Netflix intern expects to receive a return offer. However, if you don’t provide a disclaimer, there’s an expectation that the reason the company is hiring an intern is to invest in their new grad recruiting pipeline with the intention of providing a return offer to interns that perform at a qualifying level. In this case, there is a huge difference between manager approval rates and return offer rates, and this was not made clear to interns before they signed their offers, which in my mind, is completely wasting many people’s time. 

Some managers expressed the primary reason they can’t offer a return offer is because the company doesn’t have the resources to mentor so many new grads, but then why hire so many interns in the first place? Roblox should make this aspect of their internship program clear.

Additionally: Talking to your peers at work is important. Think about when you’ve had a negative experience with your team/manager, for example. Talking to others with positive experiences can help you understand your situation is probably an outlier. On the other hand, consider if you had an extremely positive experience but you see a significant percentage of your peers had this kind of negative experience. It can really influence your decision. So, if there are recruiters reading this, I hope you don't get angry at any of the people in this post, if you can identify them. I actually don't know any of their identities anyways. Everybody is trying to make the best decision for their career, and often it's best to talk to other people in your shoes to be able to make the most informed decision."

I’m planning to get an internship for summer 2022 and I still feel like a beginner. If I get an internship at that time, I would be graduating around May 2023. I might end up getting one of those unpaid internship if remote if I’m desperate. I’m kind of scared that I might not even get one even if it’s unpaid. I just started going back to college for computer science and I was one of the top students in my first programming class which is intro to Java last spring semester but this imposter syndrome is getting to me. I think I have asperger syndrome too so I don’t really like talking a lot and I don’t like saying big fancy words to look good in interviews.

 I have a bachelors degree in accounting but I realized I didn’t like the major when I was a senior. Now, I’m going back for computer science for another bachelor’s degree because my sister, who is a developer, wants me to go back for that degree. I started learning programming again around June 2020 in Udemy and coding exercises because I did do some Java programming in senior high school which we made gaming projects and I actually enjoyed them but I had imposter syndrome so I went for accounting first.

Now, I’m just like thinking if I should do this because I’m worrying about my student loan and what if I can’t get an internship while I finished all the required classes. I won’t be graduating because an internship is required to graduate. I can’t say this to my sister because I feel like I would disappoint her. I also hear that computer science is really competitive. I’m so lost of myself. Sorry this is a rant and I don’t expect any solutions."
p3fsng,2,2021-08-12,Split focus in extracurriculars?,throwra_5389,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p3fsng/split_focus_in_extracurriculars/,"Hi everyone! I'm a rising senior aiming for T20 universities, and so far most of my extracurriculars are either biology-related or political science-related. 

**Biology extracurriculars:**

Two-week medical immersion summer camp

Stanford three month protein research internship (around 10 hours/week) \*with rec letter from structural biology professor

Editor of various online medical organizations

High school coursework has been very premed-focused: AP Bio (5), AP Chem (4), AP Calc BC (5), AP Latin (5), Kinesiology, Biotech (one-semester, intended), HAPI (intended), AP stats (intended), AP Psychology or non-AP Psychology

**Political science extracurriculars:**

Intern for rural New York political campaign (few hours/week)

Design manager of political org (around 6 hours/week, did last summer for some months)

Director of Policy and Research at educational advocacy org (barely any hours/week)

Former co-president of club focusing on empathetic civil discourse on politics (few hours/week, did for 1 year)

**Kind of political science related:**

Managing editor of student news site (15+ hours/week)

I'm not sure if colleges look down on this split focus, and I'm worried that focusing on two main areas instead of one will hurt my application. I'm also finalizing my senior year courses, and I am wondering if I should keep my course load bio-focused or take AP Government as well? I would be replacing AP Psych with AP Gov, and then replacing Civics (one semester elective) with Psychology (one semester elective). 

Also, in the ""why this college"" or ""why major"" supplemental essays in particular, is it better to focus on just bio or just political science? Or try to force some intersection, like talking about medical journalism for example, something I'm not necessarily super passionate about? 

I'm super undecided in my career plan and thus very undecided in my major: I'm interested in becoming a physician assistant, lawyer, bioengineer, some sort of tech worker (product manager, UX/UI design, etc.), or nonprofit worker (philanthropist at ACLU or something like that :D). I'm considering bio major with political science minor or vice versa, or a double major. I'm not sure if most colleges will allow students to easily double major and graduate in 4 years without extra work - does feasibility of double major just depend on the college?

My question is this: So far, I like what I study. I've gotten mostly distinction or high-credit marks in my units (at one of the top universities in my country). The content is interesting and engaging for me as a mathematically-inclined person. However, I am uncertain if Computer Science is for me.

I like what I learn and work on at university, but I don't feel passionate about coding my own projects during my free time. This has gotten me concerned on if I'll be able to thrive in the workplace environment or if computer science is really for me. I can't help comparing myself to programming-nerds who code during their free time.

I'm still applying for all types of internships ranging from data analytics to software development (hopefully getting one this summer - I live in Australia), but I keep worrying that my lack of side-hustles will pull me back in the industry in the long term. I have other hobbies/interests and I want coding to be part of my professional life, not a 24/7-commitment.

I've considered keeping my data science major and changing computer science to something like statistics or financial math/stats or business analytics. On the other hand, I've considered keeping it, but also doing a 1-2 year postgrad in something more business-related after my bachelor degree.

So should I reconsider or not?"

Since June I have been working in company A, which is a 3 yrs old startup still growing, and had accepted the return offer.

However due to a visa problem I am still remained as internship, and recently I got an offer from another company, which is an agency(vendor) from Europe which opened a branch in HK. It's smaller and they offered me slightly lower salary, but **suggested me they will teach me a lot** and I can take the junior title not that long after, with many projects experience since it's a vendor.

I was giving my mind to **company B** because of:

1. the proximity
2. (presumably) more diverse experience I can get,
3. and most importantly the language used daily in the office, because I'm not a local HKer and in local-based company **cantonese is prevalently used for conversation, except for Work-related Online communication such as Slack, Mail**. I am the only foreigner in company A. In contrast, company B uses English more because there are number of foreigners there.

However, what **bugs** **me** to settle my mind on **company B** is:

1. Using PHP a lot, even though it's modern PHP 7\~8 with frameworks, I'm worried PHP will be even less popular in future.
   1. Also, HK's big firms/banks uses JAVA a lot, and Startups uses Node. Some knowledges may be tranferable but not 100%.
2. Of course, higher salary to start my career.
3. Being a vendor means I might learn shallow knowledges for many frameworks/languages.

Below is the detailed comparison:

|Company|A|B|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nature of Work|In-house (MedicalTech)|Vendor|

I don't feel overwhelmed with the course content so far, and I have done some learning outside of class as well and I really enjoy it.

The only big stressor I am facing is where to start with finding an internship for Summer 2022. I don't have any personal projects (I have a buggy, unfinished JS game for a class using P5JS), I haven't taken DSA yet (starts in about a week), and I just looked at leetcode for the first time like 30 minutes ago.

I want to do what it takes to secure an internship, but it feels like the timing of everything with changing majors and having to slowly learn what this industry is all about on my own is discouraging and it feels impossible at this point. I feel pretty confident in Java and C/C++ and alongside my summer coursework (I had to take summer classes to catch up so this also distracted me from internship preparation) I started a Udemy web dev course but I still have a lot to go on it and basically only got through HTML so far.

What are my options at this point? I am going to have a 16 credit semester starting in a week and I really don't have much of anything under my belt right now. I'm not asking for a high-paying internship at a huge company, I will almost take anything to be honest, but it feels like I don't even have the bare minimum for any company at all.

p3olya,24,2021-08-13,Something Bit My Boyfriend - and I’m sorry to say it wasn’t me. (Pt.1),xXKikitoXx,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p3olya/something_bit_my_boyfriend_and_im_sorry_to_say_it/,"Some months ago my then boyfriend and I were walking home from our local grocery store. Our apartment was fairly close by and we lived in a good neighbourhood. Nothing bad or unusual had ever happened. The walk itself was about two blocks and took us past part of a large park. At the time it wasn’t exactly late at night, but it was dark and raining softly. There were many shallow puddles and very few people in the street.

I was carrying an umbrella in one hand and an old white plastic shopping bag with handles in the other. My boyfriend was on my left, walking between myself and the street, so that I was walking with the park on my right. He was carrying three shopping bags, two in one hand, one in the other, and making near constant remarks about how consumer marketing conspiracies had lead us to this moment. 

You see, we had only intended on buying a singular carton of milk and instead had come out with four bags of shopping and a useless umbrella. Every comment my boyfriend made was hilarious, I was laughing so hard I could hardly hold the umbrella upright and was staggering along like a drunken despite being completely sober. This of course gave him more fuel for jokes. With the most mischievous grin he turned his jokes on me, “Are you alright miss? Should I call a cab? You seem to be having some trouble with coordination. Do you need to stop for a break? I know it can be a real *struggle* to walk down flat even surfaces sometimes.” He teased mercilessly. 

“Hey! This flat even surface happens to have an *excessive* amount of water on it, that adds +10 difficulty thank you very much.” I retorted as I gradually slowed to a stop. Truthfully I was so out of breath from laughing that I did indeed need a break to gather myself. My boyfriend turned to face me when I stopped but kept walking backwards with his arms outstretched in a ‘what are you doing back there?’ kind of expression. 

“We’re in the final leg of the race now, but oh no! Wait! Looks like Millicent has dropped out of the race! She instead seems to be standing completely still!” He switched to a commentator voice to taunt me.

“Are you done now?” I asked him in a the most disappointed tone I could manage. 

“Hold on, let me check my notes..” He mused and I half heartedly threw my umbrella in his general direction knowing I had no chance whatsoever of actually hitting him with the distance between us. 

“That’s not even funny.”  I told him as a matter of factly, then stalked forward to reclaim my umbrella.

However as I moved forward I caught a glimpse of something large moving in the bushes near my boyfriend. It was only the briefest glance and the smallest movement, but I was sure there was something not more than a few feet away from him and with every step back he took he was getting closer to it. 

“Jason.” I said firmly with concern. 

He must have realised from my tone of voice that something was wrong because he stopped moving, the jest in his demeanour vanished and he focused his attention on me. I’m sure at that point he thought that I was the one in danger, “There’s something in the park, come back this way.” I told him. Now he looked skeptical, I could tell he thought I was trying to play a joke on him in return for all his tormenting, “I’m not joking. Please come back this way.” I repeated a little more urgently beaconing him to come back over to me. 

He rolled his eyes at me and began to plod begrudgingly back towards me. While he moved I kept my eyes fixed on the spot where I thought I had seen the movement. The dark leaves there were motionless. It was as if nature was holding it’s breath. The trees and bushes closest to the road glistened under the street lights, insects fell silent. Even the light rain seemed to dissipate in the tense atmosphere leaving us standing in damp silence on a near empty street beside the ominous mass that was the park. 

I opened my mouth to tell Jason to hurry, since he still very clearly thought I was joking and was taking his time. Then it happened. In a fraction of a second the thing leapt from the bushes and landed on my boyfriend. He fell with a heavy thud, loose groceries scattered in every direction and I heard him yell out in alarm. The creature itself was human enough in shape that I thought it was a homeless person. It was large in stature but skinny, pale and unclothed. 

It bit savagely into Jason’s forearm, shaking it’s head violently to tear off a good sized chunk of flesh. Blood splattered onto the concrete, everything was happening so fast and in the confusion I became less confident that this was a man at all. I could see the glistening teeth of a predator and the fur of an animal. While at the same time, it’s back looked like the back of a human and it held onto Jason’s arm with opposable thumbs.

To be entirely truthful, I must have stood in complete shock for 3 to 5 seconds as I took in everything, none of it’s features made sense. I had never seen anything like it in my life before. When I came to my senses I ran to Jason to try and pull this thing off him. What I ended up doing was kind of shoving it away with my shoulder, I wasn’t a small girl at the time, so the force of my impact was enough to push it away from him. 

It recoiled with a snarl and when it turned to me I saw it’s eyes were a glowing bright green colour. For a long moment it stared me down as if it had previously been completely unaware of me and was surprised to see me. I noticed then that there was a kind of residue on my shoulder from the impact, a clump of wet skin mixed with long bits of hair/fur clung to the fabric of my jacket. Seeing that made me gag and I brushed the stuff off rapidly.

As I was distracted the creature must have tensed up ready to launch itself at me because when I looked back it was in a crouched position ready to pounce. I really thought we were both going to die at that point, then I heard a gunshot go off. I screamed and ducked down beside my boyfriend while the creature made a quick exit back the way it had come. 

“Are you two alright there? I saw that bear come out the trees and attack!” A man with a heavy Texas drawl and stereotyped hat approached us, gun still in hand. 

It took me a moment to connect the pieces. I thanked him briefly but probably not as much as I should have. My attention then was on my boyfriend, he was bleeding so much that even with all the water on the road diluting it I could still very distinctly see red blood trickling into the storm grate. I called emergency services and they arrived within a few minutes. My boyfriend was taken to the hospital in a serious but stable condition. 

He was operated on for almost 6 hours and required 113 stitches overall. We both made statements to authorities, I ended up being able to deliver a muffin basket to the kind man who helped us and all seemed well. Jason was given antibiotics to keep potential infections away, he lost the ability to close his right hand due to injuries and doctors weren’t  very precise on whether or not mobility would return. 

Doctors told us the injuries were consistent with an animal attack, though they couldn’t specify exactly what kind of animal. They took samples of saliva and fur for analysis with the expectation that results would likely come within the week. From there I didn’t expect anything further. Sometimes, bad things just happen in life and all you can do is move on. Unfortunately, this wasn’t one of those times. 

In the days following the attack some strange things began to happen. Jason’s condition began to deteriorate, he disliked bright lights and would cough so violently that I thought he was going to cough up a lung. When changing his bandages they were always soaked in foul smelling liquid separated only by dark bloody patches. I washed his wounds gently and carefully, but they didn’t improve. 

For days more Jason seemed to agonise, the infection spread, dark veins now ran up the length of his arm. When the tips of these veins reached his throat things really took a turn. He was constantly hungry and thirsty. I would bring him food but he would scream at me for trying to starve him. It didn’t make sense. He writhed in agony, groaning or sometimes growling. He complained that his fingernails hurt and that his teeth quote, *“Felt itchy”*.  

I tried to convince him to go back to the doctors for advice but he didn’t want to. I called them in private anyway to see if the test results had come back in, but as soon as I mentioned who I was and what the symptoms were, they hung up on me. In fact, they didn’t answer another call of mine again. I tried a different office, very similar results. In desperation I turned to the internet for help, however when I specified the symptoms Google must have thought I was joking because I kept being directed to occult websites.

On the 10th day of my boyfriend’s illness one of the darkened veins reached the corner of his eye and almost immediately the whole thing seemed to become bloodshot. It was horrible to watch him in this state withering away. I begged him to go to see someone, but he still refused, he was afraid someone would take him away into a quarantine facility in the middle of no where never to be seen again. That notion was curtesy of his mother I’m sure. I didn’t know what I could do for him anymore. 

The 12th day I woke up in the middle of the night to clattering from downstairs. Jason wasn’t in bed beside me so I assumed it was him and groggily got up to go help him. When I found him he was eating raw chicken from the fridge. I had put a whole plucked bird in there for a roast, but he had torn the plastic off it and was shoving it into his face. Around him the kitchen was destroyed. The fridge door hung off it’s hinges, tins of coffee, beans, and pretty much anything else that had been in a container was strewn about. 

Completely dumbfounded I asked him what on earth he was doing. He paused in his chewing to slowly look up at me, his eyes were completely bloodshot and bright green, there was no spark of recognition in them. He didn’t even answer me. Instead he just gave a low, long growl from deep in his throat. I wasn’t even aware that humans could make that kind of sound. The way it reverberated through my bones was truely chilling.

I don’t know what came over me, I don’t have children but I put on a ‘mom’ voice and commanded that he stop, “Put that chicken down and clean up the mess.” I told him in no uncertain terms. For a long moment he continued to stare daggers at me, I briefly wondered if he was going to attack me. “Now.” I added the single word in a firm tone. Immediately he whimpered and began to cry, and I mean, really cry. It was heart breaking. He dropped the chicken and sank to the floor in a sobbing mess.

When I went to comfort him he cried harder, “I’m sorry.. I- don’t know what’s wrong with me, I wanted to eat you just then. I’m sorry..” He choked out.
I didn’t know what to say to that I couldn’t even really process what he had said. Is there a specific thing you’re meant to say when someone tells you something like that? I think it was my silence that drove him to what he did next.

He fled the house. It was dead of night, cold, dark and he just got up then ran straight out the front door. I chased after him as far as I could but he was so fast and I wasn’t very fit. I went home.. Eventually I fell asleep from exhaustion and guilty relief, in those days of illness he was scaring me. So I was a little bit glad that he was gone.. I hadn’t signed up for this kind of thing. That was the lowest point we reached.. 

However, when I woke up the following morning, he was in bed beside me and, strangely, he looked healthier. His fever had broken, the dark veins were retreating and he had more energy already. His eyes were no longer bloodshot, though they looked greener than they had ever been, and by some miracle he was regaining use of his hand.  We had a phone call come in that day but we didn’t answer it because it just didn’t matter. He was better, neither him nor I cared about anything else. On the news that night there was a story breaking about a homeless man who had been mauled, but we paid it no mind.

In the following days his condition improved further. His previously rancid injuries healed in a matter of hours. Only the faintest scars were left. In truth Jason looked good, really good. Before his illness he, like myself, was a little chubby. After the illness he was quite muscular. I expected that he would lose weight, he had barely been eating or moving, so that seemed logical. But to seem to gain muscle, that confused me. 

Weeks passed. Life returned to normal. Better than normal. My boyfriend was so much more confident now. He started to work out, got a promotion and was much more affectionate. In response to his success I felt a little insecure.  I felt like maybe I wasn’t good enough for ‘new Jason’. This was actually what prompted me to take the steps necessary to better my own health and before long we were almost completely different people. Life was good. He even proposed (I said yes). 

Then one day, shortly after Jason left for work, a lady showed up on my doorstep. She was holding a cream folder, wearing a business suit, glasses and had tightly pinned back hair. At first I eyed her suspiciously, I wasn’t very good at turning away door-to-door sales people and was already trying to think of an excuse as to why I couldn’t stand and listen to her pitch.
“Hi. Is Jason home?” She asked curly. 

Taken a back I stammered out that he wasn’t home and, who exactly was she? When I said he wasn’t home she seemed relieved and introduced herself, “I’m Everest Green, head of DNA research at *’x’* faculty. I handled the testing for the samples obtained form Jason’s wounds. May I come in? I have been trying to call for weeks.” She said in a matter of fact tone. I instantly felt guilty. 

Sometime after Jason had recovered I admitted to him that I had tried to call the hospital for help despite him telling me not to, and that they had outrightly refused my calls. Hearing this he was, thankfully, more angry with the hospital than he was with me, and we had decided together to disconnect the phone line. If they didn’t want to help me when I needed their help, we didn’t care what they had to say. 

Hesitantly I invited her in and she placed her folder our on the coffee table, “Can I get you a coffee or anything?” I asked to be friendly. 
She declined my offer and insisted that I sat down, the matter at hand was urgent. I didn’t understand how it could be *‘urgent’* now, but that it was never urgent before when we needed someone’s help and no one would help us. 

“What is it?” I asked folding my arms casually, and declining her suggestion that I sit. 

For a moment she stalled, then spoke nervously, “We have gotten the results for the saliva found in Jason’s wounds, we had to run it several times to be sure..” She began and I paid a little more attention, “It didn’t match any known samples. Nothing. We ran it four times just to be sure, we were almost convinced that an intern had contaminated the samples with something.. But I don’t think that is the case. Our change of custody was clean..” She continued though now hesitated. 
“Okay, so what did it come back as?” I asked both curious and impatient. 

“Have you seen the news recently?” She asked instead, completely ignoring my question and redirecting the conversation. 

“No. Why.” I answered more bluntly. Both Jason and I had stopped watching the news sometime ago. We made a collective household decision that it was just depressing dribble and repetitive so there was no point in watching it anymore. It was one of the many things we changed about our lifestyle when we decided to live better. We also go hiking and joined the gym. Was she going to interrogate me about my yoga classes too?

“People have been dying recently.. Homeless people mostly. They have been attacked by the same type of creature. I think your boyfriend was only the first.” She tried to engage me.

“So?” I asked in a dead ended manner, I didn’t like what she was implying.

“So.. Have you noticed any  strange behaviour from Jason lately?” She said tentatively.

“Not a thing. I think I’d like you to leave now.” I stated. Truthfully, some of Jason’s behaviour since recovering had been *different*, though I wouldn’t say ‘strange’. For example, occasionally I would wake up at night and he wouldn’t be home. When asked he would admit to being restless and going for a walk. Some of my friends thought he might be cheating now that he was far more attractive than he ever had been, but he’s just not the type for that and I trust him completely anyway. Additionally his diet changed, he now preferred all natural, minimally cooked meals. However the only strange part about that was his ability to consume raw eggs without dry heaving. 

“I think you should take a look at-“ she started to reach towards the folder she had brought but I interrupted her. 

“Listen, I don’t need to look at anything, and if you’re not going to get to any sort of point here, I don’t see why I should continue to entertain you. I’m sorry that whatever attacked my fiancé is attacking other people, but I really don’t care. Call animal control. I already gave my statement and have moved on with my life. No one wanted to help us when I called, so why should I help you locate this thing now? Please leave.” I said using my commanding tone. 

I could see the hope fade from her eyes and she straightened out her clothing, “Right, well. I’m very sorry to have bothered you, I’ll leave now. Just give me a call personally if you think of anything that might help the investigation.” She said awkwardly. I was perhaps a little too harsh, and definitely rude as I made no move to show her out. Instead just watched her leave with an ‘unimpressed’ expression to drive the point home. 

*** 
That evening I told Jason about our less than welcome visitor and he seemed a little odd. He wanted to know exactly what she had said, exactly what I had said. After I recounted my conversation with her he suddenly brought up that he wanted to move. As it turned out he had been keeping up with the news, and the stories of people being attacked by this thing meant that he no loner felt safe in the neighbourhood. 

Thinking about it I understood this completely. I don’t know why we didn’t think about moving sooner. We lived less than two blocks from the park he was attacked in, of course he would want to move! Dutifully I began making the arrangements to relocate. Finding a new place to live, contacting the necessary agencies, arranging moving trucks and so on. It took us just under a month to have everything ready and on the night before we were supposed to leave we decided to make one last run to the grocery store for old times sake.

Now, since his attack months prior, we never walked anywhere if it was dark, and always took the longer path around to avoid the park. This day was no exception. We left around midday and were on our way back by about 2pm. Jason was making his gawd awful jokes and I was holding onto his arm trying not to laugh myself to death when a man stepped into our way. 

I felt Jason tense up beside me and I looked over the man with suspicion. He was wearing along button up trench coat and custodian helmet, similar to an old style British police officer. My initial thought was that this guy was from a reenactment or, was seriously mentally ill. 
“Excuse us.” I said politely to not cause any hassle in case he was about to have an episode or something. 

The man completely ignored me. Instead his attention was squarely on Jason, “Millicent, I need you to go home. Follow through with our plans, I’ll come find you okay?” Jason whispered to me. 

“Why? Do you know this guy?” I asked dumbly.

“I’ll explain later. Please. Just go.” He told me sternly. Looking between my fiancé and this man I could tell there was about to be a punch up. Hesitantly I backed up to do as I was told and this is when I noticed two things. First was that the man before us was drawing a gun. The second was that Jason’s figure was writhing and starting to convulse. His form was changing, patches of course fur grew from the pores in his skin, his muscles bulged, his stature increased. And his face.. His face seemed to tear open giving way to a protrusion of teeth and slimy blood. 

I didn’t stay to watch his transformation complete, I heard gunshots and flew home on the wings of adrenaline. Once home I threw the remaining items we had yet to pack into bags and boxes. I called a cab and began packing our  essential belongings into it. Frantically I worked, I couldn’t make entire sense of what I had just seen and I didn’t really want to either.  On my third trip back into the house to grab more stuff I found myself at a dead standstill. 

My line of sight fell onto our coffee table. On it still sat the folder that the lady had left prior, I had never moved it, in fact I had forgotten it even existed as it was by this time covered in magazines. I felt dizzy looking at it, as if those pieces of paper within were poison leaking into the room. It occurred to me that what I had seen was probably related to this report and with mixed feelings I picked it up to read. 

Inside were several report papers, the first was an introductory letter stating the cause for testing and the subject being tested. The following was a charted table listing alleles and an extensive list of number-letter codes that meant nothing to me. Skimming through I read the third page, it stated the reasons for retesting and explained that the sample of Jason’s DNA provided for elimination purposes had ‘become contaminated’ as it seemed to change over the weeks. 
The conclusion of the testing stated that the unidentified sample was still undetermined, though elements of wolf, human, and bear DNA made up the highest percentages. It was resolved that the samples must have been cross contaminated at some point. However, in the back of the folder I realised there were more of the same tests. Though the names of other victims were different, the unidentified sample in each matched that of the creature that had attacked Jason.. However what was most concerning  was that markers present in Jason’s own DNA seemed to be present at some of the crime scenes. 

Slowly I closed the folder, I was dully aware of the implications of this, but I refused to voice them even in my own thoughts. Suddenly there was a knock on the door and I jumped violently. The cab driver was wondering what was taking so long, and made sure to inform me that he charged by overall travel time, not distance traveled. I apologised and quickly took the remaining bags of our clothes to the car. 

I had decided that any furniture left would just have to deal with itself because in my opinion the situation was now urgent and I doubted that we would be returning to this apartment. As the cab pulled away from my apartment I saw police and other emergency vehicles pass us. They were headed in the direction that Jason had been and black vans were pulling up out the front of our apartment. I subtly slid down in my seat, now we definitely weren’t going to be going back there. 

The driver dropped me off at a small hotel that only accepted cash payments. When Jason initially picked this place to meet ‘just in case’ I didn’t really understand why and I kind of thought it was one of his many, many, jokes. Now however, I understood very well and was glad that I chose to prioritise essential belongings over larger harder to carry items. As it stands now, I’m sitting in this crummy, gross little room with bags of belongings hanging around waiting for Jason to arrive. 

This is of course, assuming he hasn’t already been shot dead or been put into some animal control van (that’s a joke, by the way, and yes I know I’m not as funny as Jason is). Anyway. I’ll keep you updated.

She asked if I am certified for all four, and I said I yes and that I possessed the documents to prove (through the Certiport certification website). It had been a while since I had gotten those certifications (which I did mention), so my memory was a little hazy, and mistakenly I left it in my resume as an afterthought.

I decided to check the website that possessed my certs just to be sure, and I find I am only certified in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and IC3 GS4, but not Outlook. What happened was I almost did take the exam for the Outlook Certification in my IT class so I am somewhat proficient already, but I guess I never got a chance to because it was at the very end of the semester.

Should I mention this mistake first and foremost if I am considered for an interview, or should I only state my mistake if they happen to mention my certifications again? Thanks

Edit: Just called the recruiter and she said all is good and she appreciated the honesty! My advice is just be upfront with your mistakes so they don't catch up to you."

 Hi, here are 25 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning jobs. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
p3rkzr,0,2021-08-13,Tech/Business/Design Internships,userr37,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p3rkzr/techbusinessdesign_internships/,"I’ve had a couple internships doing software dev at a Big Four company and I am looking at internships for next summer. I am looking for a product manager sort of role where I can do tech work but combine it with business and design, so minimal or no coding may be involved. I’ve done some looking and it’s a bit hard to find something that fits what I’m looking for. Does anyone have any recommendations on what companies to look at for this kind of an internship? Thanks!"
p3skvn,1,2021-08-13,Got an interview for a Network internship. Nervous and need advice.,Doomhauer45,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p3skvn/got_an_interview_for_a_network_internship_nervous/,"After applying and being denied from countless places, I finally got an interview for my county's IT department for both their Networking Engineering or Network Operations student intern positions. Both offers require a 2 year commitment.

To start with, this will be my first interview for a job related to my major (CIS, InfoSec). The interview will be conducted over zoom and I have no idea what questions they're going to throw my way. What topics should I cover before hand so that I don't embarrass myself?

Secondly, is a 2 year internship typical as that seems a little long? Without knowing the details myself, would it be possible to leave before this time without looking bad? 

Interview is on the 18th."
p3tyxg,0,2021-08-13,How do I negotiate as a new grad with lots of experience?,Furball177,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p3tyxg/how_do_i_negotiate_as_a_new_grad_with_lots_of/,"Hi everyone! I just got a full-time return offer for a company i've been interning with, but I have no idea how to negotiate for a higher starting TC package. I'm definitely super grateful to have something in this time where lots of people are having a hard time looking for work but I can't help but feel like I could get a bit more. I have tons of experience that I think I can leverage relative to other new grads, but I have no idea how to go about doing it. One thing to mention is that I have no other competing offers as I do think I would want to take this job but obviously I could just tell the recruiter i'm interviewing elsewhere. Do you guys know how I could pitch it/what to say to the recruiter?  


For reference:

   Offer is \~140TC/yr in Seattle from what I can tell. I think all starting SWE's in Seattle at the company are assigned this initial starting package however, I've interned at the company for 2 summers now, and in total I've had 6 Internships. 3 at a large aerospace company doing software development / 1 at a national research lab doing software dev / 2 at this company doing software dev.  


  I definitely feel like all that internship experience should be worth something to leverage, esp since two of which have already been at this company.  


Thanks!"

p3vj0g,3,2021-08-13,Am I micromanaging?,brooklynwalker1019,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/p3vj0g/am_i_micromanaging/,"We recently hired an intern to work on a project. My boss kinda assigned me to support her. I’d like to know if I’m micromanaging. I have asked her for feedback, but all she says is “everything is good”. 

At the start, I could still she was struggling. The project my boss gave her was extremely broad in scope and could’ve been achieved in many ways. She wasn’t the most technical person. No problem. I gave her a direction. She was still struggling with the coding part. I coded something and gave it to her for her to expand. She was still struggling. No problem. I gave her exact steps of what should be done. Still struggling. I asked her what was the issue and took the coding part to finish it myself. I asked her to work on something else that wasn’t technical. At this point, I feel like the project is entirely based on my idea and I took the “creativity part” away from the intern. The code being 90% written by me. Every functionality was my idea. I did ask her for feedback and make sure to incorporate her ideas too. 

Now comes the hardware engineering part. She was really struggling as she was very green in hardware. I also took that part and fixed it. I made sure to walk her through the issues. 

So now the project is entirely my idea. I coded it. I did the hardware parts. I developed the thing because I chose to. She never asked me to code it for her etc. The reason why I didn’t leave her be was because her contract end date is closing in (2 weeks). I’d like her to see the end project before leaving. My boss also wanted me to “babysit” her.  She did do a decent job on other (non-technical) aspect of the job and proving me with engineering ideas etc. She was hired into a technical role. 

Anyways - am I micromanaging?"
p3w08r,0,2021-08-13,What if you enjoy coding but don't have an interest in anything in particular?,samentha_gracilis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p3w08r/what_if_you_enjoy_coding_but_dont_have_an/,"I got my B.S. in computer science a few months ago. I won't be getting an M.S. for a while. I applied for maybe 100 jobs this year and got 1 interview. Someone said it's because my resume is bad. The main way to improve it is to add projects that show that I have a decent amount of interest/knowledge in a particular area, rather than several unfocused technologies and skimpy projects in random areas. 

But I lack passion about anything even after spending 4 years working towards my degree. Machine learning appears the easiest for me to do projects in since I've done a few very short ones and learned some of the mathematics behind it, but it's pretty much mandatory that you have an M.S. to even get an internship in that field. I have also done a large web development project with partners, and some smaller ones by myself but I struggle a lot with coming up ideas for that field. And aesthetics matter a lot, which I'm not keen on.

Any advice on how to choose a path so I can fill my GitHub and resume with focused projects?"
p3wcvj,65,2021-08-13,Hiring Practices Rant,Big_Boss_Bob_Ross,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p3wcvj/hiring_practices_rant/,"This is probably not like your average post. I have had very good fortune with jobs. I started working at a very large company 1 year into my degree and have been hired there with significant pay rises and job offers since. No, this refers to some of the people that get hired. 

I have seen multiple instances of people who genuinely have NO IDEA what the basic syntax is for software. Any language, any technique. We just hired a person who graduated with a degree in CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. This person told us they have never touched a line of code, yet they joined a purely software team thats quite advanced as a graduate. That blows my mind and really does a disservice to all the people that studied for that job just to have a fucking chemical engineer with no software background get chosen for the job. I dont mean to single this person out either, it just happens to be the most recent case. In my team alone we had an RF engineer who also barely ever touched code join the team. I can absolutely assure you that the amount of work we had to do, and still have to do to fix the shit he does far outweighs his benefits. 

It blows my mind and makes me so angry that we hire there people when the market has so many people graduating with at least some software knowledge. The quality of code and ability to add to discussions that these kinds of people provide is negligible at best, purely negative at worst. And dont mistake this rant for me blaming them for it. They havent been trained for this stuff and they are just working a job. Ugh. Maybe the people with a smidge of software knowledge just arent applying. I know my company does the deathly practice of having only HR hire people with no technical questions for interns, maybe its the same for grads."

p3xfis,1,2021-08-13,Rising Sophomore Leetcode,Fancy_Lingonberry_42,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/p3xfis/rising_sophomore_leetcode/,"I wanted to get people's input and opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a rising sophomore at a T10 school (T10 ranking but not a T10 CS school, think Duke, UChicago, Northwestern). I've been studying programming seriously for the past 6 months and doing Leetcode for the past month. I haven't done a discrete math or algorithms class (doing that this year). So far, I've solved about 40-50 easy's (with minimal help) and 10 mediums (half needed hints/answers) and 1 hard. They have sometime been optimal solution and sometimes in the 10-20 percent speed range.    


I feel like when I look at mediums I struggle to grasp the concepts without a hint. Meanwhile, I have friends in the same grade who can do mediums/hards and have made it to the end of Microsoft SWE internships. My aspiration is to make it to FAANG/Quant Trading firms.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering what people's opinions were on my progress? Will taking discrete math/algorithms help a lot in the leetcode grind or is my current standing indicative of where I will be? I don't feel like I would be competitive at any major tech company at my current level. I also need to decide soon whether I want to fully pursue computer science or choose to study finance/pursue IB (which I go to a target school for). 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or opinions/resources and guides would be helpful."

**Essays:**

**Schools:**  
I plan to apply to these schools so far: (this isn’t the ENTIRE list, just a snapshot). The issue is that I have around 25-30 colleges on my list and will need to narrow down. What are my chances into getting into some of these schools?

Safety:

I plan to apply EA to all schools if offered (unless it’s restricted EA). I have not chosen which school I want to apply ED too-- I’m just not sure honestly.

Are there any other schools that I might be a good match for? Or any schools that I should consider taking off my list? Thanks for any advice, all is appreciated!

**Budget:**  
I’m not entirely sure about budget at the moment. Calculating financial aid is complicated atm due to my parents being divorced, possible NCP waivers, etc. I am applying to Questbridge so that is also a possibility-- everything is up in the air right now and it’s hard to get a good estimate.

 Its not possible for me to sign up for a course cuz I'm already in school full time. As for YouTube I've been watching but they don't feel useful. Maybe I'm finding the wrong videos to watch ..? I'm in for internships if I sign up but Iam scared as I don't feel like I'm at the right level that will make an internship beneficial or impress to book a place for that matter. 

I think its important to add that I'm not failing any classes or tests and my gpa is good. I've considered leaving school but I need the structure it offers.

I am currently a first year, so I still have a good amount of time left. I really enjoy coding and have experience with Python from both CSE8A and my current internship. I also enjoy working with computers in general and know that a computer-related degree has way better job prospects than any finance-related degrees. On the contrary, I am pretty terrible at math and am probably not going to do very well in the 20 series. But overall I guess that’s kind of a summary of my thoughts about switching.

Any experiences or input would be greatly appreciated!! Also sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this

p42bas,2,2021-08-14,"Dietitians out-of-field who switched careers, what are you doing? And are you happy about that?",onehellofagirl,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/p42bas/dietitians_outoffield_who_switched_careers_what/,"Helloooo, I'm a 22-year-old female dietitian who graduated in Dec 2020 in Australia, for some context. Throughout my undergrad, I LOVED my degree and everything. Biochem is hard af but I find it challenging and fascinating honestly lol. Being a dietitian was all I could think of in high school, thinking that it'd be a thing that can help people to better their lives and all that, as a career.

But forever since my internship, I started losing my passion because it seems like people don't like my help when it comes to food (at least that's the case in the hospital), and there are so many stigmas around being a dietitian. Other than serious health conditions like renal, diabetes, cardiac failure etc... I don't find the job is taken seriously or is well respected in the workplace. Maybe because I was a student and I hadn't done an outstanding job in counselling? I remember the doctor backchatted my supervisor when we figured out the high potassium of the patient wasn't caused by the TPN, because we found out she was sipping on juices lol. The doctor insisted it was the TPN and so we couldn't do anything on our end about it, even though we knew the cause and context. I haven't had experiences in private practices, but I also don't have the interest to be in private considering I haven't yet honed in my skills in becoming a good dietitian (if I would ever be in it).

When I finished my food service placement, my supervisor, who's also a senior dietitian of the hospital, told me that if she could go back in time, she wouldn't have become a dietitian because of the tough job market.

The supervisor who's a great dietitian and retiring soon in my public health internship works 2 jobs herself, even though she's been in the field for like 20- 30 years. I followed my passion, got my accreditation, and felt utterly useless and defeated because of the career prospect. I don't expect to be earning 200k a year, but I need to be able to make a living to keep the roof over my head and afford basic needs.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Private is quite an unstable path with the business side of things.  
 
2. Hospital is certainly not a place where I can see myself being an awesome dietitian and happy because of the hierarchy.  
 
3. Community/ Public health isn't really my thing because I find it very exhausting to educate. I have done volunteering in projects that involve recipe development and I really hated that. The concept of healthy balanced eating is something that people seem to hate listening to because it's boring. There's just too much misinformation with nutrition out there, and I'm sick of it 😵‍💫  
 
4. Foodservice is the only thing I can imagine myself in if it's mostly projects, audits, etc. Does anyone work with food companies in the foodservice domain and finds it satisfying (workwise and financially)?  
 
5. A PhD is something I can't afford to do. It's something that I'd be doing on very little funding (it's half of the full-time minimum wage in Australia) and it's just delaying myself from facing my career options if I don't have a clear vision of what I can do with it.  
 

I haven't got a job or anything related to dietetics obviously, and sadly :(. Just some casual jobs to pay my bills. Graduated in the current world situation, I'm trying to take it one step at a time and figure out what is it that I can really do. I would really appreciate some advice on what sort of jobs/alternative careers that dietitians have ended up with that they are happy about. I'm happy to do a Master's in another field too :)!

TLDR: I graduated as a dietitian, LOVED my studies but found out I don't really want to be one, at least not in the clinical and community settings. Want some advice as to what career I can pursue with my degree, or with further studies that give me a stable path."

My sister owns a donut shop in a small, remote town; it opened about a year prior, and is a popular site locally.  Despite its local popularity, it has no website or mobile application for viewing the menu online or placing orders in advance.  My sister said she hasn’t hired anyone to make anything because it was too expensive.

So, being a CS student and having virtually no personal projects on my resume, I would like to create a website and mobile applications (iOS and Android) for her shop.  However, I feel like there are a lot of factors that I am overlooking/not considering.  

For example, I would first like to inquire about the costs that would be incurred while doing so, how I would keep customer data private, frameworks needed for the front end/backend, etc.  Basically, I would like to see if it’s even possible for me to do so lol.  Any and all advice will be appreciated!

Since I was in the 4th grade, I've wanted to be a programmer and I've devoted much of my free time to coding, so studying CS seems like the obvious choice. Due to my high grades/test scores, I have the option to apply to more prestigious (expensive) colleges and programs, but it only makes sense to do so if I can have a career in the field.

The problem is that I've been suffering from repetitive stress injury in my fingers for the last 2 years, which means I can't do much typing without pain. Going to doctors, OT, ergonomic equipment, and medications have not helped. I get my schoolwork done with an iPad, stylus, and voice to text, but trying to code is difficult, and keeping up with programming classes in school has been challenging. 

Basically, I don't know what to do. This summer, I've been doing a data science internship and trying to publish a paper, but the only way I've been able to do these things is by taking frequent multiday breaks and working limited hours, which I can't do in a real job. Most other STEM fields require using your hands as well, so I don't see much point in switching, but I also have no idea how I would handle working in tech, and I doubt anyone would hire me given how competitive the field is. I'd be stuck with no employment options (even if hired, I doubt I could keep up, and I'd probably get fired quickly) and fall into student debt, which really scares me. 

Maybe a product manager type role I could do with voice-to-text would be better? Though IDK if I can become a manager without experience or if I'd be good at it at all since I'm a technical person. I need to find some kind of position that does not require much typing.

I went to a no name undergrad school, got C in data structures, algorithms, discrete math, and other classes and got into fucking FAANG!! I have been practicing leetcode for few hours everyday for past 3 months and it really works guys as long as you are consistent! 


* Bio: Grad student at a state school, 1 IT internship experience and 1 SWE internship experience at unknown companies.

* Offer Details:

    * Salary: $9350 per month pre tax (NYC total income tax will be like 33% lmao)

    * Rent Stipend: $2425 per month after tax

    * Location: NYC




**I was not in US during interview process but this is the timeline in eastern time:**

Friday, July 16, 2:16AM - submitted application

Thursday, July 22, 4:09PM - got invited to 2 part OA (not 3 parts with debugging)

Monday, July 26, 5:42 AM - finished part 1 and part 2 of OA 

Friday, July 30, 2:52 AM - final interview scheduling invite

Wednesday, August 4, 2:19 PM - Another final interview scheduling invite lol

Thursday, August 5, 2:28 PM - final interview time confirmation

Monday, August 9, 4:00 PM - final interview

Wednesday, August 11, 3:00 PM - portal update to new location

Thursday, August 12, 2:38 PM - offer letter!


**Detailed explanation of interview process and prep:**

* Part 1 of OA was hacker rank coding assessment. I got full test cases for first problem, and half the test cases for second problem. In part 2 work simulation, I tried to answer every question using leadership principles. For example they repeatedly asked would I push the deadline to fully finish a project or would I finish the core parts by deadline. I always answered finish it by deadline because Amazon has notorious culture of tight deadlines.

* I got invited to schedule the interview on 7/30 and I selected the 8/2 monday and 8/3 tuesday timeslots. They didn't even confirm my interview selection and did not reply to me at all. After 8/3 passed, they finally got back to me on 8/4 wednesday and asked me to select new timeslots! 

* 2 years ago I made it to final round of amazon as well and I crammed like 50 most frequent Amazon questions on leetcode. They asked me an objected oriented design question which is so different from a normal leetcode algorithm question, I bombed it lol. Apparently the question they asked me was 70th most frequent amazon tagged question on leetcode so I almost got to it during my cram session 💀

* This year for prep I didn't do any Amazon tagged questions because I am also preparing for interviews with other companies. Past 3 months I did around 150 leetcode problems (mostly medium and some hard) in a depth first manner. Meaning I would do 10 two pointer questions, then 10 bfs questions, then 10 topological sort questions, etc. You want your brain to understand each pattern well and only focus on mastering that one pattern. Don't move back and forth between 20 different problem types. As bruce lee said, ""I fear a man who practiced one punch 100 times more than a man who practiced 100 different punches once. "" 

* My tip for doing leetcode: After doing a problem delete the whole code and code it again. Write down what mistake you made and what key thing you learned for each problem in a notebook. When you do a new leetcode problem, code it again from scratch the next day and one week from that day. Reviewing is probably more important than doing a new problem. 

* My tip for behavioral: Come up with 1-2 example per leadership principle and in your answer use STAR format. Also drop in some leadership principle words without making it obvious for example say ""I wanted to **satisfy the customer**"" or ""I took **ownership** of the project."" 

**My tips for coding interview:**

1. First ask questions to clarify everything like is there a null input, negative numbers, are we returning the length of an array or the actual array?, etc. 

2. Write down on the board or screen how you would do an example manually using pseudocode or plain english. 

3. Optimize pseudocode and explain time and space complexity.

4. Only at the very end, code your solution and test it using examples.

edit. 

**I forgot the most important coding interview tip: Communicate!! During the entire coding question round, talk slowly and clearly. Never be silent for more than few seconds. Let the interviewer know everything you are thinking. Even if you are writing ""x = x+1"" say it out loud and explain why you are adding 1 to x.**"

Background:

* 28M Asian Male
* Bsc Computer Science &amp; Math from a top 50 global university (in EU).
* Low GPA, B average so about a 3.0
* 750 on GMAT

Experience: 

* 16mo worth of engineering internships at FAANG during undergrad
* 2y at Google, 1y at Facebook as FT Software Engineer
* 3y at startup, one of first 5 employees but not technically co-founder. Did everything from major business decisions to hiring to writing most of our infrastructure code. Startup was acquired but not for that much, i.e. I could have made a lot more just working at FAANG.
* Some volunteer work teaching kids to program and giving career guidance to URM

Motivation:

* Want to build on my business knowledge so I can better run my next company. My technical expertise is good but definitely lacking in business fundamentals.
* Investors recommended I try for a top business school based on my goals. 
* Want to cofound my own company next time and join a VC on the side.

I've spoken to quite a few partners at VC firms, centi-millionaire or billionaire investors and they're nearly unanimously in agreement that I attend a top tier program or not at all. I know my profile is not competitive with HSW or even M7 but those are the schools I'm aiming for."

What should i do next if i want to get a job in game dev? I never did internship in my bachelor so will anybody even hire me? Should i move to ontario or something and join a game dev school where they teach unity and they will help me out with startup job after my bachelor?

My goal at the moment is to find an internship which would allow me to write my bachelor thesis at a company (you can do this here in Germany).

I can code some really basic things but that's far from what I need in order to get a job/internship.

I have a very basic knowledge in C++, JavaScript, HTML and SQL. Should I try to get better in any of these or learn a new one for an intership and a job afterwards? If I need another language which one should it be? I have about 4-5 months to achieve this. I would also be happy if anyone could recommend me a good book, preferably one with some kind of a project in it so that I could show my future employer that I already have experience in developing something.

Senior here just spiraling into a hole of dread and anxiety at having to job hunt with no internship experience due to circumstances like COVID and not so great excuses and only a few lame office work as ""professional experience"". Basically wasted this summer with no job, trying to keep up my mental health and not feeling the urge to off myself everyday so I couldn't keep my mind on finishing any side projects. The most I could do this summer that wasnt absolutely exhausting was do self teach myself and work on my hobbies, but those were kind of half assed too. I don't think grad school is an option for me either since I don't have any recs thanks to my anxiety keeping me from interacting with professors. I dont have a lot of connections and am not in a lot of clubs, so basically no friends. Feels kind of shitty as a low income first gen student whos parents had high hopes sending their kid to an ivy league and coming out with nothing to show for except ig a high gpa?? and suicidal to top it off. I can't afford therapy once I'm out of cornell and my parents won't acknowledge my depression, it just feels like there's no reason for me to be here at all. My stress just keeps building up and I'm losing sleep and my appetite.

I'm trying to be more active now, so I tried CAPS but my first session wasn't as useful as I had hoped and I'm trying to take baby steps going to the career center but reality sets in when I see peers doing so well on LinkedIn and job posts that ask for so much and realizing I can offer so little, I start spiraling again. I'm just SO GODDAMN tired even though I've done so little. Time and all my mistakes are finally catching up to me and I feel like there's nothing I can do about it but shrivel up and cry.

wondering if there's anyone out there in a similar situation, i just feel so alone, lost, and hopeless :( or any grads/info sci majors out there have advice? Sorry this is was probably a mess but I'm just so exhausted, overwhelmed, and no clue what to do with my life now and where to start when it feels like its about to end. Not the best post starting off the semester soon but I had to get this off my chest, it's been a summer.

EDIT: Thank you all for sharing your experiences and support, it really does mean the world to me especially right now and hopefully it helped others in similar situations feel not as alone as well. Thank you."

My resume is very light and my only work experience is retail. I was unable to have a summer internship like I planned. All I have to show on my resume is my degree which I know puts me at a major disadvantage with zero relevant experience. I have been looking for anything IT related that could get my foot in the door, but my main focus has been low requirement analyst positions as I want to avoid helpdesk if I can (but I will work a helpdesk job if I have to).


Anyway, I only just started applying for jobs and was just offered a position as a temp data analyst. The catch is it's contract and only three months, one of which is training(which I feel I could really benefit from). Would a short gig like this be beneficial enough to take or should I continue to look for more long term positions? It's a quite large and well known company but again, 3 months. Since I just started applying I'm not sure if I can do better so I am conflicted and don't want to miss a good opportunity to get some experience.

I have SEC+ and am looking at getting out of the military. I had quite a few questions about the career field that I'd like some advice on. 

First: Is CEH worth it? I am about to finish my associates and I was considering going for Certified Ethical Hacker. I am not sure if it would be worth paying for a bootcamp out of pocket while I am still in the military. Is the juice worth the squeeze and is it worth getting this before entering the career field? I know this is somewhat far down the cert progression tree, but I have had some in person exposure to course material and a teacher I really learn well with. 

Second: How qualified am I? As I said I have 10 years of regular IT experience in the military configuring routers, switches and firewalls. I also have experience working as a CSL (Cyber security Liaison) which consists of managing user accounts, controlling access to share points, managing shared drive folder permissions and imaging computers. I also am an ISSO (Information System Security Officer) for a network. This consists of managing user accounts on active directory, running scans, running system updates and reporting security vulnerabilities up the chain. I’ve also done work as an ITAM (IT Asset Manager) where I oversaw controlling, inventorying and installing all computer related hardware.  

Third: Where would be a good place to intern? The military has a program where they will continue paying you full military pay while you intern at a company for your last 6 months of military service. Can anyone suggest a type of job to intern as or suggestions of companies to work with for hands on experience? 

Fourth: Job hub locations? I know Silicon Valley and Seattle are always hiring but I would like to know other career hot spots for consideration. 

Thanks in advance for all responses and advice, I really appreciate it."

As of now, only applying to **JHU**, **Yale**, and **Harvard** for out-of-state (**also applying to many Florida public schools as well**). Am looking for exceptional **opportunities for pre-med students and research experience**. Would **prefer to stay in the East Coast**, but I am open to hearing out the west coast people. **Convenient campus layout, notable school spirit, and active social scene (""cohesiveness""?)** would be greatly preferred, but not necessary. **As of now, RD only**.

**Demographics:** 

Gender: F

Race/ethnicity: Asian/Filipino

State: **FL**

Income: middle class (90-100K), parents are nurses with education from the Philippines, FA will be a deciding factor me on decisions

type of school: total school size pretty small &lt;200, but generally considered ""rigorous"" only offering APs, dual enrollment, and limited honors classes. sends about \~2 students to t50 schools per year. Many students in my batch qualify for partial and full Bright Futures.

hook: Immigrant, if that counts. Got naturalized a couple years ago

**Intended Major(s):** 

Pre-med track, Chem/Bio Chem or BME (Spike toward math and chemistry)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

SAT only: 1540; math: 780, reading: 760

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 

4.0/5.4, my school does not do class rank, but if I had to guess, about top 5 comfortably

**College-Level Coursework:** 

AP: Chem (3), Calc AB (4), Calc BC + AB sub (5), World (5), Euro (5), APUSH (5), Lang (5), Sem (5)

Will be taking US Gov, Macro, and Lit as a senior.

DE subjects: Computer Literacy, Clinical Psychology, Trig, Socio 101, Physics 101, Public Speaking, Anatomy + Lab, Ethics, Art Appreciation, Gen Chem 1.

For fall semester, taking intro to Egn, Gen Chem 2, DiffEq, and Psych 101; haven't mapped out semester 2 tho but Orgo 1 is really interesting to me so far.

**Awards:**

\- AP Scholar with Distinction

\- Got certificates from my school for achieving perfect scores in AP World and AP Sem (tho very dubious lol)

\- UChicago Book Award

\- 3-time Regional HOSA Medalist 

**ECs:** 

**4 year commitments:**

\- Student Government; served as Treasurer for 2 years, then President, now VP for Senior Year; these past years, I'm mostly proud of how far we came along with transitioning our traditions/activities to online and forming new ones. Somewhat hands-off sponsor due to small administration team, so it's nice to set precedent (ex. pep rallies, intramural sports days, talent show, senior mentorship). Personal fav was hosting a clothing drive for a local organization, and we filled a whole truck.

\- Mu Alpha Theta; accrued \~200 hours of tutoring other students across various lvls of math, participated in a couple FAMAT competitions (no wins), but we really just went there for our chapter's teambuilding (surprisingly effective). Became President for senior year; due to covid, want to focus on more creative fundraising, community outreach, improved streamlining for tutoring services, diverse volunteer opportunities, and going back to competitions.

\- HOSA; like I said, regional HOSA medalist and completed at state lvl twice (one SLC cancelled due to Covid.)

**3 years or less:**

\-NHS, inducted as a freshman, volunteered at an elementary school for handicapped children, holiday toy drives, etc

\-Book Club: started junior year, collaborated with Ms. Language Arts to start a transcribing program at my school; underrated volunteer opportunity but very rewarding despite limited participants!

\-Online volunteering/virtual shadowing here and there

\-Internship: was a general library intern this summer who assisted supervisor in program marketing, video production, and front desk work; loved it because it has taught me how to communicate effectively with strangers more than all of the public speaking classes and seminars I took. Other life lessons and eye-openers here and there that I want to include in my apps. 10/10 would choose this over any college summer program.

**Smaller or amateur hobbies/skills (not really for apps but for finding communities in college)**:

guitar/singing, hand-sewing, tetris, ASMR/sound design

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Personal Essay: In between a couple interesting anecdotes from my high school experience (non-covid related), but trust that I'm a better writer than I make it out to be. Want to highlight themes of late blooming, assimilating to new environments, and having a strong sense of duty to my community despite social awkwardness.

LORs: cannot get rec letters from college professors due to online school/no relationship; limited circle of high school instructors (&lt;10), so letters are expected to be fairly general as they have to write for many students. That being said, Mr. Counselor and Mr. Social Studies respect my and fellow officers' efforts to enrich school culture, Mr. Math has been my mentor in pursuing higher mathematics and streamlining better tutoring and mentoring techniques, and Ms. LA respects my writing insights and my sense of humor. Could also get a nice letter from my internship supervisor, who has witnessed a lot of my social growth during our time collaborating.

AP Seminar Papers (Theme that year was Happiness): They received a 5, so they must be pretty decent papers, if not have interesting topics. The one I'm more proud of and considering to send as a supplement (if it's substantial) is my research on foreign-educated doctors and med graduates and the effects of immigration on their wellbeing and self-perception, and that was largely inspired by my and many of my friends' parents who sacrificed their education and dream jobs for their families.

If you read this far, thank you for wanting to help me! Looking forward to great advice."
p4lcxc,9,2021-08-14,3 semesters left...,RealMuppet5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/p4lcxc/3_semesters_left/," Hi all. I have three semesters left for my BS Mechanical Engineering at a large and reasonably respected Midwestern university. Through my internships I've been encouraged to consider a master's degree. My interests are mechatronics, controls, and the intersection of software and hardware.

Couple things to note:

\- GPA: 3.88

\- Work experience: 3 internships, one at a local civil firm, one at a large international avionics contractor (systems engineering for military helicopters), and the latest at a large international machinery company (controls for diesel engines). I am working part time with the latest one straight through graduation.

\- Research/Leadership: I have been project lead for two student design groups (student launch initiative through NASA and a drone research club)

\- Other factors: I am Hispanic, would really like to leave the state I am in and go to a more urban environment, and I had to drop out of school twice to undergo treatment for a blood cancer.

I wish I had more ""real"" undergraduate research experience, so I have been in touch with two professors to try and get some independent study going in my last three semesters. Other than that, what should I be doing in the last 3 semesters to max out my chances of getting into an ME master's program? Networking? Taking specific classes or exploring specific areas like machine learning and advanced control theory?

My shortlist of schools is below. With the information above, should I be aiming higher, lower, or change this in any way?

\- Univ. Minnesota Twin Cities

\- CU Boulder

\- UCSD

\- Georgia Tech

\- University of Washington

I wanted to pursue film making after my high school even my parents had no issues with it but I had to make a practical decision about my career, the film making school I would have joined, the cost of the degree was around 27 Lakhs and that's a pretty hefty amount considering the ROI (and don't want to work in Bollywood).
So I decided to pursue engineering in as my bachelors and work for a few years save some money and then do masters in CSE and film making abroad(CSE for the money to support my family and film making for my passion), then I gave some entrance exams; jee, met,viteee, bitsat. But as I wasn't prepared for it so I flunked my jee(85,89), I was getting CSE in cat 2 at Vit and IT at Manipal, I scored 252 in bitsat. I decided to go for IT at Manipal and took admission. 

( ****If you are busy read from here****)👇🏽

Now comes the main problem, I took physical education in my high school. I don't know any coding language, but I am 💯% ready to put in the effort. I found a lot of resources on YouTube but don't know where to start from. 

1. What language should I learn first?

2. What should I do in my first and second year, to get a good internship at the end of my 2nd year?

3. How to score good CGPA (like 8.5/9+)? (I want good cgpa because I want to do some research internships at iisc and IITs, for that I need to have a good cgpa, I don't know if I am being too ambitious)

4. Please suggest me some good YouTube channels and some good courses I can take up.

TLDR; What should I do in my btceh CSE to get a good job? (Inshort FAANG paane kliye kya karna hai?)

Thank you in advance."

I don’t really think i’m in any capacity a good engineer or software developer as of yet. I think my main issues are a lack of discipline and focus and also because COVID really fucked everyone’s situation and made it really hard to focus on school. I just feel really lost and I don’t know what to do. I like my major and I want to stick to it and i’m not particularly interested in anything else anyways. I want to start taking my career more seriously and I want to become better at programming but I have no idea where to start. I have a basic knowledge of c++, python and Java. I’ve made it past my data structures class so far. For my csc or cpe majors, where do I start if I want to be a better coder quickly?I’m shooting for my first internship next summer so I need to figure things out sooner than later."

Is there any advice or tips you would give me, as well as any materials that could help?

Thank you. I know y'all probably hear this question quite frequently, but tbh I don't really know what else to do except maybe go do Code Academy. I believe it to be a good source of knowledge, but I don't know if it would bring me to that level. However, I could certainly be wrong and would be elated to be so lmao."

Naturally, my parents are attributing this to my lack of a Master's degree, and have been pushing hard for me to attain this. However, from what I have personally seen, I have not seen a lot of CS graduates from my (small) college going to get a Master's before getting some CS job, if at all, which is the goal that I seek to achieve (getting a CS job). Those that did ended up starting school again once they have worked in the industry for some time. I do not know if my college is some special case, but I was wondering if people working within a CS job here (in SWE, web development, what have you) even considered getting a Master's after graduating college? Adding onto this, should I even consider applying to grad school, provided I have this goal? The majority of grad schools that I have looked at are hell bent on providing an insightful research experience, less so work experience/knowledge, so I wouldn't even know what to discuss as a reason for applying...I have done like two unfinished research projects in my time here that weren't all too engaging..."

I'm not sure what type of project to make or where to begin.

Is the use of ""real"" computer science only found in industry or academia, i.e. at a job or internship or research? Or is there a way I can also demonstrate that understanding with a personal project on my own?

I was thinking something along the lines of a large set of data online being open to everyone, and I can use ML to find patterns and its implications."
p4vhik,95,2021-08-15,Do you love your children?,ArcadenceDahlia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p4vhik/do_you_love_your_children/,"Today was my daughter’s first day of kindergarten and she was as happy as it gets-beaming from ear to ear, pigtails bouncing up and down, twirling in her new dress.  We were hand in hand as we walked to the car.

“Ruthie,” I said, looking at her.

“Yes, Mommy?”

“You know I love you right?”

“Mommy, you say that every day, of course, I know.” She squealed.

“Just checking.” I laughed.

I buckled her in and then started the car. In the rearview mirror, I could see Ruth proudly checking the contents of her Frozen backpack. She took out her notebook, pencil, water bottle, and lunchbox. Once she was satisfied, she put it all back in again. Over the course of the drive, she did this two more times.

“Everything okay?” I asked her.

“Yup.”

She was excited, but I was not. My baby was growing up too fast. Where had the days gone? It felt like just yesterday I had taken her home from the hospital all swaddled up and pink. Now she was a bright-eyed and spirited five-year-old about to start school. Tears came to my eyes as I realized in thirteen years, we would be driving in the car just like this, but instead of a backpack it would be a suitcase and instead of kindergarten, it would be college.

“Mommy look!” Ruth’s voice brought me back to the present. I needed to stay here, enjoy it while I could.

“What is it, baby?”

“It’s my school!”

“Of course it is Ruthie.” I laughed.

I pulled into the parking lot and got Ruth out. I suppressed a giggle when I saw how big her backpack was compared to her. It hung down to her knees. She had always been so tiny.

“That’s your teacher over there.” I pointed to a tall, dark-haired man standing in a circle of children. His name was Mr. Grayson. We met at the open house a week ago. He seemed nice enough, but I guess you had to be nice to work with children.

Ruth let go of my hand and ran over. I greeted Mr. Grayson, then went to stand with the other parents. They were all holding cameras and tissues, their mouths were smiling but their eyes were crying. All too soon, the bell rang and it was time to leave. Ruth waved to me. I waved back and blew her a kiss.

“Good luck!” I called out, but she had already gone inside.

The day passed slowly without my daughter. At every moment, I expected to see her running down the hallway or hear her laughing in her room. And then I would remember she wasn’t here. All the parenting books teach you how to get your child ready for school, but they don’t prepare the parents on how to be apart from their kids. None of them mentioned the emptiness-the silence that falls on the house when your child is gone. Maybe nothing can prepare you for that.

Eventually, three o’clock rolled around and Ruth’s bus pulled up. As she got out, I began to laugh. Her hair, which had been so beautifully braided in the morning, was in tatters. Who knew pigtails were no match for kindergarten?

“Hi, Ruthie sweetie. How was your first day?”

“It was awesome Mommy. My teacher is so cool and I made friends with a girl. She had the same backpack as me. Her name is Lila.”

“That’s great honey. Did you learn anything?”

“Nope.” She smirked. “Mr. Grayson taught us stuff, but I already knew everything.”

Pride for my daughter flared internally. I guess all those days I spent teaching her to read and count paid off.

“Come on, I made you a snack.” I took her hand and we walked inside. As she munched on her apples and peanut butter,  I looked through her folder. There were a few things for me to sign, but no homework.

We spent the rest of the day at the park. Coincidentally, Ruth’s new friend Lila happened to be there with her mom and baby brother, Mikah. Her mom, Carina, and I quickly became fast friends. I learned they had just moved to the area. She was doing her residency at the local hospital, while her husband owned and ran a fancy restaurant. We exchanged numbers and promised to get the girls together for a playdate.

I ordered pizza and put on a movie to celebrate Ruth’s first day. By eight o’clock, she was falling asleep on the couch.

“Ruth,” I whispered. “You’ve got to brush your teeth.”

“Okay.” She said sleepily and stumbled up the stairs. When she finished, I tucked her in bed and gave her a goodnight kiss.

“Goodnight Ruthie.”

“Goodnight Mommy”

I walked to my room and got in bed. I flipped through the channels until I found an old Hallmark movie. I was half asleep when I heard soft crying coming from my daughter’s room. It took my body a moment to register that I needed to get up. I wondered what could have happened. She seemed so happy at school and at the park. Maybe the pizza was bad and her stomach was aching?

When I finally reached the door of her room, I stopped to listen. There was something off about the crying. It sounded like my daughter, but at the same time, it didn’t. I pressed my head against the door. I heard her sniffle and whimper then whisper Mommy and do it again. My maternal instincts kicked in and I opened the door. I found her huddled up on the side of the bed, face covered in tears. She didn’t seem to register that I was here. Her eyes were open and in my direction, but it was like she was staring through me, not at me.

“Oh Ruthie, what’s wrong sweetie?” I whispered more to myself than to her. I got into the bed and wrapped my arms around her. She was still sniffing and whimpering. Every time she whispered Mommy, I said I would say Ruthie I’m here, but she never responded. When she finally fell asleep, I realized what was wrong with her crying. It wasn’t normal crying, it was like it was on repeat. Sniffle, whimper, whisper. Then again and again and again, like a video that kept going back to the start.

We woke up thirty minutes late for school. Since I had fallen asleep in Ruth’s room, I hadn’t heard my alarm. I got her up and dressed in record time. On the drive over, I decided to ask her if she remembered anything.

“Ruthie, why were you crying last night?”

“I don’t want to tell you.”

“Did anything happen at school?”

“No, I love school.”

“Did you have a nightmare, baby?” She hesitated, so I continued. “Was it about dad?”

“Of course not.”

“Was I in it?” I asked gently and she started crying.

“Ruthie, what is it? What happened. Did I hurt you in the dream?” I couldn't bear the thought and tears came to my eyes.

“No, but it was going to hurt you. It kept saying if I don’t go with it, it will kill you.”

“What are you talking about baby? What is it?”

“I don’t know, it’s black. It’s night. I don’t want to talk about this anymore Mommy.”

“Sure sweetie.” The conversation unnerved me more than it helped me to understand.

When we got to school, I apologized to Mr. Grayson for being late. When he saw both Ruth and I’s red eyes, he looked curiously at me but didn’t say anything. I silently thanked him for that. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. I even went up to look in Ruth’s room to see if I could find anything dark and out of place. But of course, there was nothing, it was just a little girl’s nightmare.

When Ruth got home, she seemed a lot happier.

“We’re doing a show and tell on Thursday Mommy.”

“Really? That’s awesome! What are you going to bring?”

“Probably Maryellen.”

“The other kids will love her.” Maryellen was her favorite American Girl doll.

“What else happened at school?”

“Mr. Grayson gave us homework.” She pouted and I laughed. She started to work on it, just simple addition and a few reading exercises. When she finished, we went to the park and saw Lila and her mom again. Ruth and Lila played for hours, even getting Lila’s little brother to join in. Although, all he could really contribute was a few gurgles. Carina and I agreed to get the girls together for a sleepover, something they were very excited about. Eventually, it became dark and we all said our goodbyes.

I made a quick dinner of mac n cheese. Ruth was still tired from being up half the night crying so I put her to bed early. Hopefully, tonight would be better. I was so lost in my thoughts, I nearly jumped out of my skin when the phone rang. It was my ex-husband, James. We had been married for eight years until I found him making out with his new intern in our bed. It was an easy divorce. He knew what he did was wrong and conceded to everything. I got the house, our savings, nearly full-time custody and he got his nineteen-year-old intern. Poor girl.

“Hello,” I said.

“Hey, it’s me.” He said. When I didn’t reply, he continued. “Just checking that I’ll get Ruth this weekend.”

“Oh, I actually scheduled a sleepover for Friday, but you can pick her up on Saturday.”

“Sure, that’ll work. How’s her school going?”

“Great, she loves her teacher. Hey, what’s going on at your house?”

“What do you mean Katherine?”

“I’m hearing a weird noise, like a thump. Is someone knocking on your door?”

“No, seriously, it is completely silent at my place. Wait, don’t talk for a second.”

“Alright.”

“Okay, I can hear it now too, but it’s faint. I think it’s coming from your house. Want me to come over and check it out.”

“No, I’ll just check it out myself, thanks though. I’ll let you know.”

“Okay, be careful.”

“I will. I’ll tell Ruth you called. Bye.”

“Bye Kath.”

I hung up and listened. The noise was coming from upstairs. I had an eerie feeling that it had something to do with last night. I walked slowly up the stairs, dreading what I would find. The noise got louder. It was coming from Ruth’s room.

I opened the door and looked at the bed. She wasn’t in it. She was over in the corner knocking her head against the wall, blood streaming down her forehead. I ran over and stopped her.

“Ruthie, baby, why are you hurting yourself?” I looked at her, then gasped. Her eyes were gone. In their place were two gaping holes of darkness, black holes on my daughter’s face. I began to sob."

I started in a major AI, but I got a bit disillusioned with it. I feel like while I have a superficial interest in it, I'm not super passionate about all the maths behind it. Yet, I still feel like it's what I \*should\* do simply because I am good at it and it leads to good jobs. 

At the other hand, there are some courses that I can take that I'd follow just out of curiosity/interest (a. Software Hacking &amp; Security, b. Computer Graphics), but that are not necessarily helpful in careers that I'd pursue. 

I generally don't really know what I will want from my career. At one hand, I feel obligated in a sense to pursue ML and AI just cause its a good career and good money. At the other hand from past internship experiences I feel the most passionate about UI/UX stuff or product-oriented development, rather than more abstract efficiency-oriented kinda things. But I feel reluctant trying to start a career in the former because I think there's generally more competition in it and less compensation because the bar to entry is lower. Meanwhile with my education and background I could probably get into an ML engineering job and get a really good starting salary right out of college. And I do have some interest in it to keep me in it.

Excuse the rambling, but I'd love to hear your takes on my situation. I'm certain it will sound familiar to some of you."

I am, however, part of a research project group where I'll be coding, but we haven't made much progress yet at all, and I'll be a TA in the upcoming sem.


Apart from that, I spent most of this summer making a desktop app, which IMO was very insightful to a lot of things, like design principles, decision making, github, code documentation, etc. I have a few small scripts and course projects in my github as well, although nothing super big. I also have a 3.92 GPA.


I'm assuming the next cycle of applications will be in the upcoming 3 months, particularly for larger companies. How should I best be spending next semester (which starts in a week)? I made the mistake of focusing too much on my grades and not enough on projects, self-learning, and internship searching last semester.


Should I start another personal project in hopes of finishing before then? Or accept that I wouldn't be able to make anything decent and instead focus on interview practice? Is it at all possible to get into one of the larger companies with what I have, and if not, are the chances of getting into one after graduation without having been in one super slim, since most people I know in Amazon/Google/Facebook/Microsoft, for instance, were summer interns with return offers."

Graduated with a ~2.8 GPA and no ECs during undergrad because I liked smoking weed and skipping class. Had some software dev internships during undergrad, including one at Apple and ended up joining Apple as a dev for 2.5 years upon graduation. Left in 2019 after one promo to join a buddy's startup which I'm currently still working at, role is akin to VP or Director - no official title but they'll let me choose whatever title I ask for. 2 devs and 1 PM report to me and I report to our CTO but our hierarchy is pretty flat.


Startup is doing fine but not amazing, 40 employees but some of them are contractors. Valuation between 5-10mil and growing. I have a chance for a personal exit - liquidate some of my equity and leave the company on good terms with the team. If I did that I would want to go back to school for an MBA and use that to pivot into a more business-side (less technical/engineering) role at my next venture. Honestly I also want to take some time off to meet interesting, similarly minded people for future co-founders or lifelong friends.


I am an ORM male turning 30 in a few months. I have spent 100 hours/year for the least 3 years mentoring students at my alma matter and 5-10 hours/year volunteering at other places. Target schools are the typical top 10 b-schools, with heavy preference for Harvard, Stanford, MIT and Columbia. Unstudied practice GMAT was 700, got it up to 740 after 1 month of studying - hoping for 750+ on actual test.

How are my chances for my target schools right now if I were to resign and apply? Would it help significantly to stay at the company until valuation is 10-20mil?"

————————————————————

The past few days had been an interesting experience for Dhalshi. If one were to ignore the blatant lack of sleep that came with his job then they would be satisfied with entertaining themselves using the resources at their fingertips.

Dhalshi’s favorite activity so far had been browsing the glossary section of various files to see if something caught his eye. Not many people, save Winters, had voiced their concerns over the contents of the secured room. 

From murders to assasination of world leaders, dirty secrets were laid bare for everyone to see. Though when Dhalshi asked Winters if everything was included in the archives, he gave no reaction. Instead opting to lecture him on security protocol, even if it wasn’t practiced anymore. Winters did however tell him that evidence was kept in a separate section of the main building.

So far, he had picked up several traits from his time on the Human planet. From a few speech traits, to adding a cup of coffee to his morning. Some people said it was slightly addictive, though when he asked the doctor (and yes, this place had everything, including a dedicated, small hospital) she claimed that even if it wasn’t physically addictive, you would most definitely gain a dependence on the stuff. 

True to his habit, he sat down at his desk with a plate of what looked like food, and some coffee. *”This place feels more like a tomb than a bunker.”* He thought as he opened his terminal to check on the work for the day.  

*”Three emails, another from Winters, probably about another obscure security issue. The third from Von’sah about any updates. So… no updates, just more work. Then there's one I can’t open. Fantastic, I thought she had those issues fixed.”*

Grabbing his omni-pad from his desk, he opened a document which detailed everything that had been completed so far. Over the last couple of days, they had blown through a decent amount of work, though it was still a miniscule accomplishment. Dhalshi and his co-workers had gone through the first two letters of the archives, A and B. *”Now for those colored boxes.”* Dhalshi thought as he continued down the tiled walkway, his shoes made a rather pleasant sound on the floor. 

He turned the corner into the isle filled with the horrendously organized boxes. Upon further inspection, it looked like half the boxes were in the wrong place. Some of the boxes were missing, as if someone had misplaced or lost some of them. 

*”Whoever organized this should be shot, it's terrible. I feel like an intern would do better than this.”*

Dhalshi hefted the first box off the shelf and began to carry it back to his desk. On his way, Winters walked past on his usual early morning round, his gaze locking onto Dhalshi, abruptly changing into a scowl before he continued onwards. 

Dhalshi had a feeling that it wasn’t directed at him. Nevertheless, he continued on with his work. Setting down the box on the floor with a thud, nearly dropping it on his foot. 

He removed the lid, and sorted through the folders inside until he had found the directory. Said directory was spaced out between multiple binders which were twice as thick as his desk which took up the entire box. 

“Fuuuuuuuck…” Dhalshi murmured. *”This is not going to be fun.”* 

Pulling out the first of the binders, he opened the first cage. A long list was marked down on the page, faded illegible pencil markings layered some sides of the page. The title on the head of the page was crossed out in marker, the words written below in blue ink. “Clown Case”

*”Isn’t that some sort of jester or joker or something? The last thing I need is some more creepy stuff to keep me up at night. These humans take photos of everything…”* 

Some of the categories had small sticky notes on their pages. Most of them read that the evidence correlating to the case had been lost, some of them had reasons, others did not. Those that had the reasons referenced another folder somewhere which had its title also crossed out, instead being called ‘Hoxton Revenge.’

The next few hours had Dhalshi scanning and painstakingly sorting and reorganizing the scattered files into a digital version. The entire ordeal had sent him through a loop, that was until his attention was grabbed by a folder of names. Skimming it, he went down through the alphabetized lines. There wasn’t much for the first three letters, only starting at the letter D. Nothing much caught his eye, *”Most of these are probably nicknames.”* Dhalshi thought as he continued to read. Until he noticed an actual name, Neville Winters. 

*”Interesting.”* Dhalshi thought as he stood up and retrieved Winters’ file. 

Overview: 

Winters is a Bay Area native, and graduated from the U.C. Berkeley’s prestigious Military Police Officer program.

Previously served with Commissioner Garret (see subsection 34) and was awarded the Public Officer Medal of Valor during his service. 

The rest of the list was mostly unremarkable, only stating specifics in his service, although it continued on for several pages. *”This might be interesting.”* Dhalshi thought, *”Von’sah wanted to know if anything turned up on Winters, and I did promise.”* He thought as he scanned the contents of the file, saving a copy to his omni-pad before sending it to Von’sah. 

Letting out a long sigh, he leaned back into his chair. Sagging a bit as he thought of the work to come, though little did he know, there was going to be even more.  

-----------------------------------

I’m back, sorry for the super short chapter but I didn’t have much to do with it. I might take a break and write a bit of something else to see if it clicks with me. But I look forward to the gang’s first heist, and I don’t want to rush it."

I'm trying to narrow down my top choices for school, with plans to major in engineering undecided. I really want to go to NYU because of the location, as I've been to NYC many times and love it there, but not sure if it will be good for my major, and for that I have a few questions.

1. How reputable is NYU tandon, like would employers think highly of an engineering degree from there?
2. How disconnected is tandon from the rest of NYU? How many opportunities would I have to be involved at NYU as a whole, or is tandon in their own little bubble?
3. How many opportunities are there for students from tandon? Internship opportunities, job opportunities, etc.
4. Finally, what kind of study abroad programs does Tandon offer, would it have the same opportunities as the rest of NYU, would it have different opportunities, or does it have none at all?

Any help to these questions or any other notes about NYU tandon would be appreciated."
p54b4t,5,2021-08-15,how i'm (slowly) improving myself (and what i still have to do),wopperwapman,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/p54b4t/how_im_slowly_improving_myself_and_what_i_still/,"with the pandemic, i stopped biking everyday to uni, started eating more junky food and drinking more beer, as well as spending the entire day sitting on my pc or laying in bed. 
i became a lot weaker, less energetic and motivated, and gained about 6kg. 
i felt like shit. i didn't like the way i looked or how uncapable i felt in my own body. i also suffered from insomnia and lots of stress.
here's what i've been doing to improve, as well as my to do list:
(i'd appreciate to hear tour own experiences with these, or even other suggestions you think could help me) 

* physical activty:
started going to the gym (i do weight lifting, light cardio and yoga there)
i'm feeling much better in general, especially when i look in the mirror (there's still a long way to go, only 2 months in).
also, working out helped me get rid of my insomnia (along woth reducing stress) and made me more conscious about what i eat. 

to do: take up some martial art. (i used to do taekwondo, but i can take up muay thai for no extra fee at my gym, so i might try that. still have to make time for that though
take up pilates at least once a week (also available at my gym) 

* eating habits:
i should mention that i have been a vegeterian for about 4 years now. 

completely cut out junk food and fatty foods in general on week days.
started focusing on protein rich foods and trying to reach a protein target everyday. 
stopped cooking with oil. started eating big, diverse salads at least every other day. 

these changes have made me feel much better after eating (no bloating, and no feeling of fullness without being satisfied) 

recently started intermitent fasting, which made me more conscious about my water intake, now i try to reach a daily target.
(i already drank a good amount of water though) 

i also started supplementing on protein (currently albumin and collagen) and vitamins. protein has helped me gain muscle in the gym and vitamins i believe are doing their thing (lol). 

cut down on beer, and drinking in general, by a lot. i used to drink every weekend, now i actually don't drink on most of them, and when i do, i try to have drinks other than beer (to avoid beer belly) 

to do: see a nutritionist to establish a proper diet. start tracking calories to make sure i'm at a deficit. start supplementing on creatine and b12. replace albumin with whey (we already had albumin here, that's why i started taking it) 

* study:
unfortunately, i wasn't able to make progress in this area. i should note that i don't pay for university.

in order to reduce stress, i cut down on the number of classes i take and stopped volunteering to the research project i used to. 

to do: get back to reasearch and plan my next semester better than i did this one so that i can actually finish all the classes i started without immense stress. 

* work:
i have been doing my best at work, always trying to go beyond what's expected, which resulted in me getting two record-time promotions there. was an intern, now working part time as squad leader. 

having a much better time there, and making more money. 

also got rid of my other, stressfull and underpaid weekend job.
absolutely reduced a bunch of unnecessary stress. 

to do: manage time better so my work doesn't extend outside my specified work time. get a voluntary internship (no fixed hours) in my area of study (currently, my work is unrelated to it) 

* sleep:
working out helped with insomnia, but i still need to get more hours of sleep, wake up earlier and get better quality sleep. 

i feel like i'm well rested enough to make it through the day, but not to my full potential. 

to do: go to bed (no phone) earlier (currently not possible because uni goes untill 10pm) 
buy sleep masks and earplugs to sleep better. (no curtains and noisy street) 

* hygiene and self care:
had to remind myself of the basics: brushing after every meal, flossing and using mouthwash at night.
definetely saw improvement in my breath. 

started washing my face (acne scarred and still with some acne sometimes) with sulphoric soap and a sponge everyday.
my skin is less oily now and looks better. 

started shaving everyday, which improved my self-esteem. 

switched to cold showers (still allow hot showers on weekends if i feel like it).
this really gives me the energy i need after a shower, and i feel has had a positive impact on my skin. 

gone low poo (hair is surprisingly LESS oily now). 

to do: see a dermathologist to start actual skincare routine. look into nopoo alternatives. 

*mental health:
reduced stress by cutting stressfull activities. 

started nofap to get rid of porn and masturbation addiction. (had a recent relapse, working on it) 

started talking to more people (online only, bc pandemic) which is always good and made me feel more likeable. 

started doing positive mentalizations and cutting off whenever i'd go on a negative thought spiral (helped with motivation and self-esteem) 

to do: start seeing a psychologist 

*relationships:
started talking to more girls, and even went on a date. still have trouble keeping in touch with people from tinder. 

to do: maybe cut off tinder entirely as it's not productive and sometimes makes me feel bad. (but not much perspective on meeting potential partners without it as i'm still stuck at home) 

*personal organization and productivity: 
i'm able to go through all my daily tasks, but there's still a lot to improve. (can't complete all non-scheduled activities such as house chores, organizing finances, buying stuff and dealing with other household and personal problems) 

to do: start mantaining my personal trello, schedule curently non scheduled tasks so i can actually do them. reorganize my room and my files in my pc, getting rid of unnecessary stuff. (look into minimalism?) 

* finances:
with my most recent promotion, i started making a decent amount of money. i have been investing for a while, but never saw too many gains. 

to do: find better investments
cut spotify subscription (need to find a replacement) 

*other lifestyle stuff:
i want to start going for walks more often. there's a nearby beach i can go to, but it's hard to get motivation to go by myself."
p54dcc,1,2021-08-15,Am I Doing Something Wrong?,uxom1923,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/p54dcc/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,"This post is for everyone to share their opinion or experience becuase I just need to hear from others who may have gone through the same dilemma.

I am a 20 yr old 3rd year undergraduate, full-time student studying Construction Management at a 4-yr university. Thankfully, im running on some grant and scholarship money and commute to school. I changed majors from Architecture in Spring 2021, putting me behind by a semester but enjoying Construction Management. Ive also been working part-time at Home Depot for a year at $13/hr, with the flexibility of working as many hours as I want. I still live with my parents and have owned a pretty beat up 2003 Infiniti G35 for 2 1/2 years. Ive saved up a little more than 20k in the time that ive worked and keep my expenditures to less than 150 every 2 weeks.

Now, I like to go by the saying: ""Struggle now, Enjoy Later."" So I try to stay humble by not buying extravagant belongings and just keeping my spending to the things I need. 

Recently, I've been hanging out with more friends from highschool and have had a blast with them. The deal is I can't help but to think about the things they've done in the same amount of time. Some of them have bought nice cars, are moving out, or have been able to travel. It just makes me think it must be nice to have all those things. Although some of my friends decided not to go to college or are planning on finishing only community college, they seem to be more happy than me.

I know I shouldn't worry about what others are doing but I sometimes think to myself: is what im doing now going to pay off later? 

My goals are to get internships while im in school, work in my field of study (hopefully as a project manager), and one day start a roofing company of my own. 

But thinking that my friends are doing better than me makes me want to do the same thing. Should I buy the car of my interest now? Move out? Or plan a trip? Should I work more so I make the money to make that happen? Or slow down the pace in school, which may put my financial aid on the line?

My head is still on the same track as always: finish school with experience in my field and find a job that'll give me the capital to start my roofing company, even if its a frugal grind. But I want to know what yall think or have been through. Should I make the same moves as my friends while im in school or wait for the right time?

Im open to read everything yall got."

GPA: 3.81/4.0 T20 CS school in US, don't know about my school tier though. 

GRE: not taken yet since it is not required for most schools I intended to apply (please let me know if you think I should take).

Research Experience: will have 3 research projects all at school labs by the time of applying, one is a 6 months research, other two will be 3 months researches that are highly related to the field I intend to do research in master.

Publications: 0

LORs - one strong letter from my engineering manager at the AI company, one strong letter from a professor who I TA'd for, both of them are not really well known in their fields. I'm still deciding on my final letter which would be from a professor whom I did research with.

Ambitious : CMU, Berkeley, Cornell, Georgia Tech, UIUC, UWashington

Safe colleges: UMass

My current problem is that my 6 months research does not relate to my research interest in grad school, while my upcoming research in the Fall semester is my interest field and also matches closely with faculty at the given university. So I don't know if I should ask for the LOR from the professor I had more time doing research with or from a professor that I would only have about 2 - 3 months working with by the time of the application.

Sorry about the super long post, might be a lil disjointed. 

I'm studying engineering in polytechnic, currently in an internship semester, where students have a choice to go source for a company and get $800 a month or stay in-house working on a project of our choosing for zero dollars. Working hours for both are 0800 to 1730 on weekdays for 22 weeks. 

$800 might as well be nothing, plus the school grades your impact/outcome based on your contributions in your internship period. Seeing as a random company aren't guaranteed to have meaningful projects to work on (students usually end up at start-ups, and we know how well those go) so I opted for the in-house option. 

This probably was the right decision in hindsight, my friend went with an outside company and they got him doing menial tasks and fixing xerox printers. In 2021. What's he gonna write in his report..?

Anyway, the project I was assigned to was hella unorganised, the previous batch of student interns were trusted to document their progress and come up with manuals on how to operate the machines, areas of improvement, etc. And the current batch was just given a crash course by the former interns (the ones who showed up anyway) and left there with no supervision. The project supervisors are often doing lectures or whatever it is they're so busy with and only visit for 10 minutes maybe once a week. 

Ok. My school's pretty big on the whole ""self-learning"" thing so I guess we'll just pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and whatnot. We dealt with automation, my station had conveyors, assembly lines, and robot arms, I learnt what I could, programmed the PLC, robot control, though the real engineers would come in if I ran into something I couldn't do. 

But there wasn't always something to do, I'm pretty confident with PLC programming and could eventually finish most tasks quickly. Then it's counting hours for the day, at one point, the 20 year-old pneumatic compressor supplying air to my station broke and I was left with even less to fill my time. I had the longest days of my life during this semester. 

Fast-forward multiple weeks and a merciful (for us) lockdown caused by Covid spikes, and I'm in my last week of internship, they fixed the compressor, I finished my work, my station is fully autonomous, reports and documentation done. I did everything I needed to ahead of schedule. 

My batch must've been hardworking because the director decided he wanted to meet all the in-house interns across all projects, he said his thanks and whatever, ""We hope you will continue your learning journey and come back to work on your respective projects. Projects are never done"", ""To show our appreciation, we'll be providing free lunch for today"", yada yada yada. 

Through the session, I was left wondering what a school director's does for their job, that they could take the time to do this, I could be watching anime in my lab. It was my last day anyway, but wait, there's more. 

The director and management board decided they wanted to see our group's project in-person, out of all the others. And they would greatly appreciate if we could come back next week for a demo (I doubt they'll be providing free lunch this time). 

I feel like they don't respect the students' time, we were forced to skip our holidays and work for you, without pay, while other students were on holiday, we were coming back 0800 to 1730. And now on our last day, you want us to come back and personally show you our work? Couldn't have read our reports, watched the videos that showed the operation processes, anything besides stealing more of our off-time? 

This just reeks of shit, I had to quit my part-time video-editing job to for this internship, I had to solve every problem that arose myself. 22 weeks for a $6 lunch set, like paying your interns isn't a sign of appreciation. 

The other interns in my project group didn't seem affected, but they defo should be. Fuck the director and his nothing job, the management board can manage deez nuts. 

My internship is finished, give me my grade and I'll enjoy my life with 22 weeks I'll never get back."

*Firstly, I'm not from one of the commonly known parts of the world and English isn't my first language, so please consider it before reading.* 

So, I'm not exactly a computer science graduate although I am someone from the STEM community. CS is very much related to the study of my field and I've had a very strong connection to it since my early childhood days. I sometimes wish that I had chosen a major CS degree but it wasn't meant to be that way. I've had some trouble completing my bachelors degree(on time) and still I have some exams left. But that's a completely different topic. I'm currently in my mid 20's and it really feels like it's getting all too late for me. I've only worked as an intern in a Software Dev company. That was just for about a couple of months and then the pandemic(didn't get any recognition letter). Since then I've been working as a freelancer, here and there collecting pennies. And no, not exactly programming jobs. It's been really hard for me. Many of my friends who completed their bachelors have settled in a nice company, with attractive salaries (and credit to them, they deserve it). But to be really honest I was one of the students who was really good in programming and CS, considered among some of the best students but life took a wrong turn for me. 

Now, I'm trying to pick myself up and learn as much as possible, improving my skills and knowledge. I know we all start from the bottom, but I don't want to waste my time doing another internship. I've seen newcomers, recent graduates (younger than me) given more opportunities and priority. Again I do understand that if one is more skillful then they definitely deserve it. But, nowadays there's kind of a trend to have accounts in multiple platforms, LinkedIn/ twitter and many others that I might not know of. It's been kind of a place to showcase their talent and knowledge (and sometimes memes and useless gossip and talks). I opened a LinkedIn account way back  before I was in college. It was different back then. I didn't know what to do with it so I left it there. Now when I see so many of my friends using and sharing their LinkedIn profiles and when I go see, it just looks like another ""Facebook"" to me. People sharing status and commenting ""haha"" and what not. Call me weird but I really disliked it, even the color matches to Facebook, lol. And when I hear that people are being called for interviews from those sites and being hired, I feel so demotivated. 

Personally, I'm the type of person who uses anonymous account names on almost every possible site, except my work/personal email accounts. I am so comfortable being anonymous. I use GitHub, Stack overflow and other such accounts with an anonymous username and have been doing that for a long time. (Btw, while applying for a decent job I wouldn't mind much sharing my anonymous GitHub profile). 

Is this really bad practice for a good CS career?"
p59tj2,1,2021-08-16,MS Thesis vs MS Professional?,Zoosh_Saran,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/p59tj2/ms_thesis_vs_ms_professional/,"Hey everyone!  


I'm a senior from a Tier1 Engineering College in India, and am looking to pursue my masters in the field of Electrical Engineering. I'm absolutely sure of the fact that I wish to pursue a career in the industry following my studies, and while I don't wish to rule the idea of a PhD out, I'm more inclined to completing my studies at the Masters Level itself.   
My question is, given this situation, is it really worth pursuing an MS w/ Thesis Program or will an MS-Professional/Coursework be more apt.   
Moreover, are there any drawbacks of a Professional Program over the Thesis Program.  


A little about myself -   
My BTech is in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I'm interested in the field of Computer Architecture &amp; VLSI. I've got some experience in the industry and am currently pursuing a research internship in my area of interest.   


Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

TERMS:

REFUND POLICY: No refunds will be issued under any circumstances once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer ignorance does not constitute grounds for a refund. If you don't know how to use a specific code and you buy it anyway, or you already own the title, you won't be given a refund once the code has been sent.

CODE REDEMPTION: You may not use these codes on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in you being reported to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""SHOULD PORT/UPGRADE TO 4K"" CODES: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If for some reason a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, you will need to contact the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray if requested. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request.

PAYMENT/FEES: I accept Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F), preferred in that order. I do not cover any fees associated with purchases. When paying through PayPal, do not use Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S). Paying through PayPal with funds not from your PayPal wallet or a linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit card, pre-paid Visa card, etc.) will result in a fee of $0.30 + 2.9%. If a fee is incurred, a refund would result in PayPal keeping your fee, which I will not reimburse, so please be careful.

I have transferred from FoS to CS this year, and I am starting from Y2.

For Y2S1, I am taking CS2030S and 2040S.

I wish to get a winter internship after this semester.

Is this even possible? If so, what are some of the things (e.g. online classes) I need to do to be able to get a winter internship? What resources should I look into?

If getting a winter internship is quite difficult, then what do you suggest me to do during winter break so that I can really secure one during next summer?

Sorry for the bunch of questions. Looking forward to hearing your advices. Thank you for reading."
p5e0vd,2,2021-08-16,How should I figure out my career path?,courageous_touch,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/p5e0vd/how_should_i_figure_out_my_career_path/,"I am a final year computer science engineering student studying in a private college in India. When I joined engineering in 2018, my goal was to work on myself and my skills and start a well-paying career by the end of my graduation. My target was to crack minimum of 10 lpa of package (I estimated this figure considering my education loan that I have to repay once I start earning and cost of living in cities like Pune or Bangalore) And my strategy for the same was to study and prepare well in the 4 yrs of college and get an on-campus placement in a good company.

So I worked hard for 2.5 yrs on this goal until August 2020 when companies started visiting for summer interns recruitment for 3rd year students. 4-5 companies visited but I couldn't crack any. I felt that I don't have a very high IQ or coding skills, and that must be the reason for my failure. So from September 2020, I embarked on a new career path of content writing (Writing has always been my hobby). I worked on a lot of projects and internships and performed well in all of them. My clients and managers were happy with my work. I continued this content writing journey until April 2021 this year. However, I was not at all earning close to my target figure. And more importantly, I couldn't figure out a path to get higher pay in content writing in future.

So after April 2021, I took a break from content writing as my on-campus placements were approaching. I decided to give it a shot again and started preparing for placements again from June 2021 (In may I caught covid). 

3-4 companies have visited till now and I have still not been able to crack any. I know there are many more companies to come till December 2021 though. But I don't feel a high probability of me getting placed in a good company. Besides, preparing for placements does NOT at all excite me anymore. In fact, to be precise, it drains me. I just have to push myself to get things done. 

Apart from that, I never felt a belonging to the place I was studying engineering in. I've had a very hard time in college and I always felt like I didn't fit in. I am not telling all this because I am getting emotional, but because i want to convey the idea that deep down I've always known that engineering and corporate world is not in alignment with who I am. But I always kept this feeling burried because I felt, being an enginnering student, I have no other option than to pursue product based companies if I want to achieve my financial goal.

Now on a different note, quite interestingly, a content writing company from Denmark approached me some days ago for a content writing role, took my test, interviewed me, and selected me for the job. Currently I am working part time (10 hours a week) for them. They are likely to offer me full time role after the end of my two months trial period (which will be in October 2021). The salary they offered me is double the salary I had in my previous content writing job. However, it's still not close to my target figure.

So at present, I am doing 3 things -
• Internship which is mandatory part of my engineering curriculum. In this internship I am going to be working on certain modules of vendor management system web application.
• Part-time content writing job from home
• Preparing for placements

Still, I don't see my career going anywhere. I don't know which industry to pick, what skill to work on, and how to carve a plan to reach my goal. I still have high aspirations and still wish to achieve the same financial stability. I am also ready to work hard but I just can't see any path in front of me to achieve it. Can't carve any plan.

Below I am giving a short description of my current skillset.

1) Data analysis -
• Have certification in data analysis, and a few basic to medium-level projects on data analysis and model building
• I don't think I am very good in this skill though, plus I don't enjoy it much

2) Web development -
• Have basic knowledge of Html, css, js, and php. But have no projects. However, my current internship will get me 1-2 projects to showcase I guess.
• Since I have not worked much in it, I don't know if I am good or bad in it. However, my interest in web dev is more than data analysis.

3) C++,C, Python 
• Best knowledge and experience with c++. Have experience of competitive programming in c++. Don't have any projects though.
• Love doing competitive programming. But I am slow in it and perform average i guess.

4) Content Writing 
• Have best knowledge and experience with blog post writing. Have also done few projects facebook ad copywriting, amazon listing writing, google ads copywriting, web copywriting etc.
• I am good in blog post writing and I think I have the potential to become a lot better if I pursue it solely. Don't know much about copywriting though.

5) Other skills -
• I know medium-level quantitative, reasoning, verbal, aptitude.
• Also have done certification course in french. But I am terrible in learning foreign languages and don't enjoy learning them as well.

Natural interest and passion (which kind of describes who I am at the core) - self improvement, psychology, journaling, spirituality, listening to other people

Financial support - No financial help at disposal. Family suffering from financial crisis. So i guess pursuing higher studies can be quite challenging.

Now with all the facts and information I have given, I would very much appreciate if I can get any help or guidance from you about how to forge my career path moving ahead from here.

P.S. - EXTREMELY SORRY FOR INCREDIBLY LONG DESCRIPTION. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GET ALL THE POINTS REQUIRED TO MAKE A CAREER DECISION ACROSS"

I'm looking for a SWE internship so that I can learn enough skills to confidently say that I'm a software engineer. Among the things I want to have practical experience in are:

1.  CI/CD 
2. Containerization
3. Microservices
4. Building scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable distributed systems, 
5. Be in an environment where my mentors can provide rigorous code reviews.
6. Learn how to apply software design patterns
7.  Big Data/ML and others (I'm not sure what else, any recommendations would be welcome).

I did web development in my last internship with Accenture. I learned a lot but I felt that the experienced gained was narrow and more applicable to the particular website I was working on, as compared to my other class mates who went to smaller companies but were able to gain exposure to fields like Big Data by using tools Hadoop and Kafaka.

That said, a company is offering to interview me about a position.

Do you think the position below would help me learn and achieve some of my goals stated above?

My feeling is that it's less technical and would be similar to the Accenture internship, and not help much in achieving my above goals.

However, I believe multiple viewpoints are needed to make a conclusion, and would appreciate any feedback about the below position.

I'm currently a freshman in college taking up BS Information Systems and the reason why I chose this course is because I  like both business (Managerial roles/ PMs/Business Analyst) and tech (software dev). Now, I am undecided if I should just shift to CS because from what I heard they have a higher chance of getting into dev roles. Although yes I do believe that my course can also get me into dev/SE jobs, I just think that CS could give me higher chances sa dev jobs hahaha. Nevertheless, I think I will enjoy either CS or my current course naman. 

Also, tanong ko na din for those who have the same courses as I am (Info Sys) what is our current job market outlook here in the ph in terms of career paths? and what can I do as a college student to build up my reputation for future employment? Nakikita ko kasi sa abroad mostly sa US na 2nd year college pa lang meron na silang internships from tech companies even FAANG.

Here is the seventy-seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I was fortunate enough to escape all the fake marketer schemes littering the trading education space and lock onto a mentor who formerly worked in the professional financial space (non-trading). Through personal coaching and devoting practically every minute of my free time to studying and practicing the markets, I was able to fast-track my learning. And now I'm looking into getting an entry-level internship in a professional space to get a glimpse of the prop trading industry.

My issue is that all of them seem to be regarding quant jobs with a requirement or high emphasis on coding. I've been following SMB Capital as a firm that I'm interested in going towards but I don't know what else is out there. Jane Street Capital is another that I found interesting but after doing some digging, it seems like the Quantitative Trader role relies pretty heavily on OCAML, with some interviews sounding like a background in Python and/or C is needed. While I do have experience with base languages (Python, C, MATLAB, etc.), I'm not particularly interested in having my career rely heavily on it.

I could also very well be looking for a couple grains of sand in a desert with my search for a trader role not relying heavily on coding. Any thoughts?"

So I started my GRE prep beginning of August and plan to give GRE on 21st Oct &amp; TOEFL on 24th Oct. I know the timelines are bit narrow but it's the best I can do working full time.

I have Given 2 practice tests till now
  - 154V + 165Q = 319
  - 153V + 170Q = 323

I am fairly confident that I can score near about 170 on the real test and the coming 2 months I'll focus on verbal trying for at least 160+

I have a CGPA of 9.2 (3.68 on a 4 point scale) from a tier 2 university in India in Computer Science

At the time of joining (Fall 22) I would have completed 2 years as a full time developer at Dell other than that I have 8 months of internship with Dell

I can get strong LOR's, 2 from my professors and 1 from my senior manager

The biggest flaw I see in my profile is that I have no formal research experience. tough I am planning to take the course work or project option where available I don't see my self pursuing a PHD.

Other things in my profile would be Major project I did in my finale year as undergraduate. Have around 20+ open source contributions (Stanford NLTK, Vscode &amp; more). Have published 2 commercial games to the play store tough not any significant revenue and have lots of projects related to Game Development, Graphics &amp; Software Development that I can talk about in my SOP. Other than this I have a Youtube channel with 400 subs and 50,000 views where put programming tutorials and showcase my progress (Don't know if the last point adds any value to my application)

I have been interested in Software development and programming since school days and would like to purse masters in the same (creating apps and solutions makes me happy)
I also have a ton of interest in game development, graphics and real time systems (high performance computing) So am targeting MS CS in these fields

I created a list of universities
- University of California Brekerly, M.Eng VCCG
- Carnegie Mellon University, MS CS, MSE
- Colambia University, MS Software
- Stanford University, MS Software, Real World
- Princeton, Systems, graphics

- University of Texas, Austin, MSCS
- University of Southern California, MS General, Software, Game Dev
- New York University, MSCS
- Georgia Institute of Technology, MSCS

I understand the first 5 are pretty ambitious. But if you have any other suggestions please do tell.

I have three semesters left for my BS Mechanical Engineering at a large and reasonably respected Midwestern university. Through my internships I've been encouraged to consider a master's degree. My interests are mechatronics, controls, and the intersection of software and hardware.

Couple things to note:

- GPA: 3.88

- Work experience: 3 internships, one at a local civil firm, one at a large international avionics contractor (systems engineering for military helicopters), and the latest at a large international machinery company (controls for diesel engines). I am working part time with the latest one straight through graduation.

- Research/Leadership: I have been project lead for two student design groups (student launch initiative through NASA and a drone research club)

- Other factors: I am Hispanic, would really like to leave the state I am in and go to a more urban environment, and I had to drop out of school twice to undergo treatment for a blood cancer. 

I wish I had more ""real"" undergraduate research experience, so I have been in touch with two professors to try and get some independent study going in my last three semesters. Other than that, what should I be doing in the last 3 semesters to max out my chances of getting into an ME master's program? Networking? Taking specific classes or exploring specific areas like machine learning and advanced control theory? 

My shortlist of schools is below. With the information above, should I be aiming higher, lower, or change this in any way?

- Univ. Minnesota Twin Cities

- CU Boulder

- UCSD

- Georgia Tech

- University of Washington

Last year (fall 2020), as the pandemic raged on in my city I was able to land an internship with a small (&lt;100 ppl across the state) civil consulting firm. At the time I was only enrolled in one class because I could not afford full tuition at my university and my scholarship was temporarily revoked due to being unenrolled and doing another internship (policy related, just for shiggles) in spring ‘20. 

I thought my position would only be for the fall ‘20 semester, but I liked the work and my PM and coworkers liked me so they I stayed almost full time during my winter break. Then they extended the offer into this spring semester, which I was not considering since I finally got my scholarship back (conditionally) and was able to return to school full time. 
I explained that I could not work as much as I did in the fall since I was not unrolled in only class anymore but six. No problem, I could work 14 hours a week said my PM. 

I worked only two full days a week; but during both I also had to use my lunch to tune into my remote lecture. The rest of the week I had classes and labs 8-6. Because the conditions of my scholarship were that I had to raise my cumulative GPA from a 2.8 to a 3.0 in a SEMESTER, I really hauled a**. 
In addition, I needed to complete 24 credits by the end of the school year but because I had only completed three in the fall I had to find a way to complete 21 between the spring and summer. 

I got the credits and raise my GPA to a 2.98 which my school excused and gave me my scholarship back on the condition that I do raise it to a 3.0 by the end of this upcoming school year. 
This summer I also worked at the firm (35 hrs/week) and because my summer classes started before my spring finals even ended (Took at another university ), I have not caught a break. 

Anyways, this semester I have a busy schedule and will be taking thermodynamics, fluid mechanics alongside my senior design classes because I did not take these classes when I was supposed to due to being away in spring of 2020. I got an offer to stay for the fall and because I really do enjoy working with civil engineers, and enjoy learning more about this field I accepted it without really thinking through my fall schedule. also because my parents do not fully support me financially (besides helping me with additional school expenses I cannot cover, and letting me live in their house but food and transportation I have to pay for) and I am saving to go to grad school in Germany, I have to be honest and say that I accept it because I need the money.  

Now one week away from school I am starting to worry about having enough time this semester. For some reason my PM told me interns are not expected to work 16 hours a week so I must work four days, four hour shifts. Which Sounds fine if it were not for the layout of my class schedule. 


As of now it looks like:
M, W: 8-12 work, 2:30-9pm class
Tu:8-12:35 class, 6-8 lab 
Th: 8-12:35 class, 2-6 work
F: 8-12 work, 2:30-3:15 class 

In addition I’m VP and President of orgs like ASCE, AWWA, etc. 

Besides feeling like I won’t have time I have other personal reasons that have made me reconsider staying at this position. The first is the pay I know $17 per hour (before tax) is great wage but considering that I do literally all of the same work (except major design and conducting meetings)  as the entry level engineer Who got hired around the same time as I did and is only a year older than I feel that I deserve more compensation especially since I am also a student who is exchanging my valuable study time to contribute to the company.
In addition, this summer I felt that I was being treated differently in the office for the first time. We had a temporary summer intern who is one semester ahead of me and unlike me is a civil engineering major but doesn’t  have any previous work experience. Almost immediately I noticed how he was being treated better than night because he got invited out to lunch, he was not given The menial tasks I was given during my first months at the company, and he has even been taken on site visits which I have been asking to go on for almost a year that I have been in this position.  Like within his first weeks he was already doing things that I did not get to do until 
I had been there for months. I don’t want to jump the gun and say that it is because I am the only woman that I am being treated differently but being a clear outlier in the office has definitely made me feel like I don’t fit in, and this summer reinforced it.

I don’t know what to do, I have never quit a professional job like this and I am scared of having to go on a job search again right as my semester is starting. I was also considering starting off the semester in the office but leaving before midterms, but asking if I can return in during winter break, once I am off school. Is this unprofessional?

TLDR: Student approaching burnout, but does not want to leave job this upcoming (very busy)semester, due to financial circumstances, and fear of instability."

* Why I want an MBA:

*tldr: Move from engineer --&gt; program manager / consultant / leadership development program*

I'd like an MBA to transition my engineering/technical expertise into operational/programmatic/strategic expertise. I've spent the past 4 years as an engineer designing various military systems for the government. In that time, I've gained an understanding of the technology, the tech development cycle, and programmatic structures that drive a project to completion. It's clear to me that I enjoy the strategy side of the business much more than being in the technical weeds. I feel that I'll have to wait at least 10 years before I'll get the opportunity to drive/lead any projects, and I want to move faster and take on more. I feel an MBA would provide me with the access and knowledge necessary to move beyond the defense industry and tackle other tech projects from a high level. 

* Why I want one now:

*tldr: It will take a long time to progress within my current company, and I want to go faster and take on more. An increase in $ wouldn't hurt.* 

Within the last 10 months, I shifted away from pure engineering and took on a new role within my company that focuses on strategy and customer/government relationships. I've loved the work and wish I could continue, but the expectation is that I go back to being an engineer to gain more tech experience before I'm ready for senior level roles in this group. Now that I've found something that excites me, I don't want to wait and grind it out for years. I feel like I'm great at what I do, excited to pursue this style of work further, and  want to get an MBA ASAP to land a role at a dynamic company that hires MBAs to solve high-level problems. The defense industry typically relies heavily on hiring from within their own engineering pool, and the ladder does not usually reward/promote young employees over more experienced ones. 

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * 3 years at current company - no promotion (hired directly into lvl 2 role due to education)
   * internal leadership rotational program - 3 different technical roles in separate topics
   * 2 years at other big 5 defense contracting company for internships
* Extracurriculars
   * volunteering lead for STEM education in local communities - leverages partnership with company \~2 hours a week
   * Former college athlete (D3)
   * avid esports enthusiast (I was bored during covid okay?)
* Undergrad school / major:
   * top US liberal arts school (top 10)
   * Physics
* Other education:
   * Masters in Mechanical Engineering (Ivy league grad program)
* Race: white
* Sex: male

**Stats**

* GMAT Q49, V41, IR5 (oof - does this matter?) AWA 6
* GPA: 3.4 / 3.4 (undergrad - physics , grad - mechanical engineering) 

My questions for you:

* Am I in the running for Wharton/M7? 
* Is my weak IR score an issue? 
* Where am I weakest and how might I improve?
* Any programs in particular I should explore?

I appreciate the feedback and consideration."

I work like 20 hours a week to help myself through school, am taking my hardest course load yet (junior year), and am already applying to internships (why is recruiting SO early!!). does anyone else feel like they can't do it? Of course, engineering is tough, but this is the first time I've gone into a semester genuinely feeling like a might not make it through without dropping a class or bombing something pretty terribly

Has anyone experienced this or does anyone have any tips?"
p5luno,1,2021-08-16,I've been offered a part-time role as a TA for a Trilogy Data Analytics Bootcamp. Would this be a worthwhile time commitment?,_KingCharles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p5luno/ive_been_offered_a_parttime_role_as_a_ta_for_a/,"I've recently been interviewed to be a TA for the Trilogy Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. The bootcamp seems pretty legit: $10,000 tuition, 3-stage interview process with technical portion, competitive pay. However, the interview felt pretty easy for a TA at a pricey bootcamp, which has made be hesitant about accepting the role.

For some information about me, I'm a Junior majoring in computer science and economics and I just completed an internship in a data-related roles, working with SQL, Python, PowerShell, REST APIs, and Excel. I can see how I may be desirable for this role, but is this a worthwhile time commitment for me? I do also still need to learn data structures and algorithms in my own time to prepare for interviews, and I anticipate being a TA to be a 15-20 hour a week commitment. 

If anyone has any experience with TAing for a bootcamp and how desirable that may be for software engineering employers, I'd love to hear any advice you can offer. Thanks!"

today I have a question for you regarding landing an internship without ongoing studies at university. 

Thus, I would like to provide you with a little bit deeper insight into who I am. Currently, I am 19 years old, just graduated from high school. I have 2 years of experience with web development, focusing on JavaScript / Typescript and being familiar with frameworks such as React/Redux, ExpressJs, NestJs... Next year, I plan to take a few language courses in Munich to improve my German. In the meantime, I would like to work as an Intern Software Engineer to gain some worthy experience before I enroll in the university. 

So the question is, is it possible to land such an internship? And if so, could you recommend to me some companies? (For instance, you have a great experience with them) Or is there someone who would take me under their wings? 

Internship

Location: possibly Munich, remote is also a possibility

Duration: 3-12 months

A great way to do it is a simple blog or website that can be laid out to expand on your resume.

The story of your design portfolio can also be used to make up for subpar grades and be evidence of being able to apply the science, not just pass a test. In some cases, your design portfolio can demonstrate that you might actually have the experience comparable to 5 years vs 2 years especially if your portfolio comprises system level design where you were hands on with the design, manufacturing, budgeting, programming, and validation. The earlier you start making it, the easier it is to do well. Also you can document everything and then create subdivisions to highlight the projects that mattered for what you wanted to do. It also gives you the opportunity to practice for the expected interview questions: eg what was most difficult problem to overcome and how did you solve it.

p5sqaq,1,2021-08-16,Switch Bachelor's major to Computer Science or go to Master's in Computer Science?,Nikalinov,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/p5sqaq/switch_bachelors_major_to_computer_science_or_go/,"Hello! I’m quite excited because that’s my first post on Reddit after much time reading it! Sorry for my poor English in advance.

I’m Ukrainian student currently pursuing Bachelor’s degree in Economics (already finished 2 academic years). A university is one of the best in Ukraine but isn't known across the world, if it matters. Several moths ago I discovered and finished couple of online introductory programming courses and realized that I'm much more interested in programming than things like economic analysis, Micro- and Macroeconomics etc. Also, my favourite discipline in high school and university were maths.

Eventually, after long hours of thinking, I've decided to pursue one of 2 options, but really struggling to choose what will be better (even after dozens of read similar topics on Reddit and Quora):

1. Change my current major from Economics to Computer Science, particularly re-enroll to another major (still in this university, not abroad). In Ukrainian universities students can't change majors, add minors or double major, the maximum is to take some ""free choice"" disciplines. I was also informed that even going to second year of Computer Science program (which means lowering by 1 year because I've already finished my 2nd year of study) might be too hard due to the lack of CS subjects on my current program, so re-entering the first year should be better option.
2. Try to enroll to Master's in Computer Science abroad. Unfortunately, there are no solid Master's programs which are recognized abroad so the only option is getting good graduate degree in Computer Science abroad.

It seems like getting solid Master's in Computer Science abroad with Economics undergraduate degree from unknown university is more complicated path than re-enrolling if I want to be Software enginner. As I said earlier, I can take several courses which aren't related to Economics, like Java programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture etc., but I'm afraid that it will be not nearly enough to study advanced CS (in case I will be applied, which is also a challenge). However, Master's is really helpful and almost required when it comes to Machine Learning Engineering, for example. Of course, I haven't realized yet which I like more, MLE or SWE, but seems like Data Science or Analytics definitely less interesting for me than engineering work (I had Statistics in my 2nd year of study, it was quite interesting but not as programming and building something).

My family doesn't have enough finances to afford 2-year US, Canada or UK Master's for me. I also heard that scholarships are really rare for non-research degrees, and with non-CS Bachelor's getting any scholarships and grants for Master's in good university is nearly impossible in my opinion. The maximum I can afford financially is to get some European graduate degree (Germany, Netherlands etc.) if I manage to enroll with my non-CS background.

If my goal is to get a tech job in US one day, will EU Master's worth to get? Let's say I will be more interested in Machine Learning Engineering than regular Software Engineering. Even if I get EU CS Master's and get the MLE position, there is much less information about relocation ML-specified specialists than regular Software Engineers from EU to US.

On the other hand, with restarting my studying I will have plenty of time for applying to different SWE internships abroad. For example, if I manage to get internship and then offer in Europe at some big company which has Headquarters in US, then I could be eligible for L1 visa, relocate and eventually get Greencard.

Of course, I understand that it's not as easy as it seems to be from my assumptions, but overall isn't option with Master's more complicated and contains more unpredictablity if the end goal is relocation to US?

In your opinion, which option is better in this case, first or second? Haven't I missed any other important thighs to consider?

Thanks for reading such a long post! I will greatly appreciate any pieces of advice!"

I had developed an interest in programming and CS pretty late into my college career (end of sophomore year, about 1.5 years ago) did some research and really fell in love with it and wanted to do it as a career. I tried to switch my major to CS but I wasn’t allowed to by my university due to me being too far ahead with credit hours and all. Since I developed my interest I have been doing a lot of self teaching and project building using YouTube, Codecademy and Udemy. I have also been practicing my interview skills and core CS fundamentals as well (DS&amp;A, Big O and all that) on LeetCode/AlgoExpert. I even got a software engineering internship which I just finished this summer for a startup here in Texas. I am now starting to apply and prepare for full time roles as I am going to graduate in a year. My question is should I stay in school a bit longer and get a minor in CS or do my masters in CS after I graduate. Would it be worth it to do either, both or none of them?"

I was offered an internship working for 40 hours over the summer that I was taking off. A couple of fellow students were also interested in this position, but I was selected after my code interview.

I asked my manager at work to reduce my hours to 12 so that I can attend college this fall.

Since I'm out of state, I also applied for some TA positions and out of luck landed an amazing TA Job(20 hours/week), that cuts my fees by half effectively making me in-state for this semester. This is a very basic ""service desk"" job that needs me to attend to email/phone and some other logistics stuff. Since it is hard for me to pass this job up, I signed up for this job too.

I've the following questions:

\- Does anyone have any experience doing two jobs in Grad school taking 4 credits in the Fall semester?

\- Is it good etiquette to end my internship to make way for others in my class since I landed a TA position? I really don't want to since I see a future with this company and we've an amazing team, but since the workload is high, I don't want to work more than 12 hours this semester. I'm also worried if my boss at the internship may ask me how I'm able to allocate 20 hours to the TA job while I'm working only 12 hours with the internship, I'm really not sure how they'd take it, and I'm freaking out if I've to pass up on either. Should I let my boss know upfront about the TA position?

Any experiences/suggestions/recommendations on how to navigate this are welcome.

Thank you for your time!"

I am a recent graduate with a major in industrial design. Soon after graduating I landed a part time job (about 10-15 hours a week) doing some pretty in-depth industrial design work remotely for a small firm. However, I need to start making some more money with consistent weekly hours to pay for rent, and start paying back student loans. So I started applying to internships to get my foot in the door at other companies! I have applied to countless internships for industrial design, so many that I am running out of options from online postings. I have gotten contacted by a few places asking for interviews, which leads me to my dilemma…

I received an offer from a fairly reputable design firm out of state (it is in San Fransisco) which is awesome! It is a 3 month, paid position working with some great designers! But now I actually need to figure out if I can take it or not. Weighing out the pros and cons has been a struggle. Pros include it being great experience, looks good on my resume, builds connections, and it would be a new experience for me working in a completely different state! The cons however are that most of the pay would need to go to rent/groceries, i am feeling some major industrial design burnout (especially if I were to work full time internship, and part time contract work), my girlfriend of 7 years and I have been planning to move to a new location in our state for a while now and she has just gotten offered her dream career, and I do not feel as passionate about this offer as I once thought I would feel. 

Having graduated only 2.5 months ago I feel I am moving forward fairly quickly with getting interviews, offers, and even contract work. But I am not sure if I am missing out big time if I don’t take this position? It’s been tearing me apart a bit and I would love some outsider input!

I would really appreciate any insight, wisdom, or general opinions! Thank you so much all 😊 also, feel free to ask any clarifying questions, I am happy to answer!"
p5xqfu,1,2021-08-17,Boss wants me to sign a contract agreeing I work for free while training to be a dog groomer [CA],throwawaydoggroomer,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5xqfu/boss_wants_me_to_sign_a_contract_agreeing_i_work/,"I don't think any of my coworkers or my boss uses reddit, but I would rather not chance it. This situation feels ridiculous and I want advice on what specific laws are on my side for this.

I work at a dog grooming salon. I started as a bather and have gotten to learn other jobs like reception and even some grooming tips and skills from just talking to grooming coworkers. I have told my boss since coming I want to help how I can and being a groomer sounds fun and would love to learn from this business to become one.

I understood from the get go how a number of things would go down. I have to pay for my own tools, I get a set percentage commission from each dog I groom, etc. A lot of what I was told and prepared for by other employees made a lot of sense. Until my coworker and I were alone one late day and explained why she turned in her notice that she's leaving once she moves in a few months.

She told me that our boss tried some sketchy shit when she first trained her to be a groomer and even now she wants to honestly consider lawyering up against our boss due to potential retaliation she suffered. The way it all sounded seemed so absurd at first. She told me this both to share and warn me and I took her words with a grain of salt, as my boss has been distant but never broke any laws from what I know about her. A part of me hoped if this was all true that my boss had learned from this and would be more ethical at this point. I was wrong.

I was told Friday (writing this Monday night) that she would call me Sunday on my day off and go over the general assessment of my transition to training and that I had to sign a contract before starting training.

Jump to Sunday late afternoon and she finally calls me. It all goes as I expected, but then when we discuss payment, she tells me I won't get any. When asking her to explain, she states she's giving me a $5,000 skill that I would have to pay a school that kind of money to learn it so she believes it's fair to not pay me while I train until I become my own groomer. I'm still expected to pay for my kit with this in mind, and she also mentioned how after I become my own groomer there's a preliminary period where a portion of my commission goes back into the shop to repay her for teaching me this skill on top of not paying me.

I told her that made me uncomfortable and that I needed time to consider my options and consider negotiation options that would be fair to her. She spent the rest of the phone call trying to convince me this was an amazing opportunity and deal for me. 

She mentioned earlier too that she had a lawyer look over the contract, but I doubt it as California has some strict unpaid internship rules. She asked what time I would have a solid answer and I told her Tuesday, as that was the expected day I would sign the contract.

I went over labor laws trying to find anything specific to call her out for, but not even 20 minutes later she calls me back saying she really needs an answer now so she can know if she needs to look for another groomer. I felt this was rude, but I told her no unless she was willing to negotiate. Her only offer to negotiate is that she would waive the preliminary period for my commissions, but that I would still train without payment. I said until she was willing to change the contract further, it would be a no from me.

Due to this all being over the phone, I never got to see the contract to see what the hard deadlines were for everything. She would throw out numbers like 3-4 months of training and a month of preliminary commission work, but without the contract I can't see for sure if she actually states deadlines which means she could try and keep me working for free for months longer. It also discourages me that she said she was still discussing estimated training periods with my potential teacher yet already had the contract ready.

Another aspect I don't agree with is she compares this training to a school, but a quick google search shows all the schools that ask for high payment fees offer a grooming kit as part of the class cost and they give certificates, and licenses after finishing the classes. I know there is no way she could do the same so this training is solely so she can have me work with her, but I wouldn't have any paperwork if I were to leave this job that might credit my grooming to any other company.

The phone call left with her stating I could stay a bather and I agreed that would be best. She texted me saying she wants to go over all this with me in person. I worry it'll just be her trying to pressure me more in person and I would like some info on whether what she's doing is truly legal and just dumb, or actually illegal. I don't have the contract yet, but if I get a copy soon I'll update everyone with the official contract jargon. Thank you and sorry for such a long recap, if I've left anything off I'll do my best to respond with what I have."

Greetings, I am one our people's diplomats. If you are reading this, then, please take heed of the lessons our species learned whilst trying to join the galactic community.

It is often said that one must judge another not by their deeds that day but their actions through their lifetime. One cannot live a life of debauchery and expect to swiftly gain the trust of newfound peers. This is a lesson we learned the hard way as a species.

Now nearly two centuries ago, our scientists made the startling discovery that yes, in fact, we were not alone. There had been a, now irrelevant, theory that our species was the first in the galaxy. As it happens to be the case, we were simply not using the right tools to communicate. On that fateful day when we discovered a faster than light communication network in the subspace of our galaxy, we knew that our time had come to enter the galactic stage. The network was dubbed the ""FTL-Net"" for ease of reference.

We had all but exhausted our stellar resources. Every moon was colonized, every asteroid having been mined or in the process of it, and every planet fractured into some form of multinational fresco. We waged endless wars on ourselves. We committed crimes against each other as far back as our history goes. Our corporations stripped nature of every last source of life, perhaps only the insects and pests that followed us into space now remain to this day. A monument to plethora of life we once had back home.

Now, our hungry eyes looked to the galaxy at large. Communications at FTL meant that there must, truly, be FTL travel. Our myriad of politicians pressed our technological research forward, demanding more of the galaxy be open to our growing needs as a species. After all, the nearest civilization we could eavesdrop on was several light-years away. Rapid expansion would secure our foothold for our own species. For our... rightful governments, who could not agree which ""ruler"" should ""rule."" The resulting wars were only another footnote in our history of violence.

In the end, it was corporate representatives that ended up representing our home star. Everyone could agree on one fact: no one could sell a better deal to a potential alien than our best businessmen. After all, did we really want to present our unified military to the galaxy? To look like a hardened species hungry for blood? No, we must mask that part of us in order to safely expand and build our military.

A decade later, our presence on the FTL-Net was noticed. Our best businessmen, lawyers, marketeers, and managers were selected to represent our interests. Soon a ship with a coveted FTL drive arrived to retrieve our ""diplomats."" We, truly, had no idea what sort of situation we had truly stepped into.

The massive vessel quite dwarfed our own people's ships. It was large, hard edged, and built like a flying brick. Our vessel docked within one of its cargo ports and we were assured our ""habitable atmospheric needs"" were quite similar to the occupants of the vessel. The humidity, unexpectedly high, was the most notable difference. Moist and musky is the best way it could be described.

The representatives of the so called ""Galactic Common Interest Comity"" met us on the landing bay. They were absolutely massive! Towering! Similar to us in many ways: bipedal, forward eyes, two limbs, a head. However we simply did not expect to be so dwarfed by these individuals. Now, compared to them, we felt like children dressed in business attire, attempting to play at adult things.

They lead us to a meeting room with fine wooden chairs, plush leather seating, and green plants in pots. Our representative laid out his paperwork and began simple introductions with these aliens. Everything seemed to be going well enough, everyone seemed to be getting along. Except...

""What is it your species has to offer for the well being of the galactic community?"" Their leader questioned us outright. Before any formal negotiations had began. We looked at each other, stammered, not having expected such a blunt question. 

Our representative leader began, ""Well, we are highly industrialized, eager to learn and grow with the community. Our best traits are research and development along with a strong economic backbone. We could only benefit the galaxy as a whole as we grow into our role for you.""

The alien pursed its lips, then pulled them back to reveal its teeth, ""Yes, I'm sure you have,"" he said in a perfect mastery of our language. ""No, we have watched your species for centuries. You spent a century locked in a war where all sides had the mastery of nuclear power. Ready to wipe each other out at the touch of as button.""

""I-well yes but we have learned sinc-"" our representative was cut off.

""Your kind has spent centuries in endless stellar warfare. Rooted historically in generations of genocide, religious persecution, and discrimination of those who do not fit the expectations of whoever wields the power. You strip your worlds of all life and resources. Locusts. Your people are locusts to the galaxy. You would repeat your past on a galactic scale, threatening our peace and stability we have worked very hard for,"" he said calmly as he brought his hands together, lacing the fingers.

We stood shocked. Not only had they known about our existence, they also knew of our storied past. It was true, we were not the most loving species that could exist. Yet, were there any that weren't? We replied, several of us at once. ""Well that was back then and..."" ""We can learn, please guide us!"" ""What had to be done was done for our survival..."" ""Well, really, we're just a bunch uneducated savages... what did you expect?""

The collective thought process of our species representatives came to a grinding to a halt at that last remark. My remark. I was one of our lowest ranked members. An intern who came on this trip only by the financial clout of my family, and I had just blurted out the worst possible admittance! The alien raised his eyebrows at this and then replied, ""Everyone, quiet, please. Let him explain what he means.""

""I-I meant no disrespect to our species or any others. It's just that... how can you expect us to know how to behave to galactic standards when we don't even know what we're doing? We're unorganized. Still growing as a species. Really, what sort of society expects a civilization to grow into a space faring one without using the resources at hand? How can we industrialize and not ruin our climates? How can we sort our differences without some sort of conflict? Is the galaxy a peaceful place?"" I asked, focusing on the alien.

A long pause. Everyone had their eyes on me, the idiot who had spoken to bluntly. Had I walked into some political trap? Had the alien's casual nature so far meant to lull a weak link in the chain to break early? Slowly the gazes of the room shifted back to the alien representative. Not a sound could be heard except the thrum of the ship reactor and climate control systems.

""Yes, well, you see we were once like you. Rabidly expanding without care nor cause but to satisfy our insatiable hunger for growth and power.  We stripped our world of all life through industry and war. Earth was never the same and still isn't. Our mining vessels destroyed the natural beauty of Saturn's rings. Our colonists decimated the native populations of nearby stars. Centuries of human history was repeating itself endlessly. Our people would rationalize that you can't get an omelette without breaking an egg. The the destruction of the 'old' was necessary for the 'new.' That mankind had no other option but to consume. Even though a few visionaries tried to stop us, we continued our path of wanton growth for thousands of years.""

""Yet, soon, we found ourselves alone. What was the point? Another war? Another ruined planet? What did we have to leave our children?  Our legacy? What meaning is the next advancement in technology or a multi-generational war if it costs us unique life or breath taking vistas? Too late we learned that we had to respect the natural order of life. It was irreplaceable. Every world was unique. Every organism precious. Every life valid. Our history had gained us nothing but loneliness and regret. An empire of dust.""

""Humanity vowed to improve how we go about doing things. Our efforts were now into reversing the damage we had done. In light of this decision, we founded the Galactic Common Interest Comity. To help ourselves and other species understand what is needed to live without excessive destruction. You will be offered a position in the council and will need to prove your civilization can mature. To accept its mistakes like we once did and grow. Until then you will not be permitted to join the galactic community.""

I stammered in my reply as the rest of my species stared at the human in shock, ""Then how can we become like you? What do we need to learn to not destroy ourselves?!""

""Moderation and humility,"" he repeated with a smile, ""Moderation and humility."""

In terms of curriculum, the computer science and data science majors are almost identical and I’d still end up taking all of the important CS classes as a data science major (about 8 CS classes total). 

From a recruiting/career standpoint, is there a big difference between the two majors and will data science in my resume exclude me from getting a SWE internship for next summer or corner more towards analyst roles? Will my school name give me some leeway in the internship/job search and give me the same opportunities as a traditional CS major from a different school even though my resume doesn’t not explicitly say “computer science”? I’ve heard different things from different people, and as much as I’d love to major in CS, I’m not sure if it’s entirely possible at the moment.

My only option of doing an internship before I graduate is next summer before my senior year, and as a transfer student, I feel very behind the crowd. If anyone has any advice, I’d really appreciate it."

p5zcoj,3,2021-08-17,TIFU by not registering my tram ticket.,UltimateJDX,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p5zcoj/tifu_by_not_registering_my_tram_ticket/,"Mandatory this happened yesterday.

Context: where I live public transport has no entry control, the city just periodically sends a wave of workers that check everyone's tickets when they're inside the tramway, if you don't have one or it's not registered then they fine you and the value depends if you pay the fine on the spot or not

Context part 2: I'm an international student from Colombia in the EU. My home country is not known for having a valuable currency and all my income comes from my father, he's paying for everything while I'm here doing a double degree.

So, since I'm under 25 y/o I can buy an unlimited monthly pass that's only required to be registered once for an entire month, although, for August I didn't have a lot of stuff to do so I made numbers and it was cheaper for me to actually buy individual tickets rather than the monthly pass. however those individual tickets need to be registered before you get inside the tramway. You can see where this is going.

And thus we arrive to the FU, yesterday I was going out for some groceries to a store that is at the other side of the town that closes early so I was in a bit of a hurry. Got to the tram stations and phased out, once in the tram I was completely distracted and the guys that check the tickets got in, they asked me for my card and I was relaxed because normally I buy monthly tickets that require just one reg for the month and I was like ""sure, whatever"". To my surprise they saw that I had the ticket but I didn't registered it so of course they fined me, since I did not expect that when they told me that I had to pay now or go with other (more expensive options) I thought those were cheaper in the long run (they offered me the option to buy a year long subscription to override the fine, per month is cheaper than the monthly subscription but still over 170USD) but in reality the best action for me would have been to just simply pay the fine (like 70USD on site) and buy an aftermarket bike and never take tramway again. Since I preferred the yearly subscription option I now have lost the chance to pay the ""cheaper"" fine and now I'm stuck between having to pay 170 dollars for a year long sub (one that might not need entirely if I find an internship outside the city for the second half of the academic year) or paying 100 dollars of fine for nothing and then get a bike that's around 40 dollars extra.

So now I'm here trying to make numbers and deciding what's best for me in this case, I have absolutely no money since I just moved out to a place that's cheaper in the long run but that depends on student and housing assistance. I feel like absolute crap since I'm burning money that isn't mine, rn the only think that can help me is to get a job so I can pay my Fups with my own hard earned money and not my father's, I have an interview tomorrow in a McDonald's so wish me luck.

Oh, and the store I went in the first place was completely closed due to vacations. F my life.

TL ; DR : I forgot to register my Tram Ticket, got fined, I have no money and I feel like shit because I depend on my father financially. Only thing that can help me is to find a Job fast."

They were never quiet, my fast breathing was so loud and I shook violently each time, but now I end up on the floor shaking like a fish, I feel like I am being choked and I scream really loud without any control over it. Also can't get up for a while after it has stopped, and I keep choking for a long time afterwards.

​

One of my parents' health is getting worse and I think they are heading to death. I am not attached to either of them anymore after plenty of things happened.

​

I am on a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and currently looking for some digestive stuff and diabetes. Almost every food gives me pain.

​

I failed to get into uni, due to things going south around the time of the entrance exams and I just didn't try at all.

​

Financially it's a mess, I barely have food at home lately and if my parent dies, that means no home either. I've been rejected from jobs, mostly due to my appearance I think. Lost one, that was basically an internship and wouldn't go on, either way, for more than a few months after the point I stopped, due to health issues.

​

I am registered on some classes, but it got messed up with covid and the few times we did have to go in spring, ended up having panic attacks in front of everyone or skipping class before panic took the best of me. Also having to wear long sleeves in really hot weather because I was too conscious of my hands (I have way more hair than females do and am tired to shave it off everytime as it grows real quick and looks even more ugly, but I feel badly about my skin being visible even when it's not about hair). Will have to go back, but I am sure \*the panic will happen again\* and it is worse now, as I wrote above.

​

My body is full of stretch marks due to my weight, similar to that of a whale. My belly looks like an animal clawed the hell out of it.

​

I get avoidant with everything. Like, I can even hate any music. I am scared of not being enough for people and making it all worse for them, so I leave when they are facing a problem or when I feel they are trying to get away from me. Pretty much like totally vanishing. I know I suck. I lost good people that way, but I'm sure it's way, way better for them. I am very useless.

​

I panic at doing anything, I can handle doing, like, 1 thing, but tell me to do more and I just can't breathe.

​

I have only one friend left that I feel immense guilt for and I hate myself when I miss even a message they send me and constantly worry about them to the point of panic, but they really don't give a damn about me. If I mention something about myself, it's ignored or if I say that they don't care about me, they say they'll leave me. It's come to the point I don't sleep so I'll be awake if something happens to them, or where I am on my phone all the time, just in case. I'm just constantly scared and worried for them.

​

I am drowning in guilt.

​

I am also dizzy so often, and can't walk more than a short distance without feeling like the world spins.

​

​

I don't know what the hell I am alive for.

What should I do?"

I am a junior CS major at an online university applying to internships. I left my old school, a reputable engineering school, due to a staggering number of problems regarding fit. I did two years of chemical engineering coursework; I realized I didn't even like the major as I was leaving. 

**What am I doing wrong?**

I feel like I am nearing insanity and beginning to consider if a successful career is even plausible. I have been applying to internships nearly every day for the past four months. I do one or two applications on busy days and about ten over the weekend, yet I have only had one interview. I hardly ever even get OA's. In fact, the  OA's I received in the last four months can be counted on one hand. I either receive an immediate rejection, or I have to suffer the torturous silence of being ghosted.

I work a full-time job while I am doing the degree. This leads to me not having a whole lot of free time, but I spend it wisely. I spend at least one weekend a month working on a project, start to finish. I can admit that my projects aren't impressive, but they demonstrate my ability to code. I bought and read Cracking the Coding Interview and revisit it regularly. While I don't do LeetCode as often as I should, I make an effort to do a problem now and then. However, I did revisit material I struggled with in my DSA course, read Grokking Algorithms, and watched hours of YouTube videos.

Despite having modified my resume four times, I continue to get the same outcome. It seems that they are never good enough. I received two ""resume follow-up"" emails from recruiters but was immediately rejected by the hiring manager. I don't know what to do. If this was a joke, the punch line would be that I actually love the work I have been doing to prepare. I took my copy of Grokking Algorithms and a notebook on vacation and genuinely enjoyed reading it and doing LeetCode problems. I'm just getting tired of being rejected. It's beginning to feel like I won't break into the industry.

**TL;DR:** I am a junior applying to internships. I have only had one interview and four OA's in the last four months. I apply to internships every day and do a lot of prep work. Basically, I am beginning to doubt myself and lose hope. The worst part is that I love learning all this stuff and putting the time in."

p69web,1,2021-08-17,Fork in the Road: Two Paths in Life for Me,CleverFox3,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/p69web/fork_in_the_road_two_paths_in_life_for_me/,"I'll be honest, my current situation professionally isn't too bad. I got two liberal arts degrees but wound up in a software implementation role out of undergrad, since I went to a decent university. I realize that I'm very fortunate to be making a solid salary and work in a growing industry with those degrees. I could probably continue down my current path for a while before running into any significant road blocks. That being said, there's just something about this path that is uninspiring to me and I'd like to change. Additionally, I feel somewhat like a fish out of water without significant technical skills. 

My strengths are in analytical skills, critical thinking, logic and reasoning as well as strategy. Weakness at the moment is technical skills/technical problem solving. I can work with clients (currently do) but wouldn't mind leaving that behind. 

As of now, I see two potential paths to fulfillment, one that is more interest based and the other that is safer, more financially rewarding/secure and potentially has a higher ceiling. Both would likely require getting further education, which I'm fine with since it provides me with more security. 

**1st path follow my intellectual curiosity and passion into policy/diplomacy/public service:**

I studied Econ and International Studies in undergrad with the hopes of going into diplomacy or public policy. This has been a passion of mine since I was a kid in Model UN. 

What I found was that it was very difficult to break into entry-level roles. I had an internship at the UN that was exciting and tantalizing to some extent, since I couldn't get an entry-level role full-time after. It was a fulfilling internship. I then interned in Congress and same deal, interesting stuff, but couldn't get that full-time entry-level role to kick off a more stable career here. This was 4 years ago. I have since kind of doubted this path (even after leaving it) for a few reasons: 

1- Financial instability: Whether I got a job for the federal gov or in Congress as an Aide, job security comes in waves of 2, 4 and 6 years at a time. That combined with the meager wages of public servants would lead to some financial insecurity. This wasn't something I'd considered in university, but I've appreciated it a lot more lately. I've got generalized anxiety as well, which compounds this concern into something I'd carry with me daily. 

The counter to this is that I've built up a decent amount of personal savings from working in consulting the last 2-3 years. It's a cushion, but I was also hoping to retire some day. 

2- Lack of exit opportunities: There are some policy jobs in the private sector for sure. Non-profits and thinktanks as well. That said, this is a very limited pool of exit opportunities relative to a technical field or something like consulting in the private sector. If I lost my job in public service, I'd have little savings due to #1 and not many immediate opportunities to jump into to replace that lost income. 

3- The masters programs required for this route (MPP, MSFS, MA) tend to have a lower ROI in their career placements. I'd probably do a dual degree for this reason, maybe getting an MBA/MPP or something like that. That's a three year program. 

4- The floor is pretty low in this path. Ceiling could be high though. I'd probably need to reframe my idea of 'success' in this instance. 

The pros here are obvious. It's fulfilling, it's meaningful work that creates impact and it's intellectually stimulating. I'd really like the quality of the work itself. The day-to-day would be great, but I don't know how high the ceiling is. The most pie in the sky outcome would be running for office, but even then I don't see how I'd do that with the financial strain I'd incur along the way. Some other great career outcomes would be World Bank, UN, IMF, etc. 

Ultimately, I couldn't break into this field with just a bachelors degree, and wound up going into my current role after graduating to pay the bills and build up savings. Going down path 1 would be taking another bite at the apple. 

 **2nd path follow a safer route into something more tech driven, then wield it towards passions later on:**

Having worked in software implementation I'm thinking of doubling down and adding technical skills, but technical skills that get me into more of a strategic or development role where I can play to my strengths in analyzing things or ideating things to build. One issue with my current role is I feel like a fish out of water. If I could learn data science, for example, and a bit of product development languages, I think I'd have a sky-high career trajectory in any industry. My ultimate pie-in-the-sky goal for this path would be entrepreneurship and building a product. To take that a step further, maybe something in social entrepreneurship that serves my interests in public service but without sacrificing that financial stability. 

The educational path for this would have a higher ROI, but would probably be a dual degree as well. Maybe an MBA/MSCS (computer science) or MBA/MSDS (Data Science or information science).  Both are also 2.5-3 year programs. 

The drawbacks to this path would be:

1- Subject matter isn't interesting to me: I don't really care about CS. It is more of a skillset to acquire and then apply to societal problems. The application of this skillset is what would matter to me, but the process of learning it might be excruciating. 

2- Day-to-Day post-grad: If I exited grad school into an employed role, I don't know how fulfilling my day-to-day work life would be. I can't imagine myself coding for 6-8 hours a day. This would, of course, be more or less a means to an end. This assumes a technical exit though, and it is possible I use these skills for more analytical/strategic purposes which more fit me. 

The pros here are that I could apply these skills to public service/other industries that are more rewarding for me later on. Additionally, I'd never have to worry about job/financial security like I would with the first path, as this is a very lucrative path. I'd probably always have a pretty cushy life, even if I took the chance at social entrepreneurship. I think the potential ceiling AND potential floor are higher in this path than the first one, the major drawback being that the day-to-day isn't as fulfilling. I know that at some point, I'd probably hate the day-to-day here. That said, the path to the really high-achieving outcomes (running for office, being a CEO of my own company, building something to fix societal problems, etc) are more numerous.

While there are students that have done research in their desired field, have volunteered at a prestigious organization, created their own company or nonprofit, etc,, you don't have to go at the same pace as them. It's perfectly fine that you still have no idea what schools you want to apply to or even what you want to major in. I promise that we'll all figure it out together. 

Doing ""nothing"" this summer is actually a blessing in disguise. You're getting a much-needed break to just relax and explore more aspects of yourself. Besides, you could've done other things this summer like getting your license or working a job to support your family. Even if you didn't achieve any ""milestones"" this summer, you continued advancing your skillsets like learning how problem-solve and   when you have to put the sheets on the bed. We learn new things everyday. Just because you didn't shadow a doctor or did an internship at some company doesn't mean you didn't learn anything. You just learned different things that may be more valuable than the activities I mentioned above. 

While summer is coming to a close, I know a bunch of y'all are disappointed of making ""no progress"" this summer. I know what it's like seeing students younger than you on LinkedIn having more awards to their name than their literal age. And while it may seem like you're running out of time, you actually have a lot of time left. 

**The school year is just beginning, not ending.** 

Now that you're well-rested, you're ready for the upcoming hectic school year. Use that to your advantage and focus on doing your best. Just be sure to take care of your physical and most importantly your mental health. Don't push yourself so hard that you break. It's easier to prevent damage to your health than it is to fix it. 

And to my seniors, I know everything is coming fast at us. We may feel like we should've done something in junior year and now it's too late. But I'm here to tell you that it's never late to start anything. 

Focus on doing your best this year and enjoy the ride. 

I'm so proud of y'all for how hard everyone has worked so far. Let's make the upcoming school year the best one yet!!!

TL;DR: It's okay that you haven't done anything this summer. Use that to your advantage and make this school year the best one yet!"

If the trouble is you don't know your stuff, then go study and practice practice practice. If you know your stuff, but get too nervous and perform badly, here's what he told me: **Pretend like the interviewer is a friend/colleague you work with who is coming to you asking help for a problem they're stuck on.**

What does this do? If you can really convince yourself, it keeps you and interviewer on a level playing field, meaning that you aren't too intimidated: you work together. They're stuck, so it's okay if you get a little stuck too, so you don't need to worry about taking time to think or not understanding it right away. And it reminds you to clearly state your thought process because they don't know how to solve it either.

I know a lot of us are going through new grad or internship interviews and are super stressed.  Hope this helps someone (it's helped me relax a lot too and have more fun)! Happy coding and good luck!"

\-Jumping the motherboard instead of using the power button

I inspected both the inside and outside of the computer and I can't find any damage at all. I also checked all of the connections to and from the PSU and they are all secure.

I already filed a claim with UPS (I used their pack and send guarantee service and paid for insurance), but I'm worried they won't approve it because there is no obvious physical damage.

Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this, or how to get UPS to accept my claim?

Hello redditors! 
How's it going? 
I'm a fellow bangladesi student, studying in Germany. 
I'm almost done with my Bachelor, just Thesis in next semester. I've learned the basics of SAP ERP, ABAP, Power BI, Excel, Java, Python, and Web Development. 

Moreover, I'm interested to work with either SAP ERP or ABAP and Power BI. 
I haven't done any internship, intend to do in next semester. But still confused which job career to focus on. 
I have few questions! And they are; 

*What are the best jobs in this direction? 
*What are the real activities of an ""Informatiker""
*How about being a Data Analyst or IT Specialist, is it possible?"
p6dvzi,1,2021-08-17,"Should I speak to HR/someone first, or just leave?",carbondragon,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/p6dvzi/should_i_speak_to_hrsomeone_first_or_just_leave/,"I am the sole IT person for a small-ish government software contractor (65 employees, 45 or so of whom work remotely on contracts) in Alabama. I was originally hired through my college as an intern under the then-sole IT person. The plan was that I would handle the helpdesk-type work and let them focus on more involved projects and be more of a SysAdmin. They never trained me on anything so I never really progressed in my career, even once I was brought on full-time. They left the company somewhat unexpectedly about a year after I went full-time and all the IT stuff suddenly fell into my lap since now my direct manager is the Facilities Manager who knows nothing about IT (they don't want any part of IT, either; their words, not mine).

At the time, I handled this pretty well and got myself up to speed on how to keep things running. I was given a pretty big raise as a result, assuring me that the company was confident in my work. However, the gov't issued a big cybersecurity push for contractors last year and I'm pretty much the only person in the organization who understands anything about it. Because of that, I'm being expected to handle this whole situation pretty much on my own, while still keeping the lights on. I feel like my own project manager sometimes as my actual Manager pushes even stuff meant for managers (according to our SOPs) down to me.

I am not a manager and I am not a cybersecurity expert. I have Security+ and, prior to this position, a few years' experience helping in the IT shop in high school. I've asked for both a full time cybersecurity person to manage me/the project, or an intern to take work off me and let me become a cybersecurity expert. The company is really weird about money so both have been denied. I did finally convince them to get me some help from a cybersecurity consultant, but the way the contract reads, it won't be any real relief. I can't seem to get it across to management that there just isn't enough of me to go around to handle both maintenance and this new workload. We're also currently barred from working overtime, which I wouldn't want anyway.

The whole situation is incredibly stressful and has been for almost a year now. At this point, I'm almost positive I want to leave but since this is my first job, I don't really know how to job search. I'm also not sure if this is just how work...works, I guess? Like, is it normal to be this stressed all the time in IT? I can't ask my Manager because they're kind of the source of the issue since they refuse to learn about my work. Should I speak to HR or something before making my final decision on whether to leave? Should I mention that I'm considering leaving if I do talk to someone? I feel like it could be a bargaining chip, but might also push them toward letting me go before I can leave on my own."

I was wondering if I would be in a better position to get an internship of a junior dev position after graduating. Or, should I just wait until i gain more experience once I go for my BS?"
p6eppj,2,2021-08-17,Junior CS student in need of some advice.,RamenNoodlesBruh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6eppj/junior_cs_student_in_need_of_some_advice/,"Just came out of an interview for an internship position at a local company. Although I wasn't selected to move on, the interviewer was nice enough to give me some advice regarding my future in CS. What the advice eventually came down to was that I had to narrow my interests. And for this company, in particular, they wanted individuals who specialized in React and node.JS. 

This leads to me. I'm a junior student with no work experience and no U N I Q U E personal project. However, I'm attending a nice university, performing very well academically, and have been part of many societies and clubs.

As such, here are the options that I created for myself.

1. I spend the rest of this summer and upcoming fall creating a personal project that stands out in future applications.
2. I spend the rest of this summer and upcoming fall grinding Leetcode, data structures, and algorithms so that I can ace all future OA's.
3. I spend the rest of this summer and upcoming fall learning all about front-end, mobile, and web development in general.
4. Continue applying for Jobs, get accepted this fall at a nobody company, but at least I'll have some work experience on my resume for future applications.

Personally, I've been thinking of doing option 2 as it sounds pretty fun (I'm also taking data structures this semester so it will be like free tutoring along the way). I've also been getting a ton of OA's from companies but I don't feel like I'll perform well enough, so I want to be more prepared in the future.

In any case, you're listening to the ramblings of an incoming Junior student who is seeing all these Redditors getting internships at Amazon and feels incredibly late to the game.

I don't know how to explain it, but I really want an internship at an F500 company (FAANG, if the tech Gods will it) before I graduate and I hope it's not too late.

Thank you for reading."

I’m going into my 3rd year of the degree. So far all the degree is, is read the chapter and write a paper over the chapter. Just boring stuff that I’m not too interested in sitting and reading and doing. Maybe that’s just college and I just need to push through. 

I have no real world IT experience. I know I need to get an internship soon but it’s been rough. My university has no program for that. They’re very rare on indeed and LinkedIn and I’m not even close to qualified for them since they already want me to have some experience. I’m hoping to land an internship in January at my dads job since he put in a word to their IT director for me. I would like to apply for help desk but being a full time student with all in person classes, it’s just not possible since they all want full time. 

A couple weeks ago I started the Google/Coursera Support Professional Certificate which has been going pretty easy. I know there’s a lot of negative talk about it here but since I’m putting myself through school and living on my own it’s my cheapest option. Each course is supposed to be 6 weeks long but I’m able to get a weeks worth done in an hour or two after I’m off work. So far I’ve done 2/5 courses and started the 3rd today. 

I kind of got off topic and gave a rundown of me, but if I’m not so sure if I like IT work or as a career yet. How did you guys know IT was right for you? Are there any resources you have that can help me find an answer? Or any free things I can do online now to help?"

(Boss wants us to build a Socail Media Website/App),_RachelisAwesome,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6f5xg/internship_expecting_to_much_from_interns_boss/,"Throwaway account for obvoius reasons, don't want to doxx myself. Below is my situation with my current internship. I would like your opinion on the matter. Am I right to feel that me and my other interns are being worked to hard? (TLDR at bottom of page) 

\- Currently a Junior. This Summer I aquired my first internship. The job title, was something basic and entry level. For example: QA Tester Intern with pay, thus, I applied. Fast forward after the interview, that went very well, with no coding questions or test, ( I thought that was a red flag) I was hired. I believed, we would be testing features and learning as interns. At this internship it is me and three other interns that are still in school. At first we started with testing out features, having meetings etc. Nothing out of the norm. Then we started to do UI/UX mockups of the site, which I didn't think was a problem. After some weeks went by, the boss wanted us to start working on the actual website / App. This is due to them having huge investors, that want to invest once they get a beta or MVP released. I normally wouldn't complain on situations like this, if we were given a realistic date of release. Out of the blue in one of our standup meetings, are boss says ""released date of the App is dropping in 10 days, we gotta get to work people."" Silence from us interns, beacause there is so much work that still needs to get done. And tbh my mental health hasn't been the same, since starting this gig. Like is it normal for a job to want interns to be in charge of so much? At this point you could put Jr. dev in front of me and the interns job title, but we still get paid like interns. Also have bosse, who don't understand programming a little is very fustrating. Trying to explain that programming certain features don't work  that way, is super hard to get through and I just feel like this ""billion dollar app"" they want us making is super out of our reach. Or at least my experience level. If you have wached Joshua Fluke on YouTube complain about how a lot of internships or CS Jobs take advantage of their workers once there hired, I can say now, I do agree with what he is saying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: boss wants us interns to code them a soical media website / app like twitter, facebook with post, images, videos etc. Is this way to much to ask of interns even if we are being paid? And we have only been developing for, like 2 months and we have a released date set in September am I wrong to feel this way?"

I'm wondering what internship programs are available to freshman. I heard about Microsoft's Explore program , but what other programs are there that are specifically for freshman? I also want to know what projects I should do to make my resume more competitive. Thanks!"
p6hn0c,0,2021-08-17,GitHub Commits Important?,theme57,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6hn0c/github_commits_important/,"I'm having issues with my IDE and GitHub where when I commit it doesn't show up on the Commit Calendar for my profile, but if you inspect the project my commits show up.

I've been told that having your GitHub showing you make commits frequently is good for internships and finding jobs. Trying to figure out why they aren't showing up, but wondering if any recruiters or hiring staff would care seeing that I have a lot of repositories, but very few of the green commit dots on my page."
p6hs2s,3,2021-08-17,Didn’t get super reprimanded at work but still hurt,Pond-of-The-Tardis,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p6hs2s/didnt_get_super_reprimanded_at_work_but_still_hurt/,"I work at a small historical society as the curator. I’m the only paid employee. I’m essentially in charge several areas of museum work including collections management, setting up exhibits, research, and handling certain interns and volunteers. I’ve never ever wanted a management position because I know with my ADHD it’s hard for me. I’ve always been content to be given instructions on what to do and not have the stress of being in charge. I will admit that since March when I was given the position I’ve been handling the stress pretty well. Almost everyday I have more than 3 people looking for me to get my opinion on something or ask me a question and I’ve handled everything in the best way I can and even have been able to handle multitasking. I’ve had people come up and basically talk at me at the same time and I didn’t have a meltdown or go into panic mode. I work with a lot of senior citizens who are volunteers and they can’t move around very well or go up and down the stairs like I can so I wind up usually going above and beyond. 
I have never ever hidden the fact that I have ADHD and ADHD induced anxiety. I’ve told the President and Vice President of the museum about my issues and it’s never been a big deal. If I forget to do something they remind me and I get the task done it’s not like I don’t ever do something. My brain is focused on multiple tasks and if it gets overloaded I let people know. Right now my brain has been a mess because I’m in the process of changing over an exhibit and there’s a deadline for when it needs to be completed. I’ve been exhausted at the end of the day. 
Today the President of the museum asks me to talk to him and he tells me not to get offended that I’m doing a good job with exhibits and doing things around the museum but he’s not happy with how I keep track of my hours. Since he barely open his email I keep track of my hours on paper. Besides keeping track of my hours I also have fill out this sheet about what percentage of the day I spend doing certain tasks. I get this is for grants and for accountability to the museum board it’s not all because I can’t be trusted. The President told me that if he evaluated me he’d give my work a stellar grading but my lack of not tracking my hours a zero. I do keep track of my hours and keep a kind of journal of the things I do in a day. This guy tells me not to say that I forgot to keep track of everything. In my head I was thinking “is for fucking real right now? How can he fucking say something like that to me?” I was offended and hurt. But then the thoughts flooded in that part of it is my fault I should be more on top of doing that. 
I held this in for as long as i could and finally just broke down and told my parents how I was feeling about the conversation. They asked me why I didn’t say anything back and I told them it’s because I was so angry I didn’t want to go all guns blazing with an attitude. My mom said to have a sit down With the guy and explain how his tone hurt and that he shouldnt talking to me like one of his high school students. I’m a museum professional with a Masters and I’m 33 years old. 
Ugh, I just feel like I was taken back to old jobs where people looked down on me like I was stupid and treated me like a kid. The conversation made me unappreciated  after all the shit I do everyday for the museum and everyone else. Like give me a damn Break I’ll get to writing my hours when I can at the end of the week. 
Right now I’m feeling conflicted about whether I’m bummed out over this because I can be over sensitive or if my feelings are legit. All I know is that I won’t let it affect my work week and wanting to go into work. I (and i think all of us here) work through so much stress that others probably have no idea about. 
I’m sure you guys will get my feeling on this. It sucks right now."

Does anyone else feel this way?",snuj22,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/p6itml/i_feel_more_anxious_before_and_after_social/,"Okay so I obviously get nervous during some social situations, however, the anxiety I feel BEFORE and after (mostly before) certain situations is way bigger. For example, I started an internship three weeks ago and I still get nervous every single day. Before I leave home I always have stomach issues and can’t even have breakfast. I get so sick and my heart starts beating extremely heavily. But when I arrive at work, I feel more at ease, even though I do feel nervous or awkward at times but it’s not a strong feeling. Then when I get home I start overthinking about every “awkward” thing I did, and start thinking that all my coworkers must think I’m so quiet and awkward. 

I really hate this feeling because I literally can’t relax. As soon as I get home from work I start overthinking about everything, and about the next day. Does anyone else goes through this?"

My dream school is JHU so what would yall suggest for me to do before the app is due in order to increase my chance of acceptance? Also, how would yall rate my EC's because I feel like they aren't bad but they also didn't last very long. Thank you for taking the time to look it over for me and good luck to everyone else who is applying this year!"

I got an offer from both IBM and Cognizant. Pretty much similar pay and in the same thing which is data science. IBM is data science role then Cognizant is Graduate Analyst in the AI/Analytics stream. Both are consulting and what I wanna pursue.

While Cognizant is a good company, IBM is better ranked according to Forbes and it is in top 10 places to work globally.

My concern with IBM is the long run, firstly I had work for IBM as an intern for two years. So was thinking it could look bad if I dont diversify my work exp. Then second, IBM uses their own technologies tho i remember hearing in the interview that they sometimes use aws or azure. IBM has its own cloud. Cognizant uses outside technologies which could be better

If people can share their experiences with the companies that would be great or any other advice. Been struggling to decide.

Sociology) starting next month, and I'm almost on the verge of pulling out of this application cycle completely.

I started working on my applications early July, completed my SoP, managed to keep my CGPA over 9.5, worked as a research reviewer, took up even more volunteer work than I was previously involved in.

The pandemic has been hard on me, like so many other people, and I've been taking odd jobs and internships to pay for the whole application process myself, (I'm in my final year of Undergrad in Sociology).

The people I see getting in are these amazing people with tons of research experience, who have worked in government funded projects, etc etc, things I could never live up to. (Also, because in my field, Undergrads aren't considered for these sort of programmes). Also, without the hope of a scholarship, there's no point in even applying, because I'd never be able to afford to go even if by a stroke of luck I manage to get in. 

I am seriously considering dropping out and instead going to a relatively good school here in my own country, because taking a gap year is not an option for me. After putting in months of work, I can sense the burnout taking over.

I've struggled with severe mental health issues over the last two years, and I've categorically been working hard to get better so I can do right by these applications, but I feel like I'm slipping into a really dark place again. 

Any advice y'all can give me, anything at all?"

I am a 24 year old white, male German National, who speaks English, German and Italian fluently and is colloquial in Spanish. 

I also know how to code well in Python and C++, and have experience in Data Science and Analytics.




__Academics__

- Major in Physics, Minor in Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder (Ranked 13th for Physics) 3.08 GPA in the Major, 2.4 GPA Overall

- 1st official GMAT Attempt 13.07.21: __770__ __(Q48|V48|IR8|AWA6)__

During my time at University, I was not particularly interested in Physics, I mostly just decided on it because it was difficult and wanted to pull through with it. I started university before 18 and got interested in other things. 

I did have one standout upper-level semester though, in which I did extremely well and worked diligently, and I believe I can get a good recommendation from one of my professors

During this time I participated in the Robotics Club, had a 1 year-long software engineering internship, learned how to play piano and the guitar (I even uploaded some videos to youtube) and studied spanish and french.

If you guys would like I can add my GMAT preparation in the comments.

__Experience__

- 1 Year in Robotics Club
- 1 Year as Assistant Software Engineer at a small engineering company in Colorado
- 1/2 Year as Junior Software Developer in a Machine Learning Startup in Europe. I believe I can get a stellar recommendation from my employer.
- 3 Months part-time analyst at my father’s law firm while studying for the GMAT (don’t really count this one due to nepotism)

I do also have an online programming presence on GitHub with one or two small projects.

What would you recommend to improve? What should I focus on when applying? Do I stand a chance to enter in a top 20 school?

Thank you in advance!"

I had some help from a teacher and 3rd party (Fiver) with helping solving the problem (equations, hand calculations, FEA) But the help I got was insufficient and I'm doubting the accuracy of it. So I'm still struggling with solving the problem for this project.

The test setup (machine) works as follows: The test operator configures the PLC system (3) so that a Hydraulic power unit (2) (HPU) delivers the correct amount of pressure in the correct time interval. The supplied pressure from the HPU causes the hydraulic actuator, cylinder (4), to move and creates a linear push and pull motion. The sward (5) is connected to the rod of the cylinder. When the hydraulic brake caliper (6) (hydraulic brake system) is under pressure, it will clamp the sward. The feet supports of the Test-bench (1) are placed on 8 rubber shock absorbers, the absorbers are NOT fixed/bolted to the floor.

The double acting cylinder (max operating working pressure = 210 bar) creates a linear push and pull motion, **F extension/retraction max = 692 kN**. The hydraulic braking system brakes the sward so that the friction coefficient can be calculated through this process. **F brake max = 610 kN**

So based on the information I gathered and the help I got, I made a free body diagram of this system. But I'm still doubting if the forces/loads/moments are correct or if I'm missing something. I was thinking about addomg 2 moment forces ME and MF (see image) to replace the F extension/retraction and F brake forces. ME and MF are calculated with (M =F\*r) with r distance to the centroid of the section of the test-bench.

Is there anyone that could help me with this problem? I appreciate all the help I can get, thanks in advance. If more information is required, please tell me so!

I am 24 years old and from India. I have been slowly working towards and aiming to do my MS in Computer Science, hopefully in Fall 2022.

However, I have low GPA (around 2.7/4) from a decent engineering college and my GRE scores are 161/161 (322 overall). In order to compensate for my GPA, I have focused on building a strong profile, some of the highlights would be

* Started my own firm after graduation, bootstrapped from 0 to having 6+ employees. Biggest milestone was delivering a project for Target India
* Currently working as a lead tech developer at an NGO to help child and women education. One of the projects is in collaboration with JPMorgan
* My teams final-year project got selected by VTU as the best project across our state (amongst 200+ colleges). We have also applied for a patent, pending approval.
* Volunteered during the COVID crisis and built a web application to help people.
* Attented ODU (Norfolk, VA) as a research intern during Summer 2018. Was awarded the ""Best Technical Intern"" award.

I am also working on a research paper (related to Big Data / Databases) that I'm hoping to get published or reach out to professors hoping they see some potential.

Please give me any criticism or advice possible.

I told them that I had finished it and then never emailed it in and then went MIA. My motivation is at an all time low. Im on Wellbutrin and Zoloft and I feel like it’s not really helping with getting that motivation back. I feel so guilty and upset at myself for this because I feel so defeated - I probably ruined my reputation with my supervisor and I don’t even know how to finish this paper and explain myself. I just feel so defeated. Any advice on what I should do? Sorry for the long post!"
p6vvjz,198,2021-08-18,My Internship with Vampires,Rick_the_Intern,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p6vvjz/my_internship_with_vampires/,"I have sort of a weird hobby. I like to collect internships. I collect those experiences, which often come without pay, like someone who collects umbrella sleeves or back scratchers. And the weirder the internship is the better.

Take, for example, this one internship vaguely titled Daylight Operations Intern. The company was Sunside Spear. Here are a few of the intern duties that were listed in the advertisement:

* Cater to the wants and needs of clients that are out of sight and out of mind.
* Belay the wants and needs of clients when directed to do so by supervisors.
* Drive in company vehicles from client to client during daylight hours, with occasional walking outside in the elements.
* Operate 12S Impaler Drilling and Retrieval Equipment discretely and efficiently. (No prior experience with Impaler Drilling and Retrieval Equipment is necessary. Training will be provided by the company.)
* Haul containers weighing up to 50 pounds into and out of company vehicles.
* Analyze quantitative and qualitive factors under project management for the Sunside Spear Initiative.

There were other, more normal intern duties sprinkled throughout, but these were the weirdest and, in hindsight, most relevant to what came next. I think the spattering of more mundane tasks must have helped block me at first from the true nature of the internship. As far as what the company Sunside Spear actually did, its description both in the job advertisement and on the website was too vague and jargon heavy for me to get a clear picture, but I supposed it must be medical in nature. The emphasis on drilling made me think it might have something to do with dental equipment.

The Sunside Spear office I went to was located on the fifth floor of a large building that looked normal on the outside, but on the inside was undergoing renovations or else never had been completed to begin with. The first level flooring was mostly absent, and I had to walk around on pieces of plywood set over red dirt. The stairs were roped off. I knew there were people inside because of all the cars in the parking lot. I was getting ready to call the contact number I had, when I noticed someone going around the corner. So I followed them around to an elevator. It dinged open when they pressed the button. He was a man in khakis and short sleeves and a too tight face, as if he’d had some plastic surgery done. His attire made me wonder if I was overdressed with my black slacks, white long-sleeve button up, and tie, but when I got off on the fifth floor he did not accompany me to Sunside Spear's offices.

I went out the elevator, and I walked around a corner that opened into a lobby. There were two people seated behind a large wraparound counter. Those secretaries, a man and a woman, looked rather old, but as I got closer I realized they had to be about my age, in their mid to late twenties probably. Something about the copper-colored light in there must’ve thrown off my vision.

They asked my name and gave me the new hire paperwork. There was much in that new hire paperwork that emphasized the privacy of clients and operating discretely. There was a ton of legal noise in there. It made me feel like I should’ve brought a lawyer with me.

When I handed them back the paperwork, they told me to be seated until Sebastian was ready for me.

Sebastian, I was soon to find, would be my main supervisor and trainer at Sunside Spear. He came out into the lobby to greet me, a guy who would seem to be younger than me if not for how he commanded the space around him. He wore a premium charcoal suit with jacket that made me feel underdressed, even with my own slacks and tie. But his tie was oddly whimsical, populated by clouds and serpents.

There was an extra layer to the shadows of his face, like oil slicks over water.

When he shook my hand, his grip was ridiculously strong.

“Sebastian Fischer,” he said. “Junior Exec.”

I was quickly led to a poorly lit conference room that I assumed would be where the interview would take place. I grabbed a seat at a long table, behind which only Sebastian seated himself. There was no one else in the room, until my eyes adjusted a little and I noticed a large shape in a very dark corner. It shuffled when I spotted it, as if to let me know it was something that could watch.

Sebastian leafed through my paperwork. Somewhere between the second and last page of him flipping through, my head began to feel heavy and light at the same time. Charged, as if I was about to have a migraine.

I was working myself up to ask for an Aspirin, when the feeling in my head vanished.

Sebastian turned over the final page and glanced up. He nodded.

“Welcome aboard,” he said.

“Aren’t we . . .  going to have an interview or something?” I asked. ""I guess you viewed my resume online?""

A thin smile bisected his youngish face.

“If it makes you feel any better,” he said, “you can consider this internship *as* the interview.” He leaned back in his seat, rocking in a stylish manner. “You play your cards right, and you might end up a permanent member of the team.”

After that, Sebastian showed me around and introduced me to a few others. It was weird that I still had no idea what the company did. Any time I asked Sebastian, he would say that my training would provide all the information that I needed, and that anything else might encroach on the privacy of the clients. It was a very discrete company, Sunside Spear, even to the point that workers like myself were largely left in the dark.

That might have caused some in my shoes to walk right out the door and never return. But as I alluded to earlier, I’m always seeking out weird internships. The secrecy of this company had me pretty intrigued. I wanted to peel back some of its secrets like the layers of an onion, without getting penalized by any of the legal stipulations detailed in those documents I had just signed. Without crying from peeling back the onion, so to speak.

Once I’d been shown around, Sebastian left me to spend the rest of that morning training at a computer in an unmarked office. Rather than getting the whole “this is our company and here is what we do” intro at the beginning of that training, the computer program just went right on into showing me how to operate the Impaler Drilling and Retrieval Equipment.

The equipment in question was in an 18 inch by 29 inch case that I was supposed to do the following with:

* Discretely roll the drilling and retrieval equipment up to the client’s front door.
* Review the correct drilling location on the door, as advised by the supervisor.
* Use the company-provided tape measure to measure from the ground and from the left the appropriate spot on the door.
* Mark that spot with the company-provided marking pen.
* Drill into that spot with the supervisor-approved drill bit.
* Affix the supervisor-approved hose piece to the retrieval compartment and switch over the power to retrieval mode.
* Retrieval mode will automatically switch off once it is done.
* Pack up, roll the equipment back to the company-provided vehicle, replace the filled retrieval container in the case, and coordinate with the supervisor to prepare for the next client.

I was shaking my head the whole time while reading it. Was this for real? I’d felt like I’d hit the jackpot as far as weird internships were concerned.

After I had read through the detailed instructions, I was tested several times with a “virtual experience.” I was even instructed to find a VR headset in the desk and put it on. It was interesting, to say the least.

I remember taking a break at some point and going over to the window. When I opened the blinds, however, I found that the window was completely blacked out.

Because it was only an internship and part-time hours, I left around noon.

The next day, I was to go out into the field. Rather than Sebastian walking me out to the company vehicle I would be using—he said he would’ve done that but he was too busy—he told me to find it beside the yellow Porsche Cayman. He had intentionally parked beside the vehicle I would be using earlier that morning.

“Oh,” I said in Sebastian’s office. “That’s your car? I think I’ve seen it around. It’s a nice car.”

Truth be told, I hadn’t seen it around, but I was trying to get brownie points with the supervisor, as we do.

Sebastian gave me half a smile.

“Like that, do you?” he said. “Happy to hear it. By the way, your drilling and retrieval equipment is already loaded. You’re ready to go.”

He swung his gaze back to his computer, began typing something there.

“So, I can just get started?” I said.

“Sure,” he said. “I’ve already texted you your first client’s relevant info.” At his computer, Sebastian was getting nose deep in some other task.

“What about the Sunside Spear Initiative?” I said. “When am I going to be trained on that?”

He lifted his fingers, very long fingers I realized, from his computer keys. And he swiveled towards me in his chair.

“Save that for another day,” he said. “Let’s get this drilling and retrieval going, alight? Client number one is ready. They’re waiting on you.”

He swiveled back. But I couldn’t help but feel that he was watching me out of the corner of his eye, that whatever he was getting absorbed in at his desk was all for show.

In the parking lot, I found the unmarked white van that Sebastian’s Porsche was parked next to. The sun tickled me with its warmth, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. I was sick to my stomach with anxiety and with a nameless dread. Maybe I knew its name but didn’t want to acknowledge it, because by acknowledging it, the foundations of my worldview might begin to unravel. Casting me into an abyss where my screams had no walls to bounce from.

CLIENT NUMBER 1 IS READY, the text message in my phone said. It was waiting on me like my first client was.

There was an accompanying address, detailed information about where to mark the client’s front door, where to drill into, and which drill bits and hose pieces to use.

Too quickly, I was driving up to a nice but cookie-cutter house in a suburb. It was only about ten minutes away from the office.

I parked the van on the opposite side of the street, as instructed. I opened up the back of the van and lifted the nondescript case out. It was not yet 50 pounds. But it might be after retrieval.

I rolled it over the asphalt like I was walking up to the airport with a suitcase.

Once at the front door, I made measurements, marked the spot, and unlatched the case. Then I hooked up the drilling apparatus as training had instructed. I switched on the power. I wasn’t sure whether it was battery or gas powered, but it was quiet. No more than the hum of a laptop. Even the drill was much quieter than most.

The drill bit ate into the wood like it was nothing, until it went straight through the front door and into something softer. There was a gurgling on the other side of the door. I stopped the drill immediately.

With shaking hands, I did my best to compose a text message to send to Sebastian.

I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THIS, I texted. WHAT EXACTLY AM I DRILLING INTO?

DON’T ASK, Sebastian texted back. REMEMBER WHAT YOU SIGNED ABOUT CLIENT PRIVACY AND LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS.

I got another text after about ten minutes of idling in the company car. The drill was still stuck in that door.

IF YOU DO GOOD WORK, Sebastian texted, YOU’LL PROBALLY GET BUMPED UP TO AN ACTUAL SALARY. FROM THERE, IT’S POTENTIALLY FULL TIMING IT WITH THE REST OF US. THIS COMPANY PAYS WELL. YOU KNOW THAT PORSCHE CAYMAN OF MINE YOU LIKE? I’M THINKING ABOUT UPGRADING IT SOON. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU WALK AWAY WITHOUT FINISHING THAT JOB, YOU’LL BE IN VIOLATION OF THE PAPERWORK YOU SIGNED.

I frantically searched around the vehicle. Did they have a camera in there? Could they see that I was idling on the job?

Reluctantly, I went back and finished the work I was assigned to do. There was a kind of wet jerking on the other side of the door as I continued to drill. Once the appropriate depth on the drill bit had been attained, I pulled back the drill while continuing to run it. One of the ways in which that drill was special was that it had a soft sealant that got left behind in whatever it drilled into. I wanted to be thankful to be able to switch over to the hose.

But once I did, I found that the sucking of the hose and whatever it was “retrieving” was even more horrifying.

Once the suction of the hose broke the sealant, the hose filled and trembled like a thirsty anaconda at a pool of water.

It worked with great force and speed. If whatever was behind that door had been jerking around before, now that movement was intensified. Something heavy slapped limply against the door.

Mercifully, the suction didn’t take long before it was finished. It automatically shut off, as I’d been informed it would.

I heard something slide down on the other side of the door.

I packed up my things, got into the vehicle, and texted Sebastian that the first client was finished.

He texted back a congratulatory line or two, and then he reminded me that—now that I was back in the vehicle— I needed to replace the retrieval container with a new one. I crawled into the rear of the van. I opened up the case. The retrieval container was locked. There was no way inside without a key. That was one layer of the onion I couldn’t yet peel back. Not that I was exactly eager to see what I’d just sucked up.

I replaced the full retrieval container—which probably weighed about ten pounds—with an empty one in the back of the van.

Then I tried to prepare myself for my other clients.

The following day, before I did my client runs, was when I began to attend daily meetings that consisted of Sebastian and some other junior executives giving inspirational yet ultimately empty pep talks to a room of me and about thirty other people. Those talks could’ve been about anything for any company. After the talks, we would break off into groups of three of four and analyze and synthesize, creative and critical think our way through problems and solutions that had nothing to do with the work I was doing. They were scenarios like how a department store might deal with an entire mob of unsatisfied customers during the peak hours of Black Friday, or how social engineering could be used on a neighborhood, without them knowing about it, to effect changes that are in their best interests.

It all seemed pointless and irrelevant. I had the sneaking suspicion those meetings were for my benefit alone and that the rest of them had other meetings at another time, when I wasn’t there.

When I caught snatches of their conversations with each other, it was the kinds of things people working nightshifts would talk about, even though it was daytime. They would complain, for example, about their circadian rhythms being out of whack in between gulping down large quantities of coffee.

They kept their coffee well concealed and seemed to get it from somewhere other than I did, but I glimpsed some of it going into their mouths. And at the corners of their lips. Their coffee had a red tint, like a raspberry flavor had been added to it.

I seemed to be the only one using the coffee maker in the communal break room.

Another odd thing was how I never saw them arrive or leave their offices during the day. I never saw them go out for lunch.

Red flags. Blood red. I think I knew deep down what they were after the first or second day. I just didn’t want to acknowledge it.

By Friday, I had lost a great deal of sleep. I kept waking up thinking whoever had been in that first, brief conference room meeting with Sebastian, with just me and him, that large figure poised in the shadows at the edge of that conference room—I kept waking up thinking that person or thing was in my room, poised in the shadows in the corner near the window.

And I was feeling guilty. About the clients.

I’d been told that they wanted this, whatever was going on at their houses, like some private service they’d ordered, but it wasn’t enough to put down the guilt. Guilt threatened to strangle me in my sleep if something else didn’t get to me first.

By Friday, I was far past my tolerance level.

But first I wanted a little information, in case the company tried to come after me legally or otherwise after I quit.

I have some hacking skills, ironically enough due to another weird internship I had.

I waited until Sebastian was out of his office and had gone through one of those doorways I’d been told I didn’t have access to. If someone caught me, I planned on telling them I was acting on behalf of Sebastian’s wishes. I hoped they would believe me. I prayed Sebastian would not come back before I was finished.

I waited for a good five minutes, then I strode down the hall towards his office and dipped in.

I stuck my thumb drive into his computer. The computer was already on, but it was locked. Using a program on my thumb drive, I was able to hack past his login screen and into his associated email account.

By and by, I scanned memos and documents that allowed me to piece together startling details about the true nature of my job tasks. I was only able to skim at first, but later, at the relative safety of my home, I examined in detail all the emails that I’d transcribed to my thumb drive.

The CEO of the company, who I’d never actually met, had some kind of advanced hypnosis that allowed him to hypnotize “clients” from afar. Essentially, he could get them to sleepwalk and pin their own bodies against their front doors. They would wait there for a daylight operator like myself to drill into them, to hose them up, and with that cutting edge technology drain them of nearly every drop of blood. Because of the technology behind the drilling and retrieval equipment, it was much more efficient than the traditional way that vampires got blood.

Not only that—and this was something I intuited myself—but if caught, the blood would be on the daylight operator’s hands. The company might then lawyer itself away from having anything to do with the daylight operator.

As for the Sunside Spear Initiative, what I found about it scattered across those memos and documents was even more ominous, if, at a glance, impossible.

The company seemed to be trying to create a spear made of souls from hell, a spear of celestial proportions that could pierce the sun and cause it to bleed. Once bled out, the sun would change into something that wasn’t a supernova or a black hole or anything like that. Instead, it would be a demonic sun, one with an actual face and sentience. It would still provide the Earth with enough heat without covering it in the light that was deadly to vampires.

I got out of Sebastian’s office as quickly as I could. I waved to the secretaries on the way out, as if all was hunky-dory. As I walked to the elevators, I kept feeling like someone was behind me, but every time I turned around I didn’t see anyone.

Needless to say, I didn’t give a two weeks’ notice that I was quitting. Aside from all of the crazier elements, it was just an internship anyway. I didn’t have a final meeting with my supervisor or call a secretary to leave a message. I simply did not come back to work.

Since I’ve quit working there, I can’t find anything about Sunside Spear online. I don’t know if the company website has been taken down or if it’s hidden.

I still wake up sometimes at night, thinking there’s something near the window.

One recent development I’ve had is the sleepwalking. I keep telling myself that it’s being caused by a fear of sleepwalking. The psyche is a messy yet surprisingly ironic piece of machinery, after all. But every time I wake up from sleepwalking, it seems like I’m a little closer to my front door.

p6vx4e,4,2021-08-18,Applying to CS PhD from a different research area,Zel_-,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/p6vx4e/applying_to_cs_phd_from_a_different_research_area/,"Hi,

I am a Computer Science student from South America currently finishing his MSc. in Computer Science. I want to apply to PhD's in theoretical reinforcement learning and robotics/control reinforcement learning labs. I want to apply to Europe since I did an internship there and I like the idea of being a worker with rights, vacations and benefits. I also do not feel like I would get funding easily in an US university and, overall, I already missed the GRE deadline in my country.

The main problem here is that most classes I took in my undergrad and masters are in the area of theoretical computer science, I actually have a publication I am not proud of in a B tier (?) TCS conference. Also, my thesis is in Algorithmic Game Theory. I have a couple AI courses, and I applied some of this while working as a data scientist but I have nothing close to research experience aside from the courses projects. Moreover, I was in a robotics lab when I started my undergrad but quit because they were not doing research in ML. Also, my internship in Europe was in security so it seems hard to explain how I swapped areas in comparison to the CV's of people at the labs I am looking at, which have always been working in the same thing. 

I think this would not be such a big issue in US because there is more time and I can take courses there, but in Europe it seems like I have to get there and know everything to do the work, since they are paying me for that. So, how do I address this in my SOP? What can help me to increase my chances of getting in RL programs? I am already reading the books, doing course materials and trying to catch up since I already have to skill for doing that."

p6we3q,55,2021-08-18,I almost hanged myself today (trans/autism/university/family),Konsta97,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p6we3q/i_almost_hanged_myself_today/,"I apologize for the colossal amount of negativity in advance, but I have nowhere else to turn to but strangers on the internet.

I'm transgender (female-to-male), mid twenties, and transitioning has been very hard for me. My insurance has made getting any kind of surgery hell on earth, and my transition has overall not been what I had hoped for. I'm extremely little even for a woman, with zero markers of masculine maturity like a consistent beard or relevant muscles. Testosterone has only changed me insofar as that I pass consistently as a male child, but nothing more. Old men talk down to me and teen boys holler at me like I'm one of them. This makes it impossible to build a peer group my age, as I'm never really taken seriously regardless of the context. In uni, I get openly snide remarks from teachers why a child is attending the course. The worst humiliation ever was when, during a legal internship at court, the defense attorney got up from his chair mid trial, pointed a finger at me and attempted to joke with the judge about child labour in the legal system. 
This also prevents any kind of relationship from happening ever. As soon as I date a woman, she immediately signals that she's friendzoning me. I have gone on so many dates where I previously thought we had a decent connection, only to have her completely change her demeanor the moment she actually sees me. I have gotten the ""You're so interesting, but not for me"" talk so many times, at this point, I'm counting down to when it will happen and have given up on the idea of a relationship.

I am also autistic, meaning mostly that I struggle with social communication and tend to escape inside my head a lot. It's gotten a lot better over the years because I really try hard and force myself to adopt a normal social persona around others. But now that I'm on testosterone, my symptoms have become extremely severe: Whereas before, I was able to keep my quirks to myself quite well and mask when in social settings, I now find that I've become way more impulsive, and whatever is going on inside will eventually find its way to the surface. Now, people can tell that I'm not normal, and I see that and it's making me feel like a complete failure. 

My father also has autism, though undiagnosed and untreated since he refuses to acknowledge it. This is the reason my mother broke up with him recently. I recognize all of my own problems in him, just way more severe - he doesn't speak to anyone for days, then makes you feel like it's your fault even though you did nothing. He cannot cope with change at all, and gave me the cold shoulder ever since I came out. He flat out refuses to speak to me most of the time, I can literally meet him in the hallway and have him completely ignore my presence. When I confront him directly, he acts visibly trapped and pretends he cannot see or hear me by fixating on something else in his circumference. He also hates when I change little, insignificant things to tidy up - for example, whenever I move the toilet paper rolls inside our bathroom when I clean, he acts like I commited a war crime and ""punishes"" me by not bringing me food when he does the family shopping, or by strangely arranging my own bathroom stuff. He has so much impotent rage pent up inside him, and combined with his autism, it just creates an unpredictable volcano. He has so many unspoken ""rules"" that other people need to follow, and if they don't comply (with something they never knew was a requirement in the first place), he ""punishes"" them in his stupid ways. 
Something that has recently tipped me over the edge was that, for some inexplicable reason, he decided to move the family fridge down inside my sister's basement apartment, without getting a replacement. Now, whenever I want food (that I mostly buy myself due to his ""punishments""), I need to beg my pretty narcissistic sister to let me in. I have severly limited my eating because of this and actually relapsed into disordered eating. When I confronted him about this, he just said ""I don't want it in the kitchen anymore."" He continues to make decisions that only make sense in his own head.
My sister is a different story. Ever since my mother broke up with my father, her survival strategy has become to baby him and treat him like you would a hurt child. I have seen her scratch his head in his room at night, and bring him dinner in that kindergardener sort of manner. She cooks for him as he is wholly unable to operate a stove. He doesn't even make his own doctor appointments. Because of all this, my father ""rewards"" my sister by throwing heaps of cash after her, in fact, she just got our basement flat for ... absolutely nothing, no rent, she even failed her studies twice and he brushed it off like a fly fart. 


My mother is the only person I'm really close to, she has become a different person once she went away. She used to be understated and unassuming, now she has really developed on her career and is a blooming ball of joy. She even found a new partner quick. She lives in Berlin, and is the most important person in my life. But recently, I had to lie to her - due to my horrible living situation, I have failed my law degree. I kept her unknowing by saying I was still waiting for results to come in when in fact, I snatched the letters before anyone else noticed they had arrived. I can't even stomach that kind of failure myself, and the thought of telling someone else, especially her, is beyond conceivable to me. I would never be able to live with having seen her shame and disappointment. She put her entire hope in me after my sister wasted her grant and now just kinda does whatever, and my father's behaviour got unbearable. But now, I need to disappoint her too. I just can't.

Because of all this, I finally got a rope, measured the lenght I needed to break my neck, found a sizeable tree in a forest nearby, and decided to kill myself. I had finishedy goodbye letter this morning when a parcel arrived. It was a Care Package from my mom who still believed I had exams. It even had a ""Good luck"" card with a little heart on it. I just broke down and kept that card with me when I went into the forest, placed the noose around my neck. I stood on an abandoned tree for a solid hour shaking and crying and ultimately was too much of a coward to end it.

I'm now back in my room and I really want to become clean with her, even though I know it will hurt her a lot. Should I be honest or is my failure too big?"

p6x6bw,1,2021-08-18,How to get accepted to Java developer and not Entry/Junior Java D....,RjurikIsTheName,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6x6bw/how_to_get_accepted_to_java_developer_and_not/,"Hey everyone, been thinking about my situation and decided to find others opinion.

Brief CV
1 year internship in Devops team
1 year QA automation, where i was the ""java guy"" as rest were more testers than coders
now 3 months as Junior Java Dev and i will be here another 4-6 month.

Now ,i suppose that after ""half a year"" experience i will be considered as Junior. Am i? 
I am not sure, i have some juniors around me and i would say that the fact that i spend time in different positions kinda accelerated my progress as Java Dev.

I dont need to spend time with understanding what is CI CD and some common tools(Devops team), i didnt have to spend time understanding what are unit tests and that they are not integration tests(QA team) and some other things that i got on the way. I could/can purely focus on my Java Dev progress, which seems to be faster than with others.

I will have to leave the country and start looking for a job elsewhere, i feel like i can skip the junior positions.

Q
1) what do you think, am i right or i should still look for junior position? 

If answer is no/you dont have to
2) What can help in persuading a potential employer? 
Only think i can think off is actually trying to build something on github that would reflect it.

3) extension of a first question, do you think , those two years experience in other teams somehow helps Java Dev career path? 

It is quite important to me , as i have two kids and moving to another country is some scary ass shit :) Money cannot buy happiness, but can pay a nice school for kids :) 

Thanks for any input!"

I love the products we do, the company, and I love troubleshooting computers. 

I just am tired of customers being rude and stressing me out. I suffer from terrible anxiety and stress so that is why I never stayed in the hospital setting.

I am looking for something I can be left alone (mostly) and just do my work. Trying to lead the tech illiterate and upset callers is diving me mad.

So what is stuff in an IT or Healthcare Technology industry I could look or research more?"
p6xdbd,7,2021-08-18,Burnt out junior graphic designer - take time off or quit?,pantonepretzel,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/p6xdbd/burnt_out_junior_graphic_designer_take_time_off/,"I’ve been working full time for almost a year after graduation and before that I was an intern with the same company. Coming up on my 2 years next month.

I’m burnt out. My company has had a lot of turnover and the environment is toxic. I’m finding myself wearing too many hats out of my job description to cover other roles. I can’t possibly tackle my to-do list on my own. 

I’m on the verge of quitting, but I also need the finances. I’m tired and so unmotivated to do the work each day. Same for applying to jobs. I’m just so tired and need a break.

I don’t know what other kind of job I can qualify for. I thought I could handle a creative role but I’m finding the feedback and process so draining. This experience has made me not want to do any creative work for my job or in my personal time. 

My role is similar to marketing, but I don’t tick all of those qualifications. I could do some sort of admin role. Or I could freelance in my free time from UpWork/Fiver and work on my mental health at the same time.

The thing that is hard is I still need money flowing in to pay my expenses, but at the same time it’s costing me my mental well being.

I’ve been pushing through and holding on for so long. Something needs to change."

This week I got two  interviews: One for a startup as a frontend another for a small company  in my city doing databases. Personally, my goal is to work as web dev,  more specifically frontend.

I did horrible at the startup interview.

\- ""Do you know how to use this?""

\- No

\- ""And this?""

\- No...

\- ""How about this?""

\- No...

I thought they weren't calling again but for some reason they did. They want me to do a technical interview.

I'm  fucking scared. I suck at data structures, I was studying recursion  today and I still don't get it. I've been thinking of just saying I  can't because I don't want to embarrass myself.

And  what would happen if I do the interview and get the internship? I  wouldn't know what to do, I'd be the person who somehow managed to get  there but doesn't know what she's doing... They also mentioned that,  since it's a startup, I need to consider I'm gonna have to work full  time, sometimes very late. Is this worth it? I feel confused and scared  rn."
p6xlxb,4,2021-08-18,How Can I Start my Career in IT?,Equility,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/p6xlxb/how_can_i_start_my_career_in_it/,"I'm a recent college graduate looking to start a career in an IT related field. 

I chose business administration as my major because I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with my life, and at the time, e-commerce greatly interested me. Shortly into my senior year, I built my first PC in a decade and rediscovered my love for technology and learning how it works. I wished I had instead chosen comp sci. 

During that (this) year, I enlisted in and completed Google's IT Support Professional Certification, an 8-month long program that went over things like networking, operating systems, troubleshooting, cybersecurity, system administration and some command line and bash. I found that I really enjoyed the cybersecurity and system administration sections of this course. 

Now that I've graduated and completed these programs, I really need some guidance on how to start looking for jobs- and what jobs to apply to. I'm very interested in the fields of system administration and cybersecurity, but I fear that my current experience level (and work history) is too little to consider me for a position in these fields. 

As far as relevant work history goes, I don't really have any. I worked in tech support (fixing computers and such) when I was a freshman in high school, but got out of the field shortly after. During college, I was able to pay the bills working a sales position, and then moving on to running a small online store and delivering DoorDash. When employers ask for work history, I don't really know what to tell them. 

I've had a couple of short discussions with some of my past college professors and they've suggested starting with an internship in an IT field. The only issue with that is my cost of living, which totals around $2500/mo. I'm not quite sure if I could afford doing an unpaid (or $15/hr as most tend to be) internship for a few months while my bills accumulate to an unmanageable level. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: considering my education, work history, and monthly expenses, how could I jump-start my career in the IT field, specifically on a track towards system administration or cybersec?

Thank you so much for any help!"

p6yfmz,2,2021-08-18,Need an advice,pluto7410,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/p6yfmz/need_an_advice/,"Hi guys, I'm on my last year of computer engineering university, started stuying web programming this year in the spring and hopefully I'll graduate untill Christmas. I've been doing some simple websites using HTML,CSS and a bit of JS and watching youtube tutorials and Udemy aswell. Also started learning the basics of React few montsh ago, but just basics. The reason I started React is because I've read like everywhere that its really good and in demand aswell and also my final work/paper( not sure how to say it) is supposed to be made in React. It's Social media web application including both frontend and backend and its really complicated, atleast it seems so. I decided studying frontend first, because it seemed somehow more logical. After writing all this I even forgot what was the main reason of making this post. Yesterday was my first day of my internship and, how to say it, I think I was really bad and my mentor told me that I think I know but I dont and that I should start from basics. He gave me a task to do it for beginning using only html+scss but in React, not using components at first, I guess Ill just sort it out later when I finish this. I felt like I died from inside because I noticed how low the level of my knowledge is and it made me question both myself and my future profession(programming). Really thinking if I made a wrong decision by even studying programming and it might not be something I should do in the future. Sometimes I think I really like it and enjoy it and sometimes(yesterday) I feel like I should go and live in the cave. After this design task my mentor assigned me we will be moving to more complicated stuff including servers and redux, atleast thats what I've heard from 1 other internship guy. What I wanted to ask, have you guys ever found yourself in the same situation and what have you done to make yourself feel better. Also do you think I made a stupid decision when I picked this, lets say, a hard final work even though I'm a complete newbie. Can it all be learned in lets say 3-4-5 months because I'm planning to finish it all untill Christmas, if not then then ultimately untill Spring. I really want to learn all this but situations like this really make me question myself and my decisions. I'm also working and it can be a bit stressful doing internship in the morning and working in the evening. Hopefully you guys know what I've meant by writing all this and that you can give me a friendly advice about all of this. Thank you in advance :)"
p6yxik,2,2021-08-18,Soon-to-be new master's grad looking for advice on getting into machine learning and/or finding a schedule flexible job.,Clefspear99,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6yxik/soontobe_new_masters_grad_looking_for_advice_on/,"Location: Midwest USA, a city with a metro area of over half a million

Quick Background: I Will graduate at the end of fall from a state school with a master's in computer science - general emphasis. Also, I have a BS in CS. I, unfortunately, never did an internship. Was a GA and RA with about a 3.9 gap in both undergrad and Graduate. A paper I helped with in unergrad in Privacy is about to get published. Currently working on a thesis in machine learning (specifically working with convolutional neural networks). I'm looking for my first job in either machine learning or Software engineering.  I think I would like to try working in ML but could also definitely see myself in software engineering as that was my original intention.

My ML background is a bit scattered and I am looking at some options that would both solidify my knowledge and beef up my resume. I'm thinking about the TensorFlow Developer Certificate, Google cloud's Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification, courseca courses for those two certificates/certifications as well as a courseca course on math for machine learning.

I'm wondering if anyone can give me their thoughts as to whether those certifications along with a CS master's with a thesis in ML would make me a viable candidate for ML engineering jobs? Or if my lack of experience / specific degree would be too big of a problem.

I also have a chronic pain condition that means I would benefit a lot from a flexible schedule. I could work full time just fine but might sometimes need to rest during normal business hours and make up for it nights/weekends and it's unpredictable when my pain will be bad. I would love a remote job but could also handle an in-person or mixed job that would be flexible for me. Is it normal for new grads to be able to find remote jobs?

Should I look for jobs specifically advertised as flexible or look at normal jobs and ask if they can be flexible? If the second option what part of the application/interview should I bring up my issue? 

If I struggle to find a job would it be weird to apply for internships as a new Master's grad?

I'll take any advice/thoughts. I might also make a post on r/jobs or r/carerguidance about my health issues during the job search.

Thanks!

p6zi3m,2,2021-08-18,Trying to decide if I should switch to community college,swagperson5442,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/p6zi3m/trying_to_decide_if_i_should_switch_to_community/,"Hi guys, I moved on to my college campus 5 days ago and I've really been struggling. Being here has triggered some PTSD related to childhood abandonment, and I have yet to learn to cope with it. I've had episodes like this before, but I always had a home and a safe space to go to. Now, I'm a 5 hour drive away and I have never felt more alone. I really don't want to stay here, but at the same time I don't want to give up on this. I'm not sure if I can handle learning to live on my own, building a social life, staying caught up in my classes, and maintaining my mental health. I have also suffered from anxiety, depression, and dissociation in the past, and I'm really worried that those will come back if I stay here. Classes don't start until Monday, so I have until then to get a full refund. On this upcoming Friday, I have my first appointment with an EMDR trauma therapist (I've done CBT therapy on and off for 5 years). I've been considering doing community college back at home and seeing a trauma therapist so that I can know how to deal with this better when I switch to a 4 year institution. It would also be about $3-5k cheaper (I got a decent scholarship to my school, but if I live at home I won't have to pay for a dorm or anything) So, I guess what I'm wondering is should I transfer to a community college? What are your experiences in community college? Is it harder to network and get internships/ do research once you transfer to a 4 year institution after doing community college? Would it be more challenging for me to make friends if I transfer? Any answers/ advice would be greatly appreciated :)"
p6zn84,4,2021-08-18,Anxiety about quitting nonprofit communications job - I'm burnt out and scared.,klaser79,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/p6zn84/anxiety_about_quitting_nonprofit_communications/,"I've been working in my nonprofit communications role for the last 3.5 years. On paper, it looks close to my ""dream job""—it was remote/location independent even before the pandemic (allowing me to pursue my biggest love - travel), it's a nonprofit organization with an interesting cause (""doing good""), it pays alright for a nonprofit, and it fits with my general digital marketing/advertising/communications eduction and career trajectory.

But ever since I started it's been stressful. My first supervisor was intense, mercurial, and regularly berated my work. She left about 6 months into my role, and since then I've had 5 bosses in 3 years. Most have left since their ""director of comms"" role was untenable. Now there isn't a director of comms anymore, and I'm essentially leading the department. I started the role just supervising 1 intern. Now I manage a team of 5, 4 of them being direct reports. 6 months ago I was tasked with leading a rebrand, with no real money behind the effort. I've had a dramatic increase in responsibilities and management functions, with no increase in pay or change in title. I've asked for both and was told it wasn't possible with our funding. I am anxious all the time, I struggle with sleeping because I can't stop thinking about work (and always have to start my day around 7:30am), and I have headaches and other ailments that I think are stress related.

I really think it's time to leave my job because of stress. My health is suffering.

But I also feel a lot of guilt and confusion. When I think about what I want to do next, I still come back to aspects of marketing that I find interesting - market research, web design, overseeing interesting campaigns, copywriting, etc. I'm inherently curious about people, I love beautiful and interesting ads , websites, and design, and I love creating systems. All things that I theoretically could be pursuing in my current role. But I can't muster the get up and go to pursue these things. I'm exhausted, I'm bitter, I'm angry and stressed every day. I struggle to hit deadlines and lead my team. I need to steer my team, work with sponsors, fill out timesheets, answer misc review requests from the rest of the organization, advise on media... all things that fill me with dread. But that's every job, right? Or every employee-type marketing job?

I've saved up 3 months worth of funds in order to quit, and I've built up 3 ways to make money on the side - DoorDash, plasma donation, and a part time role at a movie theatre. And if shit really did hit the fan I have a support network.

I'm hoping to put in my resignation this week, and leave at the end of September. I don't have another job lined up. Mostly, I want to sleep. A lot. And then re-start the job hunt in earnest, applying for jobs where I can make a bit more money (mostly to fund things that will help my mental health and sense of security—therapy, group workout classes, a healthy ""get the fuck out"" fund so I never feel stuck again), jobs that probably aren't in nonprofits, and potentially pursuing more freelance work.

But I'm terrified. What if I run out of money? What if the problem is just ME, and I find that I still can't make it work somewhere else in a digital marketing role? What if I feel like a sell-out by leaving the nonprofit world to make more money? Why am I running towards aspects of digital marketing that I theoretically could be accomplishing here, in this role? What if I never figure this out and am just always miserable?

Any advice or words of encouragement or wisdom would be appreciated. I've annoyed all of my friends and family with this long enough.

1.So i've started an internship 2 months ago which focuses on Linux server administration and i'm actually doing quite well but i've started to feel a little bored since my mentor has given me like 2 courses to watch (30 hours in total).... and its starting to affect my motivation towards learning more. so should i read and do more labs instead of watching videos and copy what the lecturer do?

2.I am also studying for my CCNA and im quite concerned about a junior job position which would have job responsibilities combining linux + networking. all i know is cloud jobs would fulfill these responsibilities but its all senior level ? so whats the deal?

Thanks in advance"
p6zwj8,1,2021-08-18,I'm having a hard time,HeWhoBreedPestilence,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p6zwj8/im_having_a_hard_time/,"I'm at work where I feel rather useless, and it doesn't help that everyone else here seems to think so as well (though they're not entirely wrong). Lately I just find myself in my cubicle. There's some menial work to be done and I choose to ignore it and pretend to code instead while scrolling through LinkedIn. But that's not really new. That's how it has always been in my department. We ""sit around"" while waiting to be sent back out on the road. But I shouldn't make excuses. I've just been avoiding everyone and everything. Nobody asks if I'm doing okay, they just make side remarks about me as if it isn't obvious who they are talking about. It is what it is. I've accepted that the only one who's ever gonna change shit in my life is myself and that I can act to make others accept me, but I don't even want to anymore. 

I make payments on my home and car, and everything associated or that falls between. And I live alone. I'm in the process of switching banks but I somehow forgot to edit the automatic payments for yet another loan I took out a while back, which leaves me at a whopping -334.16 in my old account. Meanwhile, my new account did not update in time for me to realize that I did not have enough money to make the payments on my home and auto at once (though why the fuck would I rely on the stupid banks website), but of course that's exactly what I did and now I have -367.38 in my new account.

I've let myself go since I started working here fulltime. I was an attractive guy at first. Really attractive. Girls were literally throwing themselves at me. Now I'm a fat fuck. I'm not as fat as I was a few months back cos I've been watching my diet. But essentially, I went from 180 to 260 and now at 230. This girl recently started working with us. I tried to be friendly. Sure I asked her out once, but after she said no I tried to not bother her. But what I hate is that there's a guy in here who's pretty attractive, and she's super friendly with him, but with me? I wave, she waves back with an annoyed expression, as if she was saying ""yeah hi, fuck off."" But with prince charming? Oh she has a blast with him. An absolute blast. They're pretty fucking loud, and I overheard him asking what she thought of me (because we are the only young people in this office), and she says ""I don't like fat boys."" Like, fuck you. I only ever wanted to be friendly. To be able to make jokes and have a casual conversation. I think that's probably why I spend so much time in my cubicle instead of out there. I just don't want to see her. Him I don't care. A conflict of interest between testosterone driven apes. Her? Rejection, reflection, thinking, thinking, thinking. 

There is nowhere to go to meet other young people who won't treat me the same way if not worse. This is a college town and the type of students that go there all prefer the same shit. I need to get out of here. I didn't go straight to a four year college after high school, but I got this job, or rather an internship at the time. But I'm already in my mid-twenties and I feel like I am just wasting my life. I want to meet different people. I'm so tired of the same shit every day. I don't have the energy. I live off of caffeine and nicotine, working out in a fun way is only possible here if you play college sports or if you skateboard. And the people who skate here are mostly douchebags that I avoid like the plague. The girls are the same. There's bars of course, if I wanted to meet middle aged versions of my current self.

Coffee, cigarettes, porn, and as of late: gorey suicide pics and vids! I've even started saving some of them in my camera roll on my phone. I can't believe it myself, I never wanted to become like this yet I let myself. I make excuses and I make myself miserable. I give excellent advise to friends, and don't take any of it myself. I hate the idea of making my parents and siblings have to live with the fact that I killed myself for the rest of their lives. That's the only reason I'm still here. I have no hope for a better future. Not right now anyway. I want to take it out on myself but its so hard to do it without making them worry. I smoke cigarettes knowing it'll probably kill me and with that goal in mind. I'm so fucking tired. But i'll be fine. Just wanted to blow off some steam. Didn't really work, so when I go home I'm just going to scream until my lungs collapse, I do live alone afterall."

I have certifications in addition to my degree. I thought certifications were effective in improving marketability.

   * Main reason: I don't want to be a code monkey forever, but not sure where to transition next. I'd still like to be in the tech domain but maybe involved from a Growth/Strategy perspective.
   * Other reasons: I want to grow my network, take time off work, and get a new perspective on what I'd like to do: maybe go into entrepreneurship and/or VC?

1. I'm hesitating to apply this cycle b/c I'm unsure about who to ask for rec letters. One I can get from my current manager. The other I'm not sure--I was never close with professors from college. I could ask someone on a different team who I worked with for about \~6 months, but I think the two letters should probably be a more diverse? Also not in contact with anybody from volunteering. Any suggestions on what to do here?
2. Is my profile unrealistic for M7 schools? Should I attempt GMAT for a 4th time? 1st and 2nd attempts I didn't really study too well and took a few years ago (670 and 680 respectively). 3rd attempt was recent, and felt anxiety during the exam so I think it could go better.
3. Should I apply R2 this year or wait until the next cycle with a (hopefully stronger) application? I could retake GMAT and build some more meaningful volunteer experience (current experience is sparse).

Thanks in advance for the feedback!"

First year , I messed up and majored in neuroscience, which I realized is not for me so I wasted my first year but thankfully I have some AP credits and I also knocked off 9 core credits this summer.

I want to get into the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

At my college, there are there majors relating to this: Mathematics, Computer Science and Data Science.
I don’t want to do Data Science because it is not a recognized major as it is still developing compared to others . I don’t want to do Computer Science because I don’t want to do extensive programming.

So I am thinking of majoring in Mathematics and double minoring in CS and DS. Will this be a good idea for AI/ML. I already have two internships (Data Science and Analytics), I am also planning on picking some extra programming skills on the side.

I appreciate all advice !

EDIT: I totally forgot a big part . I am planning on doing M.S. in Artificial Intelligence.

I want to know if getting B.S. in mathematics and minors in CS and DS —-  M.S in AI is any different from B.S. in CS — M.S in CS for a career in Artificial Intelligence."

I'm very passionate about infosec, even though I don't have much work experience. After I graduated, I noticed I wasn't getting any job offers likely because I tell people I'm a new grad and love X, Y, and Z, but don't have any IT work experience. It's a shitty catch 22. I only took the internship I just finished because it was the only offer I got. 

Before that internship ended, I had been interviewing for some roles and would explain that I already graduated am doing an internship that is ending on a given date, and am looking to step up my career. The people I would talk too would show some enthusiasm, but I feel like sometimes they are faking it. I'd feel good after doing these interviews, and I swear every rejection email is pissing me off. I really thought I'd have a job offer before my internship ended, but I don't and am absolutely upset about it. It also doesn't help that I am living at my parents house (and have been since COVID started), depend on them to survive, and hate being in my hometown stuck at home. I hate my current living situation and getting a job guarantees me more control of my life. 

I don't want to tell potential employers bluntly about my emotional baggage from being unemployed, but I feel like explaining my situation will turn off hiring managers more than help connect with people I'm interviewing with. So what do I say? How do I professionally say I'm desperate without being a pushover? I've heard being passionate helps people get jobs and a lot of people see that in me, yet I feel like these companies are making a huge mistake passing up passionate new grads like me hungry for experience for someone who has been working for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

For almost my entire life, I've been living undiagnosed with ADHD, and damn it's been a rough couple of decades. From birth until highschool, I was frequently physically abused by my parents. Whenever I did anything ""wrong"" it would always lead to getting the shit beaten out of me. I was also subjected to this program called ""Kumon"" which is an extracurricular academic program where kids do these math and literature worksheets every day, 365 days a year. It feels silly to complain about it now, but back then, man... this shit was the worst. My parents forced me into Kumon at the age of 7 and stopped once I reached highschool, and these were some awful childhood memories. They aren't particularly challenging worksheets for adults, but as a young child, sometimes these packets just felt impossible. Having to sit down for hours everyday both after school and on the weekends and grind out these packets with undiagnosed ADHD was seriously taxing.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst feeling was spending all that effort just to get the packet handed back to you the same day with half of the answers being wrong and being expected to ram my head against the same problems over and over until they were correct. Whenever I spent 3-5 hours doing a worksheet, I would just get so frustrated that I would refuse to do them, which subsequently lead to me getting the shit beat out of me. I remember spending so many days crying all over these packets because my mom would threaten to strike me or strike me if I didn't finish them. The worst part was, my parents stopped teaching me the required material to do these worksheets just a few years in because I had already advanced past their academic level, and they were already incapable of teaching me because they couldn't understand what was going on. It just felt ridiculous to get beaten by my parents at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember each week whenever I visited the Kumon center to do my daily worksheets there and get a refill of worksheets for the week, my parents would always be around an hour late to picking me up. I never did well with waiting because I got bored easily, but waiting in the Kumon center was an entirely different beast. Not only was I bored, but I was trapped with my own thoughts after spending hours grinding away at Kumon packets. I felt so indignant to be left with hours of boredom after working so hard and getting beaten so hard. I often walked outside to cry because I didn't want anybody else to see me do so. I also remember Kumon would hold these award ceremonies every year to award outstanding students, and I always cried my eyes out afterwards because I never won anything noteworthy despite my efforts. One time, I also remember that the managers of the Kumon center laughed at me for putting tear stains all over my worksheets. That also stung quite a bit and was admittedly quite embarrassing considering that they said it in front of everyone at the Kumon center. Yes, I know a cried a lot. Give me a break.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever my mom would hang over me, ready to strike, as I did my Kumon packets, she would always say, ""you're suffering now, so that you can have an easier life later."" The logic was simple enough: if I used Kumon to excel in school now, I could ride the success into adult hood and live out the rest of my life working a cushy dream job that's both easy and pays well. And every single time she said that, I ate that shit up easily. I believed her, and I really thought that all that pain would pay off 10 fold in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the time when I was in 4th grade, I learned about what ADHD was. That very same instant, I already knew I had it. I later went up to my mom and said that I had ADHD, and she insisted I did not have it because I was able to pay attention to video games. She's a medical doctor btw. That's also why she would always add, ""I'm a doctor, I know about ADHD, and as a professional, I can tell that you don't have it."" This conversation would repeat itself annually until this year when I got diagnosed by another doctor. Later on, I learned that my Kindergarten teacher also suspected I had ADHD, and confronted my mom about it, but she refused to get me diagnosed.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to middle school, I joined the math team. Holy cow this was soul crushing. After spending all those hours grinding more math than anyone else I knew in school, I was so arrogant. When I joined the math team, I thought that it would be impossible for them to throw anything at me that I didn't learn before. I was dead wrong. That shit was impossible. And the worst part is, it wasn't impossible for everyone else on the team. They were geniuses who could do these problems like it was no big deal. To this day, I still haven't figured out how they were able to do those math problems with such ease.

Fast forward to high school, I finally grew big enough to fight back against my parents. Eventually, they realized they could no longer physically beat me, so they stopped finally. This also led to them letting me quit Kumon finally as well. Things were really looking up for me at this time. I still couldn't pay attention in class, but I finally figured out the trick to getting good grades in school. All I needed to do was get my hands on a study guide, and I wouldn't have to process a single word the teacher was saying in order to ace the test. Living life with good grades and no physical pain was so easy. Life was good, and while I still had my challenges, my future was looking bright. All I had to do was get into a good college, and then once I graduate college, the easy life I had been dreaming of ever since I was a kid was waiting for me. Math team was still soul crushing though...

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually got into a prestigious college. At the time I received my acceptance letter, I was over the moon. I thought that because I got into that college, all I had to do was graduate, and the best job offers in the world would line right up for me. But unbeknownst to me, this was where my life took a nose dive.

&amp;#x200B;

Hot damn, college was rough. Loads of work to do, tons of lectures to watch, and no study guides available because my professors were ""above"" that. To be fair, study guides aren't a good way to prepare you for the real world, but fuck, that made things difficult. Living with other people was a nightmare. Doing projects and studying for tests with little to no help from peers was hell on earth. Honestly, it was a miracle that I was able to graduate despite having an undiagnosed mental disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

College was also the time where my naive view of the world began to shatter. I was questioning my ability to graduate daily. It was so hard to wake up everyday and face reality. I would often lay in bed the whole entire day because I would be too scared to face the world, and then I would go to sleep, all without getting up other than to go to the bathroom. People in my school often got internships every summer, but I would apply to hundreds of internships and I would often be accepted to none of them. This was the first time where I stopped and thought, ""wait a minute. That's not what was supposed to happen.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to graduation, I had applied to hundreds and hundreds of companies for a full time offer, and there was only one company that was willing to accept me. But that company was a huge company that's well known throughout the whole world. I figured that if I worked there, everything I ever dreamed of would fall into place. I was so happy to reach that point. My life was finally about to pay off, and I could finally kick back and reap the rewards that my mom was hyping up since the beginning. That did not happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Where do I even begin? This job just feels impossible to me. I simply don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I was handed piles of reading for the first month, which of course I didn't absorb, and now I don't know what to do. But the thing is, I'm looking back on the readings now, and I still don't know how I'm supposed to figure things out. The tasks I'm given have very little directions because I'm expected to figure it out on my own, but I don't even know how to get the knowledge required to do these tasks. I'm considering taking medication to help with the job, but I don't know how much help that would be because my issue doesn't seem to stem from a lack of attention or motivation. The issue stems from me not having the required knowledge nor access to the knowledge to do these tasks. And yet there have been a few other new people that joined the company around the same time as me, and they're doing much better than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager keeps telling me to be independent, so I can't really ask for help from anyone on the team. He also likes to constantly remind me that I'm holding everyone back, and how my ""performance is not satisfactory."" He also likes to remind me that I should be working overtime to make up for my performance, but I've been working like 3-5 hours everyday and sometimes work over the weekend to catch up, although I have yet to successfully catch up. In the past, if I just threw my self at a problem over and over again, I would eventually succeed. It would cost me a lot of time, but I did succeed. This was the first time in my life where I'm required to do something that I can't figure out how to do no matter how much time I spend.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was diagnosed a few months ago, all my friends insisted that I tell my boss about it, and I was reluctant to do so. I insisted that this would later just lead to him thinking I'm just making excuses and that I'm asking him to ""lower the bar"" for me. Fast forward to today, and my manager just told me, ""just because you have ADHD, that doesn't mean that I will lower the bar for you."" Which is precisely not what I asked him to do, and it's also precisely what I predicted he would say. He later told me that if I don't meet the requirements within 3 weeks, I will be let go. I really don't want to work this job, but I also don't know what alternatives I have. This is my first full time job and it was hard enough just to get this one job offer. If I get fired, I don't know how willing recruiters are to hire me in the future. I'm not even 1 year into this job. I've only been working for 6 months. And I have a feeling if I work another job, it will just end the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I wanted to tell you my life story instead of just writing my current situation is because I wanted to give context to how much of a fucking waste my life has been. My mom was wrong about everything. I feel so fucking hopeless and fucked up, and I don't know what to do. I mainly came here to vent, but I also just want to know if anyone has any good ideas for what to do next because I'm so lost. I don't want my 20 years of effort to go down the drain. I'm especially curious if anyone has been in a similar situation and if medication helped. I took ritalin once, and it felt great the first time, but then I stopped feeling the positives and only felt the negatives until the anxiety just became too much so I stopped.

I'm just starting an undergraduate degree in CS at Warwick and I was wondering what is generally considered best practice in terms of maximising my job prospects after leaving. Should I be prioritising internships, personal projects, or doing stuff like leetcode? Also what are the areas that are generally considered most valuable - should I be trying to learn fullstack or anything in particular?

Also do any companies ever offer paid internships or is it exclusively experience?

Just finished my first year at university (in the UK) studying Computer Science and French. It’s quite an unusual combination but I just really enjoy learning about them both. 

I’m now having to start really considering my career options as internships are starting to open up. I enjoy programming and I also enjoy current/foreign affairs. So as you can gather I’ll be applying to software engineering internships but also I’d like to apply to some internships in the public sector, like the civil service (non-tech related). 

Right now, I can see myself working and enjoying jobs at tech companies as-well as in the civil service. 

My problem is how I should go about balancing my internships as I’ll have these internships at the end of my 2nd year, and then I’ll have an entire year to do placements. So should I divide my year up? I.e. 6 months at a software company and 6 months in some sort of public sector department. Or should I start committing to one of the sectors so I have a lot more experience in that specific sector and therefore brighter prospects when I graduate? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks a lot,
Jack."

I'm senior year data science student who is looking for remote job but with no luck yet...

I've been searching for a job for ~2months now, and I've send my cv to around 70 companies that hire remotely across Europe. Out of all those companies i got only 2 responses, and I think its really bad since I have around 2 years of working experience even though I'm still in college.

I think (and hope) that the main reason nobody will give me even an interview is that I'm still a student and companies don't believe I'll fully commit to work, so I thought about getting an internship.

The fact that scares me about finding an internship now is that company uses me for 2, 3 months and I don't get an offer after that... In that case I lost 2 3 months in which I could've searched for a real, paid, job.

My final thoughs and questions would be is it worth it? What are the chances of me getting a decent offer? Will I waste my time doing an internship?

Thank you for reading fellow engineers and I hope you have a great day!"

I tend to need some time to think about what I want to say.

I've noticed that this kind of affects things in my internship. Though I also feel like the people in my internship maybe also fall to the complete other side of this spectrum where they talk non-stop and are constantly interrupting.

The result is that I probably don't make myself very known in group meetings. It's honestly hard to even ask my mentor questions because he doesn't slow down and offer me the chance to ask questions. If I try to interrupt, he will talk over me anyway.

I feel when I do talk, however, like when I'm scheduled to present or something, I speak very evenly, clearly, and I know what I'm talking about, and I think that comes out, and others are usually impressed, but then they jump into a conversation about what I'm presenting about amongst themselves that doesn't include me and its hard for me to get in a word edge-wise.

Not that I think all the time that I have anything particularly interesting to say, but for instance, my boss's boss's boss asked me a question and before I could answer it, my mentor jumps in and starts talking about something else. I don't want to be rude and interrupt my mentor, but by the time he's done, the time to answer the question is essentially over.

Anyone else a slow deliberate speaker? How has this affected your job? Is this something I should change?"

Today one of my colleagues announced that he will leave the company and I’m super happy for him. I like everyone at the company. But I’m going to leave as well now. I feel a little bad for the company though. They will loose many clients. Reimbursements will have to be made. It’s going to suck and they will try to convince me to stay and I’m the kind of person that agrees to things I don’t actually want. Also it’s my first job so I havent quit one before.

So I graduated college in June and still have not secured a job or internship- I feel like such a loser. Anyways as a result of the pandemic, I moved back home with my parents and have been with them since. Don't get me wrong, I know that I am lucky to have two parents who want me back home, who don't expect me to pay rent and who feed me. But for a while now, I have felt that living at home has become unbearable for my mental health and physical health. (Disclaimer: My parents lived with their parents till their late 30s and didn't pay rent etc., it very much is a normal thing in our culture, in exchange we are expected to look after them in old age).

First off, I feel like moving away for college was life changing in the sense that I was able to recognize my own toxic way of living and thinking that was passed on from my parents. Having immigrant South Asian parents, I was always just tensed and stressed. I judged other people way too much and I never knew how to just relax. I felt like during college, I worked hard to deconstruct this way of living only to move back to it during the pandemic. It's been almost two years and I just have been feeling extremely disconnected with myself and can't even seem to feel emotion.

In regards to physical health, I have a manipulative, controlling and uneducated South Asian mother who won't let me get contact lenses, see a gynecologist (despite having serious reproductive health issues), wear tampons, get my wisdom teeth removed, get filings, get braces and gets irritated at me when I go get vaccines like the flu shot. Her whole reasoning behind not letting me get these things is because ""girls back home don't do this stuff, these are all American things"". While as a child I knew I had no choice but to live under her rules, knowing that I am an adult and don't have to abide by these rules is frustrating.

On top of that, I am not allowed to date and more specifically date someone outside of our culture  and my parents are also very messy people (as someone who is type-a and is very organized and cleanly, having to clean up there messes and our home everyday has been emotionally difficult.) In addition, I am an only child and they are dependent on me to type and respond to there emails each week, write their resumes, apply for jobs and translating.

Right after graduation I got an amazing job offer form my old internship that paid 47K (as a poli sci major this is considered a pretty good entry level pay) and I turned it down because it required me to stay in the same city I am from and I knew living with my parents longterm would be detrimental. While I could have moved to another place nearby, I know my parents would have driven up unannounced, like they did in college, just so I could do things for them like translate letter etc. I also don't own/can't afford a car and knew that financially, I need to be somewhere where I could rely on public transportation (DC, NYC etc.)

So currently the main dilemma I have is whether I should use the $8,000 I have saved to move from So Cal to the East Coast or if I should use it to pay for my student loan which is roughly 10,000. I did not get any financial assistance from my parents when it came to school and that is alright (I am from a lower middle class almost working class background) but sometimes I cry seeing my other asian friends' parents pay for their schools, buy them cars and pay their first month's rent when they got a fulltime job- I have none of that. I am stuck and I don't know what to do and have been depressed. I really need advice.

Also, how much do I need to move out? I plan on having roommates (would even prefer sharing a room with someone as well to save). I am a pretty careful spender, but don't know where to start.

\-----

Short\* Living with toxic parents and wondering if I should use my savings (initially meant to pay off student loans) to move out once I get a full time job, or if I should fight it through, live at home while working and pay off student loans first.

p7lfll,308,2021-08-19,The #1 Most Important Sentence in Your SOP,jordantellsstories,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/p7lfll/the_1_most_important_sentence_in_your_sop/,"Hi guys,

I'm Jordan, author of Structure is Magic and other essay guides for grad applicants, and today I want to clarify an issue I've been pondering for **a long time**. It's always a struggle getting students to show true purpose in their application essays, true academic and intellectual goals. Hopefully, this post will make that easier and give you actionable tips for submitting a fantastic SOP.

----------------------------------

Does your statement of purpose show any “purpose”? Does it specifically declare your goals for grad school? For your career afterward? If I read your SOP today, will I know **exactly** what you intend to accomplish in the next few years? Will I know **exactly** who the heck you are and how you plan to change the world?

I hope so.

Because that’s the secret sauce to the SOP: a single, powerful, focused sentence that “states” your “purpose” and gives ad comms a feeling that you’re a rock star with unconquerable drive.

Read the SOPs of my most successful students, like [Martina](https://writeivy.com/how-to-write-your-neuroscience-sop-a-phd-success-story/), who was admitted to 5 top-ranked neuroscience PhD programs, or [Pranava](https://writeivy.com/the-sop-for-schools-in-europe-and-canada-a-rock-star-success-story/), who earned admission to 7 master’s engineering programs, and you’ll notice they all feature this sentence.

For PhD applicants, it’s a summary of their “research proposal.” For master’s applicants, I usually call it an “academic goal.” Technically, it is a kind of “thesis statement,” but whatever we call it, this single sentence, this goal, this **purpose**, is the axle around which your entire essay revolves.

Let’s call it the “***Sentence of Purpose***.”

Then, let’s examine how this single sentence can transform your essay from a vague, watery mess, into the rock-solid manifesto of world-class scholar.

**WHERE DOES THE SENTENCE OF PURPOSE APPEAR?**

If you’ve read any of my essay guides, you know that the best SOPs start with a brief story that illustrates your academic curiosities and explains why you’re applying to grad school. It’s not a silly childhood story. It’s not creative writing, and it’s not a gimmick. It’s simply an illustration of how you encountered the problems that you hope to study and solve in grad school. Here’s a great (and wonderfully concise) example from Pranava’s essay linked above:

*“A community visit to a slum as part of a group project with my college’s chapter of Enactus made me aware of poverty’s debilitating impact on India’s energy access. A staggering 400 million people still live in the dark. My summer internship at the Amorphous Silicon Solar Cell Plant (ASSCP) of BHEL strengthened my belief that solar photovoltaics could be a game-changer in the hunt for ensuring access to energy in developing countries, owing to its ability to integrate into mini-grids, thereby benefitting people that don’t live near transmission lines.* **At Gotham University, I intend to study nanotechnology applications in the context of solar cells.""**

Notice how this introduction doesn’t beat around the bush? It shows us a real person. It describes two important moments that galvanized her academic goals. It dives right into the problems she believes need to be solved. **And it ends by declaring exactly what she intends to do**.

This is where the “Sentence of Purpose” appears – at the end of your introduction, right after you describe the problems that you want to study. In this way, it’s exactly like the thesis statements you wrote for every paper in college.

You’ve introduced yourself.

You’ve introduced the problems you want to solve.

You might even have asked some rhetorical questions, like:

* “How do critical or sensitive periods of neuroendocrine development contribute to long-term functioning in animals and humans at the behavioral and cellular levels?”

* “If Brain-Computer Interfaces most improve cognitive processing and decision-making abilities, what would be the best approach to combining AR and BCI?”

Now, by including a Sentence of Purpose, you make your intentions deadly clear and set the stage for the rest of your brilliant SOP.

**EXAMPLES**

Pranava’s essay is one of my favorites, because her Sentence of Purpose is so short and focused, it’s almost hilarious. Yours doesn’t have to be so short. Here are some examples from other students who wrote SOPs that earned them multiple admissions.

* “This is why I apply to Gotham University today: to learn to disentangle data, construct valid inferences, and design clinical trials which apply statistical methods for improved cancer-screening tests and treatments.”

* “It is these very questions which prompt me to apply to Gotham University’s graduate program in Animal Welfare and Behavior, so I can gain a better academic understanding of animal husbandry, and contribute to influencing better policy decisions in the future.”

* “At Gotham University, I hope to explore mechanisms for neurodegeneration, and research potential therapeutics for various disorders including the affected JNK signaling pathway in Alzheimer’s disease.”

* “This is why I apply to the College of Fine Art at Gotham University: to study barrier-free visual experiences, to contemplate art in a multicultural and technological world, and to prepare to become a teacher myself.”

* “Now, I believe the Master’s program in Financial Engineering at Gotham University is the perfect stepping stone toward achieving my goal of capturing, processing, and using real-time information (facilitated by Big Data and Machine Learning tools) in an asset-management career.”

* “These questions explain why I am applying to the Master of Health Administration program at Gotham University today: by becoming an administrative leader, I can play a role in improving healthcare access for far more people than I ever could as a doctor.”

* “At GU, I hope to continue elucidating hypothalamic metabolic circuits, and exploring how obesogenic diets affect long-term developmental outcomes in relation to the normal functioning of the satiety hormone leptin.”

Pick any one of these examples and ask yourself: what is this student’s purpose?

100% clear, isn’t it?

We know exactly who they are and what they intend to accomplish, and that’s a very good quality to have when admissions committees decide which applicants are most likely to succeed.

**WHY IS THIS “SENTENCE OF PURPOSE” SO IMPORTANT?**

It’s not simply the “presence” of this sentence that makes it so important. It’s how it weaves into every other part of your grad school SOP.

Imagine you write this Sentence of Purpose:

*“I want to play a role in developing the new haptic feedback devices that surgeons will employ in the very near future, and the MSCS program at Gotham will give me that chance.”*

Next you’re going to write your “[Why This Program](https://writeivy.com/structure-is-magic-a-guide-to-the-graduate-sop/)” section. As you describe everything that’s awesome about the school, you’ll continually emphasize how each professor, class, or lab will push you one more step on the journey **toward building those surgical devices**.

Same for your “Why I’m Qualified” section. All of those good grades and research experiences you’ve been so eager to describe? They’re only useful insofar as they prove you’ll succeed in achieving your goal of **developing those awesome surgical devices**.

All told, this continual emphasis on your personal, unique, uber-specific goal will paint a portrait of who you are, and more importantly, who you’ll be as a part of the graduate community. Few other applicants will express their goals so clearly. They’ll seem vague and wishy-washy compared to you. You’ll be “**the haptic feedback surgical device kid**,” and the ad comm will know exactly what you bring to the table.

**THE LYNCHPIN OF YOUR GRAD SCHOOL SOP**

Obviously, I’m a big advocate of the below-listed 4-part structure for all SOPs. Master’s, PhDs, Computer Science, Fine Arts…it’s worked for them all at the most elite schools.

1. Frame Narrative Introduction – 1-2 paragraphs
2. Why This Program – 1-2 paragraphs
3. Why I’m Qualified – 1-2 paragraphs
4. Close Frame Narrative – 1 paragraph

However. Now that we’ve integrated our Sentence of Purpose at the end of Section 1, we can see how it becomes the magical thread that weaves through the entire essay and holds it together.

1. Frame Narrative Introduction (the story of how we discovered our PURPOSE for graduate study)
2. Why This Program (…is the perfect place for me to pursue THIS PURPOSE)
3. Why I’m Qualified (…to be a grad student pursuing THIS PURPOSE)
4. Close Frame Narrative (…and firmly restate our PURPOSE, with gratitude for the chance to pursue it)

Your goal in writing this application essay isn’t just to get admitted. That’s a lame goal. Your reader thinks it’s lame. Professors think it’s lame. They’re all people with big nerdy dreams, and they’re looking for people just like them who also have big nerdy dreams.

Thus, your goal in writing this essay is to prove that you’re someone with big nerdy dreams. Someone who’ll impact the world, if only in a small way. Someone who has a specific purpose, and who knows what she needs to do to achieve it.

**HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS WHAT SCHOOLS WANT TO SEE?**

Because they ask for it!

In the essay prompt for [UCLA’s master’s in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), the first question they ask is:

* *“What is your purpose in applying for graduate study in your specified degree program? Describe your area(s) of interest, including any subfield(s) or interdisciplinary interests.”*

To apply for their [Master’s in Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management), UCSB says:

* *“You should include your specific area of interest, providing an analysis of an environmental issue and how it relates to your ambitions.”*

Applying for an [English PhD at Harvard](https://english.fas.harvard.edu/guidelines-admissions)?

* *“Those who already have a research topic in mind should outline it in detail, giving a sense of how they plan their progress through the program. Those who do not should at least attempt to define the questions and interests they foresee driving their work over the next few years.”*

They don’t call it a “Statement of Purpose” for nothing, friend.

Make yours deadly clear.

**CONCLUSION**

You can’t write an A+ term paper without a thesis statement. You can’t publish research without an intro that explains the goal of the project. Likewise, if you want a grad school SOP that sets you apart from the competition, you have to write a detailed “Sentence of Purpose.”

It’s not just the lynchpin of your essay. It’s the lynchpin of **your entire application**. If we delete everything else, in every application, and only look at the Sentences of Purpose from each essay…we could tell right away which students are serious and which are clueless.

Be serious. State your purpose with boldness and clarity. Be the “haptic feedback surgical device guy,” or the “nanotech in solar cells girl,” or the “animal husbandry in public policy dude.”

That way, grad schools will know that you’re someone just like them: a focused scholar with big nerdy dreams…and the motivation to achieve them.

More than any other sector, by far. 

Years back Mark Zuckerberg said something along the lines of “one day we will be teaching kids coding alongside basic math and writing, and wondering why we didn’t do it sooner.” The industry certainly seems trying to push that direction. 

So what can we do about this?

1. Side projects and tinkering - try to build something early and do it often for the practice. 

2. Internships - I waited till my senior year thinking I’d be under qualified for a CS internship prior to that. 

3. Co-ops (Not all companies or schools allow this) - if you can get one it’s like a long term part time internship. 

4. Fight the requirement creep. Become a recruiter, even if just a short rotation. Encourage discussion with recruiters and managers to show they don’t need a “purple squirrel” unicorn candidate for every position, and someone at 70% with the personality and room to grow can be a much better fit. 

5. Mentor and volunteer - get involved.

Edit: fair point that a lot of this can be attributed to lazy recruiters who don’t bother changing the default settings when posting jobs. However…I would still wager a significant percentage (maybe 40?) can still be attributed to the original sentiment."

I have taken almost all the required classes for the Full-Stack Web Development course, but the last 2 classes are focused on getting internships and building projects. 

I’ve worked with Java, HTML &amp; CSS, JavaScript, other fundamentals and React. The problem right now is that I feel like I haven’t really learned much and I’m not able to work or create my own projects. I bought Udemy courses to relearn some of those skills and tried to follow the videos , but I don’t like the idea of watching videos and coding. 

Although I did learn good things from these Udemy courses, I would like to go through either the Odin Project or Codecademy curriculum to relearn some of these skills and to be able to create my own projects. Right now I don’t feel like I’m ready to go out there and start applying for IT jobs. With all this that I’ve said, what do you guys recommend for me to improve my programming skills and be able to work on my own projects?"

It results in some funny scenarios of some asking things that did not fit job description I applied to, one trying to scam me out of 700$ to continue the process(it was pitiful, believe me), a few tried to get me to do code signal and several ridiculous assignments worth 300 points a piece and time limit being only about an hour and a few minutes(which I promptly rejected due to being uncomfortable with being recorded and having headphones off, and I know it's silly to some, but headphones help me reduce ANY little noise that can mess up my concentration and help with sensory stuff I rather not bore details with).  The assessments I have done, I flourished in and even got complimented for how well I cared more about showing my thought process to explain how I approach. I have gotten to several final rounds and to the point of being asked to send professional references. Yet, ended up ghosted or rejected.

My biggest enemy? Lack of professional experience across the board.

 I have one internship under my belt. Throughout the 6 years in college(just graduated in May), struggled through health, losing my beloved Grandma to cancer, losing 5 family members within span of 4 months in a semester, and a lot of other things. But I pushed through because I was determined to get my Computer Systems Engineer degree I am VERY proud about.

I just feel discouraged and deflated by the job hunt and talking to senior engineer friends who are also facing some BS on their job hunt end too.

p7q81i,3,2021-08-19,How important are personal projects to getting a decent job?,RemingtonUwU,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p7q81i/how_important_are_personal_projects_to_getting_a/,"I’m about to start my second year as a CS major. Over the past year or so I’ve been having a lot of anxiety about trying to get some kind of personal project done to both learn how development is done in practice and to prove to future employer’s that I am capable of giving results. It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard for me to engage in pass-times or hobbies because I feel like I should instead be working on programming something.

My problem is that I just don’t seem to enjoy the process of working on personal programming projects, and there isn’t anything that I’d actually like to have made. Every time I try something, I keep reaching this dead end where I either find what I’m doing frustrating or unengaging, but I try to deny that it’s happening because it’s a “personal” project. I haven’t put more than a total of a few hours into any project I’ve attempted over the past year because of this.

I really have two questions. First, is this anxiety warranted? Like, is it actually important that I have a bunch of things done before I even get my first internship or something? Second, if it is truly as important as I think it is, what can I do about this? Right now my best idea is to just give up on the notion of having any “personal” projects and just figure out a thing I can make and treat it like a job or an assignment, but that doesn’t sound like it’s what I should do for the long term, if that makes sense.

I'm about to turn 27, still living at home (not that that is unusual these days), feeling stuck and like my ambitions and interests just do not leave me any realistic paths in the real world. To sum up the last few years, I graduated from college in 2016 with a BA in government from a very highly regarded large research university (my name probably gives it away lol). As I had been spending breaks substitute teaching I thought I'd like to go into education so I entered a postbaccalaureate education program. What happened was I failed out of student teaching, not once but twice. The actual experience of teaching also left me very disillusioned with the profession anyway, so I concluded it was not for me. I ended up getting a job as a paralegal for a disability firm handling veterans' claims, but the caseload was far too great and overwhelming, and I ended up being demoted to document review which is where I still am. To be fair, they did so because they knew how hard I worked and that I genuinely cared for what I was doing and our clientele (and I was not the only person for this to happen to). But I have been doing this for 2 years now and am in need of growth. 

The only things that have ever really interested me are politics/public service and US history. I'm not sure what to do as while I apply for legislative aide positions or the like when they come up, they are next to impossible to get. I also want to be clear that I will not go to law school-the debt is far too great and the job/salary outlook, contrary to popular belief, is terrible. Family members have often said they see me doing well in academia, but what they and many do not realize is that most professors are lucky to get a few thousand bucks to teach one course a few days a week, and the cost of a Ph.D. is prohibitive. Grad school in general is an enormous gamble that I am just not comfortable taking, and I am not even sure what I would want out of it. It would be different if I were already in a job where a condition required obtaining a graduate degree by a certain time. Honestly, when I look at Indeed, etc. almost nothing there excites or motivates me. I have had a couple of interviews with an insurance company and a solar company, neither of which I ever heard back from nor did I see myself really being fulfilled at. I do have political ambition and I have served in several local elected positions (I am currently on my local school board), but I can't gamble my entire life trajectory on elections that I may or may not win. I'll add that while I have volunteered for and become acquainted with my Congressman, I'm afraid, in my mind at least, that it's not a close enough relationship to ask for a phone call to a prospective employer without looking like I am taking advantage. When I applied for a job with his office, I understandably was not selected for an interview given the sheer number of applicants. However, I was a bit pained that the rejection email came from a former supervisor from a past internship with whom I have always had a great relationship. But maybe I have been taking my parents' insistence that getting someone to make a phone call for me will get me a job too literally.

Whenever family members ask if I've found any new opportunities, it honestly depresses me for the rest of the day when I say I have not, then they give me the whole ""you have so much potential, I don't understand"" talk. To be frank, I feel like I am one of the least understood people on Earth, not just on this issue but a lot of things. I guess what I am really looking for is advice on how to get myself out of this rut. Don't get me wrong, as I think about it I am still in a much better place than many who have absolutely zero idea what to do with their lives. I just need help in getting myself to a place where I legitimately feel fulfilled based on my aptitudes and ambitions (and can move out) and realizing what is actually stopping me. Maybe I know deep down already, but just need to hear it from others."

p7thei,588,2021-08-19,Higher Ed and Cyber degree rant -- from and instructor,StrikingInfluence,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/p7thei/higher_ed_and_cyber_degree_rant_from_and/,"Hello,

I've been in InfoSec for about 5 years now focusing on perimeter defense and network security.  I also teach Cyber Defense classes part-time for a state college.  I would say overall I have over ten years of experience in information technology as a whole and four years teaching part-time as an adjunct.

Recently the college I work for finally started rolling out a two-year Cyber Security degree along side their Network Analyst degree.  This is where things get really frustrating for me.  Our instructors are NOT qualified to teach security.  I mean truly all the full-time faculty have almost no background in technology itself besides their degrees.  A few of them don't even have technical degrees.  I've also noticed security is getting to be an incredibly hot field and EVERYONE is trying to be a 'hacker' \*sigh\*.  Maybe I'm just burning out but I see so many schools (not just mine) promise students salaries and opportunities to the moon.  Then graduation time comes and crickets, low level help desk jobs are posted on LinkedIn and literal Taco Bell job ads stapled to the campus walls.  It's so frustrating as an educator to try and bring these students down to reality after being lied to.  It's so frustrating to constantly see students come into these highly technical classes just because they heard 'hackers' and security engineers make six figures.

So in celebration of fall semester starting I want to give everyone who wants to get into cyber security a real honest warning and real honest evaluation of what it's like.  Most of the time my job isn't SEXY - I'm not stopping hackers in a virtual light sabre duel.  Although cyber security is very large -- most jobs aren't 'hacking'.  My job is 50% paperwork, 30% administration, and maybe 20% engineering solutions.  There is also governance, risk management, audit, operations, tools, monitoring, etc.  Ethical hacking or penetration testing is a very small piece of the puzzle.

NEXT!  I might get down voted heavily for this but there is really no such thing as 'entry-level' security.  Entry-level security is mid-level IT.  Got it?  Great, now here's why;  most security positions require a foundational level of experience of information systems concepts or technologies such as client-server computing, storage, cloud computing, networking, endpoint administration, etc...  The reason there is a huge LACK of security experts is because it takes YEARS of experience to bake up good security engineers.  Most security engineers I've met started towards the bottom in some sort of support, administration, or network role and moved up.  Some even started as developers or programmers, nonetheless almost none went from a two year, or even four year degree directly into security.  Unless you graduate from a really good school and have some really good internships you most likely will not land a security job as your first gig.  Which leads me to my frustration with cyber security degrees.  They try to fill in all these foundational concepts in two or four years and then pile on heavily with entry-level security classes and in reality what most students end up getting is very mediocre or entry-level exposure at all levels.  Most Cyber students only complete one level of computer networking classes, whereas a Network Degree you complete to CCNA.  Most Cyber students only complete one level of Linux operating systems whereas IT Support or Network students go to level two and three.

So you kind of hopefully get my point.  The faculty creating these courses are trying to fill in so many different topics of IT that the security degrees really become these incredibly watered down and generic degrees that really don't prepare you for much of anything.  They're not in-depth enough in any topic to really give you an advantage (from my experience).

So my advice?  For those who are looking to break into Cyber Security and are looking at programs - RESEARCH.  Consider instead a traditional Computer Science degree or MIS degree and take security classes on the side.  Go to the schools faculty directory (they all have one) and stalk the ever loving crap out of your potential instructors.  Stalk their LinkedIn, stalk their Facebook, anything you can find.  Ask for details of the coursework and if it follows a certification (AVOID EC-COUNCIL).  Ask if a class was DEVELOPED by the instructor, ask if it has hands-on labs.  Many schools are literally just using uCertify now -- which I LOVE uCertify.  However, students shouldn't be paying thousands of dollars for an instructor to talk over some PDF slides of a $200 uCertify course.

GOOGLE and stalk the schools alumni.  Find others that got the degree you're looking at.  What are they doing??  All-in-all make sure you're absolutely passionate about IT Security and not just in it for the 'cool hacker' job status and high paying positions.  You will be severely disappointed if you are.

Signed, a sad instructor and overworked engineer.

I also want to mention for those who are overwhelmed or feel bad about this post -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to be depressing.

My background: Multiple CS/AI dual enrollment university courses, data science/software internship, 4 years Robotics programming --&gt; I don't want to take CS50. I already took linear algebra, differential equations, AP Stats, Finite Math, but I don't want the workload of Math25. I'll have to retake linear algebra, so I'm figuring its best to take that in frosh fall while the material is still fresh.

I would really love to take CS61 + Stat110 in the fall, but I've been hearing that its a bad idea to take them together along with Math22.

My interests: CS concentration, econ secondary, data science/AI/software, getting research experience relatively soon

I've been trying to decide between fall schedules. CS 61 is the established path for CS freshman with some prior experience. That being said, stats is super useful for AI/later econ courses (I could take CS 181 soph fall potentially?). If I don't take stat110 this fall, I'd probably take it next fall. Are there serious course pre-req downsides to taking stat110 soph fall vs frosh fall?

Is option 2 going to be, like, a lighter courseload than I can handle? Should I petition **before 4:00pm** **today** to take Expos in the fall instead of a gened (somewhat harder schedule, advantage: take another more interesting econ/cs/gov course in the spring) and go with option 1? Or should I push off CS61 until soph fall, and know that I'll have to double up on CS61 + some other CS courses that could be fairly intensive?

1. Math22 + CS61 + Ec10 + Expos
2. Math22 + CS61 + Ec10 + Gened
3. Math22 + CS109 + Stat110+ Gened
4. Math22 + CS61 + Stat110 + Ec10 (this is the schedule I've been told to avoid, so I'm trying to find easier alternatives).

Right now they asked my to develop a new feature  but I have no idea where to start so I plan to give up and quit now but didn’t have any job line up yet so kinda worry that I might not able to find a new job soon or pay my car bills but luckily I can still move back to my parent house while I’m looking for a new job.

I know I can’t do this for the rest of my career and I’m feel terrible that I’m hurting my career by outsourcing my tasks and rusting my technical skills.

Any suggestions on what should I do, should I quit now  and spent my free time looking for a new role or wait until I get fired. Many people said don’t quit until you already have a line up but my anxiety level is going up every day because of this job."

It works great and I’ve been on it for almost a year and a half now. The only problem I have is, I feel like a literal fish out of water every day. I am constantly drinking water (about 99oz a day to be exact) and I can’t get enough. This also makes me need to use the restroom ALOT. My fiancé always jokes with me on road trips that the baby needs to go potty at every rest stop. 

The problem is, I’m about to start my internship. I can’t just sit around and drink water all day and go to the bathroom every time I need to like I did when I was in college classes. Sometimes I think it’s because I really don’t have much to do around my house and I pay more attention to the fact that I’m thirsty than I would when I’m busy? Idk.. Does anyone else have this problem? If so what did you do to help? Suggestions are welcomed and greatly appreciated!! Have a wonderful day friends!!"

I hear 750 is the cutoff score, and ultimately resume is the biggest screen. I feel so humiliated bro, this is fucking dehumanizing what INTERNSHIPS are making us do (ok im being dramatic, I'm pretty privileged to be complaining about this, but still, this sucks ass)

Did I get fucked? Is there anything I could do? Am I just being a big baby? Does anyone have any codesignal lower score success stories? I go to ASU, so I don't really have any school name recognition, but I believe my resume is relatively fine...

I'm also a software developer. To show I have some credibility, I've been part of an intern team for with college seniors, and ran the backend/infra/aws/vsc/git parts of that summer project. I'm good at what I do.


However, the vast majority of people going into computer science undergraduate degrees don't have that much experience. In fact, a lot of people have absolutely zero experience. And that's *fine*. You're in highschool.


Which brings me to my advice: If you're applying for computer science, sometime before may 1st you really should put some time in learning and be able to write simple programs. Software Development is Hard. Too many people go in to a CS degree not knowing anything about programming, and it's a shock to them when it's really difficult.


You can see this in first-year dropout rates for computer science. The first year dropout rate is probably around 10%. Here's a source for 2017 https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252467745/Computer-science-undergraduates-most-likely-to-drop-out. It most likely hasn't gotten noticeable better since. That's one of the highest dropout rates for a major. 


10%! That's a lot of people. That's a lot of *money*.  I don't want you to be part of the 10%. It's not fun.

I don't care if you're want to do computer science for the passion or for the money, if you don't find it at least enjoyable to do, you will hate college classes and have a hard time finding a decent job. And, for those in it for the money: a CS degree barely matters. If you want to make money you actually have to learn while in college.


So here's my advice to anyone who's picking computer science as their major, but has never written code. Learn python, write a hangman game or something. Get a taste. If you absolutely hate it, now you know, before you started school. Don't be part of the 10%.  All you need is some time and the Internet.


Good luck to everyone during the application season, and I hope I could help a few CS students out."

I am a recent grad from a pretty solid undergrad, did well. My degree isn't in computer science, and I never did a CS course, but I did plenty of mathy stuff --- including related (unpublished, sorry) research and res groups. Unfortunately (I guess?) I mostly focused on taking the hardest courses I could in terms of abstract content (mathematical or otherwise), and totally ignored practicality. So I never took a CS course per se (although there certainly have been some intersections, e.g. in logic).

I had once considered the prospect of grad school. While I still stand in awe at what interesting work has been and is being done, I don't think I can handle the institutional disrespect accorded to grad students. Plenty of industries treat you like trash, but academia is exceptionally bad. If I can skip academia and get myself a job, then I'll both save and make money.

I've tinkered with stuff on computers since I was a kid, so I'm capable of code monkey jobs, I think. In fact, I had a paid internship before starting my degree (no idea how I got it; I was the only person there not related to someone), and part of my job was to write bioinformatics programs (the other half related to actual biology). From a software design standpoint my creations were amateurish back then (and let's not talk about proteins), but I'm not an absolute beginner. Still, I feel I've always written sloppily, rather than the proper way.

While I am happy to look for anything that would fill my coffers, I would really like to focus on how to (1) remain proper and algorithmically efficient in my code --- god, was my structural analysis program needlessly inefficient --- and (2) make use, if possible, of some interesting math. I know that employers don't really care about how much you've heard about infinity, of course. But I would find it much more fun to have the opportunity to bang my head against a desk to work on some more interesting problems.

My basic plan involves working on some projects for a portfolio and getting them out there. But is there any shot for me to get a bit further than that --- specifically, are there any good books written for people who already have mathematical knowledge? Should I just pick up some random textbooks on compilers or something and go from there? And as for doing things the ""right way"", does anyone have any recommendations besides to read books specific to the language(s) I'm targeting (and/or of course to alorithm complexity, obviously) and to take note of all the details?

Thanks from this egghead!"

I'm majoring in a Bachelors in Art for an Information Communication Technologies program. (They have tracks and I'm thinking of going down the ""management"" track.) But I was wondering if going this route was a mistake, and if I should have just gone for Computer Science.  


I have a 3.97 GPA so I'm doing really good, I'm learning Japanese and doing some cinema classes for electives while also doing a couple classes in databases/architecture. I'm more interested in building computers/physical parts rather than coding, but I still have interest in it. I'm just wondering if I'd be locking myself out from many more opportunities than if I were to have a CS degree. I'm not particularly a huge fan of math, but I was thinking of maybe getting something in the database administration/app development field. Would an IT degree still be fit for me or do you guys think I'm limiting myself with an IT degree?  


General discussion about the degrees are fine, I'd like to hear your experiences with having either one! (Especially about internships, I'd need to get one next year if I continue IT)"

I recently completed a summer internship for them as a data science intern. A lot of my work centered around analyzing, visualizing, and positioning reports for clients. Recently, towards the end of my internship, I have started doing more interesting data science work imo. This includes statistically analyzing real-world data to create a model which can be used in company-wide applications. They plan to continue me down this path by teaching me more real-world stat applications and machine learning/general model-building skills.

My internship ends in a week. My boss expressed interest in hiring me as a part-time contractor during my last semester. He wants to extend a full time offer for me come January as well within the next week.

I am curious if I am selling myself short by picking a small startup for my first role? I feel the lack of notoriety of their name will have an impact on my early career. I have connections to land a role at some bigger companies (amazon, j and j). Would I really be doing myself a disservice by choosing this role due to the quality of life and skills I feel I will acquire? I am definitely a competitive applicant for this type of role.

Context: I am in the last month of a 6-month internship in Barcelona within a really big tech-oriented company as a Data Analyst that actually does tasks more related to BI/Engineering (maintain pipeline using Python, SQL, Git, Jenkins, AWS ECR and S3, Shell...). But the team in which I am (Data Finance &amp; Analytics) is going through a great transformation in which I am feeling that the Engineering work will disappear slowly.

The work that our pipeline does will be cover almost entirely by a development created by tech teams. And, according to our boss (Head of Finance Systems), we will be transitioning to a more Analytical team of Data Analysts that are going to be able to select an expertise area between (BI Engineering, Data Science, Data Analyst, and Data Visualization). This transition will consist in changing the ERP to SAP S4/HANA and using SAP SAC for analytics.

My Doubts: They have offered me a position in the team that I would like to discuss with my bosses because I am not sure if an environment using SAP is the best to kickstart a career in Engineering. It is my feeling that I have gathered a lot of knowledge that is widely used in the field (the tools I mentioned before) and that with this position and the future of the team I will be walking away from DE.

PS: I am an Economist with a Postgraduate in Data Science.

Question:

1. Does DE work with SAP in some way? If you have experience with it, what are your thoughts about it?
2. Do you see a transition from this kind of role to a BI/Data Engineering role?
3. Do you think that I could obtain a junior DE position in another company with this experience and skills?

Thanks for any advice on this, I will appreciate it a lot!"

So I'm entering the workforce upon the successful completion of my computer science degree in May 2022. I've had prior internship experience with 3 separate companies doing a plethora of programming and IT support work. I recently wrapped up my internship with Company A earlier this month and haven't worked at Company B since December 2019. Here's a bit of background on the two companies.

Company A:

* Fortune 500 company based in a metropolitan area
* Better network of coworkers to reach out to for support and guidance
* More updated technology stack that's probably more transferrable to other companies down the road
* Harder to advance upward, but easier to move between different departments

Company B:

* Smaller company based in my hometown
* Growing extremely fast
* More specialized with the technology that they use
* They're opening a new 'software' department that's responsible for supporting and customizing their ERP system. I would be their first hire in this department, with more hires to come in the following years.

I've already gotten a full-time offer from Company A and the hiring manager at Company B wanted to know the specifics of the offer before they were willing to extend a written offer to me. I really see myself accepting Company A's offer because the salary is higher than average for that position. They also have a very comprehensive benefits package and I don't really want to live in my hometown again just yet. 

I'm leery about Company B's position because they have an understaffed IT department and I'm worried that I'll be a general 'catch-all' IT technician instead of actually programming and developing new features for the ERP. However, this position would let me have a tremendous impact on Company B's growth whereas I'd be one of thousands of programmers at Company A. Additionally, I'm guessing that I could quickly become the head of Company B's software department as I'm their only hire and they're expanding rapidly.

I'm still waiting to hear back from Company B about the specifics of their full-time offer. They had mentioned when we spoke earlier in the week that they'd be willing to outbid my offer from Company A, but given the cost-of-living difference between the two cities, I don't see them following through on that. Nonetheless, I was hoping I'd be able to use Company B's offer to negotiate a higher salary with Company A after adjusting for the cost of living. For example, if Company A offered me $80K starting and Company B offered $70K, I could argue that $70K is equivalent to $90K when adjusted for the higher cost of living in the metropolitan area. Is this common practice? Does anyone have any advice on how to effectively convey my argument during my negotiation? Thanks for all your help!"

I'll be graduating with a 4 year degree in Business Administration from the University of California Irvine 4 months from now, and I'm only 20 years old.  I entered college as a sophomore thanks to completing a lot of my GE requirements in highschool, and have managed to set myself up to complete my degree and graduate after spending only 2.5 years at my university in a program that typically takes 4 years to complete.  I've so far managed to have 3 marketing related internships at various small companies in my local area, but have released after completing them I don't feel like just being the dude who manages the company's social media.  Originally, I thought I would want to go into marketing, but my experiences have made me realize I don't want to.  Now I feel kinda lost, and like I wasted my time at college since I'm realizing more and more as I'm spending time teaching myself how to code I enjoy it and wish I did computer science over business for my degree since most of my time in college was spent just in Zoom lectures during the pandemic I feel like I've learned very little real skills from my time in business school.  I know I don't want to be some manager in some large company and work some boring corporate desk job, and I originally choose to go to business school to learn how to run my own business but learned they wanna train managers more than business builders.

I now feel like I'm at a cross roads since I can either just commit to what I've set myself up to do and then either funnel the money into building a business since I know the kind of company I wanna build I just need some startup capital which a job could give me if I keep expenses low and stay with parents.

I could continue pursuing my interest in computer science despite feeling overwhelmed by just how much I know I need to learn and how much I want to learn.  I feel though excited when learning how to build applications, and wonder if I should try to become a self taught software developer or just go to a cheap local college to get a computer science degree.  Or even teach myself just enough to join an early stage startup for just equity.

I'm also working on building an app with some friends which is what pushed me into learning how to code so I could also just keep working on that on the side while using a marketing job to feed myself and provide some basic comforts.

I also may want to go into paid advertising work, but my experience trying to break into that realm last year was very much around the idea people highly value experience and without it's very challenging.  (300 emails got nowhere)  I think trying again couldn't hurt, but I'm also much more interested in technical world of code right now.

Lastly, I'm considering becoming a UI/UX designer which would design software applications.  For me this is my most likely route of a job to do while I try to invest my earnings into a business.  My only issue is I have so much I need to learn about the field, and might not have enough time to do so.  My timeline post graduation is to find something after 6 months and a goal to move out after 8 months.

Sorry for long post.

TLDR

Graduating early at 20 with business degree and marketing experience from internships, but has realized doesn't want to go into field of marketing and has found a new passion for the realm of coding and UI/UX design.  Doesn't know what to do for a job after graduation.  Also, plans on using any job as a way to build up capital for a business, but still wants to have some sort of valuable skillset that is valued by the market."

Long story short, I am a 28yo working abroad as a project manager at a FAANG company. I have 3 years of experience, no obligations (apart from student loan payments) and have a lowkey desire to return to my homeland. Additionally, while the job is great on paper, it doesn't excite me so much anymore, and I know that promotions and internal transfers would be at least 1 year down the line. Lastly, I've felt a bit jaded with corporate for the past couple of years, and I've always had a desire to take more risk by means of founding or joining an early stage startup. Ultimately, despite my excuses about timing never being right, I think a lack of balls and drive is why I haven't done anything about it so far.

Things changed when an old acquaintance (used to intern together at a big bank) reached out to me and asked if I wanted to join his startup as employee #6. He proposed a role as head of product, an OK salary and an equity package. In my eyes, the company is promising, has a decorated board of directors, and both my old acquaintance and the CTO left prestigious careers to found the company. This gives me reassurance, but I am still having doubts.

They have cash until end of year, so the existence of the company is reliant on getting VC/angel funding. The founder told me they have already had positive talks with VCs, received one offer, but have yet to formally secure the funding.

I am interested in the role. It would allow me to move back home, give me a proper challenge and a possibility of a grand payoff if successful. However, what should I be looking out for? The fact that funding still isn't secured makes me uneasy about leaving a stable, albeit a little bit boring, FAANG job. Worst case scenario, I would be jobless in December, and this thought scares me, but at the same time this type of opportunity is what I have been looking for.

So, does anyone here have any tips on what questions to ask/consider, cautionary tales or success stories. Ultimately I am looking for some perspective on what feels like a major life decision to me.

(Maybe this isn't relevant, but I have an emergency fund of 3 months salary just in case I'd ever get fired, so this would obvs help mitigate the risk)

Thanks!"

It was very frustrating since I had hundreds of doubts in requirements and in general technical doubts, but I just couldn't get hold of my mentor. I even didn't have a well-defined mentor. My manager assigned me a mentor but that mentor always told me that my official mentor is my project buddy. My project buddy told me that my mentor is who my manager assigned to me. And none of those people were willing to help me, which I genuinely needed, provided I was there for just the summer (not enough time to figure everything out myself). Even when I raised my code for a review before merging, my mentor would not dare check it! I don't even know if they noticed my work or not.

I am not sure how a good internship sounds like, cause mine was a total crap show. It seemed like my team member didn't want to mentor me, whereas another summer intern (a guy) had a much better experience. His mentor always attended the daily sync ups and his code was reviewed and merged on time.

But at this point I’ve been feeling numb because of the toxic environment. I feel like I’m in need of a career change and I want to pursue something in IT. Even if I earn less money starting, I want to find something that makes me happier.

I’ve been looking at entry level positions since I don’t have that much “official” experience other than an internship for college that I loved. There’s a couple of full time computer technicians jobs for different schools close to me. I really enjoy working with computers, troubleshooting and working with hardware. I feel It would be much more fulfilling from what I’m doing now. 

Is there anybody out there doing something similar currently? (The job role is called support staff computer technician)
What can I expect from this job?
What’s a day to day expectation? 

Thanks in advance!"

I finished as a part-time student (senior second semester) with many Teaching Assistant roles along with  Research Assistant roles. I do not have any industry experience, as two of my internships got cancelled due to COVID-19. I recently graduated, and applied for a Master's degree in BU college of Engineering. I got in, with a 25% scholarship. 

I knew, that I was going to pursue a Master's. But then, my country went through an economical crisis. My family was able to afford tuition; however, now I need a loan in order to pursue my studies. I am very undecided on wether or not I should pursue my Master's right away.  I am willing to get the loan, but I am not sure if this might be the smartest idea.

I actually have a Research Assistant and a Teaching Assistant job for the following semester; however, they won't pay that well. So, it is not enough to cover the expenses. 

I need the help of my internet friends... 

Thank you, your personal experiences are important to me.

TL;DR

Should I immediately do a Master's of Computer Engineering after graduating from a bachelor's of computer engineering (same university)? I have a 25% scholarship in the USA."

So im in Montréal Canada, and I graduated in December 2020 as a mechanical engineer , since then I applied for about 200 hundred engineering positions and so far none have granted me a job. I was part of Sae Supermileage and formula, participated in many competitions, I was very good at designing stuff I gave solidworks and fusion 360 tutorials) and overall did very good along my studies in most fundamental classes. I was suppose to get an internship in may 2020 but i think all of us knows what happened and well the internship was canceled. The university I studied in didn't have mandatory internships so i just decided to take summer classes and get my degree earlier. 8 months later I landed a job as a 3d printing technician where I will create slices, do some design, assembling with different materials, integration of electronic components etc.. Now my question is the following : in quebec we need to cumulate 24 months of experience in engineering work to be able to use ENGINEER in out resume and I have 5 years to do so (minus 8 months in my case) what do you guys feel the best move to do is? Should i stay longer in this position or use it as experience as soon as possible to move on (no engineer position in the compaby i am with). Thank you all for your responses"

I am in my final year of university. I started my first 2 years as a honours physics major at McGill college. I realized research is not for me and that I like software developpement so I switched to physics and comp. sci. major. I have 3 semesters left to graduate and currently possess no internship/work experience.

Given the gravity of my situation, I started coding 8-10h a day on personal projects about 2 months ago. I have 2 projects that are ""showable"" for a CV but they're nothing impressive, github available [here](https://github.com/hexaquarks), where [a particle geometrical  simulation](https://github.com/hexaquarks/Particle_Fun) is my best project.

Recently, I had to stop coding since I am undergoing a severe eye strain, and that coupled with restarting university in 10 days, whence I won't have much time to work on personal projects, scares the living shit out of me because I don't think I have a chance at scoring an internship for next summer.

Comp. Sci. and software engeneering students, I feel , are a mile ahead of me (2 full years ahead) and I have a very low potential of scoring an internship. 

Given my projects above, 3.8 CGPA and only 3 months since coding, do I have a shot at internships for next summer or should I take this semester off and do more personal projects ?


Tl;dr Final year student, coding and in comp. sci. since 3 months, 3.8 CGPA, a couple of projects to show for it under [my github](https://github.com/hexaquarks), do I have a shot at internships for next summer or should I take this semester off?"

It'd be wonderful if I could get a quick review on my profile for MS CS in USA/Canada. Here is an overview of my current profile: 

Bachelor's in ECE from an un-popular university with GPA: 9.51/10 (rank ~ 3) 

Research: About 10 full papers in A* machine learning conferences. 

Internship/work-experience: Hardware role: 5 months internship + 1 month (as of now) full time job at a Fortune 50 company. 

GRE/TOEFL: Yet to give. Should I just skip GRE?? 

Colleges in mind: 

Stanford: MS CS 

UC Berkeley: MS/PhD CS

CMU: MS ML, PhD ML

UC San Diego: MS CS 

University of Toronto: MS CS


A couple of questions: 

1. Are these colleges feasible? Or should I apply to more programs to broaden my chances? If so any suggestions? 

2. Does a hardware job make my profile incoherent with MS CS/ML?

p8wzwb,50,2021-08-21,Changing Careers at 34 yrs old : Train Conductor to IT Tech,Thunder-Sloth,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p8wzwb/changing_careers_at_34_yrs_old_train_conductor_to/,"I really enjoy reading the posts from this sub and I have noticed that a lot of people inquire about changing careers at an older age. I wanted to share my experience with anyone who was in a similar situation to myself.

I posted on reddit, in the CSCareerQuestions sub a few years back titled ""Mid-Life Crisis"". Which can be accessed here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahx1dt/mid\_life\_crisis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahx1dt/mid_life_crisis/)

Basically I was 34 years old at the time, leaving the railroad after 11 years and entering into the tech field. I originally entered college for an AS in IT but after speaking with a few friends who are successful software engineers, making around 150k/yr (with 8+ yrs experience), I decided to switch majors to software development. I spent one year at a local community college in New Hampshire trying to figure out how to code and whether or not programming was for me. I thought at the time, this school and its faculty in the CS department wasn't up to standard, especially because the CS teacher had just left the field after 10 yrs to come back to teaching and I found it very difficult to learn from her. But most importantly their AS in software development did not transfer to any four-year CS programs, which I thought was weird.

I think in all honestly, after seeing how successful my friends were, and my love and interest for computers was so strong that I would eventually be able to pickup the coding and learn to love it. So, I transferred to a highly recommended CS program at a Community College in Massachusetts that has a direct transfer program to UMASS for a Bachler's in Computer Science.

I was wrong about programming. Although I do have a passion for computers and technology, programming/coding is just not for me. I don't get some of the advanced and even basic concepts. No matter how many videos I watch, books I read, or eli5's I read, I just do not get it. Like, my brain is not capable of comprehending what is happening. And most importantly I find coding to be boring, and not interesting. 

I've now spent a little over two years trying to force myself into a career that I have no interest in pursuing ( when I am being honest with myself). I've stressed myself out to the point of having panic attacks while I struggle through advanced programming courses while simultaneously struggling through Trigonometry and Calculus. Thankfully, through determination and hard work I was able to pass all of my classes (while lying to myself that this path will work itself out). I have a lot riding on this path that I have chosen and it felt like I had an immovable weight on my shoulders at all times. I have a wife and two kids, I left a good paying career for this.

During my most recent semester, I obtained an internship as an IT Intern for a local NH school district. It was supposed to be a four month internship at $16 an hour. I really bent over backwards and went above and beyond at the job. They extended my internship twice and after 10 months, offered me a full-time position as an IT Support Technician. I absolutely LOVE my job. I started out repairing chrome books for students, and as time went on, I got more responsibilities and trust. I just recently installed all of the new access points in the grade school building. I love every aspect of the school IT field and everything that it involves. My boss and team are amazing. I have a really good, easy going attitude with people and I am constantly being told by people how much the like and appreciate me. This is something I am not used to hearing, and I gotta tell ya, it feels good.

I feel like I really lucked out and thanks to this internship, I have a whole new outlook on life and my career going forward. The pay for IT in schools is low compared to industry but I started out making 55k/year and plan on eventually becoming a sys admin or network admin which typically I see making around 80+/yr. And if I do end up earning a BS degree I could potentially go on to becoming a Director of Technology in the future. Being able to make the same kind of money I was making at the railroad while only working 40+ hrs versus 60+ hours is a crazy thought to me. But even if I had to work in a position similar to what I am doing now and make 60-70k I would ultimately be happy. I really, genuinely love my job and I love the atmosphere. 

Leaving the comfort and security of the railroad was a very difficult decision. But you have to take the risk in order to earn the reward. And DON'T force yourself into something because of the $$$ associated with the career. Trust me, I spent way too much time forcing myself to pick up programming when I could have been enjoying my life a lot sooner. I am 37 yrs old and have nothing but hope and inspiration for the future.

I had one semester left (four classes) to obtain my AS in Computer Science. Instead of putting myself through the pain of Calculus II and more programming oriented classes, I decided to transfer to a four year school early and to pursue a BS degree in Information Technology. They ended up using 67 (out of 120) credits from my previous education and now have 53 credits left to obtain the BS degree in IT. I am working full time and will be attending 100% online with 2 classes per 8 week term. 

If it just doesn't work out with the schooling, it's ok, it's not the end of the world. I am continuing down this road with the knowledge that I have an amazing job, in a field I love, doing work that I excel at. I personally know several people in the IT industry who do not have degrees or even any certs for that matter and do really well. In lieu of college I will take the path of getting certs like A+, Network+, Security+ and beyond. I plan on earing certs whether the BS degree works out or not, but for the time being I will be busy enough with work and the two classes per term. 

I hope this helps anyone looking to change careers into IT and know that it is possible to do no matter how old you are or what obstacles are in the way.

TLDR; Left Railroad at 34 yrs old to pursue college and IT career. Took two years to realize CS/Programming not for me. Got internship as an IT tech @ school district. Best decision ever made. 37 yrs old now."
p8x0vl,1250,2021-08-21,Howdy! from Hell.,DrBlackJack21,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/p8x0vl/howdy_from_hell/,"**Howdy, from Hell!**

Vivian found herself in quite a dilemma. Even her best demon couldn't break this subject. His resilience was apparently more than anyone in her department could handle. When she asked Volgaf what was so difficult about this one, he looked confused and ashamed as he shrugged. ""I dunno, boss. He's just so...weird. It gets to ya after a while.""

Well, enough was enough. How did the human saying go? If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. She fixed her best ""I've tortured so many people I find your attempt at bravado boring"" expression in place and marched into the cell.

Suspended by his wrists to the opposite wall was the subject. His current physical manifestation had only been around long enough for it to grow the shadow of a beard. As was standard procedure, he was primarily naked to make him feel ashamed and vulnerable. His physique was nothing special, even by human standards. His muscles were underdeveloped, and he had a bit of a belly on him, but nothing else note-worthy stuck out.

Right now, the subject was still intact since, in his frustration, Volgaf had apparently atomized the subject's last body, and this one was newly issued, all of its musculature and nerves intact. This should have been just another victim in an endless sea of victims Vivian had tormented, but something was off. This one was smiling.

Vivian kept her face carefully neutral as he attempted to wave with one of his manacled hands while grinning. ""Well, howdy! Yer a new face around here! What happened to old Volgaf? Last I remembered, he was saying it was time someone else dealt with me. I'm guessing that someone is you?""

The deviless stared at him a moment, trying to understand what was happening before she responded. ""You...you *do* know I'm here to torture you, right?""

The subject nodded. ""Yup, and we'll get there shortly, I'm sure, but yer just doin yer job, and that's no reason to spoil a perfectly delightful conversation before that!""

He looked thoughtful a moment before his expression changed to some sort of confusion or consternation. ""Oh, but where are my manners? Name's Alen Smith. Nice to meetcha! Miss...?""

Vivian sneered. ""You may call me Mistress Vivian. I've broken the spirits of countless souls in Hell, and soon you will be no different...""

Alen smiled and nodded, his head bobbing up and down in a congenial way that infuriated Vivian. ""Oh, I'm sure of that! No doubt about it! As soon as you walked in, I said to myself, 'Now there's a woman who knows her business! Yer in for it this time, Alen!'""

He looked thoughtful a moment before his expression turned apologetic. ""But I'm afraid Mistress Vivian is just too much of a mouthful for little old me! So I'll just call you Vivian, and you can call me Alen. I'm pretty sure before we're done here, we're gonna be on pretty close terms after all! No reason to let a bit of stuffy formality get between us!""

Vivian's face contorted in rage at his audacity. ""Before I'm through with you, you'll be begging for the privilege of calling me whatever I tell you to! I will visit torments on you, unlike anything you've ever dreamed of! So consider this your first actual day in Hell, and pray that it's your last!""

Alen nodded with that same infuriating grin on his face. ""Oh yeah, I've no doubt! For the record, if yer anywhere near as good as the rest, I'm sure I'm in for a real rough time here shortly! I'd like to apologize ahead of time for any insults I might throw yer way. Especially anything about your ancestry or your choice of pastimes. That'll just be the pain talking, and I hope you won't take any of it to heart! Eventually, I'll just end up screaming incoherently before I 'die' again. I just want you to know I realize yer just doing yer job, and I don't actually hold a grudge. You and me? We're good!""

Vivian laughed cruelly. ""Oh, it's not just a job. I happen to enjoy tormenting pathetic little souls like yourself!

Alen shrugged, his grin never wavering. ""Of course you do! You have to do this all day, every day, for forever. If you didn't like doing it, you'd be miserable! You gotta take pride in your work! And look at you! Yer the one they go to when no one else can get the job done! You must be at the top of your field!""

Vivian preened under the compliment a little before scowling. How was this pathetic little man getting in her head like this? It was time to stop humoring him and get started on what she came here to do. It was time to break him. ""Well, I suppose we'll find out. I hope you're ready. You're in for a long night...""

Apparently, the man refused to be cowed. He continued to grin and nod. ""Yeah, I suppose it's about that time. Let's see what someone at the top of their field can do! Weirdly, I'm kind of looking forward to this!""

\-

Vivian approached the room once again. She'd done it. She'd finally broken that strange little man. It had taken days, but she'd finally seen the hope leave his eyes as he'd finally slumped in defeat! So why did she feel so unfulfilled as she approached the room to his cell once more?

Usually, after breaking a particularly difficult soul, she'd been filled with pride and swagger, but this time she felt like she'd lost something in her victory, and she couldn't figure out what. Still, she had a job to do, so she straightened her back, put her best scowl of annoyance on her face, and opened the door.

There was the pitiful human. Alen, was his name? She could see the hopelessness in his eyes as his gaze met hers. He took a breath, probably to scream, cry, or beg for mercy. It wouldn't matter though, there was no mercy or relief to be found here. She was almost a little sad to hear the waver in his voice... ""Hiya! Welcome back!""

Vivian blinked stupidly for a moment. She's obviously misheard. ""Um... I'm sorry, what?""

Alen nodded as if he'd been expecting that response, that stupid grin wavering for the first time Vivian had seen, replaced by an...*apologetic* look? ""Yeah, sorry about yesterday. I admit that the pain really got to me there, but that's no excuse for everything I said. Especially the parts about yer mother. I'm sure she's a lovely...demon? Still, what I said was uncalled for, so please accept my apology!""

Vivian could not believe her ears. After everything she'd said and done to him the last couple of days, this Alen was apologizing to her? True, some of his insults had been more imaginative than usual. Especially those where he'd described a series of acts that Vivian was confident was physically impossible for the participants involved, but after a few centuries, the insults a victim spewed as they were suffering just became background noise, something to be forgotten or ignored.

Before she realized what she was doing, Vivian responded. ""uh, yeah. Don't worry about it... All's forgiven...""

Alen's smile returned, more dazzling than before. ""Thank you very much! I was worried I went too far with some of those. Though, in my defense, you were even better than I'd expected. Still, that's no excuse.""

The shackled man gave his best shrug. ""Well, best to leave that stuff behind us. Today's a new day, I've got me a new body, and I'm with the most beautiful demon in all of Hell! So tell me, how's your day going?""

Vivian blinked rapidly. This was all probably just some stalling tactic to buy himself more time. ""You know nothing you say or do is going to save you, right? You're in Hell. There is no escape. I will torment you as long as it takes to leave your soul broken and empty.""

Alen nodded in that same stupid empty-headed way of his. ""Oh yeah, fer-sure! But that's no reason to be rude, eh? We'll get there when we get there, but this here is the best part! We get to chat for a little before you get to work, and I get to enjoy the company! No reason to let what's comin to ruin the here and now!""

Vivian laughed, with only a slightly hysterical edge the sound. ""Did I hear you right? Eternal punishment and suffering is no reason to ruin a few minutes of chatter before the torment begins for the day? I can't figure out if you're insane or just plain stupid!""

Alan's face had a serene expression on it as he nodded in agreement once more. Was he capable of any other head movement? ""Well, I suspect it's a little of column A and a little of column B. You know I've been here a little over a thousand years already? At first, I hated y'all and everything you did. But then, one day, my demon came in and just started going on about how bad his week was going. He complained about how overworked he was and how stressful his job was. All I could do was shrug and answer sarcastically, 'Tell me about it!' and he did! He spent the better part of the day just going on about how bad his day was, to the guy he was going to torment as soon as he was done!""

Vivian looked nonpulsed. ""And let me guess, you realized we are just like you, and right then and there decided to have a brighter outlook on 'life?'""

For once, Alen shook his head no. ""Hell no! I couldn't believe that idiot would think I'd be sympathetic at all! He'd tormented me for decades before this. Why would I care about his problems? But like you thought a bit ago, I realized this could buy me a few precious moments before he started tormenting me again, so I played along. This went on for *years.* He'd come in, and I'd lend a sympathetic ear. As a bonus, I got to catch up on all the gossip in Hell. Apparently, Beelzebub had a thing going with a succubus who worked the pits of flame at the time, and there was a question about whether her kid was his or a mortal's. It was hot news, let me tell you!""

Vivian remembered that bit of drama. It had caused some significant waves in Hell back then. But that had been at least a few centuries ago...

Alen continued. ""Well, anyway, this went on for a while. Years, decades, maybe even a century. I couldn't tell you exactly when, but somewhere along the line, I realized I was genuinely enjoying our little chats! Probably that stocking shelf syndrome I heard so much about back on earth. Anyway, sooner or later, the brass caught on and realized I wasn't as tormented as I should have been and sent in a new demon. Took me a while to win that one over, but a sympathetic ear is a hard thing to resist forever, and sooner or later, she gave in too! Since then, I've been bounced around from one demon to another, then one department to another. That's what brings us together here!""

Vivian couldn't believe her ears. Either the human was insane, or she was. He'd already been broken at one point and then simply gotten better? Because of office gossip? She shook her head. ""Ok, whatever. The inane drivel stops here. It's time for me to get to work!""

Alen went right back to nodding, with that infuriating apologetic smile on his face. ""Fair nuff! I suppose I chatted yer ears off a bit there. For the record, despite what I'm probably about to say, I would never actually judge you based on yer sexual preferences, whatever they are! You got a right to pursue happiness however you chose, and I wish you luck with that. Now, let's get started!""

\-

Vivian was exhausted. It had been a long day. She'd been torturing this odd little human who'd demanded over and over to speak with the manager of Hell. She'd broken the human's spirit eventually, but it had taken longer than anyone short of that idiot Alen. Right now, all Vivian wanted to do was sit back and relax after a long day. After all, she'd earned it!

As she walked into her residence, Vivian was met with the delicious aroma of dinner. Then, as she set down her case files, she was greeted with the now familiar, ""Well, howdy!""

Alen poked his head out from around the kitchen doorway. ""Oof, you look rough. Lond day?""

Vivian nodded exhaustedly. ""Uh, yeah, I had a real alpha ""Karen"" today. Took a lot longer to break than usual. I actually had to fall back on the flaming clown spiders!""

Alen shook his head in disgust. ""Oh yeah, I remember those! Real nightmare fuel that. Well, anyway, never mind. Why don't you come in and take a load off and tell me all about it! I got some chicken fried steak cookin up, and dinner'll be ready in no time.""

Vivian leaned in and gave Alen a quick peck on the cheek. ""You're sweet. Tell me, how was your day?""

Alen handed her a glass of something he called ""sweet tea"" then got back to working the mysteries of the kitchen he'd insisted they installed when he'd moved in. ""Oh, same old same old. You know, Narlack, the ever-burning, hasn't had a proper pedicure for those hooves of his in over a century? So I cleaned them up right quick while we went over his torment regimen. Just like the horses back home! Don't tell him I said that. Anyway, we found a few weak spots in his torment, and I bet he'll see a 10% increase in efficiency for breaking bank managers from here on out!""

Vivian nodded while sipping her drink. ""Excellent! I hear the new intern is in charge of your torment next weak. Unfortunately, he's a bit over-eager and keeps atomizing his victims before they can break.""

Alen grinned. ""Well, as Hell's first official torment auditor, I'll see if we can't straighten him out right quick. Oh, if you remember, could you pick me up some sweet potatoes tomorrow after work? I got another recipe that'll knock yer socks off!"" He looked at Vivian's cloven hooves pointedly for a moment. ""Uh, figuratively speaking.""

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just an idle thought I had at work. Humans can adapt to almost anything over a long enough time, wouldn't it be the same with Hell? Then I thought of this guy who was always annoyingly cheerful when demons came to torment him, and the story unfolded from there. For the record, I'm not claiming ""stock shelf syndrome"" is a good basis for a relationship, but this story wasn't written to make sense or get across any idea of morality or philosophy.

I have very little to no experience with coding but I want to apply for summer 2022 internships tailored to first &amp; second-year students like Microsoft Explore, Google STEP, Facebook University, UBER Star, etc. I am currently in the process of making my resume CS standards so I have been looking at freshman resumes posted under the resume roast thread to see resume templates, what to have and what not to have on a resume. I keep on seeing advice that says people should not add relevant coursework or high school-related content to their resumes or not include their soft skills (in general things that are ""intangible""). My problem is that since I have basically no experience in CS and have barely started college I don't know what exactly to add to my resume that's hard-core experience. I definitely plan on getting involved in the computing school, networking, and adding projects that I will do during classes and by myself once I learn the basics of coding during the semester (I gave myself a deadline of late September to mid-October to do all I mentioned and submit my applications). I know that I want an internship for next summer and have the ability to get one (self-motivation LOL) but I definitely have to work hard and need guidance from students that have gone through the process. 

TLDR:  I guess if anyone has any advice for first-years like me with little to no experience on how to make a decent resume or general advice on landing a first internship I'm all ears."

**11:35 AM**

Alicia had been happy with her life. She had managed to work her way in just a few years from simple intern to Planetary Don. Of course her path to the top had been paved with blood like any true leader among the Cartels worlds. Alicia though had managed it with the least amount of corpses she could though.

Today had start off wonderfully as well only a few minor incident reports from the Peace enforcers from over night. Then it had shown up and practically sliced through her planets defenses like they weren't even there. Only a single ship making the jump into Gravitic space to try and get help. She had been hopeful right up until the damned thing had slammed into her world just outside the main city.

That was three hours ago. Now nearly a third of her city was overrun with screeching horrors from space. Rather than being huddled up in a bunker somewhere though. She was moving through the streets surrounded by a small force of five Enforcers, her Head Enforcer at her side. The entire group making their way towards the cities only spaceport with the four lesser Enforcers at each corner providing protection.

The heavy staccato of both automatic and semi automatic weapons fire ringing off the buildings. Turning a corner they come across a group of nearly twenty of the vile fucks happily munching away on a large pile of corpses. Her Head Enforcer Katalis raising her hand up in a fist bringing the procession to a stop.

The group ducks back around the corner each silently thankful the group of creatures had been too busy with eating to notice them.

""Fuck. Any way around this Kat?""

Alicia asks her Head Enforcer, quite possibly the only person she had ever truly felt for.

""Sorry Boss. Unless you wanna spend an extra hour moving this is the fastest way.""

Cocking back the slide of her rifle making sure its got one in the chamber, before checking her mag. Alicia sets her jaw as she prepares to quite possibly send her loyal Enforcers to die.

""Fuck. Alright lock and load people. Things are about to get heavy here.""

She waits until each of them have nodded in acknowledgement before with a single wave of her hand the four Enforcers with her charge around the corner. Waiting for a few seconds for the fight to be engaged Alicia and Katalis move into a dead sprint around the corner attempting to simply push their way through.

Firing while running Alicia is focused only on the other end of the street beyond where her now four enforces are fighting a rapidly losing battle just barely making it passed as the first of the enforcers go down. The SMG  they had been using clicking empty allowing one of the spider like creatures to jump onto their chest and consume the Enforcers head.

Stopping and turning to provide cover for Katalis. Alicia is struck in the shoulder by a bright purple beam of plasma that severs her left arm at the shoulder. Screaming in pain as she stares at the smoking stump where her arm used to be. She is yanked down just in time for another beam of plasma to pass over her by less than an inch.

""Damnit Boss be more careful.""

Alicia manages to smile as she looks into the face of the woman she loves.

""I.. I think this may be it Kat.""

Alicia says looking up at the still ten creatures still moving towards them the rest of the enforcers laying dead on the ground or dissolving into goo as she watches. The sound of Katalis's heavy assault rifle filling the street.

""GO BOSS! I will try to hold them off""

Alicia shakes her head a soft, sad smile on her face.

""You know I could never leave you behind. Together until the end.""

Alicia gets back to up onto her feet pulling up her own rifle with her one remaining hand.

""Together forever my love.""

They say in unison as they lay into the monsters. As the last of the creatures fall to the ground dead but still twitching the two of them let out a sigh of relief. The moment lasts for all of a few seconds before a loud cacophony of moans and grunting splits the sudden stillness that had fallen over the street. The two begin back peddling as fast as they can as from around the corner comes a horde of what looks like people.

Many of the horde are missing limbs, missing chunks. Many of them even missing their entire head. All of them though are armed in some way either with rifles, pistols or makeshift melee weapons. Turning to run both stop as they stare at a second horde of mutilated, weapon wielding corpses.

""Well fuck.""

Alicia and Katalis say slightly out of unison. Raising their rifles they do their best to make their final stand. The sounds of their rifles mixing in with the moans and grunts of the two hordes. Katalis is the first to go down of them being piled on by nearly three dozen of the corpses. Katalis screaming in agony as her flesh is torn off in ribbons. Blood fountaining up from among the mass of bodies as her throat is torn out.

Screaming in rage Alicia uses her one hand to spray 7.62 Caliber Depleted uranium rounds into the horde until her rifle finally clicks. Looking over to the mound of moving bodies and flesh where her lover, best friend and most precious of confidants went down Alicia reaches into her pocket pulling out a small round thing.

""Be seein ya real soon babe.""

She says out loud before screaming at the horde of undead.

""COME ON YOU MUTHAFUCKERS YOU WANT SOME OF ME. WELL HERE I FUCKING AM!""

Rushing forwards she bits the ring pull on the M897A3 High Yield Thermobaric Anti-Matter  Thorium Salt Flechette Fragmentation Grenade. Pulling it does cause several of her teeth to fracture but she does manage to pull it out as she rushes into the closest grouping. Alicia screams her hate and rage at the monsters holding the grenade up to her chest.

""EAT THIS YOU FUCKERS!""

Are her very last words as the grenade goes off creating a fifteen meter wide Anti-matter explosion that propels the flechettes out at hypersonic speeds. As the explosion ends and the dust settles the entire street including the front faces of the nearby buildings. Are either melted, slagged or covered in slowly bubbling and hissing chunks of meat. Within minutes though more groups of mutilated humans and spider creatures file in to clear away any Biomatter they can find.

I asked my boss for a salaried position once I graduated or at least a pay raise, which she told me she would “get back to me on”. 2 months later, I was getting exploited still, doing jobs well above my pay grade, taking on huge projects that salaried workers wanted nothing to do with, all the while, $15/hr. Worst of all, they’d begun to ask me to come into the office and then we’re giving me bullshit tasks and yelling at me when I wasn’t jumping for joy that I was getting my time wasted in a bleak corporate building. fuck corporate, fuck capitalism. i can’t do it anymore. i just entered the work force as a graduate and was already getting exploited by a team who apparently “loved me so much”. bullshit. you loved my labor, not me."
p8ydma,428,2021-08-21,There's a waterslide in the middle of the North Sea.,twocantherapper,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p8ydma/theres_a_waterslide_in_the_middle_of_the_north_sea/,"For some fucking reason, some absolute weapon of a man built a waterslide in the middle of the North Sea. Me and the lads on the cod trawler couldn't believe it when we found it.

There we were; bracing ourselves against 40ft rogue waves and horizontal sleet, carried on hurricane-level turbulence 50 miles out from Scotland, when we spotted it. An 8 looped, baby-blue plastic waterslide, standing defiantly amongst the building-sized waves and ship-bucking winds. It had a ladder and little white-and-red flags for a lifeguard and everything.

It was Gaz who saw it first.

""Jesus Christ"", he yelled over the North Sea roar, ""there's a fucking waterslide out there!"".

I was about to yell back that he was an idiot when, out of habit, my gaze turned to follow where his trembling finger pointed. He wasn't lying; there was a fucking waterslide out there.

""Fuck me…"" I muttered under my breath, ""that's a fucking waterslide.""

""Is that a fucking waterslide?!"" Old Dave, the captain, had poked his head out the cabin to get a view uninhabited by the fat drops of rain smashing into the viewing window. ""Fuck me, it actually is. That's a fucking waterslide, in the middle of the North Sea!""

He joined the rest of us, running from the wheel onto the deck to lean over the starboard bulwark. Every man on the vessel stood gawping at the horizontal blue loops, those steel bars set into concrete standing firm against the lashing of wind and monstrous waves. Even the tiny lifeguard flags and the bucket they were in seemed unperturbed by the North Sea's rage. This was in stark contrast to the nets and gear on the ships deck, all of which strained at the straps saving them from being lost at sea. The search beam on the roof of the cabin swung in the concrete plinth's direction, carving it out against the almost unscathed Arctic darkness. I turned around, peering to see who had climbed up to direct it.

That's when the ship capsized.

It happened in three moments; the mother of all surges crashed down, I was in the air above churning foam, all was black and my lungs filled with ice water. We had life jackets of course, but in seas this rough the buoyancy offers little help. Fortunately this wasn't the first time I'd found myself in the drink. Adrenaline let instinct take charge and I became singularly focused. 

Swim, you bastard, swim and don't stop until you reach that fucking waterslide.

The constant flashes of lightning were my only guide. Somehow though I made it to the concrete platform. My lungs burned from inhaling so much of the subzero salt water. Those freezing waves still smashed around me as I climbed the steel rungs bolted into one side of the structure. It was when I got to the top that I was allowed a lightning-strike snapshot of our ship's stern vanishing below the churning surface.

The gale was still beating down on me. There were no signs of my crewmates, but I dared not risk standing to look for them in the roaring black waves. The force of those winds would no doubt have carried me straight back into the freezing waters. Instead I rolled towards the only thing I could see on the platform besides the blue plastic water slide; a hole, about 10ft in diameter, in the centre of the concrete space.

I was terrified by the time I'd reached it, but only by the memories of Mick or Benny or Saul's Mum's weeping faces when they found out their boys had drowned. I'd sworn never to do that to my old dear. That's why I only peered into the gaping ladder-less hole for a few moments before deciding this new unknown danger was far less than the known certainty of an enraged North Sea. The lightning-carved silhouette of a fresh 30ft-er bearing down on the platform was all it took for me to close my eyes and throw myself into the yawning void.

The Arctic overspill from above fell through the darkness with me. We weren't falling for long. After about ten seconds my plummet was broken by something soft, cold, and clothed in wet fabric. It crunched beneath me when I landed, despite the distinctly moist squelching nature of the way it cushioned my landing. It took me a few minutes to find a flare in the safety kit on my belt. Even though the echoing from the tunnel mouth on the distant ceiling made the roar of the waves louder than ever before, I still heard the high-pitched scream that could only have come from my own mouth.

It couldn't have come from Bob or Fred's. Their necks were broken. That's why discovering I'd landed on them made me scramble as far back into the flare-lit room as I possibly could. I screamed even louder when Gaz came falling through the hole. Shock is a funny thing; when Gaz landed my main concern was how I'd explain to Bob's Mum that the the impact of ""Big Fat Gazman"" landing on him caused his eyeballs to pop from their sockets and splat violently on the opposite wall, a far-too-short way from my yelling features.

""Who the fuck is screaming? Keith mate is that you? What have I landed- OH MY FUCKING GOD NO THAT IS A BIG PILE OF NOPE FUCK THAT-""

""GAZ! GAZ! MOVE AWAY FROM THE FUCKING HOLE!""

For a man with a moniker that contains the words ""big"" and ""fat"", Gaz could move fast when he needed to. This is an essential skill for any fisherman, as nobody wants to be decapitated by a snapped line. Another life saving skill is knowing when to follow instructions without stopping to look around and find out why. It's both of these skills which saved Gaz from being crushed by the falling frames of Dave and Alfie. Dave landed safely on the pile of sodden corpses. The organic snap which cracked the air let us know Alfie had joined them.

""What a fucking storm!"" Dave grinned at us, before the grin turned to a scream upon noticing the puddle of blood forming around where a sharp piece of bone protruded from the new unnatural joint in Alfie's neck. ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST ALFIE NO, WAIT SHIT IS THAT BOB-

""DAVE FUCKING MOVE!"" It was Gaz that yelled this time, still only a yard or two from the hole himself. Dave showed the same intuitive response that kept Gaz alive, rolling from the corpse pile mere milliseconds before the thick boots did to Fred's skull what they would have done to his own. 

""I want to go home."" Nathan whimpered, upon seeing the red mess of bone and brain on his thick rubber footwear. ""I want to go home, I want to go home, I want to-""

He was snapped out of his panicked jabbering by his own neck snapping. Jim rolled off of him and the other bodies, already vomiting from the realisation of what had just happened. 

By the time a few minutes had passed since the last of my former crewmates had fallen to their death, there were only the four of us standing. Me, Gaz, Dave, and Jim. Four bodies lay in a pile, leering at us through the dim red light of the flare. The rest never made it out the waves.

""Lads…"" Gaz eventually managed once we'd all stopped screaming. ""Where the hell are we? What in God's name just happened?

""We capsized, and all swam for the water slide, then we fell down a hole."" I heard the words leave my lips, rather than consciously deciding to say them. I was still in shock, my grip on the flare trembling and my gaze fighting hard not to be drawn to the pair of glistening orphaned eyeballs peering at me from a few feet to my right.

""I have no clue why it's here,"" Dave said slowly, his 1000 yard stare locked on Fred's mangled skull, ""but I am so glad we found that water slide. I've been on these waves for nearly forty years. I know this sea, and I've never seen her this angry. It was a blessing, but still something isn't right.""

""Well no shit Dave something isn't right, are you fucking high, of coure something isn't right! You don't find fucking water slides in the middle of the North fucking Sea!"" Jim was slapping the back of his hand into his palm to emphasise each word of the last sentence. He was the youngest of us, and this was clearly shown in the additional layers of terror present in his face. I wasn't in a state to acknowledge it at the time, but he was doing well considering he was also dealing with his first brush with drowning. As I said though, I wasn't exactly in a fit state to recognise this.

""Shut up Jim, show him some fucking respect. You have no idea what you're talking about!"" Of the man and boy, the boy was struggling but the man was very obviously broken. So was I though, which is why I ignored my instinct and turned to Dave, ""so what do we do?""

The wild-eyed man, whose kind wrinkled face was usually so warm, was the least qualified at that moment to lead us. We followed him anyway. All I knew was that I was cold, in pain, and terrified. Dave's ramblings may have just been lunatic gibberish, but they were maniacal nonsense from an authority I recognised. Had I been a bit more with it, I would have questioned his decisions instead of blindly following. I wish I had been. If I had, we'd never have gone into the door marked ""NURSERY: STRICTLY NO ENTRY"".

We'd been stumbling around wide, unlit concrete corridors for about six hours when we found it. The deep groaning from the metal beams lining the walls constantly reminded us that, outside dark passages, there was nothing except inky ocean blackness and whatever monstrous things it contained.

Aside from the pile of bodies, the room we'd fallen into was quite bare. There was a lightswitch, and a bulb hanging from each corner of the ceiling, but despite Jim's frantic switch flicking they wouldn't sputter into life. The same went for the switches in the corridors he'd periodically try, despite Dave's increasingly aggressive insistence he leave them alone.

The floors of the room and hallways were lined with red tiles. I don't know what colour they actually were, but the glow from the flare left them all rendered a deep, flickering mosaic of scarlets and crimsons. There'd been lines of drains, the kind you find at swimming pools, to filter the seawater overspill from the hole in the ceiling. Clearly there was some kind of power in this facility, as Jim could hear the distant sucking and gushing of a pumping system when he put his ear to one of the plastic grates.

That's why Jim suggested we follow the pipes leading left at the first split of the corridor. Dave disagreed. Dave decided we should keep following the rail.

It was hanging from the ceiling, kept in place by thick steel cables drilled into the concrete every few feet or so. The rail started at the very lip of the hole, then ran along the dripping ceiling into the dark corridor that sprawled forth from the room's only exit. It was constructed from three stainless steel plates arranged in a rigid arch, housing a thick chain exposed on its underside. This quietly clinking and clanking length of equally rusted iron rivets was looped around large wheels set directly below each ceiling cable. My mind couldn't help but conjure up images of slaughterhouses and abattoirs, of gutted beasts turning slowly on meathooks as the conveyor belt rail carried their corpses to the grinder in irregular, shuddering bursts.

I think Jim's mind was conjuring similar images, which is why he didn't stop pleading with us to turn back as we followed the rail further and further from the source of the gurgling water pump sounds. There was definitely power somewhere in this place, even if none of the light switches dispelled the darkness. The doors we found at various points were all sealed with electronic keypads whose illuminated fingerprint scanners created small glittering oases of false hope as we traversed deeper below the waves.

Jim kept trying these keypads until Dave's harsh reprimands grew into threats of violence. It was when we reached the empty lobby/landing, and the rail disappeared into a steel hatch above the door signposted as the nursery, that Dave started delivering on his promises.

""Ow! What the fuck man!"" Jim was looking up at the three of us, a streak of dark red pouring from the nose that Dave had just broken.

Dave's blood-covered fist was still shaking when he replied. ""I told you, shut the fuck up. We're following the rail. The rail will lead us out. Right Gaz? Keith?"" Dave's newly wild eyes flicked between us in quick succession. Gaz smirked and nodded furiously, his face in a grin betrayed by his tearful eyes and trembling jaw. My nod was slow, and accompanied by a gulp. I don't know whether it was the twitching, the flecks of spittle in his gray beard, or the way Dave's tongue would occasionally dart across his lips like a reptile, but it was beginning to dawn on me that I'd backed the wrong horse in the power struggle between youthful ingenuity and old age's ""wisdom"". Unfortunately, the realisation was dawning just a few moments too late.

""No you shut the fuck up you crazy old bastard! We've been down here hours and this rail leads to a fucking NURSERY! Why would the way out be in a-"" The rookie trawlerman never got to finish his sentence. The steel-capped toe of Dave's boat smashed into the boy's chin, knocking him sideways into the cement wall. There was a dull crack, accompanied by a jet of dark red spraying at the impact point where hair, flesh, and bond met cinder block. Jim's head bounced off the wall. He looked up at me, blood pooling from his split skull, his eyes crossing in and out of focus.

""Keith... mate… please…"" The lump in my throat rose. The message to step forward and put myself between the helpless teenager and the madman we'd mistakenly elected to lead was only halfway home when Dave responded for me. I screamed the first time his heavy boot came down. Gaz was holding me back for the subsequent two dozen stomps Dave delivered. His aging knee rose up and down again and again, stamping on Jim's head until the dull squelching thuds were replaced by muted cracks and snaps of splitting bones, and then the wet smack of rubber on blood slicked tiles. Jim's helpless, and now headless, body had stopped twitching long before Dave finished.

""WHAT THE FUCK DAVE!"" I screeched, struggling helplessly against the collosal Gaz's pudgy grip. ""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU DOING YOU FUCKING MAD BASTARD?! HE WAS JUST A KID!"" Behind my tear-stained eyes, all I could see were panic-fuelled visions of Jim's Mum, of me having to explain that I'd allowed a psychopathic near-pensioner to stamp on his head until his brains were splattered across the rubber overalls of two grown men who should have saved him.

""OH KEITH, DO YOU HAVE BALLS NOW DO YOU?"" Dave snarled, rounding on me. The wildness in his eyes had evolved into red blemishes around burst capillaries. ""FUNNY, I DON'T REMEMBER THEM WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO SHORE AND WALKED IN OUR YOUR BROTHER FUCKING YOUR WIFE!""

Now I wasn't just seeing red because of the flare. Before I could free myself and slam a fist into Dave's face for bringing up this known taboo subject, Gaz revealed just how much he also didn't appreciate the comment.

""YOU DON'T FUCKING BRING THAT UP!"" Gaz roared. He threw me to the ground, stepping over me and slamming a paw into Dave's jaw with one fluid motion. ""YOU KNOW WE DON'T FUCKING BRING THAT UP, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY ONE OF OUR FUCKING MISSES!""

It still amazes me that Dave breaching an unspoken code amongst men who spend time away from their wives was what snapped Gaz out of his panic. He'd seen a young man have their head pulverised and said nothing. If he were still alive we'd definitely be having words about it.

As it was, I was too shocked at the sudden ferocity with which Gaz sicked himself on Dave to do anything but watch, jaw dropped and eyes almost as wide as Dave's. For his part, Dave was too busy being repeatedly punched in this face by the obese man sat on his chest to comment on the situation himself.

""YOU… DON'T… REMIND… US… THAT… THEY… CHEAT…"". Gaz punctuated each word with a fresh blow to Dave's face. From my viewpoint on the floor I couldn't see it's condition, but the way the old man's blood-covered boots stopped kicking and flailing painted a clear enough mental image. When Gaz eventually stood and I saw that the truth was much closer to the remains of Jim than I'd imagined, an irrepressible wave of nausea rose up from my gut.

""Christ Keith, don't get it on my boots."" Gaz was crouched over me, his fat palm hammering my back in an effort to help me clear the last of the vomit. I was about to respond, to make some half-terrified wisecrack about the mess he'd made with our former captain, when a noise made us both yell and look into the deep red shadows above. There was a loud metallic THUNK, accompanied by the squeak of unoiled wheels and the clink-clank of rusted iron. The chain in the rail was moving.

""Gaz,"" I stammered, pulling myself to my feet and staring at the hatch above the door marked NURSERY: STRICTLY NO ENTRY, ""Gaz mate, we need to go.""

When the lobby was suddenly illuminated by a bright light from the space beyond the metal hatch, Gaz started vigorously nodding in furtive agreement. For some reason though, our feet didn't get the message. Both of us remained rooted to the spot, each waiting for the other to grab us by the shoulder and yank us into a full-pelt sprint away from those slowly parting steel hatch doors. Before either of us had the chance to muster up the needed courage, however, the rail mechanism above lurched it's cargo forward with a screeching jolt. The hatch burst open.

I screamed. Gaz started crying. The steel hatch doors swung closed with a deafening clang, plunging the room back into the near-darkness of my last flare.

Something was dangling directly above us, hanging from the conveyor chain by a hook piercing the large fin at the end of its thick, veiny tail. It looked almost like a walrus or manatee, if somebody had decided to turn a walurs or manatee's skin inside-out and stretched its neck about four feet. Another notable difference was the excess amount of long, bony fins jutting from it's bulbous stomach. It had thrice as many as any known species of marine mammal. These spidery flippers wriggled and twitched excitedly as the scent of the dead men's blood reached the three flaring nostrils on its back.

At first I thought it must have been looking away from me, because I couldn't see its face in the almost un-permeated red darkness. When the tip of the fleshy tube that was its neck started to peel back, I realised to my unending horror that I was mistaken. 

The thick trunk of its neck juddered and spasmed, the loose folds of glistening skin on its surface retracting to reveal a long, yellow snout. By the time the wrinkled hood was stripped back I realised the slowly-spinning thing never had a neck to begin with. The quivering ""neck"" was actually an elongated head submerged beneath folds of skin.

Well, I thought it was elongated. Once the vertical slits along its jaundiced surface started peeling open, however, I knew I was mistaken. 

It was flat. 

I was still screaming and wishing for the kick-start from Gaz that would never come when the flesh petals began to unfurl. For the thirty-or-so seconds it took the starfish limbs to prize themselves apart, our screams were undercut by nauseating slurps and squelches which perfectly matched the viscous mucus dripping from this newly exposed flesh. Our screams only got louder once the ""face"" of this monstrosity could be seen in its full inglory. 

Each of the seven trembling face segments had three eyes running along its length. These eyes were round, bright, dancing independently of eachother as they sized up this unexpected meal. They were also distinctly human. They alone weren't what made my legs turn so numb I fell on my ass, though. No. That was the mouths.

It had three of them, arranged in a triangle on a flat tonguelike pad at the epicenter of the writhing 21-eyed gaze. The space between the maws was occupied by an unfamiliar orifice that oozed a pus-coloured substance. This discharge caused hissing and steam to rise from the floor tiles by Gaz's feet where it pooled. These mouths, also human and full of molars, knocked all hope of survival from my mind. I wept uncontrollably, shaking in the warm puddle of other men's blood and my own urine where I lay.

It wasn't the look of the mouths that broke me, despite the fact they were utterly horrifying in ways that test my nerve to ruminate on too long. It's the fact that they were talking to one another.

""What's this what's this what's this? What is it what the eyes bring us?""

""It is filthysmalls, is it?""

""Ay, I eyes filthysmalls yes yes yes. They want to play they does, yes yes yes yes.""

They conversed in sing-song voices devoid of any dialect I recognised. What I did recognise, the thing that horrified me so much about those understandable yet unintelligible words, was that the voices that uttered them belonged to human children.

Gaz was still standing. I think that's what saved my life. That's why it went for him first, giving me the few seconds I needed to run screaming into the dark corridor, away from this living nightmare.

Before either of us could move the air was cut through by a noxious odour. The stench curled the hair in my nostrils and sent my gag reflex into violent spasms. Working on a cod trawler, I thought I'd smelled the worst shades of rotting ocean flesh the sea could send to try and break my morale. I realised in an instant that I knew nothing of the stomach emptying horrors she could spew forth, and she was now punishing me for my overconfidence.

The punishment her tittering judge meted out on Gaz was much, much harsher.

Neither of us had time to react to the smell beyond starting to gag. The orifice between the mouths had puckered, the acrid acidic pus leaking from it now cascading from the pursed hole. I'd just about noticed the change when it convulsed, opening to spray forth a thick yellowish web of phlegm over Gaz.

He started screeching the moment the pus-coloured snot touched his skin. I could see why. As soon as contact was made, his flesh started bubbling, melting away to reveal veins, muscles, and eventually bone. The jabbering thing above had landed a direct hit.

Gaz just about had time to turn in my direction, arm outstretched, his remaining eye wide and full of tears, when the jaw he wanted to use to cry for help fell to the floor. We both watched it fall for a moment that seemed an enternity long; me with my unrestrained panic and mouth full of bile, Gaz with his exposed throat and flopping, jawless tongue. By the time I'd found my way to my feet, his arm had gone too. By the time I'd started running down the unlit corridor, his corroded body had collapsed under its own weight, the remaining eye still darting wildly in the few seconds before the last parts of his head dissolved into foul-smelling organic sludge.

I shouldn't have looked over my shoulder. That mental image, and it's implications, will scar me for whatever does remain of my life. I also shouldn't have dropped the flare. If I hadn't been running through the corridor in pitch darkness, the scientists with their night-vision goggles would never have been able to tackle me and drive that syringe into my neck.

I've been in this cell ever since I woke up. I don't know what happened to my clothes. They've been watching me since then, too. The scientists I mean. They've been poking and prodding me with needles for weeks, treating me like a damn pin cushion while they inject serums and take samples. I'm in no condition to fight them. Some of the syringes contain a sedative that keeps me drowsy. They must do, because they always seem especially keen to stick one in me when I get a bit, as one of them put it, ""restless and screamy"".

It was the one with the kind face who said that, the lady one. Can't be older than Jim. I think she's some kind of intern. It's her that brings my admittedly not-too-bad meals which are always steak, eggs, and beans. She's also the one who brought me the crayons and paper I'm writing this on (she wouldn't let me have a pen, too pointy she said.)

When she brings my next meal, I'm going to beg her to take this. Plead with her to put this out there somewhere, so my family know what happened. I know Hannah left me for Jack, but I still want her to know. Little Ian deserves to know what happened to his dad. Even if she doesn't get my message out there immediately, I hope the kind-faced scientist takes my advice and stores this away instead of throwing it out. Just in case she ever has a change of heart about… whatever the fuck they're doing to me.

I'm going to have to stop writing soon. I'm tired. My neck aches, and I've got these cysts on my sides that have been there for a few days now. I'm sure it's just the meat diet, but I've been getting big. Like, Gaz big. I'm hoping it's nothing to worry about though. I've got bigger problems than my health, like getting the fuck out of here.

Oh, and before I go, I did ask the kind-faced scientist about the waterslide. She just smiled at me and said ""Oh, yeah, I see why that must seem weird! You'll find out soon enough Keith, but during the larval stages you can get a bit… um… childlike. We find taking the newer converts up top and letting them go for a swim and use the slide helps them burn off a bit of excess energy.""

She'd leaned in closer after she said this, her face locked in an effort to offer genuine reassurance.

""Don't worry Keith, I know the nursery seems scary, but I'll make sure the others give you a turn on the slide."""
p8yr1f,0,2021-08-21,AMD and Nvidia need to get their act together,ECOG911,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/p8yr1f/amd_and_nvidia_need_to_get_their_act_together/,"I know 2020 was a crap year to release a new GPUs, and pricing has been shit ever since, however Nvidia and AMD has done barely anything to fix the situation. In short term, they don't care about the consumer. All they want to do is please the investors and make even higher profit margins. AMD and Nvidia have not struggled, and have made huge amounts of profit in the last year, and yet we're supporting this by still buying their overpriced GPUs, telling these two tech giants dominating as a duopoly that we will buy high priced cards, letting them completely neglect the budget market, and focusing on high end cards which are eaten by hungry miners. What we as a community have to do is stop buying GPUs for the time being and let the demand reduce.

Secondly, I do believe that Nvidia should have a second thought on the new LHR series of cards, as they have recently been cracked letting miners use 75% of the hash rate instead of 50%. A new version of this should be implemented reducing hash rate avaliable for mining, and stronger security against hacking. Intern, this would increase the stock of GPUs towards he gamers.

Finally to conclude, I believe there could be good news on the horizen, as with the introduction of Intel into the discrete gaming gpu market, which could be greatly influential with the pricing, and the resurrection of the budget market. If Intel can release budget GPUs at a reasonable pricing, it could bring down Nvidia's and AMD's pricing, only if they release with a mining limiter like Nvidia's LHR. This all revolves around if Intel releases quality GPUs, however only time will tell"
p8zrjm,8,2021-08-21,Is my company hiring “interns” for cheap labor?,anotherthrowaway-422,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p8zrjm/is_my_company_hiring_interns_for_cheap_labor/,"Throwaway account in case someone from my work sees this.

I’m somewhat of a career-changer, I graduated in 2019 with a physics degree and one engineering internship. I got a job as a test automation engineer at an electronics company (I developed the software used to test hardware during the manufacturing process) After a year, I decided my job was kind of boring and went back to school part time get a second bachelor’s in CS so I could get into a software developer role in robotics or autonomous vehicles. After taking a few classes I got an internship at my current company.

It’s a startup of about 100 people in the bay area and we’re developing a medical robotic system, which I think is super cool. I really like the work and all my coworkers are nice and overall great to work with. I’ve been an intern for 3 months, and during my interviews, it was emphasized that they wanted to hire me full time after a 3-6 month internship. 

When it came to renew my contract, my manager offered to renew the internship for an additional 6 months, meaning I’ll be an intern for a total of 9 months. When I asked when I could be hired full time, my manager didn’t really answer and just said “it depends”. I was kind of upset by this because I have only gotten positive feedback about my work and I always finish tasks well before deadlines, so I thought I’d be qualified enough at this point for an entry level position. I also took a pay cut to be here, from 90k + benefits/PTO and now $33/hour with no benefits, PTO or holidays and I was assuming it would be short-term. (Like I was willing to take that pay cut for 3-6 months but not longer)

I later find out that another intern on the team actually has a master’s degree in computer engineering AND 3 years of work experience in software development. He’s not a US citizen so I’m guessing he took whatever he could find to get a company to sponsor his visa. But it seems shady that they wouldn’t just hire him full time right off the bat, he’s obviously way over-qualified for an internship position. Other interns on other teams I have met finished their masters’ degrees and it seems like they should have just been hired as entry level engineers rather than interns. Many interns do get hired full time eventually, but in general they seem overqualified.

Is this normal and fair or is it a red flag that I need to leave ASAP? I'm not sure if this is a situation where I should advocate for myself at work to get promoted or just get a new job."

However, I noticed a lot of people saying recruiters are constantly messaging them directly asking if they’re looking. I’m not getting that ever.

I just started my first full time role in May, but have 3 internships before that (about a year and a half of full time interning). All of these roles were as software developers.

just looking up page after page till the thing did what they wanted

Not only was I not  fired, I was given a great review, the offer of a reference, and the opportunity to come back if I so choose…

I spent the entire time thinking they were just about to fire me.

now I'm the only programmer on another project and similar things are happening i will

make dumb mistakes because I don't know what the hell is going on  and scramble around until I can figure out what reference material  will tell me what I need to know.  I'm slow,  I just grind at it one problem at a time.

I apparently cant remember things about the language i have been using for 6 years... so google 

but again, not only have I not fired but I've been offered a reference  and one of my bosses is currently working to find me another position when this one ends.

one of my other boss is wants to hire me for independent work.

I honestly would take most entry level positions, because I just want to switch into the industry ASAP. 

I’m currently working full-time, so I can’t attend a coding bootcamp - meaning I have to study independently. My current plan is to: follow the Cal CS major curriculum - going through course materials of each requirement for a B.S - grind leetcode and codewars, complete multiple relevant projects to makeup for lack of experience, and maybe take a course on coding interviews (although, I hear those aren’t great). I’m planning on working towards this goal for 6+ hours a day, because I do feel an urgency to escape my current situation. 

I’ve been following this plan for a month or two now, so I am still heavily inexperienced. I do feel pretty good about my progress already though, and definitely enjoy coding to a great degree. 

I’m hoping to land a job in a few months from now because I do learn pretty quickly; however I do, admittedly, have a tendency to overestimate myself. I know how difficult the process of landing a swe job is, even for those with a CS degree and internship experience, and feel somewhat naive for thinking that things are going to work out for me just like that. That being said, If anyone has a similar story to mine, do you have any advice on how to land a swe job without a cs degree? Any tweaks to my current independent study plan? I’ll take any advice I can get, because I’d rather make the corrections and adjust my projected timeline now rather than later.

Thanks to anyone that took the time to read this! I appreciate any help I can get."

here's some context: i come from a family where nearly everyone has high-paying jobs related to medical, science, or engineering. if i'm not super successful or don't make a lot of money, i'm worried i'll end up the laughing stock of my family. i know i shouldn't be worried about family opinions but, i really do not want to end up being the odd one out. 

anyways...i've taken plenty of advanced STEM classes in high school and have received high grades. i could major in a STEM subject if i had to...but for some reason, it has never interested me like it has my family. i'm way more into writing, media, communication, social sciences, politics, etc

recently i've done plenty of writing or media related internships. i made the decision that i will major journalism, since it is something i excel in.

earlier today, i was looking online for insight into a journalism major. i found that it is viewed as a useless major...many say ""it isn't necessary and the skills can be obtained through other majors"" + ""you don't need to major in it to work in journalism""...and journalism in general is a ""dying field"", ""hard to get a good career in"", ""not good for a lot of money""...

this has me really worried. i have a lot of questions, and if any of you have answers for me, that would be appreciated.

is journalism really a useless major?

if so, what is a good alternative?

should i just go in the complete opposite direction and go with a STEM major like the rest of my family?

if i stick with a journalism major, how can i get a successful career path out of it?

is it a good idea to major in journalism and then go to graduate school for a different field? what graduate schools would a journalism major be good for?

and, in general, just give me your advice/opinions about this. pros, cons, other majors, etc. sorry if this is too long, i know i kind of ranted and asked too many questions... whenever i talk to my family about this they act kind of annoyed/ashamed that i'd even consider journalism, which is why i'm asking reddit. thank you!"

I recently graduated from ASU with an undergrad in CS. I have no internship and in my interviews have mostly tried to push my Capstone which involved using Flutter to create an app. However I prefer a typical tech stack of Java/C/C# and such. 

I have two offers I am considering at the moment.

One is for 71k + 5k w/ a retention bonus for 1 year; + 7k salary bump after the second year completion. I am afraid of gaining no real experience as from what I have heard WITCH companies are career stunting. Also I don't want to relocate.  

The other offer from a regional planning agency for Phoenix that has offered me a flat 68k after some negotiation. The pay is less but I believe that it will be better experience, at max a software engineer there caps out at around 90k. They use C#, noSQL, AJAX, and JS. They haven't informed me on how the salary hikes are. Additionally, I will be working in a small team of only 4-5 other devs. 

My question is, would the lower compensation from MAG be worth the experience? 
 
I would appreciate any opinions/ advice."

Background: I have completed my bachelor's in Electronics and Telecomm in 2020 with a 9+ CGPA on 10. Currently, I work in business consulting at a MNC, also have completed 3 internships during my bachelor's, one at a govt organization.

I have a GRE score of 319(167 in quant). I would like to pursue master's in CS, fall 2022, as I'm interested in computer vision and devops. For this, I believe my foundations are quite weak, in programming and math as well. I can't study these basics due to long hours at work, almost end up working 10-12hrs a day on average, find myself exhausted on the weekends. As you may guess by now, I don't like business consulting. I had to take up this job due to financial constraints at my end.

I have some options right now in my mind. Firstly, quit this job and increase my skillset before admissions. But I think this would impact my overall profile in graduate applications and also during the visa interview. Secondly, find another job in my area of interest and develop my skills there, but i believe it would be near to impossible as I would not get hired due to lack of experience and knowledge in this domain. Thirdly, continue with my current job and end up studying the basics in graduate school. 

Dear Reddit, I really need your honest opinion on what possible path should I follow as I have very few people to reach out to. If you have another option than the above, I'd be happy to hear them. But please help out a fellow stranger."

I've been planning for MS in CS for fall 22 in US. Based on my profile I'm unable to figure out if i should go for fall 22 or wait for another year and then apply. My profile-
Electrical Engineering Major from Tier 1 University. Cgpa 8/10, currently in final year.

Internship experience- one industrial ML intern
Research- have ongoing projects (all in CS domain) under different profs which are about to complete. No papers right now, will probably write one soon before applying.

LORs- strong, worked under 4 different profs 

GRE- 321 (169 Q, 152 V) 4 awa
TOEFL- haven't given it yet

I've a few low grades in particular semesters (in 1-2 subjects, they're really low due to some specific reasons, but in the same semester other subjects have highest/near highest scores)
I'm worried that the grades would be a problem, I've seen a few Universities with a requirement of decent grades in all subjects (Georgia tech being one)

Extra curricular- Strong part of the application. Have good achievements and ranks. 

Kinda confused about applying this year with this profile, or wait for another year, get all the research work done with publications, get a work experience (by the time of applying period for the next fall term work ex would be at max 3-4 months)
 
Would be great if someone could advise something about this and also suggest a few Universities on the basis of this profile. Thanks!"

I need your thoughts and suggestions. 

*About Me :*  

graduated ( tier 3 college a month ago) -&gt; no job.

A backlog in College -&gt; No applications to WITCH . 

good in Aptitude, Language Knowledge (Python and C++), good DSA theory knowledge . can solve easy questions on codechef. Currently doing Leetcode easy. Will continue solving problems and I will contest soon.  

*Projects and Internships*:  few decent Web Dev projects . mostly in Python and Django. Mostly getting data from APIs and creating CRUD apps . i suck in front end but have a 3 month internship in frontend. 

*My problem:* These keep getting me interviews occasionally. But I keep failing them because the interviewers ask all sorts of things about your projects and later ask me DSA or they ask me to build MERN projects. I do finish the take home assignments but even then I would be ghosted. I dont have a problem with MERN but I think learning it takes a significant amount of time which i believe wont get me a job soon. I applied to 100+ companies but havent had a single offer. So Like I said I started doing DSA in the hope that maybe this will get me job soon. I am not a beginner in DSA. just a little above.  

I see ppl on social media and even my friends who aren't even that of a great coders but they get into these 7.5lpa jobs. I dont know what these TCS interviewers ask or if my friends are bluffing. Meanwhile I can't even get a single offer. I was so frustrated that i started applying to companies with 2 years bonds too. I just cant get my foot in the door. I networked a lot . I have quite a few Hr connections on Linkedin but they ghost me. I asked a person to refer me to Accenture. He did but for a management role. But i was rejected in that too. Meanwhile My parents who wanted me to go for govt jobs are suddenly asking ""where is job? Your cousin has it. Stupid ppl has got into wipro, the 3rd year girl 2 doors next got into tcs"". I dont have a answer to them. I've been looking for applying to TCS but i think hiring is over and new notifications arent showing up. Same in all witch companies. I really dont want to go there but do I have a choice?

I believe that I can learn things fast but I also know I am a procrastinator and lazy.  My eventual goal is to work in a hedge fund. But I like the technical nature of the stuff they do ( I like C++, rust ). Well what did I do in College? I did not completely waste the time. The first year is gone preparing for Jee again (my bad). The Lockdown period is the worst phase for my family. Insane health and mental problems. Cant say. But I am an ECE guy. Learnt a lot of electronics subjects, prepared for gate and explored lot of Computer Science stuff. Poor me who didn't know how objective the world is back then. But I am genuinely interested in Programming. And I want to get into high packages soon ( not bcoz of money but prestige and proving myself to my relatives).  But first i need a job because I am being extremely guilt tripped and pressurised to get a job asap or else I would be out of the house. So my question is 

*Question: What the heck can I do to get a job that pays me atleast 3.5L+ asap?( I dont need more or even an Internship with PPO). DSA ? MERN projects for fullstack roles? And Where to apply? What's the strategy I need? Should I stop applying to companies and learn DSA or projects? If so at what point should I feel its good to start applying again? Help me. I am desparate.* 

*I dont really see myself in Frontend in future but I am not averse to anything right now.*"

p9c4bh,1,2021-08-22,I’m tired of making mistakes and hating myself for it - I don’t know how to continue being an adult (F23),Claudia_Rose,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/p9c4bh/im_tired_of_making_mistakes_and_hating_myself_for/,"For starters I have Aspergers and have been on antidepressants since I was 7. I have anxiety and depression but they’re well managed (I think) for the most part. 

I’m currently in my 5th and last year of law school and on top of doing my honours thesis and classes, I also am applying for internships with top law firms. I have a good score and plenty of extra curriculars and spent hours perfecting my cover letters. Problem is I forget the date of one of the firms (my dream firm) and missed it by a day. I emailed them and asked for a late application which they accepted. Now though they sent instructions to do video interview questions within 5 days. Once again I left it a day too late. 

I hate myself so making the same mistake again and again, and for such an important job. I had networks and connections there and I’m so embarrassed that I fucked up. Problem is I know deep down I am scared of applying and put it off (like i put off my honours thesis). I keep saying I’m working hard and I have so much on my plate, but I honestly feel so lazy all the time and everything is a struggle. I feel like I’m going to be a terrible lawyer if I can’t keep organised but I’ve dedicated 5 years of my life to doing the best I can in the degree. I’m just so tired. 

I don’t know how to process failure and my instant reaction was to jam a pen tip in my wrist. I know it’s problematic but I feel like I need to punish myself for making such stupid mistakes. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. My friends aren’t applying for internships and my parents don’t understand how competitive the field is. I feel so alone and people don’t realise how hard it is to get an internship, and I’ve fucked up by not even applying. 

I’ve tried therapy before but whenever I’m there I just tell them I’m doing okay and they say they don’t need to see me. I don’t know how to bring up these topics and I struggle connecting with them enough to rant and unload to them. I just feel like a burden or dismissive. Does anyone know how I can be better or get help?"

I finished my degree in July and good a job proposition in the company I was doing my internship on. The project was something completely different than what they do.

I struggling to get in their use code base, a misture of nodejs with angular and some react. The code is awful, complex and without any kind of documentation, and the person that spent years writing the code left the company to start his own business. When I ask help, the other 2 programmers presence tell me they don't know where to find it, just to backtrack it based on the frontend. The code is huge, not very good structured and don't even get me started on mess they call database, where I have to dig into the it to try and find something that makes sense.

What do you all think I should do? This is my first job, I have a few more already lined up that started reaching to me after I finished my degree in computer engineering. I'm thinking on just quitting after this month and find another one. I don't really need the job, since Ilka start my master's in September, but would be good have some experience for after the master's..."
p9dsu9,2,2021-08-22,Annoying Karens at Work,ShakeBoth8371,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/p9dsu9/annoying_karens_at_work/,"Just wanted to vent to anyone who is willing to read.

I work with a couple Karens at my work. They make the work environment very toxic and many of us can't stand it. They won't get fired because of the union and if they do something horrible, they only get a slap on the wrist. Some people are so annoyed that they just move to a different department. We had 2 people who have been there for 7 years and couldn't take it any more. They left the job, seniority and really good shifts to move to a different career.

There is one Karen named Joan who is the old grouch that works the evening shift. The first thing she does when she starts her shift is complain. She goes straight to the manager and harps about coworkers, the workflow, machines (about everything). One time the manager asked her if she is ever happy and that shut her up for a couple days. She's made a couple interns cry because of how mean she gets. When she comes in, she looks at the worklist. If she thinks there are too many patients on the list, she says that the morning shift was lazy. I know the morning shift people, and they are not lazy. They always try to cut the worklist down before she gets there, so they don't have to listen to her complain. It's not like she does a whole bunch of work. The first 2 hours of her shift she walks around the hospital gossiping/complaining.

Next is Deb. She's so terrible that even the school she graduated from 10 years ago still remembers her and calls her a ""bad egg."" She messed up so much in school that she was the first and only 3rd year student in a 2 year medical program. She threaten to sue if they did not let her finish the program. Well Deb works with us and everyday is a nightmare. She loves to talk to our interns and gossip about everyone. She sometimes will ask them if they think so-in-so is a good worker, if they should have a job, and if they have anything to complain about they could talk to her. When people don't want to work with her, she complains that they are lazy. But in reality no one wants to be around her, so they try to avoid her. I've seen her make fun of Asian accents, be rude to patients of color, and also LGBTQ patients. A couple people point out to her that she's being racist, but she denies everything. Says ""she's not racist.""

Then there is Heather. Who has a terrible personality. When she was an intern she left a bad impression on the dept and no one wanted to hire her. But the previous manager felt sorry for her and gave her a chance. Even though she failed the drug test, they still let her work for the dept. When that manager got cancer and passed away, Heather was happy. Actually happy. This was the person who gave her a job! Her personality is so horrible, that people (for example management) are afraid of her. They let her do whatever she wants. If she wants a day off, she gets it. If she wants to leave early, she gets it. If she wants to work certain hours, she gets it. She use to work Monday-Friday, but then realized Mondays are very busy. So she told the manager she is no longer working Mondays and they agreed with her. She yelled an intern one time and someone from a different department was so concerned for the student, they went to the manager. Said Heather had no right to talk to a person that way. When management talked to her, Heather said that interns are no longer allowed at the outpatient clinic. They just agreed with her. It's amazing how she runs the show. Gets to do whatever she wants.

Next is someone I'm not sure is a Karen, but she is a snake. Her name is Manjit. This person has a reputation at another hospital for being a snake and when she moved to our hospital, a couple people told us to watch out. She always tries to play both sides. She will be nice to you, stab you in the back, and then pretend nothing happened. She is sneaky. I've seen her say terrible things about another person, then in a couple of hours she would be laughing and say kind things to the person's face. She's not a terrible person to work with. But everyone knows they have to watch their back with her. She's thrown a couple good people under the bus when it benefited her.

Well this is the end. There's a lot more, but here are the basics. Now that everything is typed out, I'm thinking I need to look for a different job."
p9f1s3,5,2021-08-22,ongoing masters degree required for internship,MLWarriorfromRussia,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/p9f1s3/ongoing_masters_degree_required_for_internship/," 

Hello everyone,

looking for a machine learning internship I often see the requirement ""ongoing Masters degree in CS or similiar subject"". Does anybody know if that is a hard requirement, meaning that it is either necessary for legal reasons, or maybe the HR computer system sorts people out, that don't meet this criterion? So that would p.e. mean that if you finished your bachelors, but have not yet signed up for a masters, you cant do the internship (irrespectable of your knowledge and skill).

Or is it more like they just expect you to have skills that a master student has?

Although the second option seems optimistic, I've seen that microsoft /google specifically say that applications will only even be considered, if you are enrolled in a masters degree and have at least one semester to go. So these 2 companies at least make it seem like a hard rule.

Thanks in advance."

p9hk76,111,2021-08-22,Burnt out after a year. Will taking a long break this early in my career ruin it?,Dry-Yogurt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p9hk76/burnt_out_after_a_year_will_taking_a_long_break/,"Just a bit of background, I'm a 25 year old guy who's having some serious burnout and depression. I got into CS because I had a knack for it, and because i grew up pretty poor and wanted to improve my situation. I landed a high paying job about a year and a half and it really hasn't resembled the field that I originally fell in love with. I have a nice house in a city I like living in, and I'm saving alot of money but I feel super empty and unfulfilled. I'm starting to realize that money doesn't mean that much to me if I feel like my job and life have no meaning. To be honest, I'm questioning whether Software Development is even the right field for me. I've also been going really hard for the last 8 years with college, work, and internships, and just feel like I need a break.

Sorry for the rant. Anyway my plan right now is to do my best at my job until I hit the 2 year mark, and then take a year off and focus on figuring out what I want from life. After that I'm hoping to look for a job that's more in line with my values and interests.

TLDR: My specific question to ya'll is this: has anyone ever felt this way before, and if so, what did you do about it? Will taking a year off significantly hurt my chances of getting a job if I decide to return to CS?"

Feeling intimidated by all the FAANG interns on LinkedIn? Stressed by the recruiting process and not sure where to get good information? The Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking is the Decal for you! 
Coding interviews often require a skill set that is not fully covered by the undergraduate CS curriculum. Rather than leave students to learn these skills on their own, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking attempts to bridge the gap between traditional computer science coursework and the industry recruiting process. With mock interviews and practice problems curated by frequency, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking provides a hands-on and practical approach to learning how to code algorithms commonly seen in software engineering interviews.

The decal will involve lectures, practice problems, mock interviews with peers, and some special speakers (JomaTech, Clément Mihailescu, and Jelani Nelson)! 
Our course staff has received offers from Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Amazon, DE Shaw, Intuit etc. and will hold office hours and be there to help you!

p9krth,1,2021-08-22,Internship/Entry Job Questions,Emperor-Valtorei,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p9krth/internshipentry_job_questions/,"Quick run down of my current life... I'm a full-time student, only recently started back at school. I've got roughly three semesters after this fall before I have my bachelor's degree.

I've done some contract work in my break from school, mostly small stuff and project based. I've done some freelance web developer stuff as well.

I wouldn't say I'm GOOD at what I do, but I can manage things. (For example, I'm really bad at class design. I know what I need big picture, and I can program a project from a UML, but I suck at designing the class that a UML is made for).

So I've got two questions essentially...

On Tuesday or Wednesday I'm about to find out if I have a job/internship on campus. It covers a wide spectrum of CS work. I'll be act as a full stack dev, a system admin, I'll do some networking and server setups, I'll do some cyber security stuff, tech support for faculty, etc.

The pay is shit, but I'm curious how good of an internship this would be if I plan on being a Software Engineer. I do plan on getting a more traditional internship in the summer, but this is what I'm currently working with. What are your thoughts on this?

My next question is about an entry level positions... With the rise of remote work due to COVID and the potential of it staying around, when i graduate, should I shoot for s higher paying dev job remotely or should I stick with a local company? (I've got State Farm, Rivian, and Cat in my area)."

p9m206,2,2021-08-22,Advice needed: Should I quit my first job?,sir_platinumJim,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p9m206/advice_needed_should_i_quit_my_first_job/,"Context:
- Graduated from University with CS degree 2 months ago. Understand the fundamentals well but am lacking in knowledge in regards to modern technologies such as Node.js, etc.
- Found a full-time SWE internship a month ago but what the company wants me to do is closer to data engineering using SSIS, SSMS, and mostly pure SQL. However, I'm more interested in web development.
- After internship, I'm more or less guaranteed to be hired as a Software Engineer I
- Talked to my seniors and they told me the company doesn't work with newer tech

Now I'm at a fork in the road. I don't enjoy what I'm currently doing so I'm thinking of quitting. Originally, I was planning to stay and then learn the newer tech on my spare time. But that'll take a long time considering an 11 hour day dedicated to work (1 hour lunch, 8 hour work, 2 hour commute). So now, my first option is to stay and learn slowly or leave and dedicate my time to completely learning the new tech stack. 

Ive torn between the options and would appreciate any advice. Thank you for being your wonderful self and thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Edit 1: I'm currently financially secure and have funds for at least one or two years."
p9mj7f,23,2021-08-22,Parents pushing me to apply for a Master's Program fresh out of college even though I don't have any research/internship experiences when I think I should build more research experience before I decide. Which approach is wiser?,mjlet,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/p9mj7f/parents_pushing_me_to_apply_for_a_masters_program/,"I am an undergraduate who recently graduated with a BS in Economic Policy Analysis and BA in Sociology and seeking to apply for a Master's degree program in Public Policy or Data Science.

I came on here to ask about my chances at being admitted to a well acknowledged graduate program when I have no research or internship experiences.

I immigrated to the U.S. at 17 and wasn't given the chance to enroll into a university straightaway because my education from my origin country was not recognized as legitimate in the U.S. education system.

I got a decent GPA at the American high school I went to that would have allowed me to be apply to some state universities, but I had to go to community college first.

I received all A's in my general education courses at community college and my parents began pushing me to get an Associate's degree in Nursing even though it didn't fit me at all. I ended up severely suffering.

However, I found out that I was eligible to transfer to a 4-year university near me because of my grades from my prerequisite courses.

I started studying Economics but was devastated at how behind I was compared to other juniors who studied and did internships/research since their freshman year.

Because I was a transfer who already completed general education courses, my only option was for all four of my classes to be higher level major related courses.

I had no time to explore other areas of studies.

I received A's in the introductory courses but lost touch when starting to take the theoretical courses and even failed one class.

The next semester I decided to use it as a turning point and registered for all higher-level sociology classes and retook the class I failed. This was the semester that I received all A's.

From the sociology classes I was able to find an answer to why I *want* to study Macro and Microeconomic Theories for *myself* and HOW the knowledge is highly, incredibly useful in the research process.

I realized that if the skills taught in sociology could be backed up by statistical skills taught in economics, it would be very powerful.

I fell head over heels in love with doing research and writing papers and started teaching myself how to use computer programs such as Python and SQL and took computer science courses offered during summer semesters even though it did not count towards my degree.

During my last semester, I overloaded my courses and took five higher-level economics classes and received all A's.

During the last year I met the most supportive and incredible professors who emailed me telling me if I ever needed a recommendation letter they would be more than happy to provide me with the needed help and guidance.

However, because of my struggles in the beginning as a transfer student, my GPA is a 3.5 and I was never accepted into internship programs because hiring staff thought I had too little experience or knowledge in the field compared to other competitors.

I am eager to be able to continue my education and be able to do more research by applying to a graduate program in Data Analysis, but I have been told that if it is not at a university that is a significant upgrade of my current university (which is in the Top 150-200 range) it would not be worth it.

I'm not confident about applying this fall and think I might have to apply two to three years later after I get some post-bachelor's research assistant/internship experience under my sleeve.

The issue is that my parents, especially my mom is eagerly telling me to apply within these next three months because she thinks that the longer I wait the lower my chances will become at being accepted to a good graduate school and that once I start working I will find it hard to transition back to being a student.

They both completed their education in a foreign country and my mom never went to graduate school so they have no idea how things work in the US system but they're relying on the internet people from back in our origin country telling them that I should just apply as quickly as possible.

I need real advice and guidance from someone who actually applied for and completed graduate programs on what the right move for me would be.

Would it be worth it for me to at least try to apply to the graduate programs I want to get in this year or if should take two to three years to build internship/research experience first?

Also, would my professors still write me a recommendation letter even after three years? Would they forget about me?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!"
p9nrzl,2,2021-08-22,(19F) My mom and relatives talked badly about me for being an undecided major in college and I felt so humiliated,Choco_pocky,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/p9nrzl/19f_my_mom_and_relatives_talked_badly_about_me/,"I went to my cousin’s wedding two days ago and apparently while we were on our way home my mom told me that my relatives asked me what I was studying in college. She told them that she doesn’t know and our relatives talked behind my back and said that I should know what to do with my life and that I’m simply just wasting my parents’ money at this point. She agreed with them and I was so upset that they were talking about that while I wasn’t there (I was hanging out with my cousins but the adults as well as my mom were in a different group at the wedding). 

I just feel so humiliated and I don’t want to see my relatives anymore but my mom will say that I’m being rude if I do that. Now besides that, I’m going into my 2nd year of college and I’m kind of leaning towards the bio major. Although, I don’t really know if I want to do anything in the medial field and I’ve already taken my prerequisites for the bio major as well as a business class last semester since I wanted to see if I liked business but I didn’t like it so I kind of sticked to bio instead. I’ve never had a part time job or an internship so I don’t really know what to do from here. I just feel like I’m wasting so much time but I honestly don’t know what to do and I feel like taking more classes to see what major I like isn’t enough since I have to declare my major by the end of sophomore year. If anyone has any advice for me just let me know! Any advice would be much appreciated :)"

I am bit worried now for 3 reasons- 

1. One of my role was Software Development intern but in my resume I wrote Software Developer.

2. I left out a company that I only worked for 2 months. Left it out from the resume, because I have another short job that was of 3 months where I was laid off and the current one is only of 7 months. (I have screwed my career)

3. The form says it will contact my current work place and all other places I have worked that they can find either in my resume or from other sources. The problem is I haven't informed my current work place about my plan to change the job, and I not even 100 sure if I will make the switch.

What do you people feel I should do? Is it possible to tell them not to contact my current employer, as I want to keep my current job in case I am flagged for point 1 and point 2?

p9og3m,7,2021-08-22,Need help on how to recover as best as I can,throwawaye1654365272,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/p9og3m/need_help_on_how_to_recover_as_best_as_i_can/,"So, I have a fear that I may get stuck in an endless loop of bad coops if I don't escape it this time. Let me explain (tech coops btw):

1st coop search: I had a **relatively** good number of interviews and even got a half-decent coop at an established company. I was satisfied with this result.

2nd coop search: Since I was satisfied with my coop search last time, I didn't bother changing the layout of my resume this time and I just updated the content. However, this time, I noticed that I got fewer interviews than a lot of people I knew (still more than my 1st coop search though but the increase was not as much as I saw others gain). In fact, after looking at other resumes, I realized that a lot of my content is also competitive with theirs. But, I think the issue is/was that my resume's format was very different from the industry standard and it may be an eyeful to read the resume. I don't really know what else it could even be... Unusually though, I actually also got a FAANG interview this time. I **completely** bombed it. I don't know if it was the nerves, but I couldn't for the life of me, remember how to manipulate a linked list properly. Ended up getting an offer at a decent startup this time and took it.

3rd coop search: I wanted my resume to be different from the industry standard so that it attracts some eyes. So, I didn't change the format again, just updated the content. This time around, I got **even fewer** interviews than my 2nd coop search. This is how I understood my resume was shit in its current state. Unusually again, I got an interview at a large-sized company and this time I actually got an offer which I happily accepted. Then COVID happened. Lost my job offer. Was too tired by the courseload to bother trying to get another one since the coop semester had technically already started. Failed this coop.

4th coop search: Resume format still unchanged, just the content updated with new coop experience and better projects. Got very few interviews again (similar to the 3rd coop search). I was also in a bad mental state at the time and so this time I just took whatever I got first. This was a big mistake in hindsight. I was an engineer intern at a startup doing something very distantly related to tech.

I'll be going into my 5th coop search next semester and I want to break out of this negative cycle that's starting to grow. I regained my mental health a few months ago and was able to get on top of my deadlines again. I've been practicing Leetcode for a few weeks now and I feel pretty confident about the technical interview. My main weakness was always the lack of coop interviews, to begin with.

To address this weakness, I changed my entire resume format to be industry-standard (think some format you can easily find, written in Latex and known as a common format). It's not going to be unique anymore but I don't think I will get lesser interviews with this format. I have a few questions about how to frame my ""Experience"" section. I haven't included the offer I got in my 3rd coop search because it was just an offer of course and was canceled due to COVID. However, I don't want the recruiter to think that I slacked off and just couldn't get a job at all in 4 months of job search. Moreover, my 4th coop is easily the least relevant out of the 3 that I actually did. I'm not sure how to include this at the very top of the ""Experience"" section without turning off the recruiter.

But my most essential question is, what other steps can I take to maximize my chances of an interview after applying, this time around? I want my resume to be at least competitive this time. I would really appreciate any advice on this."
p9ou93,8,2021-08-22,help! unsure of major,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p9ou93/help_unsure_of_major/," 

hi! i am starting my senior year in high school, and pretty soon i have to solidify my decision in what i will be majoring in in college.

here's some context: i come from a family where nearly everyone has high-paying jobs related to medical, science, or engineering. if i'm not super successful or don't make a lot of money, i'm worried i'll end up the laughing stock of my family. i know i shouldn't be worried about family opinions but, i really do not want to end up being the odd one out.

anyways...i've taken plenty of advanced STEM classes in high school and have received high grades. i could major in a STEM subject if i had to...but for some reason, it has never interested me like it has my family. i'm way more into writing, media, communication, social sciences, politics, etc

recently i've done plenty of writing or media related internships. i made the decision that i will major journalism, since it is something i excel in.

earlier today, i was looking online for insight into a journalism major. i found that it is viewed as a useless major...many say ""it isn't necessary and the skills can be obtained through other majors"" + ""you don't need to major in it to work in journalism""...and journalism in general is a ""dying field"", ""hard to get a good career in"", ""not good for a lot of money""...

this has me really worried. i have a lot of questions, and if any of you have answers for me, that would be appreciated.

is journalism really a useless major?

if so, what is a good alternative?

should i just go in the complete opposite direction and go with a STEM major like the rest of my family?

if i stick with a journalism major, how can i get a successful career path out of it?

is it a good idea to major in journalism and then go to graduate school for a different field? what graduate schools would a journalism major be good for?

and, in general, just give me your advice/opinions about this. pros, cons, other majors, etc. sorry if this is too long, i know i kind of ranted and asked too many questions... whenever i talk to my family about this they act kind of annoyed/ashamed that i'd even consider journalism, which is why i'm asking reddit. thank you!"

I'm 26 years old. I'm going to a tech school for my AA in computer networking and my AA in cyber security. I'll be starting my last semester at Tech school and I'm very excited because it's my last semester. I guess the best part about the situation is I'll be done with school in December but my graduation won't be till summer of next year. My career goal is to be a cyber pentester. Before I get shut down, I know I have to start from the very basics with help desk and tech support work. I'm willing to start from scratch and build my way up to where I want to be. I'm a smart young man who's determined to do whatever it takes to make my dreams into reality. I have a 3.8 GPA, Im a member of my schools National Technical Honors society, and Phi Thetta Kappa and I will be graduating with honors. The experience I have from tech school is I know how to do a laptop and a computer breakfix because it was part of my exam. That's the only IT experience I can possibly put on my resume. My city doesn't really have much to offer as far as entry level IT work or internships so I'm also thinking about relocating from South East Georgia. Most of the computer shops in my city claim they don't do internships or volunteer work. I'm currently working at Amazon as a DA driver and spoke with the manager at my hub about trying to get an it support job there and he said they don't really look at people unless you have a bachelor degree. I've been checking around at places like Verizon or t mobile too see what kind of entry level work that I can do. My next thought was going back or a bachelor's or get some certifications like IT fundamentals, A+, sec+, network+ and see where I can get from there. So my questions are.

1.) Should I go back for a bachelor's degree later or obtain certifications? 
2.) Would computer science or cyber security bachelor's degree be more beneficial to me if I was to go back?
3.) What cities in America, preferably the east coast are booming with the cyber industry?(I'm thinking Atlanta area because I'm only 5 hours away)


All honest helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm ready to get started and put alot of work in to get my career going."

This semester, I'll be finishing my general education credits. I feel so depressed, anxious, and stressed because I don't know what to major in. I feel like I am wasting time and money, but I feel like I need a college education to get a living in the world. 

I have spent SO MANY hours researching different majors and careers but have not made too much progress. I have bounced around everywhere. I started off in psychology, now I don't know if I should stay or switch(because I hear a lot of horror stories of people not being able to get a job with a ba in psychology, or if they do, the wage is very bad). My mind has been bouncing everywhere from thinking of majoring in biology, accounting, nursing, computer science, social work, business, even more, I probably forgot at the moment. Ill be honest, I have some sense of direction, but I feel discouraged from following it because of pay. I really want to help people (I think counseling/ mental therapy or even teaching would make me happy, but the pay is not so great from what I have been seeing). 

My goal is to figure out what I want with my life before the semester is over so that I don't waste time and money, or take classes that have nothing to do with my future. I have heard that the bachelors degree is the new diploma and that you can't do much with a ba in biology, accounting has slave hours, nursing I don't think Ill like because of working with people when they are at the low, and I don't think I have the dedication for nursing school, I've looked into computer science, but I am scared it may be too complicated for me (it does seem interesting though as it is like solving puzzles), social work and psychology work (like mental health help), I would like to pursue something like this, but I have seen that the pay is not so great. I have considered trades, but it doesn't seem interesting to me.

I really just want to get a bachelor's and get out and start making an income that I can live comfortably and sometimes splurge on my family. Being around my family and treating them is what I really want out of life. I am scared to pursue a master's as I feel like I will be losing time with my parents who are getting older and that I will not be prepared mentally and emotionally to dedicate myself to an extra 2-4 years of school or internships.

p9s5yv,24,2021-08-23,Stats Major Who Can't Study Abroad: A Sad Rant,studyabroadstatswoes,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9s5yv/stats_major_who_cant_study_abroad_a_sad_rant/,"I am a rising third year and today sadly realized the study abroad dreams I've had for years are slipping out of my reach. Just for context: I am on track to start the Stats 102 series this coming year, which I believe is quite normal. This means I can't study abroad until Winter 2023 at the earliest since I would have to take the 102 series and currently study abroad fall programs are mostly cancelled. I could take 102C over the summer, but I'm planning to get a summer internship and unfortunately getting a job and that work experience is more important than me going abroad. Also, pretty sure I couldn't afford housing/tuition costs over the summer on top of not having internship money coming in anyways. 

I was supposed to study abroad the summer after my freshman year which I believe is basically the earliest time you can go for most programs but COVID hit so that didn't happen. Of course that ended up taking up a lot of my time in college and still is, but I had been holding out hope for Winter/Spring 2023 (my last quarters as an undergraduate student... wow COVID has taken forever). But now I realize that means I can't make graduation which just isn't possible for a first-generation student like me. Also, my parents' first (and only other child) graduated in COVID... so he didn't get a normal graduation either. Yes, I'd rather celebrate mine and my parents accomplishments on that special day but it sucks that I have to sacrifice the thing that was the ""light"" at the end of the tunnel for me during COVID.  


The kicker is the program I want to do starts in March rather than January like a lot of other semester programs. My solution was maybe I could walk in Winter (still kinda don't feel great about that though honestly because of the aforementioned reasons why graduation is very important to my family) but I would have to take winter quarter off because I planned it out that I would graduate after taking Stats 102C. Not even sure I'm allowed to take a quarter off right before graduating and then not even being at UCLA because I'm shipping off to another country. I checked if going in my last quarter was even allowed since there is a residency requirement to graduate (taking a certain number of you last units at UCLA), and they said it was ok to go, but I kind of doubt they'd let me do it after I had already just taken the Winter 2023 quarter off. I would have been really sad if they said I couldn't because then literally the only time for any Class of 2023 student to study abroad would be Spring 2022 and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of those programs are cancelled due to COVID. 

I wish I could go in Fall 2022 but I need Stats 102C. I keep beating myself up because Stats 102C only has Stats 102A as a requirement and doesn't need Stats 102B but it's not offered Spring anyways so I can't take it until next Fall. I keep telling myself ""Why didn't you just take Stats 102A last year?"" But obviously I didn't know AND if I'm going to be honest I couldn't have handled it as an extra class during online learning. It just sucks because I thought I was so smart in taking the 101 series as a sophomore so I could take 140s earlier but now it's all in vain anyways. I love the Stats major. I've had great experiences with professors and the classes are so interesting. But god I want to throw up. When I was manically crying about this situation a few hours ago, I wanted to just drop the major and become a minor but obviously that's insane for me to do when I'm one class away. But god it was so tempting to think about. 

I don't know man. I just wished some rules could change and there could be some leeway because as someone in Class of 2023 I'm like there's no way this is just me? The number of people who are going abroad from our class is probably way down since we can only basically go as seniors and there's all this red tape for seniors. I literally planned this since I was a freshman and it's still falling apart. I feel like people who planned 1-2 years in advanced just cannot make it. 

I know this is first-world problems and people are probably thinking that some people were never able to afford study abroad anyways (that's actually not true, my program would cost me the same as going to UCLA so recommend underclassmen research into it) but it still makes me really sad. I don't even know if this post makes sense but thanks for reading it. And my fellow people who lost out on study abroad due to COVID wya let's cry together."

For some context: After my undergrad I plan on pursuing a master's degree abroad and don't plan to work right after my bachelor's degree (atleast full-time) so placements aren't a huge factor for me. 

From what I can tell, chandigarh university will open physical classes as soon as October while Symbi will definitely take longer. CU has a much better infrastructure than symbi and also a lot more cultural events and clubs. CU focuses more towards practical application of com. sc. in general and had better ties with companies for internships.

Though because symbiosis is considered to be the BEST college to pursue a BCA in the country. Due to that reputation alone, finding good internships wouldn't be too tough and would probably help me get into good colleges for my master's. 

Not sure where to go from here atm.
I'd love some opinions on this, thanks!"

Graduated last 2017 and I still haven't got any job. Just internships. It makes me feel more depressed that my new internship won't be absorbing me as well even if i am trying my best.

My girlfriend just told me that she still looks at her ex's social media. She told me she was still angry with her ex. And also she dreamt of someone she dated before where she was happy. It just feels sad hearing this from her. And I don't know how I should react to it?

I don't know where to start and where to go. I am lost and I think so low of myself right now that I just want to end my life here.

So I took the GRe at home around 15 days ago.
325 (165Q 160V 5.0AWA)
I've an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from a reputed Indian public/government university not an IIT but a Tier-1 university.

I've about total of 4 internship experiences :

1. Academic Learning and Project Based Learning at NUS. Related to Machine Learning and Big Data- 1 month
2. Indian Space Research Organisation - Published a paper as co-author in my time here on my work done during the internship - 3 months.
3. One of Big4 as a Technology Consulting Intern - 2 months.
4. Product Intern in a globally recognised company that's into creative software - 6 months.

I've been working full time in a software role after my internship ended at (4) so that's about 1.5 years at this organisation. By Fall 2022 (my preferred intake), I'd have about 2 years of full time and 2.5 years of cumulative experience at this company.

Apart from this I took up certain projects through online courses. Also took up a research project under my Head of Department at my undergraduate university for 6 months. Didn't convert into a publication though.

LORs -
2 Professors (one I took multiple classes with, and the other is the professor who was my guide on the research project) 
2 internship guides (one whom I co-authored the publication with at the space organisation. The other is the Sr. Manager from the 6 month internship I pursued)

GPA - 8.83 (Top 5% of university. And department rank about 10/120) 
Additionally, my GPA on my department courses are above 9. However this is not explicitly reported on the transcript.

Stellar extra curricular till high school both high in number and quality. Didn't do much in college as I was spending time with internships and online learnings. However still have a few extra curricular.
Volunteer/Welfare work - Performed in college.

Again stellar PORs until high school, not much in college.

Taken a couple of MOOCs from Rice, UPenn(Wharton), Udacity's Nanodegree Programs. 

Need advice in how to approach this?

Few questions:

1. Should I fret about GRE? 
2. I guess PORs can not be reversed now. Anyway to compensate for this?
3. Would taking more professional courses online help in anyway on the admit?

Please point anything you find good or bad about the profile."

For this reason, I have been suffering from strong impostor syndrome recently (I have always suffered from it, but more so recently). I feel I am not as good as others, and others are way better developers than me (I don't have much development experience apart from the internship, and haven't even done any good hobby projects either).

It's not in my habits to make posts like this but I need help. I'm currently studying web dev. And I was about to finish my graduation. But at the time I needed to give back thesis, I felt overwhelmed and can't finished it. I was using a stack that I didn't know well and find myself stuck with some bad logic I putted in place in my react and graphql implementation that didn't match correctly what I would like to do.

I also need to work on a Laravel project but I didn't touch it for 5 of 6 six month and I'm feeling like I forgot how everything works.

I feel overwhelmed with the techno I used and how to implement then together, how to build my graphql api, how to add JsonWebToken on it. How to verify it. And It's pretty much the same for laravel.

I constantly kinda feel that I know almost nothing unless the basics and I feel very frustrated to google any error I'm stuck on or anything I don't figure how to do directly. And when I find the solution most of the time It was quite simple and logic. But I can't take my mind the solution without google it. I feel like I can't put all the tings I know together. To achieve my needs.

So I gave up sending my thesis by September, I hope I could send It by January.   
I'm about to give up in programming. Maybe I'm not confident enough. I afraid of failure which, I know happens some time and brings good lessons but I'm too afraid to look idiot. I took 5 year to do my bachelor's degree (usually take 3) because I didn't send back my projects. They always are incomplete in the due time, because I keep changing things on them. Always finding better solutions, better UI. Or I make my life more complicated by finding too complicated solutions to simple problems.  
And now I'm adding a new 6 month to it by giving back my thesis in January. I did my internship in a startup which was a success, I passed it but I was surrounded by other developers.

Maybe It take time. I don't know. I like what I do but every time I'm alone on a project I kinda fail it by spending too much time on details. Changing stuff because I didn't think about all things I needed to consider.  I would like to have some opinion on this."

Here is the seventy-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

pa3jne,16,2021-08-23,Got my first cert!!!,purplewindflowers,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/pa3jne/got_my_first_cert/,"I officially passed security+ this morning! I swear I thought I was failing going through the test lol. I got a 767 so at least I wasn’t failing as bad as I thought. I also didn’t buy a retake so I was super nervous that I’d have to spend a lot again if I did fail. 

I am 23 and have a BS in cybersecurity that I got in may and I currently work as a security engineer in a SOC overnight. So I had a bunch of study time when it was slow. I love this career and can’t see myself doing anything else. I studied for about 2 months. 

Huge shoutout to Professor Messer’s free youtube videos and $25 practice exams. I would say those helped me the most. I also had Ian Neil’s textbook but didn’t like it because it was confusing in places. And I bought Dion’s tests only but I noticed some of the material on his test wasn’t even on the objectives list (looked like it came from cysa+?) 

Next I’m gonna get cysa+ and then pentest+. I don’t wanna be a pentester but I was an intern at a pentest company during my degree so I really think I can brush up my skills and get it here within 6 months or so. I also just want a well-rounded cert background. If you made it this far, thanks for reading lol"

This semester, I'll be finishing my general education credits. I feel so depressed, anxious, and stressed because I don't know what to major in. I feel like I am wasting time and money, but I feel like I need a college education to get a living in the world.

I have spent SO MANY hours researching different majors and careers but have not made too much progress. I have bounced around everywhere. I started off in psychology, now I don't know if I should stay or switch(because I hear a lot of horror stories of people not being able to get a job with a ba in psychology, or if they do, the wage is very bad). My mind has been bouncing everywhere from thinking of majoring in biology, accounting, nursing, computer science, social work, business, even more, I probably forgot at the moment. Ill be honest, I have some sense of direction, but I feel discouraged from following it because of pay. I really want to help people (I think counseling/ mental therapy or even teaching would make me happy, but the pay is not so great from what I have been seeing).

My goal is to figure out what I want with my life before the semester is over so that I don't waste time and money, or take classes that have nothing to do with my future. I have heard that the bachelors degree is the new diploma and that you can't do much with a ba in biology, accounting has slave hours, nursing I don't think Ill like because of working with people when they are at the low, and I don't think I have the dedication for nursing school, I've looked into computer science, but I am scared it may be too complicated for me (it does seem interesting though as it is like solving puzzles), social work and psychology work (like mental health help), I would like to pursue something like this, but I have seen that the pay is not so great. I have considered trades, but it doesn't seem interesting to me.

I really just want to get a bachelor's and get out and start making an income that I can live comfortably and sometimes splurge on my family. Being around my family and treating them is what I really want out of life. I am scared to pursue a master's as I feel like I will be losing time with my parents who are getting older and that I will not be prepared mentally and emotionally to dedicate myself to an extra 2-4 years of school or internships.

It hurts so bad, it really does. Thinking about this makes me cry. I usually get stress/panics attacks from this, like I just feel scared and want to lay in bed and avoid stuff or I feel a deep sinking in my chest. I feel so lost, I feel like a lot of people my age have it figured out. I know people say don't compare, but it is hard, I know I am supposed to move at my own pace, but it still hurts... I hate this feeling of feeling lost. I am in desperate need of advice.

Sorry if reading this wasn't that smooth. I know this post was long, and I thank you a lot for giving it your attention. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank You"

I'm really good at science subjects (biology in particular). Been thinking about medicine but so many people said that it was so hard and I kind of got worried about it. So I decided to look on Google and then managed to find compsci, love technology and I thought to myself that maybe this is the one I should pursue. What encouraged me more is the Internship movie by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.

So I went up and watched a couple of videos by uni students on what they do during their typical day of being a compsci student, one thing I noticed is the amount of mathematics involved and that's the thing that made me question this field.. I'm not the best at Maths, it's not my strongest subject although I gain enjoyment from it whenever I seem to know what I'm doing but when there are confusing topics that I can't seem to get a grip of I just find a hard time loving Maths as a subject.


So my question, is Maths that hard in compsci? Should I allow it to be the reason why I'm not going to pursue this field?"

Trying to keep this as short as possible. I've applied for software engineering degree apprenticeship/trainee roles and received offers at the BBC, Ford and Visa. These are all 4 year schemes that allow you to study a degree with a university at the same time, a relatively new initiative in the UK (BBC would be with University of Glasgow on computer science, the other two with more unrecognised providers, under a more general digital and technology solutions qual  - would still include software engineering).  


My ultimate aim is to get good at both frontend and backend - I have experience of both in a previous internship, where I worked with a Java backend and a React frontend. I'm also interested in developing knowledge of app development, e.g. iOS and Android, and React Native - I like designing something that can be interacted with by a user. However, I also enjoy backend development as well - I definitely don't dislike it, I just find it more challenging. I know that with Visa it would be mostly backend. With Ford, I may be able to do more iOS/Android app development or frontend work, as well as potentially backend. At the BBC it could be either, I'm yet to learn which team I would go into first.   


I'm very pressured to decide soon of course as they all start very soon. I'm very conflicted as they all seem good, I had good experiences at all the interviews, they seem to want to invest in young talent etc. I think the main pull of the BBC is that they are known to be good at training newcomers, they are also providing a computer science degree with a recognised university (though I know this isn't always essential in the current market). I'm also worried that I might be spending too much time in the university, not enough in practical learning. With Visa, it would be mostly backend but an interesting problem to solve, and experience with a language like Go, which would be really interesting. Also with Ford, they're going through an interesting stage as a company in terms of connected vehicles, working on mobility innovations etc. I think in general they are all good, which is what makes this decision extremely hard for me.

I started in the JavaScript ecosystem and have stayed there the entire time, moving from junior roles to team lead roles. Obviously as a code school grad, this focused experience is not unusual these days when compared to CS grad journeys.

But now I'm noticing how insular my experience has been, focusing on full-stack JS development over the years. It's basically a repetitive experience, but the thought of expanding outside of JS frontend/backend + AWS/Microsoft cloud dev work seems nearly as daunting as starting to learn to code in the first place and getting a job that way.

Was there a time later in your career you started doing something totally new, out of your comfort zone, and what was that challenge like? Did you go from ""I have to do this for a job to make money"" to ""I much prefer this experience even though I'm new""?

I could use a pep talk and inspiration lol - thank you!"

1. School works (Office etc.)
2. Machine Learning/Data Analysis/Programming \*BEGINNER, NEED THIS FOR MY FALL INTERNSHIP
3. SolidWorks with large assemblies/Simulation/Possible CFD
4. Very last priority would be gaming. I play DOTA 2, Forza Horizon 4 and Kerbal Space Program only. Microsoft Flight Simulator would be a plus, not required!

Currently, these are my build list that is in stock both locally and online. If you can suggest or would like to replace a part, just let me know. Ideal cost for me would be $1500 CAD including GPU. Max would be $2000 CAD.

**BUILD LIST #1: $1600CAD to $2000CAD**

* **CPU:** Ryzen 5 5600X
* **COOLER:** Corsair Hydro Series H100x 240mm AIO
* **MOBO:** MSI B550 Gaming Plus
* **GPU:** Either used 1070 for $350 CAD or used 3060 for $700 CAD
* **RAM:** G. Skill Ripjaws V Series 3600Mhz CL16 DDR4 16GB
* **STORAGE:** WD Blue SN550 M.2 PCI-E NVME SSD 500GB
* **PSU:** Corsair RMx 650W 80+ Gold Fully Modular PSU
* **CASE:** NZXT H510 Case

**BUILD LIST #1: $1150 CAD**

* **CPU:** Ryzen 5 5600G
* **COOLER:** Corsair Hydro Series H100x 240mm AIO
* **MOBO:** MSI B550 Gaming Plus
* **GPU:** Use iGPU and wait for GPU prices to go down
* **RAM:** G. Skill Ripjaws V Series 3600Mhz CL16 DDR4 16GB
* **STORAGE:** WD Blue SN550 M.2 PCI-E NVME SSD 500GB
* **PSU:** Corsair RMx 650W 80+ Gold Fully Modular PSU
* **CASE:** NZXT H510 Case

**BUILD LIST #2: $1050 CAD**

* **CPU:** Intel i5-11400 w iGPU
* **COOLER:** Corsair Hydro Series H100x 240mm AIO
* **MOBO:** Gigabyte B560m AORUS PRO AX w/ WiFi
* **GPU:** Use iGPU and wait for GPU prices to go down

* **STORAGE:** WD Blue SN550 M.2 PCI-E NVME SSD 500GB
* **PSU:** Corsair RMx 650W 80+ Gold Fully Modular PSU
* **CASE:** NZXT H510 Case

I think I can wait for GPU prices to go down as long as I can do the listed purposes including playing DOTA 2, FH4 and Kerbal Space Program.  Would like 60+ FPS as much as possible on okay settings. If going with iGPU, which one would be better between 5600G and 11400? Cheers!

Some background: 

I've been working full time through my undergrad which is in Information Technology. I started working in IT about three years ago in a helpdesk role before moving into a level 2 support role. Then I got a few certifications related to security and networking and moved into system administration. Then I got a cloud certification and just started a role as a Site Reliability Engineer (part software engineer, part cloud engineer) two months ago. 

I switched schools after starting at a community college, and am now in my senior year at a T50 University (in the US). Currently at a 3.5 gpa, and hoping to finish at around a 3.6. No internships as I've been working in the field full time.

Studying for the GRE, and hope to get around a 320.

My Post MBA goal (immediately) is to pivot into a technical product management role hopefully focusing in cloud computing. Eventually I want to move into more of a director role. 

Does it make sense for me to apply to B schools for the 2022 year? I was thinking some of the lower T15/20 schools like Johnson, Ross, Darden, Tepper, if I can get a decent GRE score.

Any advice or suggestions would be very much appreciated.

pa7y9v,27,2021-08-23,Is working at a startup suppose to be this hard?,Sovietmexican,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pa7y9v/is_working_at_a_startup_suppose_to_be_this_hard/,"Hello all, I recently got my first job out of university as a software engineer at a startup nearby(that was the title of the job and they only wanted to know if I knew years of Linux and Java), and I hate it, I love computer science, and enjoy coding, but a few things about this location have made working in CS difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

**First**, I was misinformed about the role, I had mentioned my special skills in languages for Database, Linux OS and C during the interview and they thought I would be a perfect fit, and on my first day they told me I would be doing a lot of network administration that I have very little experience in, and the first few weeks have been trying to teach myself the subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Second** the management there is scary, the Owner and the lead engineer have severely raised their voice almost to the point of yelling and berede some of the engineers, one of them held a meeting just to talk about a mistake that one of the engineers made. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Third**, they are insanely disorganized, there is no commination, except for passive aggressive emails about something not being done right, and the higher ups don't like helping when someone has a question, I have made friends with the newer engineers, but they are shy as well so almost no one is communicates in the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally** the real nail in the coffin is that I have yet to complete a project there in the weeks I have been there, mainly because I don't know the software that they are using and I have to learn it all on my own, and every couple weeks I get changed onto another project randomly before I could finish what I was working on and have no one to really help me understand the assignment(which is more on me, but again I got hired with minimal experience in networking) or explain it well. Should I just start looking for another job, the pay is decent for me since I never got an internship and it was insanely hard to find a job in the area I live for CS, the job I got was 45 minutes away and was the only one I could find. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: Should I leave my job that I don't feel like I have enough experience in, and the work environment is slightly toxic, when it's hard to find a job in the area I live in?"
pa7z3u,0,2021-08-23,I got a job and so can you!,Flooding_Puddle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pa7z3u/i_got_a_job_and_so_can_you/,"These types of posts kept me going when I was down in my job search so I wanted to make one and try to give some advice, hopefully it will keep some people going.

I'm a career switcher, got a non engineering BS then went back and got an AAS in CS, and studied back end and front end. My school was very project oriented so luckily by the time I graduated I had some great projects to show on my resume. I worked full time in a non CS related job while I went to school and didn't have any internships or related experience.

I applied for probably around 500 jobs although I used the shotgun method and at first was pretty inefficient with applications. I mostly only applied for local positions and a few areas I was willing to move to, and didn't bother with FAANG or other prestigious companies. I probably had around 30 total interviews, with several final interviews where I was told they found someone with more experience. 


Some tips I can give:
1. Apply for anything you're qualified for, I ended up getting   a remote swe job with solid pay in a pretty low CoL area by applying for an internship and they liked me so much they considered me for a full time position.


2. Don't just grind leetcode(depending on where you're applying) I didn't get a single leetcode question even though I had plenty of coding assessments. Most of them were assessments that the company had prepared. A few of the ""technical interviews"" I had were just trivia, mostly for Java developer roles. I didn't solve a single leetcode question, I did work through some of CtCI though so that I knew how to go about solving the simpler leetcode type questions and could at least talk about and describe data structures. 


3. Keep a notebook/word doc of your interviews. If you get a question that stumps you or you aren't able to think of a great answer, write it down and look up the answer or prepare a good one if it's behavioral.  I was able to nail every technical question I was asked for the job I got because I had kept track of all the common questions I had gotten, and had answers prepared for every behavioral question.


4. People say it a lot but it sometimes gets lost in the leetcode grind: projects are huge. Every hit my resume got I was told they loved my projects.


5. Don't be afraid to apply locally, to non remote positions, to contract work, and to companies that aren't prestigious. You just need to get your foot in the door and get some experience, every future job search will be a lot easier once you have a few years of experience (or so I've read).



Hopefully this helps anyone struggling to find a job. Feel free to DM me as well, I'll give any advice I can or even just listen to you vent."

Beyond that I'd like to get something like the cloud security(CCSK is it called?) cert and go from there.

Problem is I've read a ton of different angles on how to approach the A/N+ tests and it's all really overwhelming. I don't know where to start, and since it's a paid test I am very nervous about screwing it up and being out $200 or so dollars each iirc. My intention is to move past helpdesk level and into either sysadmin or data center, but with the pandemic I'm really not comfortable with anything on-site. I have some college experience but the one I went to had a very poor program and it got shut down, and it's a small town so that was it for onsite learning / few if any opportunities for interning too since there's practically no tech companies here either. (The two I did intern at both closed awhile ago pre-COVID) 

Feels like I'm spinning my wheels and also intending to move, but without anything to show for it on my resume I'd just be back in an entry position and don't want that. Need some concrete direction, don't have a network to rely on currently."

It also doesn’t help that 70% of the jobs I find are for senior positions, even when i’m filtering for entry level.

What do you suggest I do to make my self more attractive to potential employers?

Should I abandon what I learned in school and pursue web development? Should I put off finding a job and go to grad school instead? (something I really don’t want to do) Should I go get an entirely different degree? (Not being serious with this one)

I was not that into computer science for the first two years and didn't get a strong resume background in terms of internship experience.

I think I got two options here: I'll grind more leetcodes and see if I can find an internship even it's a small-medium company and hopefully I'll get the chance to get into big techs for New Grad positions. Second option is going for masters. I can either internally easily get into my current school's master program or try getting into big names like stanford.. but the concern is that whether it's really worth the opportunity cost and whether stanford helps in landing a job..?

I’ve started doing leetcode this month too and I’ve already done some Codewars before that but it seems leetcode is the most important for interviews.

I’m a “junior” but I’m more like a freshman because I already have a bachelor’s in accounting and going back for bachelor’s in computer science only takes me like 2.5 years to finish if I get an internship next summer. I’ve finished the general education from my first bachelors degree accounting so I only have to focus on the required computer, science, and math classes.

Rising junior here who just changed my major to CS with very few upper div courses and little research experience. Those are where my concern comes from.

I did an internship in a research position in the finance industry (a little bit of math/stat related) this summer and met a few people who have been or are PhD students. I didn't quite like the industry but enjoyed my research time (tho far from an academic research) and leaned toward pursuing a PhD degree. 

However, since I have only taken upper divs that are not so relevant to the research field I intend (optimization/decentralization and security), nor any  previous research experiences, I'm really afraid that I'm not qualified and I don't even know what I should present to the professors when I approach them.

To be honest, I feel being determined to do a PhD degree without serious research experience is like ridiculously naive. But it is my penultimate year and the time left for me to try is very little. Hence I'm not sure whether I stand a chance for a good PhD program and whether I should still aim for it.

I might be a bit unorganized in stating my questions so I'm going to rephrase them here. Is it possible to get a research opportunity in possibly relevant field in my junior year and how should I set about doing it? Also do I still have chance for top PhD programs in stat/cs?

pabxgv,1,2021-08-23,Epilepsy and Engineering,alkeemi,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/pabxgv/epilepsy_and_engineering/,"Hi everyone, I have a bit of a dilemma in regards to getting a job as an engineer. Three years ago (May 2019) I graduated college with a bachelors in electrical engineering. Within three months upon graduating college I started having seizures. Now I've had epilepsy ever since I was 12 years old, but my seizures were under control after taking anti-epileptic medication at the age of 14. I eventually had to have brain surgery back in March of this year since they discovered a brain tumor. After it was removed I haven't had a seizure but I am constantly getting seizure auras (the feeling of a seizure before it happens) but a seizure never comes. I've been trying to find a job that I can do from home but haven't had any luck. There was one job that would've given me a job but said that my internet was too slow (it needed to be around 100 Mbps but my internet maxes at 30 Mbps. I decided to give up on that and just go straight to applying for engineering jobs. 

Now finding an engineering job has been insanely difficult for me. For one, I have huge gaps in employment due to epilepsy. The longest job I've ever kept was for only four months as a lab aide. That job was over a year ago. Whenever I have a job interview, one of the first questions that always comes up is why I have so many long gaps in employment and I do not feel comfortable explaining it to them. Another major problem is that many of the jobs that I've applied to require me to travel to some extent. For me that's completely out of the question for me. Occasionally they want me flying to another state, but most of the time the jobs I've been interviewed at only want me to drive to another job site. I also don't have any internships and my grades were pretty low back in college. When I apply for references, I don't have many to offer. In every job I applied to I worked for a very short period of time and didn't have time to make connections or get any references. The managers I worked with barely even knew me. 

It's all been so difficult, frustrating and disheartening but by no means am I giving up on finding an engineering job. I put myself through 5 years of hell to graduate with an engineering degree. Now the main question I want to ask you guys is what field of engineering do you think would be good for me considering my medical condition? I've been eyeing software engineering since that seems like a job that requires no travel. My only problem is that I don't know how to code very well. I'm trying to change that. I've been trying learn C with the K&amp;R textbook (I know it's not the best language for beginners but I'm very familiar with the syntax since all my programming classes in college used it). Another field I've looking into is IT (maybe network engineering if that doesn't require driving). But I just need suggestions on what would be a good job for someone that cannot drive. Also what should I do regarding the gaps in my employment whenever it comes up in a job interview? Lastly if there are any jobs that make good use of an engineering degree without needing to drive I would consider that too."

I know that's it's not easy to seek for an internship(so far I want to be a software dev)and it may be more challenging if I want get 1 just after the 1st year but so far I want to set it as a goal for me. These are some of me question on it:
1. For seniors who have gone through CS-related internship  interviews, do you find your CCAs give more chances to get a spot? If so, what is the extent? (like I'm quite introverted and rarely do CCAs but I spend that time on the GPA, tests in school and practice on leetcode (I hearsay it helps for the technical interview))
2. I'm currently taking CS1101S, MA2001, MA1521,CS1231S and CFG1002. Is there any recommended modules for me to take in sem 2(so far I just know that I would take CS2040 or it could be pre-allocated)
3. There's quite controversial that it dont require so much CS theoretical knowledge to do well at work(I mean not something that is so academic), should I spend less time for the GPA(although i know it still need to be quite decent) to self-learn and build my own project( but lol i still dont know what to do so far)? What would be a minimal GPA to be maintained or the internship chance is most dependant on GPA?
Sorry if I sound so delusional but like what I said, even if I cant get internship after Y1, it's also a great goal to pursue i think. Any advice, experience sharing would be appreciated. Tyyy"

Little about me. 2 YOE full time, couple of internships. Last 3 years (fulltime + 1 year internship), have been exclusively using C++,C,Python,Bash. The applications have been in embedded systems, operating systems, compilers. Current full time work is in compilers.

Contemplating a few offers right now. They all pay more than my current job. However, I'm worried about changing tech stack(s) since some of my current offers are completely different to what I do right now.

Some of my recent offers:

1. Big Data
2. C#. NET / Azure integration / ML/AI / React
3. GPU Programming (I'll be honest this isn't entirely new to me)
4. Another compiler job

Is it career suicide if I switch tech stacks? Let's say I switch and don't like it (either the work or team), how easy is it to transition back? Will future companies only look at my most recent experience? Let's say it goes well. Do I now have two different avenues to apply to the next jobs?

Any feedback is welcome. I'm pretty early on in my career, so if anyone has any stories / feedback about why is it good or bad, please let me know!"

I loved it so much so that I attempted to transfer to a school in California and just never go back home.

Well I got into that school and was set on going until 3 days before I supposed to leave, when I rescinded my commitment due to finances. So now I’m going back to my home school feeling pretty depressed and worried at my own academic, social, and mental well-being since I’m going back to a place that brought me a lot of unhappiness rip.

Literally the only thing I’m actually looking forward to is my upper division EE classes, FSAE, internship hunting, and maybe research if I can land a good lab.

While I don’t mind the grind (I choose engineering for a reason), I feel like I might loose myself mentally because of the downgrade from the lifestyle I was having in Cal. As well as the mental health resources I was able to get because of my job. (regularly psych appointments, weekly therapy, etc.)

Furthermore, my social life is also taking a large hit from my life Cal. Whereas I pretty much went on weekend trips with my friends every week in Cal, my only real friends at home don’t really go out on weekends. Meeting new people is hard at my school because pretty much everyone makes their friends freshman year.

I think I few things I could do to help myself mentally is going to gym, learn to cook dinners, prioritize my mental health treatments, and attempt at dating (but not try to hard). But besides that, I would love to know other “self-care” tips while I finish my last two years of “the best years of my life”. 🙄 

TLDR; Tips on surviving engineering school so I don’t constantly mentally break down due to FOMO."

How often do other undergrads and full-time SWEs look for new opportunities? Do you only look when you're specifically trying to get a new job? Or is it like ""Oh look, this well-known/good company is looking for someone with my skill set, maybe I'll throw them an application.""

Or do you only respond when recruiters directly reach out on LinkedIn? Just trying to get a feel of how balanced I'm keeping my job search, as sometimes it feels like I'm overdoing it sending out application after application. All insight is appreciated."

I hope you people like it, I have more but wasn't really sure where to cut the first episode.

\------------------------------------------------------------

It had been 50 years since “the occupation” but he was born way after it happened.

From what he could read, humanity was better now than it had been by itself. Climate change, wars, poverty, racism, religious conflicts, discrimination.. all that were things he read in history books.

The Empire was formed by a myriad of races and humanity was one of them.

His studies had been outside Earth from a small age, the human concept of family was something they would study about just in case on wanted to be a colonist, but he always knew he wanted to be an explorer. It was not forbidden and some humans would do video conferences with their families and even spend their vacation time in their homes but he was really not that interested, he preferred to spend his free time in the library learning about all the different races and places and stuff.

That was possible because the Empire didn’t suppress previous history and knowledge, all information pre-Empire was available for everyone to read so they could see how much humanity had improved.

But there was also available the history of all races part of the Empire and, for historians and everyone with a bit of intelligence, the consensus was that the Empire was a good thing.

But amongst all races of the Empire humanity was in a class of their own. There were more bipeds carbon-based, but few were omnivorous. There were more species whose cradle was a death-world, but few were death-worlds as dangerous as Earth and of those few, none were carbon-based or omnivorous. And above all, none of those species born from death-worlds had the artistic capabilities of humans, which was something that intrigued the Empire from the beginning, and one of the reasons they decided to conquer us.

After his mandatory studies he did his internship on the Exxavian, a scientific ship dedicated to analyze newfound systems. They would analyze the composition of planets and evaluate their capability to contain one of the Empire races, to be terraformed or to just extract minerals.

During his two years internship they didn’t find any new species but they did find some ruins of previous civilizations in some devastated planets, he remembered thinking “if the Empire would have found them sooner, they could’ve saved them”.

So, now, at 24 years old, he was officially an explorer full grade, and a new ship was waiting for him in the Starport of his choice and he had chosen the one near Barcelona, he was born by the Mediterranean after all.

The Exxavian had docked in the Sol system station, a huge base capable of hosting 4 million beings and 200 ships located in the L4 Lagrange point, and he had said his goodbyes and best wishes to everyone who worked with him. He had learned a lot but never really mingled, his was a lonely soul.

Now, in the Shuttle on his way to Earth, he was preparing for his first solo mission.

He was reading all the communications from the explorer guild, he would have the ship and everything he needed for free provided that he kept accomplishing the guild quotas, which wasn’t really difficult to be honest.

Since he had marked his preference for a solo mission his ship was a small Kirkugger class, a vessel 30m long with a lot of automated systems and self-replicating bots. The funny thing about the Kirkuggers though was that they were half organic, so things like lights and food would grow automatically by themselves. The bots were capable of healing everything but the core, and the core was so protected that it would be safe even if impacted by a Supernova, the ship shields were that good.

While reading the guild communications there was one flagged as ‘very important’, it was his assigned psychologist.

He clicked on it and it was a video, a reptilian face, yellow eyes on a green patched body with scales that seemed like a crown on top of his head, appeared on it.

*""I’m Dr. Vann’hra, first congratulations on becoming a full fledged explorer, I can see on your report cards that it’s been kind of easy for you, you humans never cease to surprise me. I can see you’ve opted for a solo mission and been assigned a Kirkugger, that’s fine and all but I won’t have you really going solo. You will have a pet, this is not optional and it will help you on the ship.*

*""Attached to this message you’ll find a ticket you can exchange at a shop on the Starport, they already have one I personally selected for you. Despite being quite young it has been modified a bit so you don’t have to train it, it will know what to do and how to do it, we wouldn’t want an Empire ship dirty with animal feces and urine would we.*

*""I wish you good luck and remind you about the mandatory contact with me once every six months for the first 3 years of your mission. Please answer once you’ve accommodated on the ship.*

That was weird, he hadn’t been informed of that, but the psychologists had this kind of power, the Empire worked because everyone was behaving according to Empire regulations after all.

He read a bit more messages, about supplies, the systems he had to go to first, and more detailed information regarding the Kirkugger.

When the shuttle started descending to the planet he received a message from his family, they have kept in contact and talked a bit throughout the years, they had been informed about his visit to Earth and wanted to have dinner with him before leaving and left an address; he confirmed the visit, why not? It could be fun and wouldn’t hurt to have some personal contact before his solo mission.

The first thing he felt when he was leaving the shuttle was the smell of the Mediterranean, something struck him and he got goosebumps all over his body and, somehow, he couldn’t even walk while a few tears descended from his eyes. Did he miss it that much? He had only spent his first five years of life before being sent to the intergalactic school but that salted wind was bringing back some memories.

He pushed back the melancholy, smiled to himself, with some time in his hands he decided to go check his assigned vessel.

He left the shuttle hub, ignoring the buzzing activity around him, walked straight to the information cabin where he could see 5 humans and 3 beings from other species, a reptilian like his psychologist - those were the Ravnars - a purple gas being inside a cylindrical tube - probably Yuren, but he always mixed the gas beings - and a sand colored insectoid towering among all others, one of the Grhjujiik. Almost all were attending someone else so he approached one of the available humans, a young blonde girl with green-blue eyes.

*""Hi, I’m citizen XEA-6889475861, I have been assigned a ship""* \- he said in galactic showing his ID card

The girl scanned the card and looked at her screen.

*""Pleased to meet you mr. Jordi Roig""* \- she said with a really accented galactic, giving the ls a totally different sound from what he was used to - *""your assigned vessel is on dock G-25, please put your hand on the terminal so we can finish the registration.""*

A terminal emerged from the table in front of him and he did as requested, the terminal had a gelatinous substance and he felt a tickle on his palm. After a few seconds a green led blinked and he removed the hand, which was completely dry much to his surprise.

*""Thank you!""* \- she said with a smile - *""enjoy your ship and congratulations. Always happy to see a new explorer.""*

*""Thanks""* \- he said nervously, he really wasn’t used to this type of interaction.

He located the dock quite easily, one thing the Empire had was order and once you’ve been in one Starport you could find yourself in any other.

He arrived at the dock marked G-25 and passed his ID in front of a terminal by the door, the door opened and there it was, the ship held by two clamping dock legs held in the middle of a spacious hangar.

The first thought that came to him was that the ship was beautiful.

Looking at it from the side the ship looked like a long silver needle with a mushroom growing at the back. Two lines of green lime color went from the mushroom thing to the center of the ship.

He walked to see it from the front and it looked like a manta ray head, without flippers.

He circled it just trying to get the size of it all while thinking “my ship, my own ship”, there was no way he could suppress that smile.

He approached the door and something like a huge eye appeared on top of it, looked at him and disappeared from view, the door opened and a ramp appeared.

He entered the ship feeling really nervous. The moment he stepped in a warm orange light illuminated the entrance and a robotic neutral voice sounded through the comm system.

*""Welcome to your own Kirkugger. Would you prefer I refer to your galactic ID or to your designated name?""*

He continued walking and exploring the ship, spacious rounded corridors that were being illuminated with that same light the moment he stepped in.

*""My name is fine, thanks ship.""*

*""Acknowledged mr. Jordi Roig. Please remember you have to finish this ship customization before first lift off. The mandatory customization items are ship’s name, AI voice and behavior, internal colors, and leisure database. And please keep in mind this ship has limited space for the leisure database, the limit is 10 peta-bytes.""*

*""Mmmmh, I think I know what to choose about AI and behavior, do you know those old human superhero films ‘the Avengers’? Friday rings a bell?""*

*""Researching""*

And about 30 seconds later the ship spoke to him in a familiar feminine voice.

*""Research finished. Hi Boss.""*

The smile he had been wearing since he entered the ship was now a huge grin.

*""This is awesome, you are awesome, this is going to be FUN!""*

He continued walking towards the front of the ship and saw there were a few rooms already prepared and furnished like a huge bathroom, the kitchen, and such.

*""I’ve been informed that there will be a pet joining us""* \- the ship said - *""and the necessary equipment has been ordered, it should be delivered and installed soon. Also, I’ve organized the rooms in a way that I thought you would like from the data that I received but feel free to make any modifications, all interior walls can be moved or removed if necessary.""*

He stood in front of a large room with a king size bed in it, over the bed he could see a window that was as long as the wall with the shutters closed. There was a huge wardrobe on one of the walls, when he opened he saw all kinds of clothes already there, he had no doubt everything was tailor suited.

Left the room and continued walking towards the bridge, there was also a gym and a leisure room with a sofa, a big screen and a billiard table.

He continued walking and finally arrived at the bridge, which was basically a seat and some screen panels all around it. It was the smallest room on the ship but he wasn’t going to spend much time on it, apart from the jumps and some system navigation he would be somewhere else.

He sat on the only chair at the bridge and began thinking about names. He was sent young to the academy but his parents always spoke in catalan between them and that was something that stuck, he even took some classes to be able to speak it properly.

*""Friday, can you check if the name Espurna is available?""*

*""Espurna is not currently assigned to any Empire ships, I’ve checked with the register and you can use it.""*

*""Please set the name of the ship to Espurna then.""*

*""Done! Before continuing I need to remind you about your pending call with Dr. Vann’hra and that you still haven’t collected your assigned pet.""*

*""Oh right!""* \- He looked at the bridge and sighed - *""I suppose I should go before it gets late.""*

He left his ship and exited the hangar. He was told the pet shop was in the Starport so he checked his datapad to find the location and after a few minutes he was standing in front of it.

He could see shelves filled with different foods, toys and a counter with a massive and slender Grhjujiik, their six hands busy. He approached and noticed a sweet scent emanating from them.

*""Hi, I have an assigned pet?""* \- he said while showing his ID

The six hands stopped and the eight eyes, spider like, looked at him and the ID. One of the hands grabbed the scanner and passed it in front, he thought they were frowning somehow.

*""Ah!""* \- A soft voice with a melodic timbre came between those mandibles - *""Yes, yes, the mackerel tabby trained for a Kirkugger, right?""*

Somehow he thought they were smiling, he hadn't had much interaction with the species but the voice surely sounded like it.

*""And the report said it is your first pet, right?""* \- they continued - *""Don’t worry, this cat has been genetically trained to do things properly the only question is how well will you adapt to her""*

Again their voice sounded like they were having fun. A cat, he never had any pet but he had watched some cat videos, who hadn’t?

*""Be right back!""* \- they said disappearing through a door.

After a couple minutes they came back with a straw basket, inside he could see a pink blanket and over it, a small ball of fur with ocher and black stripes that ran perpendicular to her spine and lined her legs, she was sleeping in a fetal position hugging her tail.

*""She was tired after the treatment, poor thing""* \- the Grhjujiik continued - *""it is important for her to get used to your smell, please keep her close to you the next 24h.""*

They passed him the basket and he hugged it, keeping it close to his chest.

""Like this?""

*""Yeah that’s perfect! I believe all her things have already been sent to your ship, do not hesitate to contact us if you need anything else.""* \- they said waving him goodbye.

He started walking towards his ship looking at the small thing that was going to accompany him in his travels.

*""Well, that’s you and me now""* \- he said with a soft voice - *""but what do I name you?""*

I think I've posted on this subreddit before, but I just wanted to ask for more advice. 
How crucial would you say a data analysis internship would be to begin a career in data analysis? I keep seeing more data analytics roles than internships on job sites and I'm wondering if those in this field tend to take up an internship or go into a full time role after college. I have backgrounds in python, R, and SQL, using them to organize different datasets and posting them in Tableau. I keep applying to intern roles, but I'm wondering if I should just try to build experience in one full time role and move to another later on. Is this the right approach? What would you suggest?"

First of all, sorry for asking yet another ""what are my chances of migrating to SG"" type of question. I tried looking for a situation similar to mine, but couldn't find any posts on this subreddit (if there are and I just missed them, please post them in the comments :) )

Due to some personal reasons, I have decided that I would like to move to Singapore once I'll be done with my Master's studies (around February next year). 

To give y'all some background, I am 24 from Europe and I have a BEng in Computer Science and I'm currently following an MSc in Geo-Informatics. I sadly don't have a lot of working experience, only a few short-term internships as a software developer. 

From my own research, finding a job (in general) in SG as a foreigner is a difficult task, especially if you don't have much experience in a certain field. However, I would still like to ask:

\- Given my study field (Comp Sci and/or Geo-Informatics), are there more opportunities available (in comparison with other domains) in Singapore for foreigners? Another version of this question would be: what are my chances of finding a job/internship in Singapore given my background? 

\- What are some things which I can do in order to improve my chances? Any advice is welcomed :) 

\- How should I proceed with the job hunting process in the next few months in order to maximize my chances? Is sending my Resume to job offers that I find on Linkedin/Indeed enough, or are there other platforms/ways I could check out?

Thank you! \^\^"

I did my master in the polytechnic school of Lausanne, Switzerland. I did it in Bioengineering (because it seemed nice and I didn't know what to do really) and I enjoyed it. However, I didn't found any job during the year following my graduation. I applied for many places and worked a lot about my applications but... nothing. Only some meaningless interviews.

At some point, I received a proposition for an 6-months internship in software development, and since I enjoyed the courses I had on programming, I accepted.

Fast forward, I've got one job which lasted 1.5 months (because the boss bypassed the agile methodology and thought if would be a good idea to give me direct tasks. Turned out these were harder than what he expected (and I got my teamates confirming that), and he ended up firing me because he thought I wasn't good enough).

Next, I had a short 2-weeks mission where I ported a software from java 1.5 to 15, successfully, but they didn't have the budget to hire me permanently.

After that, I had another job in a payment device company. I thought everything was nice as I resolved the bugs assigned to me and implemented the features asked to me. However, I still got fired after 3 months because ""we appreciated you and you work well but we realized we need someone with a more complete background on computer sciences"" (it was a low-level embedded software development job, in C).

Aaaand, I'm still looking right now. My applications are not successful even for internship and I feel that the fact I don't have a CS degree is slowing me down for everything. I'ts been more than 2 years since my graduation and I technically don't have a single year of experience and I'm kind of desperate and feel I made a wrong choice somewhere.

... Oh, and I'm 30, I need money for my family and I feel like I'm a fraud and quite ashamed to being unable to live by my own. Everyone around me seem to have much less difficulties finding a job and I don't get what I'm doing wrong. I wonder if I made the right choice coming to this field. I feel like I missed my chance also to find a job in my degree's field even if I wanted to, and I'm quite lost about my situation and my choices...

I really think I need some advices.

And yeah, I should probably see a psychologist."

The past year, I got admitted into a summer Program (January), yet It got canceled 1 month prior to the start date (June). It was devastating for me. But I also have to admit, I should've had backup plans since the internship was mandatory for a passing grade. I was scared that I'll fail my year and I got depressed for a month. 

Thankfully, I ended up finding an internship locally at the start of July. Yet, the only positive outcome is the name of the company on my resume. I kept on comparing my work to my classmates and I can't help but feel like I am left behind since my work at the internship was so passive and I learned nothing (soft nor hard skills). 

This leads up to today, September I'll be back at university and I am already thinking about filling my free time with extra courses (edx, Coursera...) in order to catch up to my classmates, and also feeling overwhelmed by the need to apply to final year projects internships and entry level jobs. 

The year hasn't started yet and I'm feeling totally stressed about the idea of having too many things to keep on track. I am also an over-planner and I end up not sticking to it and feeling like shit afterward, I am setting unrealistic milestones even though I know that everyone moves at their own pace and that progress doesn't happen in one night.

The fact that I am self-aware of things that I have to do and don't makes me at times unforgiving towards myself.

However through an Intern's program I was able to get an internship of  3 months with a company that works with SalesForce and now  I have to create a Light Web Component where we use Apex, SOQL and JS with an OOP model. On the beginning with tutorials and internet I was able to build a part of this component, however I has been a few days already and I am STUCK, I talked with an experienced person of my team for help, he game some suggestions but after talking with him I realised I am still lost, his advice was to technical for me and I was ashamed to show my so little experience... so idk I think code is not for me, I am worried cause I feel my internship depends of this and I am ruining it already, I feel I can't code I've reached a point where idk how to begin anymore... cause all of it seems so new... Idk how to talk with my superior about it either, cause  what can I say? ""idk what to do, I suck at it"". I feel that I should quit already, but then idk what to do I've invested almost a year on this. Before coding I was working as cleaning lady and then moved to retail, because my Bachelor Degree is not worth in the country where I live now. So idk I feel  there's nothing else for me here, I suck at coding so maybe I should go back to my previous jobs."

Problem is, I'm graduating after winter quarter so if I do get an internship, it would probably start after I graduate.

Has anyone done an internship after they graduated? Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

P.S Advice to those who are Cogs Design majors, start working on your portfolio and work to put in it ASAP! I switched to Cogs Design in the middle of my studies and no one told me to make a portfolio (maybe its common sense but I was brand new to the major and never heard anything about it until later)."

paqdna,2,2021-08-24,Advice needed on my career path,xfokkie,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/paqdna/advice_needed_on_my_career_path/,"Hi. I actually have more than one question, but they are all related in some way, so this going to be a longer post, but I will be extremely grateful to anyone who could help me with some bits of advice.

Quick introduction: I've been into programming for almost a year now and I'm currently working as a blockchain engineer. I'm leaning towards the architectural type of work and my goal is to become enough familiar with computer science so that I would be able to design and develop anything I could think of. Basically, if I have an idea for an improvement for something from everyday life, I would like to be able to act on it.

# 1. Do you guys know where I can find any resources that are thought at the universities in Software Engineering or Computer Science degrees?

I'd like to learn more about hardware, building robots, AI, and of course, get better with web and software development. I think that I need to dive deeper into low-level programming to do that. **I'm looking towards reviewing the material that is being thought at the universities because I'm self-taught and fear that I have some gaps in my knowledge**.

# 2. I would appreciate it if you would suggest what I could learn next?

I'm currently familiar with:

* Different data structures, like Binary Search Trees, Binary Heaps, Graphs, Singly and Doubly Linked lists, etc.
* Problem-solving approaches and common algorithms for searching
* Web3 networks  

   * smart contracts
   * decentralized storage
   * building and optimizing blockchain networks
* Cryptography
* The very fundamental mathematical and physical concepts of how cpu, ram, gpu, and hard drive work.
* Some of the basics of how the internet works... server hosting, dns, tld, root server, data encryption, ipfs, sockets, (and http)
* Some design patterns in OOP and functional programming, like a few Factory patterns, Observer, Strategy...
* I've made some apps with React (w Next and TS), Express, MongoDB, Laravel, and maybe other frameworks or libs...
* And I've used JavaScript, Python, Solidity, Go, and PHP (HTML and CSS too)

# 3. I think I'm being underpaid. What should I do?

When I started my job I was a complete beginner and I didn't care about salary, so I asked for the bare minimum wage and we agreed that after my 6-month trial would end we would sign an official contract I would get paid an internship salary - $12,957 (yearly btw. And this is very little even for my country). Obviously, I've spent tons of effort to make a dramatic improvement. My goal was to reach a senior level within one year and I (and my boss) believe I'm on the right path to achieve it. I talked with my boss, that I would like a better salary because I exceeded my personal and their own expectations for my improvement, but he refused under the premise, that we had an agreement and it would be unfair to increase my salary. I will have to wait 6 months for a performance review to ask for a better salary again, but I think he is still going to propose less than my expectations.

Thanks for sticking to the end. I would be so grateful to read your advices! Thank you in advance!"

Its a wonderful learning experience and my team is great, but I can't help but feel like it's a big blow to my self-esteem that they cannot see value in me besides being an intern. Also, because of stress due to the job, I have been having some health problems recently. I feel like I need some time off, and that if I'm going to work hard, it has to be for a job contract.

 Last week, the head of the department told me that she's been in negociation with HR, and they told her they can't increase her budget for a junior hire right now. She has expressed over the course of the internship that she wanted to hire me and still does. But all she can offer right now is a bit more salary. I refused the offer yesterday and she understood where I'm coming from and told me that if something opens up, she'll consider me first.

Today, the project manager in our team called me and told me I'm making a huge mistake. That he's been in my shoes not too long ago, and that I should take this offer because it's probably the best I could get in today's market. He said that I'm valuable for the team, they admire my work ethics and urged me to reconsider. He also said that if I ask the head of the department for a day a week for applications, she would not say no. 

I don't know what to think anymore, friends and family have different thoughts about this. But at the end of the day, I need to start my career. I need a job that will pay my bills, grant me financial independence and most importantly, pay for my health insurance. 

What do you guys think? Fear of not finding anything is making me doubt my inital decision. And the pressure of being 25 and in this position is making me doubt myself and my hope about my career."

I am about to switch to an online CS degree and should have 1.5-2 years left. Since its online I will have some flexibility, I was considering attending a boot camp. I have the opportunity to have it paid for in full and noticed many have a flex program. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

Would it be more beneficial to do a boot camp while finishing my degree and trying to go into the industry now. Or, would you recommend doing the standard DSA/leetcode/cracking the coding interview grind for as good of internship as I can get? End goal for me is to wind up in a remote position or NYC. 

What are your thoughts?"

I’m getting an okay salary for my first full-time position ($60k+ in a smaller state). I started out initially working remote due to COVID and began working in the office a little over a month ago. I thought it wasn’t so bad at first but now I hate it and feel really drained coming into the office every day.

I don’t have to rant to you why working from home is vastly superior: not having to get dressed, no commute, no cubicle, access to food and pets, and an overall less draining environment. You know all of this. I haven’t pressed my boss *too* hard about it (i.e threatening to quit) but he’s made it plainly clear he wants me in the office every day and only wants me remote on drastic occasions. I’m not sure quitting is the right move but I’m seriously considering it.

I have little, albiet *some* experience. I’ve been programming with Java since I was in middle school, have a Bachelor’s in CS, tangible independent projects with programming as well as an internship and half a year at this full-time software position. Would it be reasonable for me to quit just for the opportunity to *maybe* work remote? I remember the period after graduation and before this job spending hours of every day applying for jobs for several months, and there’s really no guarantee I’d get a position like this in the near future. Should I just suck it up and be grateful I have a job at all, or is it reasonable for me to quit? 

Any advice at all would be appreciated."

I had enough of working with children and then coming home to my child. It was too much for me that I wasn't enjoying my daughter enough and politics at the daycare really started to anger me. Plus the pay was never going to get where I wanted in life. 

The first year off was great. I'd drop my daughter off at school and I'd go to my classes on campus. Sometimes I'd even get to visit my friend and godchildren after my class. I enjoyed it very much. Then covid hit and my daughter was home with me and my classes turned into online only.

Two of my friends seemed to see this as an opportunity for them. I started babysitting my friends baby a couple days a week at my place. I was getting paid but very little. My choice because she was practically sleeping the entire time I had her in the beginning. Now she's a year old and we'll she's not sleeping a lot and I'm still getting paid the same amount. But it is at my home so I basically go about my day and make sure she is occupied as well. 

Then another friend of mine got a job and asked if I would watch her child who is the same age as my daughter. So I figured it'd be fine because they can just play together and I won't have to worry about keeping her occupied as well. This child came over every day. My daughter had online morning school and her friend would do her homeschooling work during that time. Then they could play after. My friend kept saying she'd pay me after she got a few paychecks. Well a few weeks of doing this and then my daughter went back in person and I told her I could no longer watch her daughter since I wanted to get back to a semi normal life when my child was in school. She understood and again said how she'd pay me for the times I had her and I said don't worry about it and moved on. Well I hadn't heard from her in months after that. I had texted her to see how she was doing a couple weeks after I stopped watching her kid and it was a short lived conversation. She just texted me recently asking about me being an emergency contact for her child. I agreed. 

Now with my friend with the 1 year old. I have a class that is face to face online. A communications class. I told her I wouldn't be able to babysit 2 certain days out of the week unless she could drop off 2 hours later than normal. She struggled with finding someone else to watch her and then asked if I could just sit her in front of a movie while I do class. I said I'd try it once but if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out. 

I feel taken advantage of by these friends and I'm too nice to just tell them no. I'm starting to apply for internships and jobs so I have no idea what they plan to do when they're cheap babysitter is no longer available. 

I love this 1 year old, I've watched her grow up and I don't want to stop being in her life but I also want to get my life back. 

I've watched my godchildren a handful of times and their parents always pay me more than my regular babysitting. I never ask for money from them because I want to spend time with them as their godmother. But they still pay me anyways.

TLDR:// friends use me as a cheap babysitter. And I have a hard time saying no."
pavl19,9,2021-08-24,Does it get easier once you get your first job? How do you make getting the first job easier?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pavl19/does_it_get_easier_once_you_get_your_first_job/,"I've really been struggling for the past couple of years.  I'm about to graduate in December, but I've been unsuccessful in landing an internship throughout college.   I'm still applying and I got a couple of technical interviews for a company that weren't too intense, but I wasn't able to land it in the end.   My resume isn't trash, but it's not very impressive, because of my lack of experience.   I don't really have any side projects other than one I'm currently doing because school has kind of kicked my ass.  My friends from school who have landed jobs are working at places like IBM that I am kind of unqualified for, so leveraging my connections at this point feels like a joke.  

I want to be a better candidate, because I feel like I can carry myself well in an interview.   However, it's hard to answer questions well when I don't have great answers, such as a times when I've accomplished something.   The usual answers are leetcode and personal projects, but I don't know how that's going to help me because I'm not even getting interviews really.  I feel like I would be a much more knowledgeable candidate if I actually had experience, but that's the hard part.  

People always talk about how there's a huge need for people in software, but I just don't see how that's possible.  I've probably applied to about 100 jobs (granted, some were out of my league) and only one company has responded to me.   The only jobs that I feel like I could even get are the $8 / hour positions where you're basically a full team by yourself or just doing a project for some company that doesn't want to pay a legit developer for it.   

I'm just genuinely confused as to how people do it.   Like I'm not an exceptional programmer, but I'm competent.  I don't have zero experience, but it's minimal.  I feel like I'm sitting right under this threshold that I need to reach to become employable.   From my perspective the easiest way to surpass this threshold is to get a job, but that isn't straightforward.  So what can I do to help myself?  Just side projects and leetcode?  Do I need to take a shit job that takes a toll on my mental health to ""make it"" or what is the approach that I should take applying to jobs in the future?  Should I even apply to internships as a graduate if I've never had one or should I just apply to regular jobs?"
pavur9,102,2021-08-24,What college brochures don't tell you about job prospects for an international student at UCLA...,Zmxncbv20,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pavur9/what_college_brochures_dont_tell_you_about_job/," **TL:DR:** Long post ahead - be extra nice to your international student friends, especially ones that are recruiting for jobs/internships in business (or any jobs/grad programs honestly) this Fall, they’re going through so much.

\--

Last night, I signed my full-time offer letter with my dream company as an international student. I just couldn't stop tearing and smiling for a hot minute. Exactly 2 years ago when I was about to enter my 2nd year, I called my parents and cried because I felt like I had no future in America and that I wasted all their life savings on my UCLA degree. 

As I get asked a lot by my domestic friends at UCLA, “can’t you just get a job?”. I figured some would find this post informative and I hope intl students can have more sympathy from our peers and employers.

When I first started at UCLA, I was intrigued by a career in business since many exciting jobs like consulting, investment banking, product management didn’t even exist in my home country. After my first year, I came to a painful realization of the inherent hurdles that intl students face when recruiting for business jobs:

1. For every 20-30 opportunities that domestic students have, **intl students only have 1-2 since a majority of companies don’t sponsor work visas.**
2. For those companies that sponsor, it’s *extraordinarily competitive* since (1) the companies tend to be top consulting firms, investment banks, or big tech - meaning that the competition is naturally competitive as these jobs pay well over 6 figures for entry-level (capitalism goes brrr) and (2) unless intl students can show **why they’re significantly better than the next domestic candidates**, the companies will play safe and pick domestic students instead.
3. Many domestic students can have ‘stepping stone’ internships to make their resumes more competitive by interning at smaller / less prestigious firms before applying to their ‘dream’ jobs. However, most of the time, this isn’t an option for intl students since smaller / less prestigious firms do NOT sponsor. **It’s the classic vicious cycle, but even worse for intl students**: employers want entry-level applicants to have prior experience but applicants can’t get experience because no one wants to employ them!!
4. **Intl students are expected to pay everything out of pocket**. A 4-year UCLA degree costs \~$260,000 (tuition + living expenses). Hence, intl students are pressured, whether internally or externally, to get a high-paying job in America. And no, not all international students are loaded. For reference, the average GDP per capita in my home country is &lt;$3,000 annually - it’s a pitiful fraction compared to the cost of my degree. 
5. **If you’re pursuing a non-STEM degree, almost no employer wants you** since non-STEM intl students could only work up to 1 year after graduation. On the other hand, STEM students can work up to 3 years. Because of this, many students chose STEM degrees that they could care less about, just so that they can be more attractive on the job market (shoutout to UCLA for making Econ STEM). After graduation, intl students have 60 days to find a job or will get sent back to their home country...

Aaaaand all of this is just about the recruiting process, it might take another post or two for me to explain how stupidly complex and unforgiving the paperwork process is for intl students, on top of the language barrier, cultural shock, and homesickness that some of us experience on a daily basis. 

Not sure if anyone makes it this far since the post is hella long lmao but if you're an intl student reading this, just want to tell you that I admire how strong and tenacious you are and that you got this! Reach out to me if you need any support. I'll be on the lookout for the comment section :)"

The hours I would work are flexible, meaning I could work 2 hrs some days and 8 hrs on my free day. I would most likely have to sacrifice things like going to the gym and hanging out with my friends.

Has anyone ever worked an internship and taken a full class load? Do you think I would be overextending myself? How much harder would it be to land the same job next summer? Are they less likely to consider me in the Summer if I go through interview process and reject?

I know these questions are dependent on a lot of these things, just trying to get some perspective."

payxky,2,2021-08-24,Is it okay to have 2 out of 3 LORs from superiors at my internship?,SwagNoodle,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/payxky/is_it_okay_to_have_2_out_of_3_lors_from_superiors/,"I'm a college senior, and I'm currently applying to graduate school for data science.

I currently have a LOR from the Chief Data Officer at a company where I serve as a Data Analyst Intern. I've been working at this company for almost a year, so my responsibilities are very close to that of a full-time analyst. My Chief Data Officer has led many data science teams and has a high opinion of me. I believe this will be my strongest letter.

I also have a LOR from an assistant professor that I took 2 math courses from (Calculus I and Probability), both of which I got As in. I wasn't super close with this professor, but she'll hopefully write a decent letter.

For my 3rd LOR, I have a few options.

1. My direct superior at my internship. We have a good relationship, and I'm confident that she'll write a strong letter. My only reservation is that it might be too similar to my Chief Data Officer's letter.

2. My Linear Algebra professor. I got an A in his class, but so did most people. I don't think I made a very strong impression on him either way. His writing style tends to be very blunt, so there is some risk that it'll be a short and weak recommendation.

3. My Mathematical Statistics II professor. I got a B in this class, but this is the most difficult class in my major. I'm closer to this professor, so he would be able to write more about our interactions. English is his second language, but that shouldn't interfere with the message too much. My main concern is that getting a recommendation from a professor you got a B from would be compromising.

4. Another math professor whose class I got an A in (but almost definitely does not remember me).

5. A professor whose class is unrelated to my major, but could strongly attest to my writing skills and work ethic.

Any advice? Is it possible to ask a professor from this upcoming semester, provided that I make a positive impression in time?

Major: Mathematics/Statistics
GPA: 3.7/4.0"

I am a junior in college majoring in CS. I got an internship for fall. It is for with the Network Operations/SRE team. I’ve been hired to help the team move from their internal ticketing system to JIRA. This is going to be the primary project that I will be working on. 

Today was my second day and I got know that I may not have many opportunities to code/develop an application or work with SWEs to develop an application on this internship. 

Since I will be working full time and I want the money, I do not want to quit as this is my first paid internship and I might learn something. But I know, I do want to keep working in this part of industry. I want to develop/code applications. How can I utilise my time outside work to prepare for a “switch” from this JIRA Engineer to Software Developer? Would you suggest leetcode grind to prepare for the internship interviews and working on a side project? Or if you have anything else, let me know!"

paz5mb,2,2021-08-24,Advice for someone who is about to have their friends host an intervention for them,hey_its_me_hotmess,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/paz5mb/advice_for_someone_who_is_about_to_have_their/,"For context, before my friends and I (22f) all left university for a few weeks break, we went out to some clubs a couple nights that week and I went a little too hard. I had been working a very stressful and demanding internship, and decided to blow off some steam and got absolutely pissed. They were all fairly worried that I’d been acting so erratically recently. Part of me knew this before they said anything. I’ve come to realize when I do blow off steam it’s just a mad house. My roommate had tried to talk to me when we got home and had we both not been incredibly drunk it would’ve been really good. 

So I went home and thought on it for a really reallly long time, everyday I sat and thought on how I could be better for the people I love. Since then I’ve really committed to disciplining myself, being intentional with my presence in the group, being intentional in my connections with them, and tamping down on my impulses to just go off the rails in order to run away from my stress and guilt.

But I’ve been physically sick the past week since I caught wind of their plan to sit me down tomorrow. Our friends have an explosive history of group confrontation. I really need any and all advice on how to approach this in a healthy forward-thinking way.

****edit**** definitely going to be more of an emotional confrontation rather than drugs/alcohol abuse. i’m just not very good at processing emotions quickly or handling emotional discussions on the spot

****edit**** they sprung the chat on me tonight. it was actually super positive, i said I’d need time to pick myself up and be better and i apologized for being chaotic. i thought it went well but still stressed on how to proceed without post-confrontation awkwardness"
paza9q,24,2021-08-24,David Rocco is my real uncle and he is making me go to U of T to make the family proud what do I do,itsuptomoo,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/paza9q/david_rocco_is_my_real_uncle_and_he_is_making_me/,"Hey all,

I come from a long line of Italian culinary mafiosos, and growing up I really never got the appeal of cooking. In fact my uncle's success on Telelatino with his hit shows like dolce vita really showcase cooking and culture, while man I just wanna code and play video games.

I know what I want to do when I grow up and that's make video games, show off to FAANG and then land long term contracts in high paying consulting gigs.

I really want to go to UWaterloo to get a juicy internship where I can flex my coding skills but my uncle wants me to go to U of T so I can engage in Winterlicious and a summerlicious,  David Rocco, my uncle, lives in Toronto and one day I could actually live with him if I go to uoft for something cooking related.

I personally dislike cooking, but I know how to code an addition machine on Python. So like what do I do. My uncle is really being unfair but I know I can one day open up a restaurant of my own if I had the right connections.... Do you think uoft will allow me to create restaurant connections? Could I recruit people from FAANG to join my alliance and restaurant? 

Folks is uoft really worth it? If I get pressured into the culinary world by staying around Toronto too long I fear I will miss my chance at making it biiig like I would in the tech world from UWaterloo? 

Help! And thanks"
pazrsc,2,2021-08-24,Creating accomplishments if you have none,one_of_A,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pazrsc/creating_accomplishments_if_you_have_none/,"So I've learned the importance of going back in your career and emphasizing your accomplishments. My professional career is about 3 years and counting. I'm out of work now but when I started, I was an intern. I hadn't coded professionally at all before then. I was also using a new language. It took a long while but I finally got the hang of things, but that's a year of learning. No accomplishments. Later, I end up on a different team. I don't think I did bad but I wasn't going to stand out as a star yet. Basically, I didn't really code for an entire year. Basic, day to day stuff in a saas as the pandemic slowed everything down. No accomplishments. I just really don't have any. I think it was a combination of just being new, nervous, having alot going on, ignorance, etc.

So I'm wondering, is a portfolio with good projects a good way to counter this? I need another job opportunity to prove myself and use the wisdom I've gained to not repeat my early mistakes. But my past needs to be sugar coated in order to not hurt me. If a portfolio is right, what is a really good resource to help me build a professional quality project (not just using an ide but deploying, version control, etc) or is there a better way to really fill those gaps?



I've been working hard learning algs and ds for interviews. That's been a challenge but I fear the rounds after when I'm asked about my past and my only real accomplishment is learning but not really having things to show for it. 

This is one of many problems I'm facing but I was just reaching out for help to see if anyone could point me in the right direction. Hope it makes sense. Thanks for your responses!"

REFUND POLICY: No refunds will be issued under any circumstances once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer ignorance does not constitute grounds for a refund. If you don't know how to use a specific code and you buy it anyway, or you already own the title, you won't be given a refund once the code has been sent.

CODE REDEMPTION: You may not use these codes on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in you being reported to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""SHOULD PORT/UPGRADE TO 4K"" CODES: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If for some reason a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, you will need to contact the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray if requested. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request.

PAYMENT/FEES: I accept Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F), preferred in that order. I do not cover any fees associated with purchases. When paying through PayPal, do not use Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S). Paying through PayPal with funds not from your PayPal wallet or a linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit card, pre-paid Visa card, etc.) will result in a fee of $0.30 + 2.9%. If a fee is incurred, a refund would result in PayPal keeping your fee, which I will not reimburse, so please be careful.

CONTACT: If there is more than a half hour between our newest message and the one before it, don't expect a quick response. I do not have constant access to Reddit, but I respond to messages as soon as I am aware of them.

pb0ef8,4,2021-08-24,Should I quit this internship?,InLoveWithIcedLatte,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pb0ef8/should_i_quit_this_internship/," 

I need to do a compulsory internship for my graduation. And after 6 months of apply, interviews and rejection, I finally (very reluctantly) asked my father to help me with my internship. He managed to get me one at his friend's company and I was supposed to start from this week. The internship is remote.

The problem is I feel they dont want me there. I email  HR, she doesn't reply to me. I don't even know who my manager is.  It's been 3 days and they haven't yet contacted me. I dont know if I should proceed with this internship.

I really don't want my father to interfere anymore, because it's always like if my father asks the CEO( his friend) then he askes the HR or someone then only they respond to me.

If I don't do the internship my graduation will be pushed by one year. I feel enough guilt for asking my father for help I really dont want to involve him any more than he already is.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks."
pb0q0d,17,2021-08-24,Impossible to get a job without experience,SUPblob,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pb0q0d/impossible_to_get_a_job_without_experience/,"I graduated from uni last year with a bachelors degree and since have applied for 300 jobs (varying degrees of realistic). I didn’t realise until the final year of my degree how integral relevant experience was to get a job, and I actually was meant to do an internship last year  but the company ghosted me after i’d accepted. 

I pretty much get straight up rejected for every job (because I don’t have relevant experience) , but I’ve made it through to the last step of 2 graduate programs and for one of them literally missed out by 1 (graduate programs are really hard to get into, but don’t require prior experience). 

I feel like those graduate programs were my last hope and I am at whits end after so much rejection and coming so close to those grad programs.
I don’t know what to do, I’m seriously considering becoming a tradie or a police officer.

Does anyone have any advice or guidance?"

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
$600, I don't really want to go past it. Lower the price the better.
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
Not extremely, I prefer new.
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Performance and build quality are important, I want to be able to rely on it when I pull my laptop out of my bag ready for class. 
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
The lighter, the better. Trudging a monster of a laptop across campus is a pain.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
N/A
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Gaming would be a plus because I love it, but ultimately I need this computer for working with database software, potentially creating sites, etc. for my IT classes. (I'm an IT major.) Something capable of handling photoshop/video editing would be a plus too.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
I'd like to be able to play games like Noita or CS:GO. 60 FPS on any settings would be nice, but again gaming isn't something I desperately need for this laptop.
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Good keyboard is important, I'll be doing a LOT of typing. I don't want the laptop feel like it can break at the hinges. If I can write on it like a tablet, that's a plus. (School gave me an iPad Air that I love, but it won't allow me to download the software I need.)
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
I major in IT and will be doing an internship next year, so something that lasts for a bit is important. I probably won't be using this everyday, just for a couple classes throughout the week. I'm a student in the US so I might be able to get deals on some slightly more expensive laptops."

Year 1: will have more free time so -Learn basic leetcode, complete AWS developer cert, ensure i pass 1st year of uni. during summer, improve leetcode + do a summer internship

Year 2: Focus on uni mainly and ensure i make it as easy as possible to get a 1st in year 3. Improve leetcode in summer

Year 3: Do a Placement year, work on a few personal side projects to put on my GitHub portfolio. 

Year 4: a) Final year of uni, ensure i graduate with minimum 2:1. Brush up on leetcode in summer. 
 B)apply to a wide range of jobs, (hope for FAANG?) demand minimum 40k+? - not sure if this is reasonable feel free to correct."

How would you rank the aspects to get an internship?

By aspects I mean things like GPA, previous experience, personal projects, being from high tier school, and of course Leetcode.

So how would you rank these and any other unmentioned things in terms of importance?

Then I get sidetracked and start reflecting about a lot of things. 




I still had 1.5 years left of college when we got that 2 week spring break. A lot of my friends are younger and didn’t graduate yet so they’re back on campus. I started working in May and my closest friends around me had jobs or internships from home. We were all working from home together. It didn’t feel lonely. But now it’s different knowing some of them are back at school, seeing their friends and the rest of the gang everyday while I’m stuck working from home. Yeah I guess I can technically go to campus and work from there. But anyway now I’m just obsessively keeping up with this sub even though I haven’t been on Reddit at all this summer until a couple weeks ago. I’m just mad that I couldn’t enjoy my college years to the full. And that’s probably on me because I only became social and made so many friends during the beginning of junior year (Fall 2019) and then Spring 2020 started off even better. But all good things come to an end. 




I realize now why I’m feeling like this. Coming from a brown household, my parents controlled me a lot. And I didn’t realize it until my junior year that I could be getting out there more. I was a commuter so my parents would tell me to just go to campus right before class and come back home as soon as my last class is done for the day. I never stayed around longer to socialize. I wasted the first 2 years. Then junior year comes, and I basically started leaving early in the morning and came back home at night (9pm). Spent all my free time hanging out with friends and socializing and meeting other friends through these friends. Yeah my parents weren’t happy about the fact that my classes would end at 3pm but I’d stay way longer (as they wanted me back home by sunset, which in the fall nearing December it was like at 5:30pm) but I kept pushing my curfew and eventually they started trusting me and didn’t care as much and just wanted me home by 11pm. What I’m trying to say is I had finally gotten my freedom. I was so much happier, staying outside of the house more (cuz toxic brown household lol we love it here). Spring 2020 was the same, I had an amazing group of friends who I took all my classes with and we had a nice study group. 




So now here I am. Graduated, got a job, but working from home. The same home I define as my toxic brown household. I have some sort of freedom now that I’m working (cuz my parents never believed I’d actually have a job ready before graduation so they’re actually proud of me for once) I go out and meet friends after work or just go drive around and they don’t (can’t) say anything. But it’s not the same as seeing everyone everyday in every class. 



Anyway, this post started off as one thing but then kinda went in different directions. Thanks for reading if you came this far :)"

My main drawback is my low GPA. Looking at profiles of people getting accepted, I'm kinda low on morale. Also if anyone feels like I am trying to show off or anything, I'm genuinely not. I'm here for honest advice, should I even bother applying to the MScAC program or am I an automatic reject?

pb8iav,5,2021-08-25,Did you ever endure terrible internships out of fear of ruining your career?,falafel_queen,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/pb8iav/did_you_ever_endure_terrible_internships_out_of/," 

Hi everyone! 

I am currently researching the topic of unpaid labor and labor exploitation in the form of internships. If a few decades ago internships were the step from studies to permanent employment, today employers change interns every few months to cut costs and avoid any social responsibility in the form of social benefits and financial remuneration. Moreover, interns are many times performing very crucial tasks and bring value to the organization for which they are never compensated. 

Economically, free internships drive all salaries down because there will always be someone more desperate that would work for no money in any conditions. 

After the 2008 financial crisis, the rise in internships and other precarious employment increased and I can only imagine how much worse it can get in the aftermath of COVID. Some of my friends shared horrific stories of overwork, verbal abuse, and even sexual harassment - which they kept quiet about for fear of ruining their careers. 

I was wondering what were your experiences with internships and what do you think about the continuous rise in free internships?"

I have 2 years of help desk experience and am currently a ""Jr. Systems Admin"" at a law firm since Jan 2021, but all I do is troubleshoot lawyer issues. It's a 2-man, one stop shop IT Dept. here. Everyone here is super mean to me, most work from home while I have to commute into a major city everyday, and just take shit from people all day.

The senior admin guy basically is holding me from learning any server/firewall stuff saying I need to ""master help desk first"" before he gives more server side projects. But I'm not stupid, and he knows the sooner he teaches me that stuff the sooner I'm outta here, and he doesn't want to have to train another person again soon.

I graduated in 2018 with a BS in IT - concentration was programming and database, mostly Java and SQL. 

I've applied to almost 100 jobs in the past few weeks, mostly all rejections even for junior developer/engineer positions.

Didn't do any internships - my fault, that's why all I could really land was help desk. Some questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. With 2 years of help desk, 9 months of Jr Sys Admin and a BS degree, is that enough to land some junior cloud role? Or should I focus on AWS certs like SAA before applying?

pbeta2,0,2021-08-25,Looking for some specific advice on condensing certain information in my resume and general critique,ResumeNoobPlsHelp,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/pbeta2/looking_for_some_specific_advice_on_condensing/,"Hi, I am applying for a graduate assistantship to TA a class I took last year (different professor) and I need to submit a resume and a statement of interest. I have not updated my resume since some time in undergrad so I am working on that. 

I have a lot of changes I already see that I need to make (like removing my high school club), and I have some restructuring that I am going to do, but I have a few specific areas that I am not sure what to do with. I have a few things to add (grad school to the education section and an internship mainly) so I need to make space since my resume is a full page long.

The main thing I want to ask is **how can/should I condense my experience at ""Affordable Housing at Uni""** (the full left column under Extracurricular Activities)? Some of them are important roles I want to highlight, such as president, treasurer, and house finance manager, the others are not *as* important, but things I would still like to include. 

Exec Board member is also something I think is important, but I think I can include it as a bullet for other stuff because it is a position I held as a result of other positions I held. Basically, certain positions in our organization were automatically members of the Exec Board (treasurer and president in my case). As a House Finance Manager (and as treasurer) I had a position in the finance committee, but I don't have that committee as its own thing, so I think I can ditch Exec Board as its own thing.

I have seen some things online that recommend ways to show multiple positions at one company, but I am having difficulties applying those recommendations to these positions. Some positions overlap in time, some are more important than others, some have vastly more responsibilities than others, some are elected positions while others are not, etc.

I was thinking maybe doing something like:

&amp;#x200B;

""**Affordable Housing at Uni**, *Aug. 2019 - July 2021*

Notable positions: President, Treasurer, Chair of Executive Board, Finance Committee Chair, House Finance Manager

Committees: Membership, Housing, Gardening and Sustainability, Outreach, Bringers of Fun""

&amp;#x200B;

This is much shorter and allows me to include more committees I was involved in that weren't important enough to warrant their own chunk of space. The only thing is that this excludes potentially important information such as when/how long I was involved in specific positions/committees and important work and responsibilities. 

I'd love to hear suggestions for how to reformat and condense this section!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few other minor questions (from top to bottom of resume):

1. A professor of mine said that GPAs should be rounded to two digits. I can not remember his rounding advice and found conflicting information online. Is it acceptable to round 3.677 to 3.68, or should it be 3.67?
2. Should I not include my community college GPA of 3.10? 
3. I was president of the affordable housing org for about 6 months. A full term is one year in the organization. I was president because we impeached the president at the time and I was elected to fill the position until the next regular election. I feel weird having a 6 month presidency listed with no explanation, but I don't know if it would be better to list as something like ""interim president"" or to just leave it as is. 

Finally, I am open to any other suggestions or critiques you may have about anything on my resume!

2) I remember seeing somewhere on this subreddit that you can apply to amazon (or AWS) internship only after a gap after 6 months. Is that right? So if I apply once now and get rejected, will I be eligible to apply only next march?

3) On the same lines as 2, am I allowed to apply to different internship positions within the same company (for eg., cloud engineering internship vs software engineering internship at Microsoft or something)? Or do I have to wait for 6 months again?

4) Is it necessary to have a portfolio website built-up? I'm sorta mainly into backend, IoT and automation so I don't really want to build a website, but if companies look for it and it's absolutely necessary, I can build a quick and dirty react site?

5) If I end up getting an internship offer from one company, can I still continue interviewing and negotiating with other companies at my will. Or are there some companies that mandate otherwise?

6) For questions like - 
a)  Are you currently legally authorized to work in the United States?  and b) Will you require sponsorship for employment visa status

What should I put as an incoming graduate international F1 student? (as I don't really 'require' sponsorship for either internships or on the OPT period)"

Quick Background: I Will graduate at the end of fall from a state school with a master's in computer science - general emphasis. Also, I have a BS in CS. I, unfortunately, never did an internship. Was a GA and RA with about a 3.9 gap in both undergrad and Graduate. A paper I helped within unergrad in Privacy is about to get published. Currently working on a thesis in machine learning (specifically working with convolutional neural networks). I'm looking for my first job in either machine learning or Software engineering. I think I would like to try working in ML but could also definitely see myself in software engineering as that was my original intention.

My ML background is a bit scattered and I am looking at some options that would both solidify my knowledge and beef up my resume. I'm thinking about the TensorFlow Developer Certificate, Google cloud's Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification, courseca courses for those two certificates/certifications as well as a courseca course on math for machine learning.

I'm wondering if anyone can give me their thoughts as to whether those certifications along with a CS master's with a thesis in ML would make me a viable candidate for ML engineering jobs? Or if my lack of experience / specific degree would be too big of a problem.

I also have a chronic pain condition that means I would benefit a lot from a flexible schedule. I could work full time just fine but might sometimes need to rest during normal business hours and make up for it nights/weekends and it's unpredictable when my pain will be bad. I would love a remote job but could also handle an in-person or mixed job that would be flexible for me. Is it normal for new grads to be able to find remote jobs?

Should I look for jobs specifically advertised as flexible or look at normal jobs and ask if they can be flexible? If the second option what part of the application/interview should I bring up my issue?

If I struggle to find a job would it be weird to apply for internships as a new Master's grad?

I'll take any advice/thoughts. I might also make a post on r/jobs or r/carerguidance about my health issues during the job search.

As you can see for international student even though a public university is really expensive, so I found BYU Idaho affordable compared to most state universities that are around (41,000-51,774 more or less per year) 
But for me the most important is quality education and accreditation because I am planning to do a master degree in computer science after I graduate. 

First of all I would like to know:


1)Does BYU Idaho has quality education for software engineering? And what about accreditation?

2)Does BYU Idaho offers internship opportunities for software engineering/computer science students? 

3) Do they accept credits from other states? 

4)How does big companies/companies in general  see a student graduated from BYU Idaho with software engineering degree? 

Also, I am not mormon, I am actually pentecostal christian, but I have no issue with other religions. I read the honor code and I am really find with that. I am not actually that kind of people that party or drink. I am really chill, and I am more focus in my academic goals and meet good people.

I have to control a Keysight E36312A with MATLAB GPIB. It has already been tested and shown to work in controlling the channels on our VS.

However, our issue is that in the 'Data Logger' menu on our VS, when the GPIB is used to control it, the waveforms do not appear as they would given you had programed a sweep from directly on the power source.

We are assuming this is some sort of issue in regards to a setting on the VS, however we have set our trigger source to remote command, DIO Trigger in, and the Run/Stop Key. None show the activity sent from our GPIB :(. Does anyone have experience with a similar situation? Thank you in advance."

\----------------------------

Walking towards the ship he was thinking about the reasons for this pet; it wasn’t only to keep him company but it also had a job.

Turns out that a half organic ships tended to have infestation problems, from what he had read it was similar to the caries that happens in human teeth, and the cat had been modified to hunt those things that could end damaging the ship.

He looked at the small ball of fur, from what he remembered it could be just a couple months old or so but it would grow to a nice size, about 30-40 cm long.

He entered the ship (his ship!), no need to arrange for an apartment when he already had something, and walked to his bedroom, left the basket on the bed and walked to the kitchen.

The kitchen wasn’t really that big but it had everything a house kitchen would have. The nice detail was the Italian coffee maker and he saw in the storage room enough coffee for 5 years, plus spare rubbers.

The fridge was also well provided with his preferred foods; meats, vegetables, drinks, everything was perfect.

While he was preparing his dinner he saw a bowl on the floor with water and another with some dark coloured big grains.

*“Friday, what are these bowls?”* \- he asked the ship

*“These are for the cat, I instructed the drones to put them there, is the location not correct?”* \- inquired the ship with a kind of guilty voice

*“No, I mean, yes they’re ok. They are by the corner so I don’t think I’ll kick them or anything. Next time let me know of the changes when I come in, will you?”* \- he answered nervously, interacting with the ship would need some time to get used to.

*“Sure thing Boss. I’ve also installed the litter box in the bathroom, it has a self cleaning system and we’ve got enough for a while.”* \- she informed him

He sat on the bar stool and had his dinner on the small table; afterwards decided to check on the cat. She was still sleeping, so he took the basket with him and went to the leisure room.

He sat on the couch with the basket by his side and spent the rest of his day reading about his exploration targets on the big screen.

The first two systems were, to be honest, quite boring. It made sense though even as an explorer full grade he did have to fill the quota and, until he proved they could trust him, he would get boring assignments.

So he would fill his quota to the letter, and then some.

*“Friday, what am I missing from the first system?”* \- he asked to the AI

*“Sorry, I don’t understand the question, can you be more specific?”* \- she dutifully answered.

*“Well, I can see is a binary system with 12 planets, 3 big gas ones with a few moons each, there’s one with a ring, similar to Saturn from the Sol system but, I mean, what am I missing? Is there anything special there or just routine and boring?”*

*“I’m afraid we’ll have to go there and check Boss”*

Well, that was obvious, and as helpful as a kick on the nuts. He looked at the image on the screen and wondered, what else is there? How can I prove that I deserve better assignments?

He checked the second one, a massive blue star that, for all accounts, had already devoured a couple of the nearby planets.

There were some asteroid belts and some other planets but the exploration drone didn’t get much more info. That would be the most interesting of the first two, he thought.

After those two he decided to put on a movie.

It was during the movie that he felt something move, the cat left the basket and laid down on his belly, purring. He ignored the movie and looked at the cat, she had her eyes closed and was rolled-up.

*“And what do I name you?”* \- he said out loud while caressing her back

The purr accentuated and an idea came to him. She was supposed to hunt infections on the ship, wasn’t she? Then, hunter… but hunter sounded typical and boring. For some reason he had always loved and felt an affinity for the japanese language, and hunter in japanese was ryoshi, which he felt had a nice ring to it.

*“Ryoshi, your name is going to be Ryoshi”*

As if she understood what was going on she opened her eyes and yawned.

*“Ryoshi!”* \- he said with a convincing voice

He saw the cat tail moving emphatically. Yep, that was it, the cat was not “the cat” anymore, she was Ryoshi. Ryoshi, Friday and Jordi on the Espurna, about to begin the adventure of their lives.

He looked at the time and realized it was kind of late, 3 am. He wasn’t jet-lagged or anything but he wanted to keep proper hours to give his brain time to rest.

Holding Ryoshi he went to his bed, left her in a corner and put on the pyjamas. It made sense for him to follow some procedures, he had to have a family meeting tomorrow after all.

The next day started with a call to Dr. Vann’hra, his psychologist. It was a quick call, he informed him that he was already on the ship, and the good doctor was already aware of the changes made to the AI, the name of the ship and the cat (even the cat! Did Friday really have to report it all? Of course she did) and he ended the call with a *“Well, speak to you in six months”* which got a smile in response; and a Ravnar smile was somehow disconcerting for a human, but he was pretty sure it was intentional, Friday would be monitoring his vital signs 24/7 after all.

He still had a few hours before the meeting with his family, that would be a weird one. Granted, they had spoken throughout the years, but he was an only child and really didn’t know much about his parents after all.

He knew his mother was a teacher specialized in languages, she spoke something like eleven human languages plus galactic (because of course everyone had to know galactic, that was the standard), and she would teach other races the intricacies of the human languages; from the latin based ones, the germanic ones and others, like basque, mandarin, korean, japanese, etc.

His father was an architect, he had taken the necessary galactic courses to familiarize himself with other elements that did not exist on Earth and helped the design and construction of Empire infrastructures and buildings. He had helped South America and South Africa building cities like New York and Tokyo; obviously he wasn’t the only architect on these projects but the fact that he worked on them filled him with pride.

They were both, by all accounts, pretty amazing people, he could only wish to have an impact in the Empire as his parents did.

A couple hours before the meeting he took a shower, feeling suddenly nervous.

*“Would you like something to help you relax? I have an assortment of allowed drugs that can help you, you know”* \- said Friday

*“Ok, first, I’m taking a shower so let me shower in peace will you?”* \- he answered - *“And second, no… I don’t want to meet my parents high as a kite, thank you very much”*

He took the silence as an answer and finished showering, he would have to set some barriers to Friday. He knew he was being observed, analyzed and all data would be sent to Central to be recorded in order to improve the knowledge and treatment of humans, but there was a thing as ‘too much’.

*“I’ve prepared a backpack so you can take Ryoshi with you”* \- Friday informed him

He sighed and then remembered that he had to have her with him for 24h.

*“Will she not get nervous? We’re traveling a bit you know”* \- he answered the AI

*“Well, she needs to be able to adapt, and from what I can see about her treatment, she’s more than ready to do so”* \- Friday answered condescendically

He made a mental note to read more about Ryoshi treatment, there was more about the cat that he thought and he should know all of it, for future events.

He dressed and prepared the backpack. Ryoshi was just lying on the bed, about 10cm long and light as a plume. He picked her up and put it in his backpack.

*“Come on, we’re going on an adventure! The first of many”* \- he whispered to her

He wasn’t going to fly with the ship to his parent’s house, so he checked the public transport and there was both a bus and a train from the Starport to Mataró, where his parents lived.

He decided to take the train, if anything because as he recalled the train line was so close to the sea that he remembered hearing stories of trains having to stop when the waves were too strong.

Both the train and the tract had been improved by the Empire, he didn’t remember much but he could see the differences. The travel was smooth and he could see lots of people on it; Mataró was by the Mediterranean after all, and the mountains weren’t that far from the center, so it would make sense for some races to come and enjoy it.

He knew he was getting close because of the palm trees (not really native but they have been there since forever) and the breakwater (l’espigó, as he remembered calling it).

His parents lived in an apartment not far from the train station. He rang the bell and his mom’s face appeared on the small screen by the entrance. She was beaming.

*“Oh!! Jordi!”* \- she said while opening the door for him.

The rest of the night was as familiar as anyone who has been in a family meeting can tell. Hugs, kisses, ‘you look thin, you need to eat more’, you know, the usual.

They were both curious about Ryoshi but once he explained they both had this face like ‘it makes sense, of course’. Suffice to say he was still intimidated by their presence.

After dinner, they had coffee (an amazing flavoured coffee he had to admit).

*“So, explorer full grade, eh. And what are you supposed to do?”* \- asked his father

*“Well, for the next years, 3 or 5 it depends, I will go to some systems the Empire has only sent an exploration drone and do a deep system analysis. To see if there’s something of value there”* \- he answered, dutifully.

*“I think it is a really interesting job, one that can in the future provide something of value to the Empire, right dear?”* \- said his mom while clutching his father's hand.

*“Ehem… of course, of course. I haven’t thought that far and if it is what you like, all that much power to you!”* \- was his father's response.

The rest of the night went as you would expect. They would tell stories and anecdotes from their jobs, he would explain some about his time on the Exxavian, it felt nice and he was feeling like they had never forgotten about him.

When they were saying their goodbyes his mother hugged him really hard.

*“Remember we love you and we’re proud of you. What you’re accomplished so far is amazing and we wouldn’t have it any other way”* \- she said

His father looked at him, he could tell his eyes were fighting hard to not drop any tear, and he shaked his hand with a really strong grip.

*“And if anything ever happens, you have a place here. We’re your family so keep in touch every now and then”* \- he said while keeping the tears at bay.

He stopped the shake and decided to hug him hard as well.

*“I know dad, I know”* \- was all he could muster.

And back to the ship it was, he almost fell asleep on the train with the backpack on his lap, it had been an emotional day and he felt like his batteries were drained.

Seeing the ship in the hangar his brain kind of woke up and before he knew it he was already planning to leave the next day.

*“Friday, can you please log a request to leave tomorrow?”* \- he asked the ship

*“The first slot available is at 14 hours”* \- the Empire didn’t really like the am pm system, they preferred the 24h one - *“Should I reserve that one? Next one is at 17h”*

*“14h is good, I still have a lot of space for the leisure database and the travel time to the ship system is about two weeks if I recall correctly” -* he thought out loud

*“It was but it has been reduced. Just this afternoon a paper has been published that improves travel time. Depending on the characteristics of the origin and destination system the speed can be increased by 75%”* \- the ship informed him - *“This paper has the Empire in a bit of an uproar because it has been published by a 20 y.o. human junior researcher”*

*“That’s awesome! If I remember correctly the last improvement was about 200 years ago, wasn’t it”*

*“That is correct”* \- the ship answered - *“This researcher has already received offers from all over the Empire, once her internship finishes she’ll be able to choose without having to fight for a position”*

*“Incredible, so, what increase are we talking about in our case?”* \- he inquired

*“In our case we’ll reach the first system, Alkagoria, in 9 days”* \- was the ship response

The standard day in the Empire was 30h long, but they curiously also had a seven day week. The years had 13 months though, each month had 5 weeks, for a total of 455 days per year, or 13650 hours.

He went to bed thinking what else to add to the leisure database, he already had a huge collection of human tv shows and movies, maybe he could add something from other species.

With that thought in mind he reached his bedroom, Ryoshi sleeping comfortably in a corner, she might have been having a nice dream because she was purring softly.

He entered the sheets trying not to bother her much and went to sleep.

The next morning he spent it verifying stocks and finishing the copy of items for his leisure database. He had already thirty exploration drones ready and the 3d printer could make some more, since he had a few hours before launch he decided to program it to create a few more, maybe ten just in case.

And before he realized it was ten minutes for the allocated time, he went to the bridge grabbing Ryoshi. He sat on the chair and put her on his lap, she was looking at him with a look that seemed to say ‘I’ll allow it’.

Turned on the panels and prepared the ship for launch, as an explorer piloting was one of those things they had to master and he always received almost perfect scores.

*“Are you ready Friday?”* \- he asked, he knew the answer but this AI was becoming more a companion than anything else

*“Ready, all systems green Boss”* \- was her answer

He started the anti-gravity engine and released the clamping legs, his eyes looking at the timer, two minutes.

*“Control this is the Espurna, ready to go”* \- he informed

*“This is control, received Espurna, we’re having a busy day so when your timer hits zero please launch without delay”* \- they responded

He heard a metallic sound and saw from the exterior cameras that the hangar roof was opening, then looked at the timer, 60 seconds.

He didn’t even try to suppress a smile and waited to say out loud.

*“10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.. zero!”* \- and he started the in-planet engine, pulling up.

Even with the inertia dampeners he could feel the pressure from the acceleration, on his lap Ryoshi looked curiously through the main window on the bridge.

*“And we have lift-off!”* \- he excitedly exclaimed to no one in particular

I was supposed to do my first internship this summer, but despites all my applications i didn't get interviews. Some people told me that it's because of covid. But honestly i will not put all the blame on covid. If i didn't get a single interview i think it's because There's something i probably do wrongly. Then i search for some tips and find that i should networking on linkedin. So i create a linkdin profile and try to connect with students of my university and some profesors and company as well. But i never try to send a message to someone. I don't know how to do it. I'm so scared of it. Does people will find me interesting? they will be bored? they will be mad? Also i don't know what to talk with them. I'm an introvert person and try to correct this part of myself. By it's difficult for me. 
Also, i tried to show my resume to another people to ask them if it was good, even if the coop manager for my specific program said to me that my resume was really good. I had someone who said to me that my english resume doesn't look professional at all. It's kind like i don't speak the language fluently. And she guessed right. Because my 1st language is French. Then i learn english through school and my own research.
So i want to ask you if you have some tips to networking and discuss with people on linkdin? And do you know how i can make my english resume look more professional? 

Finally, i also learn during my research on the internet, if i didn't get internship i should do and work on project to improve my experiences section in my resume. But i don't know where to look at some projects that i can do. If you can help me by giving me some suggestions that will be really great too.

Hi, I'm studying computer science at the University of Alberta, and just finished my 2nd year.

I have some knowledge about algorithms, data structures, logic and know python, C, Java and GoLang.

I might have to take one year off school due to my mental health condition, the doctor strongly advised against me going to school, so does my family, but I know it going to make me feel way worse if I sit in my room and do nothing for another year,

I have no contact with anyone currently working in the field, so I'm asking help from you guys that if it is possible to let me try some internship while I'm off school for this year.

I'm an international student, so my visa forbids me to work part-time if I taking time off school. I can accept the internship without pay, just want to have some hands-on experience with the works, and don't want to waste my year."

I have a few potential offers coming my way and  I wanted to be able to make my best decision possible.

Opportunity A.) Soc Analyst-  Citibank. Location: NYC (would have to relocate). Not sure how much the offer would be or what's competitive for the area so maybe you guys can help me with this, but I would have to also go into the office.  The opportunity is solid, have a lot of cool projects to work on and as a part time student it covers some tuition (about $8,000 out of my remaining $15,000). 

&amp;#x200B;

Opportunity B.) VMware University Propel Program.  Rotational program as intern to full time offer.  You get to choose 2 teams of your choice. First 6 months you work for 1 team, other 6 months you work for other team, then you have the freedom to choose whichever team you want to join. Reloc to Palo Alto, Boston, or ATL. Offer is usually very high for new grad- but not sure what to expect from this either.

Opportunity C.) Application Security analyst. Series-D funded startup company of 100-200 people (unicorn). Fully remote, pay is 80k a year so presumably lower than the other two but balances out because of remote. Benefits standard. Technologies are pretty standard... nothing fancy- I would definitely have a learning curve here, and my experience with startup culture is a bit rough but I have only ever worked for one. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you were in my shoes, how would you rank these choices? really in a toss up about what to do here.  I am stoked to get three potential opportunities, and if there are any questions I can answer in addition that may help you answer this, ask away."
pbpwgf,6,2021-08-25,"This week was supposed to be the start of so many amazing things, but it's all gone to shit and I can't seem to get over it.",GoddessScully,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pbpwgf/this_week_was_supposed_to_be_the_start_of_so_many/,"TLDR; I'm a mess, life is fucking me in the asshole with no lube, no end of misery in sight.

I struggle with so many mental health issues, cptsd, codependency, bipolar, depression, anxiety, etc. and for the last couple months my ADHD has been especially difficult. I knew a long time in advance that this week was going to be the start of many important things, mainly revolved around grad school (I moved from Cleveland, Ohio to a suburb of Philly PA for grad school last year during the pandemic and a lot of terrible things happened which ended up in me withdrawing for the semester and going into an inpatient psych facility for a week). 

So not only was I going to be back in grad school (THANKFULLY on campus/in person because the online stuff was what made me lose my mind), but I'm starting an important internship that's part of my graduate program and I'm still working a job, I just went from full time to part time. I knew juggling all these things were going to be really hard so I started planning as much as I possibly could. Meal Prepping healthy foods. Going to the gym to create a rhythm of working out. Getting a dotted notebook to do bullet journaling. Checking my school email to see when I would get my syllabi's for classes to help with planning. I finally felt like things were going in the right direction and I was finally starting to get a handle on my life.

And then, on Monday night I was the victim of a hit and run accident. Now luckily I didn't get physically hurt from this, which that I am thankful for. But emotionally I feel broken. I have insurance and part of my policy is getting a rental car for when my car is getting repaired, BUT my car is a little bit older (2011). When I was telling the claims adjuster on the phone the details of the damage she told me that there is a chance my car will be deemed a total loss which means that I will have to get a new car. This shook me to my core. 

My finances aren't great, but I've made some good progress in the last couple of years and since I started on a specific recovery path things have really turned around for me. My credit score is not great tho. And I still have a very good chunk to pay off for the car. Also I just reduced my hours to part time instead of full time, and I just genuinely cannot afford another car right now. I was banking on still paying off this car for the next couple years and getting a new one after I get out of grad school. 

Basically, since the accident I have been an absolute wreck. No pun intended. The accident happened at 7:30 on Monday night. I was starting my very important internship on Tuesday at 8:30am. I was not able to get a rental car Monday night, but I could get one when the rental place opened at 7:30am. I had to get a lyft home from where the accident happened because I didn't feel comfortable driving the car in the condition it was in. When I finally got home around 10pm I was trying to figure out how to get to the rental car place at 7:30am, when I looked up booking another lyft for it it would have been $25, (I had already spent $15 on the lyft home from the accident) and I couldn't afford that. I still had to save enough money for the deductible and other costs this whole thing would accrue. So I figured I could just go through public transit - granted I had never taken it before since living in Philly and had no idea where to go. I woke up at 5am on Tuesday to eat breakfast, take a shower, get ready for the internship and have enough time to get to the bus stop on time. And to no one's surprise, I miscalculated the timing and knew I would not get to the rental place early enough to get to my internship on time, so I called a lyft. Another $15 gone. The rental place was not expecting me to come so they only had 1 car for me which was $10 more than my insurance covered. They told me if I returned it before they close at 6pm I could avoid the charge. 

I made it to the internship on time - even early, which was my preference. Internship went fine, but during my lunch I returned a call to the place where my car was towed to, and they told me I needed to authorize them to work on my car before they could do anything with it. Couldn't sign the authorization form on my cell phone, so I would have to go after I got done with the internship before they closed at 5:30 pm. Also, I forgot a phone charger and my battery was depleting quickly. I am not familiar with how to get into and out of the city of Philly and needed my phone for gps but that eats a lot of battery very quickly and of course when I left my internship at 4:30pm I hit a ton of traffic on my way home. I did not know where the place my car was towed to was, and when trying to go to it on my own without a gps I fucked up where I was going and was terrified I was not going to make it by 5:30pm. I ended up arriving at 5:27pm and I was so panicked the lady at the counter told me to take a few deep breaths to calm down. Then there was getting to the rental place before they closed in time, and again, facing traffic on my way. I was so mad at myself and so frustrated. I was screaming and yelling at myself in the car for being so dumb and going the wrong way. I ended up getting to the rental place at 6:03pm but they were still open thank god and I got switched to another car my insurance fully covered. By this time I had a massive migraine and felt miserable. Called my mom to try and talk about how miserable I was, she told me that I needed to not think about my car stuff and to just focus on school and internship because that's more important. But I literally can not. 

Then came today. I went to work, things were normal but I had 2 appointments, one with my Psych NP to get my adderall adjusted, and one with a therapist I'm not even sure I like yet. Thankfully I really like my Psych NP and she was the first person to validate all of my frustration about this whole situation. She told me it's okay if I take an extra of one of my anti-depressants and is upping my adderall which I desperately needed. For the first time I was starting to feel better until I met with my therapist. I explained what I was feeling and why and all of that but that I was starting to feel better. Then she started to poke and prod why I felt so bad about everything. Asked me about my childhood and my parents and why I feel like I'm inherently bad and bad things happen to me disproportionately, all of this while my phone is low on battery. To no shock and surprise I forgot my phone charger - again. Luckily a coworker had a charger she let me use. My therapist asked me about the abuse my mom did when I was really young and what my dad did, and she was asking me more and more about stuff with my dad. The LAST thing I wanted to do was talk about my stuff with my dad or even think about stuff with my dad. I have a lot of issues with my codependency in relation to having a very absent and emotionally unavailable father. I basically asked her if we could end the session because I had 1% battery left on my phone and I just didn't want to talk about stuff with my dad. It's left a really horrible taste in my mouth about this therapist and I already wasn't a big fan of her. 

All I wanted to do was go to my school library and get started on my homework. I was so excited to get home and get all my stuff together and go to the library to finally get started in school mode because I literally CANNOT work from home do homework at home like my brain cannot manage doing stuff like that at home. I need to be in a physically different location in order to focus and get stuff done. But of course, my school ID would not let me in any building. The library said if my card isn't working they can't let me in. I went to Campus Security and asked me if I had been vaccinated and updated my info with the school which I absolutely have done. I told them I have my first class tomorrow morning at 9 am and how was I supposed to get into the building. They said lots of students are having this problem. I have been waiting OVER A YEAR TO ATTEND THIS UNIVERSITY ON CAMPUS AND IN PERSON. I CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE FOR THIS - AND MY FUCKING ID CARD WON'T LET ME IN CAMPUS BUILDINGS FOR NO GOOD REASON. 

I am destroyed, defeated, and done. I have no one I feel like I can turn to. I don't feel safe or validated by like anyone. I don't even want my cats around me I'm so miserable but of course they want to be near me because they know how miserable I am. I just need someone to give a shit. I've been sober for over a year and it's days like today I just want to say fuck it and drink or smoke something."

***\*Aboard Zephyr Station 12…\****

”\*cough, cough\*”

Alan was not having the best of days, to put it in a boring but factual manner.

It’s kinda funny when you think about it. Over 80 years of xeno interaction, hundreds of medical advancements, and *countless* years of research, and there still remained the most annoying enemy of mankind: The Common Cold.

The name’s a misnomer, really. If it were one disease, it wouldn’t be so… well, *common*due to after-infection immunity. In reality, over 200 different viruses apparently had met in a secret virus villain lair, and had all decided to work together to do one thing:  
*Annoy the absolute shit out of everybody they infected, and spread*. Then, keep coming back, one after another.

The result being?  
They had managed to make themselves an incurable, repetitive disease. One that kept coming back, no matter how hard you may try to scrub it out of existence, no matter what protocols you may try to put in place.  
What did they do with this incurability?  
Well, they didn’t wipe civilization out by killing everything, they didn’t inflict horrors upon their hosts that debilitated and maimed the poor souls who contracted them, they didn’t even try to make themselves anything to take seriously.

They took the smart route, and just made themselves the **most annoying organisms that mankind had ever dealt with.**

Why was this the smart route?

Because if nobody took them seriously, then nobody would even **try** to take a *serious*attempt at *curing* them. They would just spread, one after another, taking advantage of the nonchalant attitude their hosts took to their infection, and used that behavior to **thrive**.

Right now, Alan was cursing that fact.

He felt like absolute shit today. From the minute he had woken up and rolled out of bed to getting his shirt on and walking out of his room, he had been dealing with a cough that would come in spurts, then leave him alone… only to just return and in worse form. Alongside that, he couldn’t smell or taste for *shit*, his throat felt like it was slightly on fire, he had a 101° fever, and his nose felt like it had a brick stuck inside of it.

Coughing along the way, Alan walked along the hallways from the dorms until he hit his cafe, then went over to grab a breakfast bar from the meal line. He picked one up out of a display filled with a few dozen of them, and half-assedly read the label as he walked back to his usual seat.  
As he neared his table, however, one of the guys at said table, Reman, scrunched his face up a bit.

”You alright, dude? You don’t look so hot.”

Alan smiled a bit, but just sat down and opened his breakfast bar.

”It’s just a cold, dude. Do I look like shit? Maybe. Feel like shit? Yeah. In mortal danger? …nah.”

Reman shrugged, and then turned back to his breakfast.

Alan dug into his breakfast bar, and silently daydreamed about if he had enough money to pay the medical guys enough for them to develop a cure for colds.

His mind also wandered over to one of his friends, Ash.  
Well, that was what *he* called him, anyways. His real, Jornissian name sounded like one of those old floor steamers (the closest approximation that Alan had gotten to was Asjesh’hass), but Alan had come up with the nickname when they first met 8 years back. They had only really been friends for the last 6, though, but the name still stuck. It was kinda ironic, seeing as his scale colors were deep (but also light) cobalt blue spattered with flecks of white, the colors of water and ice.  
Now, Ash was a big, *big* fucking dude. Even by xeno standards, he stood at a normal height of 3.45 meters (average was about a 3/4 meter *shorter*) and he actually stood with slightly *less* of his body vertical than most snakes did (32% as opposed to the average 35-40%). The dude **ate his fucking wheaties,** so to speak, and you could *tell.*Combine that with being a cold-weather Jorn, meaning he also had the cross-section to match his vertical stature, and the dude made his presence known to **everybody** that saw him. You couldn’t miss the sight of his white-speckled blue scales in a crowd if you *tried*. *That* fact was *also* helped by his slightly viper-ish look, even though he was mostly of python descent.  
Oh, and a weird quirk about him; despite his size, the man never seemed to fail at sneaking up on anybody that wasn‘t a Dorarizin. Not sure how, maybe it was something about how all that weight was distributed, but he knew (almost subconsciously, it seemed) exactly how to slither over even the creakiest of metal floor plating without a sound.

’Flashback time.’ Alan mused.

They had met back when Alan was first interning on the station as a shipping grunt, hauling carts of packages when the bots were being upgraded, fixed, or replaced. Being one of the single largest… (to put some respect on the name) **beings** onboard, Ash was usually one of the first guys that anybody contacted when they needed something big and heavy moved. They always paid him good overtime, so he always obliged.  
Alan’s first sight of this absolute **unit** of a snake was about 3 months into his internship, when a ship had come in too hot for landing and crashed into the back wall of the bay. More importantly, however, was that after they had gotten the pilot out safely, they had discovered that cargo had completely spilled *everywhere* as a result of said crash. We’re talking metal boxes scattered across *every* square fucking foot of the floor within half a football field-length of the ship. The shipping guys had called in an “all hands on deck” to deal with the situation, since the sheer *amount* of boxes, and the number of positions that they were in, were just too much for the drones to handle.

Alan had just clocked in, and was already getting to work sorting out the cargo, throwing what wasn’t being delivered *here* in a separate, giant pile. He was working pretty steadily, clearing a good 10-ft radius of regular-sized boxes, before he came across a GIANT box the size of one of the cafe‘s tables, and as thick as a table‘s height, too. And it weighed a few *tons*. Even after calling over a Dorarizin to help, they both couldn’t get it up more than a few inches off the ground.

Then, the titanoboa showed up.  
“\[One sec-\]”  
With absolutely *Herculean* strength, the snake just *sauntered* over and just… tilted the box on it’s edge and slid its tail underneath. Before either Alan or the dog knew it, the Jorn was carrying the damn thing over to the pile, inch by inch. Alan was pretty sure that for the only time in his life, the moment that snake just hauled off the box like it wasn’t even a major issue, he saw a Dorarizin’s jaw physically *drop*.

Alan didn’t waste a second after he clocked out, and had dead *sprinted* after the snake before they, too, clocked out. All that he wanted to know was how in the *hell* did it pull that stunt off, but it turns out that… well, I don’t think that there’s any more cliché yet apt phrase to describe the snake outside of… he was a *gentle giant*! The dude had apparently just grown up… well, **big!** He had just started looking for a career when he heard about the Zephyr stations, and he just… found that spark that he was looking for!  
By some miracle, he managed to beat out *thousands* of others to get a job as a loading bay operator, but his size made it so that his *de facto* job was making **bank** as the only guy who could take care of extra-size cargo while the XL drones were down. Multiply *that* by 30 years of experience doing that job, and he ended up with quite the amount of strength, too. Combine **that** with being xeno-Shaq (with even more meat on his bones), and he could probably make it onto a xeno basketball team (if they ever picked up the sport). The thing was, though, that as imposing as his profile was (and rightfully so), he didn’t like his job because he could show off, he liked it because of the relaxation factor! Well that, *and* the warmcuddles, but *everybody* came for the warmcuddles in *some* amount. But that’s beside the point; the guy liked the quiet background that he came from, and he liked the same quiet that his position offered. Well, that, *and*screwing around with friends.  
He wasn’t ever boastful about his size, it was just *his normal*.

”I… damn, I kinda envy that story, honestly. You‘re happy with the quiet life, you‘re happy with your job, you’re happy with yourself… damn. Good on you, dude.”

”\[Don’t worry about me, you have your own stuff to tend to as well. Be proud of it, it’ll make shit easier on everything in your life; your mind, your friends, even your physical health.\]”

”Huh. Wise words. You know what, you got any advice for workin‘ here? I’m just interning here to get a job away from Earth and get paid while I’m doing it, so I may as well do my job *right*.”

Alan hadn’t realized it then, but that conversation was the kick that really gave him his first friend group since his *sophomore year of high school.* It would take a couple years, but when he finally managed to win his position onboard Zephyr 12, he wasn’t alone in celebration.  
Turns out, he and Ash just… *clicked*. No, neither of them were gay (calm the fuck **down)**, it was just… they hit it off as friends! Oh, and by random chance, Alan’s first *paid* shifts 4 years ago were with the titanoboa (which he had already befriended 2 years prior by that point). Ash would come in at around noon every day and they would shoot the shit, play some games, and generally just hang out until dinner, and *then* until when they had to sleep, and they had pretty much stuck to this schedule for *all* of the past 4 years.  
How had they managed to keep in the same shifts for 4 years? Well, the paid guys could submit “*Stay Within Current Hours*” applications every year before the shift shakeup, and as long as you weren’t actively deteriorating in performance, you would generally get it approved. Surprisingly, despite the on-hours gaming, Alan and Ash *increased* in performance for the time that they were working a co-opted shift, and the Chief guys took notice. Which meant, pretty much *guaranteed* shift-stay applications. Win-win for all.

Alan coughed, unvoluntarily breaking himself out from the good memories. Dammit, couldn’t this cold let him have *anything* nice?

Unfortunately, a cold was no excuse to have the productivity of a sack of potatoes today, at least in his mind. In response, Alan had mentally shrugged his affliction off and gotten to work. Those supplies weren’t gonna (properly) offload themselves without their operator there, after all.  
So, after finishing up breakfast and walking out of the cafe through some long hallways, he went up his little elevator and *physically* got to work.

So there he was, sitting in his booth, coughing up a storm, and counting the minutes until he could take another tylenol (everybody still called those pills by that name, even if the original company \[along with most\] hadn’t existed for decades).

Alan’s glass booth sat over the whole of shipping dock S2. With the dock mostly automated, all that he was paid to do was to make sure that nothing interrupted the bots’ work, and un-fuck the system if something ever did, via his own set of drones. It was pretty boring most of the time, but one thing that Alan had learned in 4 years he had worked here was that, if it was about medical histories, work, or coworkers’ personalities, boring was good. Very, ***very good***.

As he scanned the bay while sipping his coffee, he happened to spot a drone smooshing it’s face into the wall. Well, the robot equivalent of it, at least. It was flying up against the far left wall of the bay, pushing against the thick metal pilad with the same effectiveness of an ant trying to push someone’s shoe out of the way. Upon seeing this, Alan mentally shrugged and moved his hand towards the console in front of him with a motion reminiscent of a forklift running low on hydraulic fluid.

Once his hand reached it’s destination, Alan pulled his chair closer, and got to work de-smooshing the robot. He pulled up the bot’s info-panel on the screen, and it immediately caught his gaze with a warning. It was something about needing to recalibrate the roomba map, a common problem with older models.  
“Yeah, ‘roomba map’ is *my* official term, sue me.” Alan mentally argued to himself out loud, chuckling at the thought along the way. The technical term was “something something Maneuvering Memory,” which wasn’t much better when you couldn’t remember what the full term was.

He let out another round of hard, wheezy coughing as he opened up some menus on the screen before him. All that he had to do was re-download the roomba map from another bot to fix the other not’s issue, but this cold was just complicating everything unnecessarily. After a few seconds of additional menu-navigating, a progress bar flashed onscreen for a half-second, before Alan looked over to the malfunctioning bot. The moment he did, the bot’s thrusters righted themselves, and the offending hardware began to saunter back over to it’s original route. And *that* just about constituted the most exciting regular part of his job.

He coughed again, doubling over this time, and began emitting a sound reminiscent of a penguin call mixed with an out-of-tune century-old harmonica, layered on top of a violin played with a bow made from human hair. He kept coughing for another few seconds, almost tripping over himself, before finally righting his head.

He took a breather for a second, trying to get some oxygen back in his lungs.

Out of nowhere, the door to Alan’s booth hissed open, scaring the shit out of him in the process.

”\[Hello? \[Human\], are you okay?\]”

Oh, **great**.

”Hey there… yeah, I’m good.”

”\[I heard some pretty bad coughing, are you *sure* you’re alright?\]”

Alan looked up towards the doorway, catching the eye of the Dorarizin standing in it. He didn’t know this guy personally, but he seemed familiar enough.

”Yeah, it’s just a cold. I still need to work today, anyways. The dock don’t stop *just* for me. By the way, how the hell did you hear coughing from my booth? The damn thing’s, like, *7 meters away* from the hallway, and most of *that’s* pure steel.”

”\[I guess it was loud enough to penetrate, which doesn’t make your \[cold\] sound any better. Do you need a blanket? Or maybe a heatpad?\]”

Alan rolled his eyes slightly at that.

”Oh, no, I’m not *actually* cold. The name’s sort of an oxymoron, anyways, considering I actually have a slight fever right now. It just means “minor upper respiratory infection.” It’s nothing major, though.”

“\[I… okay, then. If you say so…\]”

With that, the Dorarizin walked off, still looking slightly disconcerted from Alan’s less-than-good looking appearance. Alan swiveled around in his chair, brushing off the dog’s concerns from his mind, only to find that another one of the drones was face-smooshing again.  
”…goddamn it…”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***\*Four hours later…\****

The door hissed open, and Alan turned his head from a video about the establishment of the Zephyr Stations themselves.  
There he was.

”Sup, big man? \*cough, **COUGH\***” Alan managed to get out, before his cold acted up on him again.

”\[Alan? You don’t sound the best.\]”

”Just a cold, don’t worry about it. Now- \*cough, *cough*, **cooouuughh**\*”

Ash cocked his head in concern, as he slithered over to his spot beside Alan.

“\[Shit, dude. You sure?\]”

Alan raised his hand, as he resettled himself. “Yeah, just… just give me a sec.”

With that, the coughing fit seemed to subside. Ash leaned back from Alan to give him some space, as they both faced back over to the drone consoles.

”\[I’ll let it slide for now, but the minute that *that* gets worse, I’m personally wrapping you up and taking you down to the infirmary. You have a *habit* of brushing this kind of shit off and making it worse, dude; it’s gonna get you *killed* at some point.\]”

”*Fine.* But for the record, you guys worry about humans *way* too much for your own good.”

They both sat in silence for a bit, only interrupted by Alan clearing his throat.

”So about that Karnak chick from yes-“  
”\[**NO, NO,** ***NO***. We do NOT TALK ABOU-\]**“**  
”So was that a *yes*, then?”  
**”\[…fuck you!**\]” Ash retorted, as the two promptly got back to their bullshittery.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***\*An hour later…\****

”\[And so, that’s why they always carry the spare *wheeled* drones; it’s to make sure that they can reach through and clear the disturbances without needing **ungodly** amounts of power!\]”

”Huh! So *that’s* what the lower bay’s for, then?”

”\[Ex*actly*. That’s for the *wheeled* drone storage.\]”  
”Ahhh.”

The two had gone on *quite* the tangent over the past hour, uninterrupted by any more drone problems. Alan‘s cough *had* resurfaced a few times when he laughed, but overall it hadn’t been too bad.

“\[Aight, I’m going for lunch. Whatcha want?\]”

”Oh, I can just come alo- \***cough, cough**\*”

”\[Yeahhh… just stay put for me, okay? You want a sandwich or something, or…?\]”

“…I could do with some good-ole’ chicken noodle soup, if that’s alright with you.”

”\[Heh, goin’ with the old remedy, eh? Sure, just a minute.\]”  
And with that, Ash slithered out and closed the door, leaving Alan to watch over the yard.

‘Now, what to do? Watch the incoming ships? …Sure.’ Alan thought to himself, as he closed out the documentary that had been on-pause for the last hour.

He sat there for a few minutes, watching through the massive bay windows as the familiar white dot approached…

Wait, was it supposed to be *orange*?  
His console suddenly beeped, as a notification for a radio hail came up. He quickly reached over, opening the channel, as a microphone shot up from a hidden compartment in the desk.

“MAYDAY, MAYDAY! THIS IS THE U.S.S HACHENAN, REQUESTING IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY DOCKING PROCEDURES.”

Alan cleared his throat, as he quickly realized the situation.

”This is Zephyr 12, you are being granted emergency access, what’s your status?”

”I HIT A PATCH OF SPACE JUNK AS I CAME OUT OF SKIP, MESSED ME UP *BAD*. HULL INTEGRITY’S 17%, ENGINES ARE SHOT, SO IS LIFE SUPPORT.”

”Copy that, you are cleared for dock at S2, do you have any means of slowing your trajectory?”

”CURRENTLY FIRING WHAT RETROROCKETS I CAN. NOT GONNA BE A PRETTY LANDING, THOUGH.”

Alan quickly moved to open the outer airlock doors, which would let the ship pass into the pressurization tunnel. Unfortunately, at their speed, he wouldn’t have time to fully pressurize said tunnel before he would have to open the gates to let them through, leading to one hell of a gust when he opened the inner doors.  
’Well, some wind is well worth somebody’s life.’ Alan thought, as sensors told him that the ship had entered the outer doors. With that in mind, Alan *slammed* the button to close the doors, as well as the pressurization button once they were shut.

”Get ready, mayday!”

At the last second, Alan hit the button to open the inner doors. *Immediately* he felt his ears pop, as he heard the *earth-shattering* ***roar*** of the bay’s air supply being sucked through that gate. Within a second of opening the door, the ship’s nose peeked through, before the rest of it careened through the doors. Then, with an absolutely **thunderous** **crash**, the thing *embedded* itself into the wall, the cries of screaming metal drowning out Alan’s own thoughts.

And just like that, it was over.

Alan didn’t exactly know what to think, as his body had already broken into a dead sprint to the bay stairs. Within moments, he was down on the bay floor, rushing over to the wreck with every last mite of strength in his legs that he could muster.

# ”I’M COMIN’, MAYDAY!”

As Alan approached the giant, flaming metal carcass, he noticed that the pilot’s cabin had been **crushed in**. In response, he quickly climbed up the jagged metal siding, hopping up waved and folded metal sheets like it was a rock climbing course. Once on top, he looked inside.

”MAYDAY! ARE YOU OKAY?”

No answer.  
Unfortunately, he knew that the glass, even if shattered, would be too strong for him to crack through. So, he decided to hop back down, and grab something heavy from by the ship to help him crack it. Once down, he sprinted over to the scattered cargo and began looking around.

He finally found what he was looking for after a solid minute of searching, and tried picking the heavy metal box up. Unfortunately, he found that this box in particular had something inside that felt like it was full of lead. He tried with everything that he had, but Alan could not get it to **budge**.

“\[**ALAN! GET BACK!\]**”

He whipped his head around to face the noise, but felt something wrap around him before he could fully turn. As his face became covered, he was pulled to the ground and he felt himself start to *move*. Within moments, he was easily 50 feet away from where he had been.

And with that, the engines grounded to a halt before **exploding** into a *massive* fireball.

As the explosion passed, he felt the coils stop moving, before unwrapping from around him. Alan looked up as they did, to a familiar sight.

”Ash?“

He looked back over towards the ship, which was now being surrounded by fire crews and all other sorts of EMS guys, and watched as they pulled a pilot’s body out from the (thankfully) un-furtherly-damaged cockpit. The ship had been scorched by the explosion, but most of the damage was superficial and mainly consisted of soot marks.

”\[Alan.\]”

Alan snapped his attention back over to Ash, who had quite the look on his face.  
‘Oh god, here comes the reaming out from my friend.’ He thought.

Instead, Ash grabbed his friend and pulled him into a full-body defensive hug, his voice wavery and soft.

”\[If there ever is a next time that this happens, please, please, ***please*** don’t do anything like that ever again, man.\]”

Alan stood there for a solid minute, stunned. He considered Ash a good friend, but he… never really anticipated the guy to ever just do the snake equivalent of *cry* over him.

”…Ash? You okay, buddy?”

”\[…as long as you are, dude. As long as you are.\]”

“Man…  
…Do we fuck now, or-“  
**”\[NO, NO,** ***NO***. **WE DO** ***NOT*** **DO THAT. WE DO** ***NOT DO THAT***.\]”  
”Well, you *were* going pretty hard on the ‘I can’t live without you’ spee-“  
“**\[YOU KNOW** ***DAMN WELL*** **NEITHER OF US ARE GAY, DUMBASS!\]”**  
The two quickly began laughing their asses off, easing the tension of the situation.

Ash let go of his friend, and the two walked back off to the cafe; Alan coughing like hell, Ash too grateful to care. Along the way, Ash explained why he had cared about Alan to the point of crying:  
Ash had another warmcuddle friend a while back.

“\[He was my first friend on the station, the guy who showed me how to do my job. It was about 30 years back, and he was… well, I’ll just say that he set the new bar for my future friends.\]”

”…do I want to ask what happened?”

Alan hadn’t realized it for a second, but they had stopped walking when the topic came up.

”\[Well, no use dwelling on it now, I guess.  
He… he was in an accident. In the loading bay, got crushed by some cargo that had spilled while he was trying to help out somebody else who was trapped. I made it over in time to see him, but he… he was gone. Most of him was just… *just…*\]”

”Shhh… it’s alright. You don’t have to relive it if you don’t want to.”

”\[Mush…\]”

”It’s alright, it’s alright. C’mere, bud.”

And with that, Alan threw his arms around his friend and held him.

“\[I don’t want to lose another one like him, man. I can’t lose another one. I can’t lose *you*.\]” Ash responded, as he slightly coiled around Alan to reciprocate his hug.

“Don’t worry, bud. I’ll be around when you need me.”

And for a little while, all was good.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***\*The next day…\****

Alan awoke to his lungs feeling like they were made of corn syrup, and his throat on **fire**. Yeah, that’s a rather *sudden* way to put it, but he barely could breathe as he tried to roll out of bed, and flopped to the floor. He tried to yell for help, but he could barely make out a whimper as his lungs *refused* to hold air. As his eyes darted around in absolute panic, he frantically began to swat at his translator implant in his neck, which was supposed to activate an emergency alert along with a geolocator.

As he began to pass out from lack of oxygen, his last thought was about the hug that he and Ash had shared back in that hallway.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

…

^(\*beep\*)

\*beep\*

\*beep\*

\*beep\*

**\*beep\***

‘Where am I…?’

Alan’a mind awoke, and began to stir.

What had happened?

‘Metal… fire… scream… cold… sandwich… wait, sandwich?’

His eyes slowly blinked open to a white, plain view. No, wait… a ceiling. That beep was… a *heart rate monitor*?

He tried to sit up, but quickly felt a hand stopping him from rising.

”Easy, buddy. Don’t need you puking up any more mucus.”

He finally realized what his surroundings were, as he took in what he was seeing. A *hospital*.

”What… what happened?” Alan spoke, his voice hard and raspy.

”Well, turns out that ignoring a cold until it turns into pneumonia is an easy way to get yourself into the hospital.”

As Alan’s world slowly came back into focus, the doctor began to explain that his cold, plus the stress of the crash in the bay, had opened up his lungs to become infected by a strain of pneumonia that had only recently evolved, and that basically suffocated patients by causing overproduction of mucus (a-la acute cystic fibrosis). He was lucky to have been able to alert the medical staff with the emergency commbead feature, but he was basically going to be stationary for a while as a result of the pneumonia damaging his lungs to a degree that he wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen otherwise.

”So, what’s the full recovery time?”

”About 3 weeks, and you basically won’t be able to do anything outside of move around in a small room, or else you risk permanently damaging your lungs. You have to *rest*, okay? And I mean it, *especially* with your track record when it comes to taking a *break*when you need to.”

With that, the doc walked off, leaving Alan to his thoughts.

A few minutes later, he heard a familiar voice coming down the hallway, and Ash’s head peeked over from around the curtain.

”\[Hey, dude. Not to say I told you so, but…\]”  
”Heh, where’s that ‘I can’t lose you’ attitude now?” Alan rasped out, his voice sounding like one of those people from decades ago called “smokers.”

”\[Well, I managed to convince the doc to let you out of the hospital.\]”  
”*No fucken’ way.* How?!”  
Ash immediately took on the Jornissian look for “smug,” and Alan quickly regretted asking.

”\[Well, I think that I may be able to *enforce* his ‘rest‘ rule for you, don’t you think?\]”  
”Ash, you son of a…“

Alan paused, realizing that Ash was about to spoil him with snuggles beyond his wildest dreams.  
“…I can’t even be mad, dude. Well played.”

A few hours later, and Alan was all coiled up, being taken back over to Ash’s room. The funniest part of the trip, though, was that as Alan passed through the halls, he managed to catch a glimpse of Reman staring at him, almost a little jealous.  
Once they arrived, Ash set him down in the middle of the faux-sand pit memory foam bed, and pulled out some stuff that had been stashed between a dresser and the wall. As he came back, Alan could see that it consisted of some sort of monitor rig, some assorted gaming tech, and most importantly, a few giant blankets &amp; a few pillows. He then proceeded to spend a solid 15 minutes setting up the monitors making sure that they were close enough and at the perfect angle for Alan to look up at them while laying still.

“Not to be rude, but I’m *slightly* concerned at how prepared you were to spend multiple days on-break snuggling with a human.”

”\[Well, I had a whole day to plan out everything, and I already had most of the stuff, so it wasn’t *too* hard to get the monitor stands…  
…I *may* have an issue.\]”

“Ah, screw that. It’ll at least make the next few weeks much more bearable, just sitting around like a log.”

As Alan said that, Ash finished setting up the monitors, and moved to wrap Alan back up again. He made sure to tuck his friend in one of the heavy blankets first, though, and *then* began to coil him up. Alan flinched as the his body suddenly became off-balance, but he quickly regained composure as Ash’s coils wrapped around him more evenly. Within a minute, Alan was completely enveloped, with only his arms and face being uncovered from his friend’s grip, as Ash laid down a second blanket on top for the both of them. As Alan made sure to make himself as absolutely comfortable as possible, Ash adjusted as necessary, and soon Alan was locked in the *coziest* death-grip that anybody had ever experienced, or at least he felt like it.

“Jesus Christ, I already want to take a nap and it’s only… what, 1:28? \*yawn\*”

”\[I’ll take that as a compliment! Go ahead, bud; you’ve got a whole 3 weeks before you can get back up and running, savor it.\]”

”…will do. Night, Ash. Keep the nukes away for me, will ya, big guy? Heh.”

”\[Don’t think they stand a *chance* against **me**. Night, Alan.\]”

And with that, Alan drifted off, ready to get in a year’s worth of snuggles in 3 days. And he had 3 *weeks* of recovery time.

’Well, that’s *one* way to have a memorable vacation.’ He thought, as he slipped his arms under the coils and let his head sink into his pillows; both the down pillows, *and* his friend pillow."
pbqr8z,0,2021-08-25,Potential Opportunities,Icy-Run2694,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pbqr8z/potential_opportunities/," 

Hello guys, I just wanted to ask a quick career based question. I have a few potential offers coming my way and I wanted to be able to make my best decision possible.

Opportunity A.) Soc Analyst- Citibank. Location: NYC (would have to relocate). Not sure how much the offer would be or what's competitive for the area so maybe you guys can help me with this, but I would have to also go into the office. The opportunity is solid, have a lot of cool projects to work on and as a part time student it covers some tuition (about $8,000 out of my remaining $15,000).

Opportunity B.) VMware University Propel Program. Rotational program as intern to full time offer. You get to choose 2 teams of your choice. First 6 months you work for 1 team, other 6 months you work for other team, then you have the freedom to choose whichever team you want to join. Reloc to Palo Alto, Boston, or ATL. Offer is usually very high for new grad- but not sure what to expect from this either.

Opportunity C.) Application Security analyst. Series-D funded startup company of 100-200 people (unicorn). Fully remote, pay is 80k a year so presumably lower than the other two but balances out because of remote. Benefits standard. Technologies are pretty standard... nothing fancy- I would definitely have a learning curve here, and my experience with startup culture is a bit rough but I have only ever worked for one.

If you were in my shoes, how would you rank these choices? really in a toss up about what to do here. I am stoked to get three potential opportunities, and if there are any questions I can answer in addition that may help you answer this, ask away."

His degree requires this internship for graduation. We are working through HR to get everything approved.

I am here to ask for some advice on ideas on how to train him. Some coworkers want to give him ""bitch"" work (all the shitty tasks that no one wants to do like organise the supply closests). One the difficult things is that our organisation requires that he have a Sec+ certificate to be able to have admin privileges and as far as I know, they would not be willing to make an exception. Hopefully we can get him through a class and get him certified in that time. 

Anyway, does anyone have ideas on other IT related things that we can have him do? We do not manage the network at our place, that is managed by someone else. We handle tier 1/tier 2 support for the different offices we have. Anything on AD requires admin privileges same as installing software or changing settings on computers. He might be able to configure printers before they are on the network, image computers if we stage them in AD first, and he might be able to help with getting new employees set up. 

Thank you to anyone that can think of some other things he would be able to do! Looking forward to the suggestions."

So in a month I’ll finish my internship in cultural field. For this internship, I moved to a new city, made it my home.

Unfortunately the company won’t hire me, so I’ve started to look for something else in the same field but I’m struggling. Since the beginning of the internship, my parents said I would move back with them at the end of the internship, despise the fact I never said I wanted to, quite the opposite actually. I know I’m lucky and super privilege to be able to live my parents and to use this time to find a job, but I’d like to stay independent. We get along well but I did the boomerang a few times before and my mental health suffered from it. I’m just starting to get well mentally and physically, and I feel like I’m going to lose it if I move back to m parents house. I’m scare about it, about feeling useless, not to be able to breath and to exist, to be like a doll you put in a corner and you can look at.

I’m trying to believe that I could have a temporary job and keep job hunting in the same time, but I have issues believing in myself. Also, because my parents keep acting like I’m moving back in a month, no matter what I say, I’m not sure they think I can manage to have a job and do job hunting. I’m starting to think I should give up and do as they say. Which means I could stay for months and months before finding a job. I couldn’t cook my own dinners or have friends at home.

My dad has mental issues as well, sometimes it would really weigh on my life with my parents. Last year I thought he was about to cancel Christmas because he didn’t feel like celebrating it. I cried so much about it. I was with my parents two weeks ago and explained that I was thinking about finding a part time job to spend more time job hunting and writing, which is my dream career, my dad just said « what? You won’t live with daddy and mummy? » which made me feel guilty about my desire of being independent.

I’m afraid of conflict so I’m not even sure I could stand for my independence and try my writing plan. Despite talking about it, being approached by a publisher and winning twice a short story contest when I was a teenager, they see it as a hobby. And I wish I could be confient about this but I’m really struggling."

I'm here to get advice. Please help me out.

So I'm basically at the beginning of my third year, and starting my second try of internship. I dropped out at my first try, due to mental burden and COVID which allowed me only to work from home. 

I kinda came to the idea that programming is not really something for me... despite finishing all exams (excluding one) positively.

Well... I know you can do so much more with the degree. Especially CS. It's easy to hop into alternatives. This is my plan really.

But I have to go through 2 years, with 2 internships, other tasks and so much more. I don't know if I can handle this. 

Starting over for a new degree is not a solid solution. I would only be able to start over next year, and this means I'll be losing 2 years of my life!

So... How was your first internship like? Which task did you get? I have a feeling that I have one that's too complicated!

I just graduated with my B.S. in May. Prior to that I had been working as an intern for approximately 1.5 years in a local company. Was headhunted and received an offer from my current company at $60k, 1 week vacation, 80/20 health care, 401k 3% match, good dental and vision. They wanted me to start part time immediately so I accepted. I’ve been working full time there since May. 

There are both good and bad things about this job. Firstly, my hours are lenient. I can come in when I want with reason, as long as I do 40 hrs a week. I’m basically my own manager with the exception of reporting to my operations manager. I have plenty of interesting projects and I appreciate the ability to work on what I want when I want with deadlines for major research in mind. Company is apart of a group of sister companies, and access to funds I need for projects is very easy to come by. Unfortunately there’s always negatives. The work culture is a bit toxic. Too much political discuss, lack of respect for scientific process … not my cup of tea. They don’t pay their operators nearly enough so that leads to disinterest in performance from them. Management doesn’t really communicate properly and this has led  to immense tension between a coworker of mine and a supervisor, placing me in the middle of it to essentially babysit. Operators don’t really respect my coworker’s attempts to improve the process, but I’ve been steadily working on building up a good relationship to improve this. Said coworker is pregnant and due in December. I’m effectively going to be taking on her responsibilities while she is gone, which has been cutting into my R&amp;D time. I am the youngest individual there so sometimes I get flack for my age, but I mostly ignore the insecurities of others. 

Out of the blue, I was headhunted again. A competitor wanted me. Offered me $6k increase, which I negotiated to $15k - putting me in at $75k. Benefits include 2 weeks vacation, 5 sick days, 5 personal days. 75/25 health insurance, okay dental and decent vision. Biggest difference comes in with culture. There is more intellectual support. Instead of being alone, I’d have PhDs to bounce ideas off of. This could be good or bad, and I can’t be sure that the work place isn’t just as toxic. Obvious respect for scientific process. Company is owned by a Japanese parent company, so there would seemingly be good monetary support for projects. They seemed very eager to hire me. The role would eventually place me in a management position (6-12 months out). 

Let my company know I’d received an offer. A few days later we had a meeting with the president to discuss. I was not expecting a counteroffer. Essentially, I was told they want me to stay. They are willing to offer a $10k bonus once I finish 20 prototypes, and a $10k bonus once I get my prototypes to production. After this, they’d be evaluating my salary for a raise and profit sharing. 

I told them I’d need 24 hours to consider. Now I’m left confused and wondering if I should stick it out or jump ship. I’m not sure how much I trust their word now that they are aware I would be willing to leave."

So I’ve been applying to new jobs over the past week or two, and quiet a few places have gotten back to me. So far it seems like all the positions require relocation (whether these are mid sized or FAANG or other big companies). When I’m asked if I’m okay with this, I say that I’d be willing to move, but tbh…I’m not sure if I actually would be when I actually sit down and think about it. 

All my friends and family are where I currently live, and with the pandemic still seeming far from over idk how easy it would be for me to actually meet new people and make new connections if I do move to a totally new city. Having those types of personal connections is *incredibly* important to me. But I’ve always wanted to spend a bit of time in a different city as well while I still had no “real commitments” (aka a family). 

Then again, I feel like it would likely be a while still until things are totally “back to normal”, so in a sense idk what the benefit would be for me to go to a new place at the moment when it feels like I wouldn’t be able to do much anyway. I feel like I would mostly just be stuck in that new city, except this time I wouldn’t have any loved ones around. 

I think I’m also just…..scared. I’ve never lived in a different state before. My first and only job out of college is only ten minutes away from my parents’. Any internships I had in college were super close to my house too. I also went to an in-state public university. I’ve been living in my current state since I was 4, so it’s literally all I’ve ever known.

I think ideally I’d stay remote, but have the option to move in-office next year or by the end of the this year, rather than doing it all as soon as I get an offer (and reading about extremely short offer deadlines on this sub scare me!). Anyways, how do I account for all this while job searching? Should I only apply to remote positions? Or should I try to negotiate something like this in the case that I do get an offer?

Things that were briefly touched on last semester (binary, hexadecimals, how compilers work) are now expected to be fully comfortable with and understand all of the ins and outs about. Not to mention (seemingly) new thing like assemblers, linkers work, machine assembly, etc. are as well. In lectures I feel like I'm doing good to understand every third word that comes out of the professor's mouth, let alone comprehend it all. Is there unwritten rules of things I should be attempting to do in my time outside of lectures? I know that internships and projects are a big thing, but having just completed the basics of C++ I don't know if I'd even qualify.

I know ""imposter syndrome"" is a thing, but is it really this common? I'm willing to do whatever I need to in order to keep up with and understand the CS material, but I haven't a clue where to look or what I should even be looking for. Is anyone else in a similar situation or have any advice on what I should do in this situation?"

I am currently a college junior who recently decided that quant was something I want to pursue.  I am reaching out because I want to know what is the best things to focus on to try and secure a junior internship in the quant field?  I only recently decided to go this route and therefore feel rather far behind especially because my school isn’t quant focused, rather it’s financials tend to be more regular business sided.  I am currently working through investment science (David luenberger) and the usual quant interview questions.  To maximize my chances, should I even try to understand the underlying market structures and math at this point for a internship, or just focus on statistical problem solving improvement.  Moreover give my standings below is it even a possibility to get a quality quant internship.  I am aware the applications should start around now, but are there later opportunities as well (I know some financial areas already went through their recruitment cycle)?  Lastly, if I fail to get an internship for my junior is that a killer for future chances of entering the industry?

My standing

My general experience is I attend top 20 university and am study chemical engineering.  I have a decent gpa (3.85).  As for more specifics, I have a decent amount of experience doing modeling research in python for a lab.  I have done a little trading etc, but not enough to really say anything on.  Class wise I have some applicable courses such as numerical statics and methods, machine learning, game theory, but have not yet had a chance to fill out more quant specific courses.

Thanks for any and all help, I really appreciate it."

Which cert should I start with?",RealBigMeech103,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/pc8uux/i_earned_my_bachelors_degree_in_it_left_the_field/,"I graduated with my Bachelor’s of Business Administration in 2017 with a major in Management Information Systems and concentrations in Telecommunications/Networking and Business Analysis. At the time, I wanted to pursue cybersecurity and went the IT Audit route. I had done two IT Audit internships, one with a Big 4 firm and one with a Big 3 auto company before becoming an IT Controls Analyst with a major tax software company. After 6 months of stress and depression in controls, I made the decision to leave IT all together and pursue another passion. 

One other significant reason was feeling imposter syndrome from being slow to catch onto concepts and lacking the technical skills to pivot to another area of IT. I can admit that I didn’t focus on polishing my skills or advancing my knowledge area outside of the classroom.

4 years and a Master’s degree in a completely different field later, I’ve done enough research and soul-searching to conclude that I’m ready for a return to IT. I’ve become intrigued in network engineering and cloud. 

In all honesty, since I have my degree but only two internships and 6 months of IT work experience, is it the best option for me to start at the bottom of help desk, get the A+ Network+ Security+ trifecta and work my way up? 

Should I include my brief past work history in applications? 

Should I apply for help desk and IT technician jobs anyways even without having a cert?

What would be the best or most acceptable way to explain my 4 gap years away from IT in a job interview?"

Now that school is back in session, I have been debating on whether I should go straight to graduate school for an MBA or look for full time jobs this fall semester.

Going to graduate school sounds appealing to me for a few reasons:

\- Help with my career and I would like to get into management

\- Finances are not a problem

However, I have been in touch with a recruiter from Apple and have have seriously always wanted to work there since I was in high school. If I decide to go to graduate school right after undergrad, I will need to let the recruiter know ASAP so that they can transfer me over to university recruiting.

I am currently an intern at a corporate company working in an industry that will be changing soon and I am extremely excited to be a part of this. The interview process was difficult. I had to go through 3 interviews before I received an offer. I later learned that my supervisor was looking for someone qualified for this position. I felt a slight bit of pressure knowing this at first but went along with different tasks that I was given… 3 months later my internship was extended for the remainder of this year while I finish my school semester, but with no certainty that I would be offered a full time position upon graduation. Anyway.. what I am getting at here is that I have felt extremely stressed and anxious because I do not know if I am doing a good job or not. I am currently working on a particular task that includes data analysis and everytime I meet with my supervisor I get a lot of constructive criticism. However, I always feel as if though I never produce the work that my supervisor is looking for. I can see it in my supervisors body language that she is stressed with work and sometimes I feel as though she shares the stress with me. Meaning I get the short end of the stick. She is not approachable so I can’t really have this talk with her. I feel as if though maybe I am not doing a good job and don’t really belong here. I think that I’m constantly trying to prove myself. Anyway.. has anyone ever been in this position of feeling like they aren’t doing a good job or feel maybe incompetent for the job? My other intern peer is better at articulating his research and I find myself struggling a lot. I know that I am responsible for how I feel but I don’t know how to over look this. I can’t tell if my supervisor likes the work that I’m doing or if she’s disappointed, annoyed etc..at one point I considered quitting because I just felt like maybe I’m not fit for this job but then thought to myself but why would they offer you an extension for the internship? My supervisor has never told me that I am doing a good job or the reason why an extension was offered. She is a very reserved, analytical, rough kind of person. So when I have my weekly meetings with her I always walk away feeling like “man I suck at what I’m doing” I want to not take things so personal and improve but I always think too much about things that were said or how she reacted to an idea I had or how dumb I must have sounded when I couldn’t articulate a thought or idea."
pcdyx7,13,2021-08-26,I'm worried that I will be abusive to my future child as my parents are to me and my siblings,[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/pcdyx7/im_worried_that_i_will_be_abusive_to_my_future/,"Recently have been worried that I'm becoming more and more like my parents and how abusive they are because of how I act when I'm alone(listening to music that makes me feel better) and want to spend time alone. So I recently just started college and of course my parents are trying to control my life by telling me how I need to get a job even though I want to have a normal college experience by joining clubs and sports teams in my college.  


My dad then goes on to say how I need to earn money and how all college students have a job, and how I'm useless if I don't provide any money. This is because I worked a couple times in the past and they took all my money and they were nice to me when I worked and had money going into my joint account with my mother. Then after my internship ended they treated me like how they always would. My parents always favored my brother who was ""better"" than me even though he never had a job or an internship or provided money for them and because he was smarter and more hardworking.

My APs also say how I need to stop playing video games even though I don't since I don't even have a gaming system and my Mac can't handle it. They honestly don't even care about how I feel and continue to abuse me mentally and emotionally by comparing me to other kids and how they give their money to their parents when they work. I plan on getting a job and putting the money into my own bank account so that I can move out when I graduate college and rent an apartment, even though the only bank account I have is with my mother which I know they will take all the money from my account like they did in the past.   


My APs won't even let me open my own bank account and claims that it's for my FAFSA even though I know that they said the same thing about my red envelope and birthday money that I received and claims that I spent it when I didn't even touch it the day after I gave them the money. Then they say how I owe them for living in their house and for raising me.

Right now I'm just worried that I would end up just like my APs in the future even though I'm willing to try to get a job and participate in school events to have a normal college experience, so that I can get a good job later on in the future my children would be able to have a good childhood and not suffer the same abuse I went through. But I'm worried that the cycle of abuse would repeat and I won't be able to break it."

I have got some acceptance letters, some rejection letters, and am waiting on some more. I can’t believe that this is so real. I’m proud because I finally am doing it! Anyways, I’m currently 25 and will be 26 when I start college. I originally started at a Community College after high school. However, life happened...I lost my father unexpectedly (due to malpractice), went to the hospital (had blacked out at my home due to stress), lost my grandfather, and etc...this for sure effected my mental health and overall performance in school. I took a summer or 2 off but that’s it. I finally was better and went back to performing well.

During college I was either working or interning. I did 2 internships doing IT for the state and I am forever grateful for my experience. I also interned at a few marketing places and one of my bosses wrote me a letter of recommendation that made my heart so happy. Ever since I healed and changed my mindset I went back to my original academic self. This means I made nothing less than an A recently. I also had access to a program where you interned for NASA and also took a electrical/circuits classes.

I’m applying to engineering school and while I’m excited I’m super nervous. While I am sad that I didn’t graduate on time I am at the same time realizing that if certain things didn’t happen then I wouldn’t meet certain close friends or even have access to certain internships. I feel weird and am wondering if I’m too old to even be going back to college.

I feel like let’s say I wanted to join a sorority (probably won’t) I would get highly discriminated because of my age. It’s also weird since everyone would be younger to be (18-23 about). This has first hand happened to me recently. I tried to join an organization and even though I was a student they rejected me and said that “it’s more so for college aged students. Sorry!” I felt insulted but understood.

I also am not sure what the new professor will think or if I’ll adjust well. I’m not finishing degree for my family or anything. I’m doing it for myself! It’s something that I’ve always wanted to do. I also want to genuinely learn so that I can grow both as a person as well as career wise. I’m also nervous about the environmental change. By the time I graduate college I’ll be about 27/28 years old. I am kind of depressed that it’s taken me this long. I wonder if employers will even want to hire me because of how long it’s taken. Any recommendations? Also, am I too old to even continue college? Will employers even want to employ me? Is it even worth it? Should I just focus on getting jobs? Thanks!"

I'll be finished in 2 years and I will be around 30 by then. I'm doing the 5 semester Honours CS program at UWindsor, which doesn't allow for coop. I'm hoping to get an internship in the summer of 2022, but I am just reading now that most companies only accept applications. 

How do you land an interview as a freshman? I've been coding for fun for only around 6 months now but I've been working full time during this period and I can't imagine any of my would look impressive to a hiring manager. I was thinking once CS becomes my main focus in September I could start really doubling down on making something impressive by spring, but I can't imagine I'll be anywhere near what recruiters are looking for within just my first semester. I am fairly decent at working on coding puzzles like leetcode, but I have no idea how to actually implement my solutions in a business setting.

Should I be looking into hackathons? What sort of projects should I be making that I could show to recruiters? Is it at all possible to get hired based purely on good marks from mid first semester??? I have been working in a completely unrelated education role for the majority of my life, so should I just be giving up on an internship so early?"

Definitely more to do outside of class, but nothing real foreign. I’m working on just my gen-eds and getting my associates before I move on and decide what I want a degree in. 

When it comes to work, the longest I’ve ever worked at a job was for 2.5 months earlier this year at dominos as a driver (worked as a host for a month during my sophomore year as well). It was good money, but I ended up quitting because they worked me so much that I damn near didn’t graduate high school. 

The only reason I’ve been thinking about working is because of my family. I have the privilege of staying at home for college and for 97% of my life I’ve never worked. My older sister on the other hand is the stark opposite. This chick has balanced school, work, an internship, helping run her sorority, and social life ever since her junior year of HS, to the point even my parents are confused how she’s still sane.

Being the family disappointment, I feel like I have almost an obligation to get a job and stop mooching (my parents would never admit it, but I feel like I mooch). with my past record in academics, I’m afraid that if I do then I’m gonna loose focus on school because of how fucking demanding jobs have become since the start of covid.

You see, if I had the option (which I technically do, even if I feel obligated) I’d rather not work a job. Now that I’m in college, I want to pull my head out of my ass, and get serious about my education because my last year of high school was a real eye opener that I can’t just keep fucking around.

Between the shadow of my sister that I’ve had to live in fueling the obligation I feel, and knowing that jobs these days are gonna require more out of me that I know I can reliably put in, I’ve been caught in this weird purgatory of debating if I should work or not.

Is it bad that I’d rather just focus on school?

I am also the Captain of the Debate Team. Also have trained 250+ girls for MUNs. Have been working for two NGOs since past two years. Did 2 internships over the summer, did a bootcamp program with Huron University, Canada and also did two covid relief fundraisers.

I am good at many things, but don’t feel I’m great enough at anything to be paid for it. I’m turning 30, have ADHD and still don’t have a career- I’ve worked part-time for the past 5 years. What should I do?

——

Further info- I have done so many types of jobs, only a handful were interesting in any way. Most were desk jobs, retail, customer-service, sales. The ones I found interesting were working in a senator’s office as an intern, a temp job with a news agency, working at conventions, and an English teacher in Japan. 

I did a lot of career research and chose to learn coding, but learning it is frustrating me so much because it is taking such a long time. It’s so hard to motivate myself to study more than like a few hours per day. 

Despite actively studying, I am getting frustrated with not having a job (most of my friends have jobs and they are always wanting to do expensive things- I have to say no and I’m sick of it). So I started looking at them again, and even the ones that sound easy- example, writing- I don’t feel like I could really do them. I just don’t feel like I’m qualified for anything, and I feel like my resume looks so bad since it’s so all over the place, there’s no focus on any one thing. 

I want to work…I want to make money &amp; be independent… I want to feel like I have a value in society.

Does anyone have any advice for my situation?"

I was happy with my team, the company as a whole seemed to have a strong engineering culture, etc. However, I've recently been reading posts on here, teamblind and cscareerquestions, and man do other engineers not seem to have a positive outlook on this company. 

I also did two internships as a quant/dev in trading at a Canadian Investment Bank (Fixed Income, Options), and received an offer to join their quant rotational program for S&amp;T. Although I found that job more interesting, I ultimately turned it down for TC and since I thought FAANG will open more doors for me down the road. I'm seriously doubting my decision with Amazon after reading all the negative outlook on the company and how low the bar for hiring has gotten in the last year or so. I'm planning on re-recruiting, but man am I rusty on Leetcode. I'm unsure if I'll be able to secure a better offer, especially since I overloaded my final year with some extra research courses with some profs.

I guess this post is basically just a rant. I grinded Leetcode, worked hard on securing my internships and a full time offer, and just when I though I ""made it"" in some sense, I'm back to square one. Maybe even considering grad school. Fuck knows at this point."

Microsoft ATL is newly opening up and I was wondering if anyone here knows when their Summer 2022 SWE Internship recruitment will open. I saw that the application for Redmond, Washington has opened but could not find one for the Atlanta office yet. Or is it okay to apply for a different office and ask for a location change later on? 

I contacted recruiters from the specific office via LinkedIn but unfortunately have not heard back. My school's career advisor has also recently changed so I do not have many resources to consult. My fellow Yellow Jackets seemed unsure as well. 

Any advice, insights, or experience sharing would be appreciated! I am not trying to find a solid, definite answer here but was wondering if anyone's on the same boat or has some news to share. Thank you in advance!"

But this field is so huge, there is app development, web development and Machine Learning. I don't think I have time to master all of these.

Internships have already started and I have no idea what to do as I don't have enough experience and knowledge (still new to DSA, C++, OS). 

I'm thinking about trying for Google Summer of Code,( GSOC ) as I will need some time for learning the basics and getting some experience and GSOC is like 5 to 6 Months away.

I don't know how long will companies keep coming in College for Internship. So I will probably have to search for an Internship outside college.

But I have no idea in what fields to specialize in and apply for in GSOC.  I need someone to guide Me and give an overview of CS and which Languages, Skills, Framework is required for which type of Internship/Job.

Also should I learn Java? Or Do You guys recommend any language, framework that I must learn.

Also I'm cool with doing an Internship in VLSI/COA, Embedded Systems. But would prefer to do an Internship related to Python, Machine Learning."

I've also been working on a video game for 5 years and it has a small following. I'm currently working on my portfolio site + a small fullstack web app in case I want to go into webdev.

Any advice as to what I should be focusing on? Worth it to shoot for a winter/spring internship, or just keep working on projects relevant to positions I want to apply for?

They wanted me to use Redux, Webpack, babel etc. Kind of got hard after a certain point, i was skeptical as well, so i skipped it. Since then i started using Angellist.

Most of these companies are either not in linkedin or with 4 to 5 employees. For example, a company from Shangai accepted my resume, the company has 5 employees in linkedin, all of them private.

So my question is can they be trusted? How do you approch this? I would like to ask the help of people who have been through similar circumstances so that i dont get scammed or over worked."

It seems like this is how things work at 90% of places.  I guess I'm thankful that, here at least, I have the support of my boss when it comes to enforcing the use of defined processes.  But ... a few clarifications.  The below is not how the conversation went; it's more of an internal monologue.  After repeatedly stating the request was unreasonable and pointing her to the process, she eventually involved her boss.  I then had to involve my boss.  He 'decided' that we would have a meeting on Monday about how to proceed with the rollout and they'd have to postpone their Monday go-live.  I've posted a few other replies through the thread clarifying other stuff.*

* Don’t send me a request right before lunch on a Friday to have a new piece of software installed on the computers of 40 users, ready for Monday morning.  
* Don’t belittle me and my team, referring to us as ‘low level support team’ when we’re in fact a mix of 2nd and 3rd line support, responsible for computers, printers, mobile phones, operating system images and their updates, applications and their updates, anti-virus, exchange and email, Office365, file servers and permissions, and more.  1st line is over there on the other side of the room.  
* Don’t try to blame me for derailing a four-month long project on the final working day before go-live; you had four months to inform my team of your requirements and it’s your fault for informing me halfway through the final day.  
* Don’t try to pull rank on me with your fancy job title.  I’ve been doing this job for twice as long as you’ve been doing yours, in the department hierarchy I’m two rungs below the CIO to your three, and, while I’m not supposed to know this, I make considerably more than you do.  
* And don’t you dare try to bully my new intern, who has been working on the team for less than two months, into doing the installs for you while I’m on my lunch break, you inept blundering fuck.

We have a process that needs to be followed.  A security group needs to be created to automate the software deployment and distribute email notices for software updates and service outages.  This security group needs time to sync to our endpoint management tool and we need to create and test deployment packages linked to this security group.

We need to create ServiceNow workflows to allow users, managers, or your team to request the installation of the software on a user’s device.  This workflow, once running, is automated, by the way.  Once a request receives approval, the user is automatically added to the relevant security group and, if the user is online and connected to our network, the application will be pushed to their device within an hour.  Our team doesn’t need to do a thing.  Oh, you recieve requests for account creation via. email?  That’s fine.  We still need workflow created in ServiceNow because, if you want us to install it on a user’s computer after this initial rollout to 40 users, you’ll need to follow our process.

And I just noticed something.  Do you see this ticket you logged with my team three months ago to add an exception to the anti-virus to allow your program to run?  It was only ever requested for your team.  The application is still blocked for everyone else.  Even if we wanted to install the software on your 40 users’ PCs today, we can’t!


Why is it that, in every company I’ve ever worked for, project managers and applications teams fail to include operations in their roll-out plan.  The requests always seem to come in at the 11th hour and then they act all shocked and surprised when we say ‘no’.  Cries about ‘project deadline’ and ‘cost to the business’ and so on and so forth.  I’ve heard them all.  So many times.  Too many times.

If we’re responsible for the installation of the application, if we’re responsible for updates to the application, if we’re responsible for the design, administration, and support of the platform the application is to be deployed on, then we decide the process, we determine the timeframe.  We were stakeholders in your project, whether you acknowledged it in your plans or not.  And if you’d involved us in your discussions before today, we wouldn’t be having this argument today.

AAAARRRGGGHHH!!!

Sorry for the rant.  I’m meant to be packing for a hiking trip down in Tessin this weekend as well.  I think I'll go computer free this weekend."

However, during my school enrollment I completed two tax internships at two different local CPA firms, I do like tax but feel like it could pigeon-hole me. 

Now, my dilemma is this – two very different career paths are being presented:

1) Work for boutique fund services company as an operations/accounting associate

2) Work as a Staff Accountant at a CPA firm that has both tax and auditing divisions

I love fast-paced systems-oriented work and learning new things but am not looking to work in excess of 65 hours/week on average, though do understand with busy seasons with both Finance and Accounting may require putting more time to meet critical deadlines. 

I don’t have any experience with IB – this company specializes in the alternative space (PE/Hedge). Please tell me more of what to expect for this type of role, work-life balance, job stability, exit opportunity – or should I just do what most accounting grads do – go the CPA route.

All of what you are about to read is true.  I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage.  Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent.  And the guilty.

**PREFACE**

""We need a new tech on the team.  We have a team of three guys supporting almost 600 users.  Tickets are up almost 60% over the last five years and we can't keep up.  On top of that we have to migrate almost 500 workstations from Windows 7 to Windows 10.  How are we supposed to find the time to do that?""

My director, Laurie, looked at me tiredly.  We'd had this conversation many times, and the answer had always been 'no'.  I hoped this time would be different, but I knew not to hold to that hope too strongly. 

""I'll bring it up with Steve, but he won't want to spend the money on another person.""

Ah.  Steve.  The CEO.  The penny-pincher.  

""Look, I'm not even necessarily asking for a full-time person.  Even a part-time intern or whatever would be a huge boon to the department.  I'm just telling you we don't have the resources to keep up with day-to-day tasks much longer, nevermind a massive migration project.""

""I'll see what I can do.""

A few days later I got word from Laurie that it actually looked promising.  I began excitedly writing job descriptions for two different positions.  One for a full-time tier-1 helpdesk technician, and one for a part-time intern.  This was exactly what we needed.  A full-time helpdesk technician could work almost exclusively on Windows 10 upgrades and get us finished by January 2020 without us having to do much with it at all.  A part-time intern could at least take most of the burden off the main team.  

I sent the job descriptions over to Laurie the next day.  A few hours later I got the call.  We're definitely getting our guy.  

""That's fantastic.  Are we getting someone full-time or part-time?""

""Full-time.""

""Awesome.  Did you take a look at the job descriptions I sent over?  Do you think it needs any changes?""

The briefest of pauses.  ""Well...""

*Oh no.  No good can come of this.*

""He's already picked out, actually,"" she continued.

""Whose kid is it?""

""Was it that obvious?""

""Yes.  Whose kid?""

""Sherry.""

The director of HR?  You've got to be kidding.  Surely she knows better than this.  *sigh*

""Alright.  I'll get with her.""

*a few hours later*

""Hey, Sherry.  I understand your son will be starting with us soon.""

""Yes.  His name is Jordan.  Now you'll have to teach him, because he doesn't have much experience.  But he's very smart and he loves technology.""

""We'll teach him whatever he needs to know.""

""That's great!  He'll start in a few days.  And don't worry.  He'll be treated just like any other employee.""

**DAY 1** - The Arrival

7:50

""Welcome.  I'm Thomas, I'll be your manager.  John and Daniel usually arrive around 8:30; they're the more senior sysadmins.  So how much experience do you have?""

""It's mostly just from playing around with computers at home and stuff to be honest.  I took a couple classes in school but I don't have a degree.""

""Well, as long as you're willing to learn we'll teach you everything you need to know.  I will tell you that a lot of your time - especially at the beginning - is going to be spent upgrading and imaging computers.  It's not going to be particularly fun work.  All of the computers here are still on Windows 7 and we need to be on Windows 10 by January 2020.  Along with imaging them you'll be upgrading a lot.  Some of them are over 10 years old and we'll be adding RAM and upgrading them to SSDs.""

""10 years?  I can't believe you have modems that old.""

pcwj7n,2,2021-08-27,Why are these internship requirements so demanding?,Bright_Bee_529,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/pcwj7n/why_are_these_internship_requirements_so_demanding/,"I was looking at this AWS Data Engineering internship:

https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/jobs/1639455/business-intelligence-intern-uk-2022-opportunities

This looks like its for undergrads but I found these requirements to be a bit bizarre:

· Advanced proficiency in Microsoft Excel (e.g. macros, pivots, lookups, VBA)

· Advanced proficiency in SQL/ETL

· Ability to perform in-depth data mining, highly analytical, detail-oriented, methodical, with professional business sense

Isn’t the whole point of an internship to learn and practice these things? How can they demand that you’re advanced in these skills. Unless I’m missing something. Someone enlighten me"
pcxy3h,2,2021-08-27,Internships,Frangistra,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pcxy3h/internships/,"I'm currently studying a double bachelor in Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a Bachelor of Business Administration (Basically, I study 2 bachelors in one, doing more subjects per year, convalidations between math subjects, etc...) with a duration of 5 years (instead 8 if you do em separately or 7 with convalidations) that I plan end in 4 years (1 year early).

I'm currently looking to apply the next year for an international internship on one of the FAANG businesses. Do I have any chance? Anyone can tell me their experiences if they have been in similar situations or any tips? Do I have any advantage for be studying a double bachelor? (I don't know if this exists in the USA, but it does in Spain, basically, study 2 bachelors at same time.)."

However, as a return, I've got a lot of rejection emails.

My goal now is to apply for upcoming summer (2022) positions, but I was wondering if my rejected applications may cause a negative influence if I apply for the same companies again.

Should I use different account or email address if it does matter? Or Would it not matter at all?

Thank you in advance for any comments."
pcy34j,3,2021-08-27,Last year of MechE degree and wanting to do software,TiredOfMechEng,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/pcy34j/last_year_of_meche_degree_and_wanting_to_do/,"Hi all, I'm looking for some advice on changing career paths.

I'm finishing up my 4th year with a B.S. in MechE at a good school. I have a good GPA and internship experience as a MechE. While I enjoyed the internship, I don't think I could manage that type of work for the rest of my life.

I've taken a couple CS classes, and they were some of the most interesting classes I've taken. I've also talked to a lot of the friends going into software jobs and they all seem amazing: great salaries, remote work, etc. I would honestly like to switch to career in software but I'm afraid that it's too late.

It's a bit too late to switch majors and I really can't afford to stay at school much longer. I don't really have much to show under my belt in terms of CS and recruiting season for CS jobs is coming soon, so I don't think I will be competitive enough to get those jobs. Does anyone have advice on what I should do here? Should I take a MechE job for a couple of years and transition later?"
pcz4gu,16,2021-08-27,An update on my begginner developer life.,blaify,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pcz4gu/an_update_on_my_begginner_developer_life/,"I had a post like maybe 10 months ago, you can check it on my profile, I am too lazy to give you a link. 

So I got an internship after two months since I finished the bootcamp and I'm hyped to see what's next. So this is how my first two days went as a Full Stack .Net intern.

Cause I'm a dumb idiot I was almost late on my first day, but somehow I got there on time... That was stressful, fucking stupid. So I get there and they give me a laptop, the dev-ops guy comes, logs me to the server and gives me the source code. No developers are in the office so other people show me the app and the boss tells me to check out the code. I sit down and look at this overwhelming huge project and I'm bamboozled. I spent couple of hours trying to figure what the hell is going on.
I ask the boss what to do next since I thought they were going to be giving me some tasks. He tells me that the devs are on a mini sprint and are preparing to deploy so I wont be receiving any tasks and to just try to understand the code. I was like ok, and did that.

Second day was basically the same. I'm guessing that they had to finish by today, so I was just reading some documentation on things I never ran into during the bootcamp that were in the project.

I still pretty much have no idea how the whole project works, I just hope someone will explain at least something on Monday and that I will have something to do.

I want to thank everyone here, this community has given me lots of motivation to keep pushing. We just got to grind, learn and keep our heads up. Good times are coming. If I made it this far, you all will. I just hope I can turn this into a career. Wish me luck and love to all!"

I find it difficult to get responses from sites like Linkedin and Indeed despite applying for a lot of jobs. I do not know if there are any online platforms where I can showcase my skills, offer volunteer services, or some form of assistance relating to the field I am interested in. Something similar to Behance or Dribble for designers where they showcase their creativity and probably get hired."

pd181r,6,2021-08-27,INTERN TO Entry Level HelpDesk with a bachelor degree?,howlingtaco,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pd181r/intern_to_entry_level_helpdesk_with_a_bachelor/,"Hello!
I am currently an IT intern at a medium sized company and have been there for about four months. I’m still considered an intern but my job responsibilities are much more than what a typical intern would be doing. My boss likes to highlight that if he was a new hire he would’ve never expected that I was the intern. 

I graduate this year with my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am hoping to stay with the company I currently work, which my boss mentions he’d like to keep me on. After some talking about salary and start date, he pushed up wanting me to start before I got my degree. The downside is that he plans to hire me as a entry level helpdesk technician. It’s always good to get your foot in the door at companies but when I told him with my degree and all my responsibilities I’ve taken on as an intern I need to make at least $50,000 (USD) he said he doesn’t consider education to be a big factor in pay and wants to research market rates for that position.

pd1fcz,3,2021-08-27,Am I being too hopeful about graduate school being more like the college experience that I haven’t been able to achieve during undergrad?,jadedpersonduring,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pd1fcz/am_i_being_too_hopeful_about_graduate_school/,"I want to first start off that I am a senior and I will be graduating during the spring, and it’s made me feel bittersweet. Maybe if COVID didn’t happen I would be feeling differently, but alas.

I come from a strict, Haitian, religious (Christian) household, and I even tried graduating early from high school to escape out early, but that plan failed (but that’s a whole other story). I’ve been having to commute to college and my family has been moving during these past 3 years. With the first location being the closest, the 2nd location which I lived for 2 years at being the longest, and the current one still being farther out but then the previous one.

Being a commuter definitely makes things tough, and also not being able to go to certain places out such a the club, pride, sleepovers, etc makes it tough. I’ve been pushing it a bit this year especially since the past two years have been damaged by Covid. I was going to push some limits during my send semester or sophomore year but COVID happened and everything became virtual. 

One of the things, that I plan on doing since I will be heading to grad school is going out of state because I can’t handle the environment at home anymore and it has limited me when it has come to my social life. If I have to stay in state it has to be a different city even though I love the school I go to. But I can’t deal with being in that same space and the gaslighting that may happen if I would choose to live elsewhere in the same city. 

I definitely have gotten connections, jobs, internships, and club roles which I’m proud of myself for completing because unfortunately my sister who was forced to stay in state and my parents applied to school for didn’t do that. And she’s struggling to this day with job opportunities.

I feel like even though I’m 20 I should know myself more. I have seen that I have changed my views on a lot which I’m proud of but a lot of exploration hasn’t taken place that should have. Especially with my sexuality as a Bisexual person. Even though it was just there first week of school it has been great and it’s already my best year thus far. 

Over lunch one of my friends told me I won’t have time to have fun during graduate school and I got to find a way to push the limits during my last year. How is grad school for those who are in the same situation as me or at least left their home and were on their own? Is she right or just like undergrad is having that balance the important part? I feel like I have so much angst I should have dealt with years ago but it has piled on and I have been going through so much emotionally that I’m about to explode. I feel like I’m still in my identity v. Confusion stage while also in my intimacy v isolation stage. 

I know this goes beyond college of course and I don’t think my best days will be during my college years. I think my best years will be when I can get away even though it may not be easy. I don’t want To come to the end of my life and feel regretful. Especially since I feel so much regret now and I’m just 20."

Obviously, college is starting back up and the stresses and the anxieties that comes with applying to internships for CS (and other majors of course) hits us again. I hope I am not alone in this struggle but as a coming sophomore, the feeling of being behind gets crazy bad. I see people around our levels earn these amazing opportunities  and I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong... For the upcoming application seasons, I got no other internships to speak of, no side projects to show, and no great referrals to connect with. Soo.. how do you shake off this feeling??

I have a \~2.7 cGPA (screwed it up during lockdown). I'm wondering what my PEY prospects are. I did an internship this summer which required a lot of research and programming, and I have decent semi-large side projects and experience from working in student clubs. I'm probably a bit biased but I'd say my programming skills/knowledge is in the top 20% of my class (from what I've seen when talking to and working with other people in my year, I also got a 90+ in our software development course in 2nd year). I'm confident I have the same software skills as people with 3.5s, but I'm afraid I wont get any interviews because of my 2.7. I know some companies have a strict cGPA cut off, but what are my prospects for companies that don't have a strict cut off? I'm fairly confident can prove myself to software companies in an interview, but don't know if I'll even get an interview. What are my prospects compared to someone with a 3.5 and no experience and does anyone have any general advice?"

I will get two degrees from these two schools, and this situation also leads me to say byebye towards toefl waiver.

&amp;#x200B;

Major and minor: Major in electrical engineering and minor in computer science.

GPA: 3.85/4.0 in UIUC, 3.95/4.0 in ZJU.

TOEFL: 107 (s 21, best 23; w 26)

GRE: (I do not plan to submit it, if I need to, it will be 149+170+4)

research: three papers so far, two of them are related to scheduling problems and machine learning (EI conference, oral papers, won best presenter award). The last one is the poster paper for EMBC 2021. Two papers unpublished, working with professors Yale University and will become journal papers in TOP journals related to computational biology.

&amp;#x200B;

Recommendation letters: One from PI in ZJU with research content, one from mentor in intern company (famous internet company), one from Yale's professor (strong recommendation, I think), one from course instructor in UIUC.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my choices (I listed the feedback from PIs after I sent them the self-introduction emails)：

Purdue CS phd (get good feedback from one PI)

UIUC ECE phd (must apply haha, I already have target professor here and will cooperate with him soon)

UTH bioinfor phd (good feedback from PIs)

Columbia bioinfor phd (very difficult, plan to give up)

Brown bioinfor phd (having a try is not bad)

Umich bioinfor phd (biostat too difficult)

Duke CBB phd ( good feedback from PIs)

CMU MSCB/CPCB phd phd (no reply from PIs...)

Emory bioinfor phd (I think the bar is not very high, and toefl waiver will be accepted for me)

I have an idea for an internal network setup at my workplace and I am not sure if some tools already exist or if it's feasible. (I'm a beginner in this field so any suggestion is much appreciated)
The network consists of a server and many dev computers connected to that server. The server's main purpose is to hold multiple storage mounts and to serve as an apt/package mirror for the devs (When a dev machine is created, as a basic ubuntu image, it will import its configuration from the server and it would get any needed package fron the server's cached version)
The goal is that all machines will have the same configuration and apps, the updates will be made in a single place (the server) and, maybe, different configurations will be available for different machines (eg. intern machines with no Internet access, normal devs machine etc.)
Now, I've heard of Puppet and Ansible, but I'm not sure if they are the right tools."
pd4uaj,1,2021-08-28,Needs advice. Switching to tech,treksis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pd4uaj/needs_advice_switching_to_tech/,"Hi, community. I did double major Math and stat from avg Canadian university with avg gpa. I'm 31.Partial actuarial background. I passed P and FM actuarial exam. I worked as analyst and trader in commodity-focused prop trading shop for 6 years. I always felt this job is extremely insecure. I'm planning to switch into a software role. My qualification somewhat fits quantitative or data positions because of stats, but damn I don't want to involve in any of these roles. I'm fed up with bayesian stuffs.

It's about 18 months, I decided to seriously commit to switching my career path. I got dozens of Coursera certificates which I don't really believe it has any value. I went over 300+ leetcode problems (2/3/1 ish ratio) and Educativo software design courses. Yet, I haven't built any application or website. Just theories and toy problems, it's far from practical.

Other than that, the only programming experience I got is building image recognition-based MMORPG farming bot in macro-express and AutoIt. I don't know whether I can call this programming but, I was a mod in starcraft, warcraft3, and starcraft2 use map when I was in high school and cegep. Which, I don't really believe it would fit to someone's resume. It's far from professional experience.

My next goal is to build a bunch of clone apps. Lots of resources are already on udemy and youtube, which would make my skills a little bit more practical.

Here is the problem. Most of the qualification in entry position for software dev requires 2, 3 years of practice and lots of tech stacks. That's too luxurious for a guy like me.

First, I got no idea how to get the 1st year of professional experience. a short internship would be ideal, but I graduated years ago. I don't even remember the name of profs. If anyone successfully landed the 1st tech job from different background, please share your story. I saw a bunch of posts it's easier to land in a start-up company but, Gosh.. start-up companies are asking even more tech stack.

Second, I honestly don't know what's proficiency means. If anyone can help me what really proficiency means in the tech field, please help me. Here is one example of what Microsoft asking for SWE position in linkedin.

* BS in Computer Science or a related field
* 3 months to 1+ years of experience in software engineering
* 3 months to 1+ years of experience developing and operating cloud services, web applications, APIs, etc.
* *Java, Graph QL, REST,* ***proficiency***
* *JS, TypeScript, React, Redux* ***proficiency***
* Excellent programmer: your code is maintainable, and you write tests

Third, my goal is to fit a position where I can learn about how to design practical service architecture. I don't even know what this role is. How should I prepare to walk on this path?

Needs some help."

At which I previously worked as a tutor and student researcher but declined the offer for a graduate position.

I subsequently developed psychosomatic and depressive problems and just worked odd jobs for the first year. Specifically, freelance tutoring and for two months for a start-up in the production of video material for an accelerator, after which I decided to accept an offer for a more stable position at a telecommunications software company (however, with an unfitting external image). I was assigned to a bit of a more important and long-running project of the company after a half year. But even though the projects were interesting, and if one was attentive one was one could also learn up-to-date industry-relevant skills, the day-to-day work was below my capabilities and not challenging me enough. As I did not saw the light at the end of the tunnel I decided to apply to grad school (abroad in the UK) and was accepted for a program for a 3 years long funded program (with 4 years of funding). I left the company with good references and was also granted by my boss to write the reference letter partly by myself such that I could better express some of the technologies I interacted with. I honestly partly regret the decision of accepting the position at the graduate school, due to the work conditions being plainly exploitative. Even though it having been a joint project in cooperation with ""industrial"" stakeholders, which were  very concerned about projecting a good image. As the project does not want to further fund me; I have been looking for part-time work and internship opportunities (Germany); but even though I am being enthusiastically invited into interviews, I am being repeatingly filtered for the second round or being treated with suspicion subsequently.

Since the last years I am increasingly encountering and working together with people who are  overly „fake“ in their presentation, feign genuineness and deliberately create situations of intransparency to prey in these upon one's lack of awareness. And it is wearing and wearing me down and I see how it is increasingly killing the last bits of 'good' inside of me. But I feel that the companies where I might be a good fit in regards to values and character just filter me out because they are suspicious of my track record. I do not know how to escape this situation and recover from this and further fall down this rabbit hole.  "

Will this hinder my career in the longrun considering I would not have any work experience prior to masters?

As background, my first degree is economics, and I have minimal experience with coding and advanced math courses. I'm taking CS50 right now and will hopefully have time to play around with freecodecamp and other free resources before winter semester starts.

Below is what I was thinking for scheduling. I plan on being a student full-time (living at home with family, luckily), so I adjusted accordingly. The timing of electives is based on the 2021-22 schedule, so I may adjust accordingly if things change. I also want to point out that I'm currently going through mental health treatment (had a lapse recently), so I would appreciate advice on what helped current/past students balance between their personal health, program requirements, and career prep.

pdd47y,20,2021-08-28,I feel like I’ve wasted my chances,throwaway-acct-1999,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pdd47y/i_feel_like_ive_wasted_my_chances/,"Hi everyone,

First of all, I think a lot of what I am going to say in this post will sound arrogant, and I apologize in advance. I don’t wish to sound this way, I would just like to gain some advice from others.

I went to a pretty good university for CS (UT, top 10 i believe). During my time at university, I feel like I did pretty good in my classes. I’ve maintained a 3.8 GPA, and I truly loved my major. I love CS to the core, and I spend a lot of my free time doing CS just for the sake of it. I know there will always be people out there who are more knowledgeable and more dedicated to the subject, but I do take a little pride in my commitment to the subject as well. 

However, when it came to applying for internships and jobs, I’ve always felt not good enough. I’ve always felt like there was no point even applying to these bigger tech companies because I’m not the best. I don’t know where these insecurities come from: I actually love doing leetcode/competitive coding problems and I love talking about my projects and past work experiences.

Many students from my University go on to work at FAANG companies. I know there’s a hate-boner for saying you want to work at a FAANG company, but I really don’t know why. You can learn so much from the other engineers at these places. In addition, most of these places treat their engineers like they are good people!

Right before senior year of college, I accepted a job at a large bank as a SWE. I want to emphasize that I am grateful for the job I have, as I know many are still searching for internships and jobs.

However, it really feels like I am not learning much at my job right now. Many things are extremely simple fixes, and I legitimately finish all my work for the week in about 2 days. I ask my manager for advice/tips because, as a newer hire, I feel like there is always room for improvement in my code in some fashion. However, he is constantly busy (not to his fault of course) with meetings, and my code generally ends up working, so usually nothing happens. I spend the rest of my time learning new technologies, working on my side projects, or doing leetcode. 

I feel frustrated because it feels like I wasted my chances by not applying to bigger tech companies (for example, FAANG) where I feel like I could learn a lot.

Furthermore, I am a new hire, so inevitably my college name comes up in conversations with other coworkers. 8/10 times, everyone makes a comment, “Wow you ended up here? I thought all UT kids went to work at &lt;tech company&gt;”. This honestly makes me feel like shit, but I also kinda believe it too.

I would just like some advice on how I can handle my emotions of failure and regret. I would also like some advice on what I can do to work at a FAANG (or any bigger tech company, really) company ASAP."
pddx36,2,2021-08-28,Never felt so dysfunctional before after getting my dream job,ybbee23,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pddx36/never_felt_so_dysfunctional_before_after_getting/,"I am a graphic design diploma graduate that got a job right after my graduation. 

Realized I have ADHD during college, tried to get diagnosed before getting out to society, but motivation died down cause keep getting my symptoms dismissed by Dr.

Struggled extra hard trying to keep afloat in college(also basically my whole life) (struggle to start task n feel like my creative brain dying), and somehow got thru as one of the top student despite feel myself crumbling apart. (My lecturer give mark base more on progression, n less on result imo)

Got offered internship at my lecturer's company and gladly accepted it. Then things started went terribly wrong(imo)

My company is a design firm that are high demand (need fast work, good management skill n also nice design etc)

My focus problem, forgetfulness and brain fog came onto me on full blast. I struggle to keep track of my projects progress, boss's feedback; keep making beginner's mistake; do work super slow cause my brain keep lagging; and even cried and told my boss I have ADHD when critic out of impulse. (All of which also happened in college thou less intense but my lecturers let it slide). I work overtime everyday but it's not helping much either.

So I decided to try getting diagnosed again in different hospital n was quite desperate.
During all of this I also doubted if I still like my job, or like design as whole, and should I stay in this company cause they have quite a lot of red flags like ppl keep quiting, even 10 yrs experience employee in the company advice me to consider properly etc.

Eventually my internship ended, n I choose to continue in the company because I know I won't do well either in other places with my ADHD, so might as well get a job when I still can n save up for diagnosis.

Then I got diagnosed 1 week after I sign the contract.

Am trying low dose Ritalin. Am getting better (at least brain fog is much better), but still feeling very lost abt many things n keep getting existential crisis, like being unsure that do I still like design(cause I feel like that might not change after getting treatement), unsure of will I get better at stuff after diagnosed, why did they hire me despite everything, how long shld I stay etc etc

I don't really know what I'm asking for at this point. Maybe like, how to find a purpose in life? Or is my lost of direction in life a ADHD thing? And how do you cope etc etc.

Feel free to give any advice or input cause I'm pretty lost n would appreciate views from different angle etc

Thanks for reading so far."

There was an interview for the position, and I wasn’t the only candidate. It required several tests, but it didn’t take long for them to contact me after. It made me excited. I figured I did well, and I celebrated with my girlfriend that night. My first day missed my exit while driving. When I arrived, I remembered I could park with the employees. The building was a large dome and had a big enough radius to block the back, which was exactly where I needed to go. They had a security checkpoint, and I had to grab a sticker out of my glove compartment. I was almost scolded for not sticking it to my windshield. The parking lot was almost full, and while driving to the back to find a spot, I realized that the firm was actually located on a compound. There were many smaller buildings with concrete paths connecting them.

By the time I managed to enter the back of the firm I was already 15 minutes late. In the back entrance room the receptionist told me that they were waiting for me before they got started. I was confused as she took me through compartmentalized hallways. The interview was in one of the front offices, but we were getting deep into the interior and I realized how many rooms there were. We entered an open door, on the other side were confused looking men. 

We were given a presentation, and told we would help the “the Data Structures Department.” I concluded we’d be doing basic quality assurance and bug fixing. We were then led to another room to watch “training videos.” Videos about proper office etiquette, and codes of conduct. They were odd, and the actors were not good. I learned basically nothing about the job on my first day, but I got a good idea of my colleagues. Some were older, and one was younger, but most were my age. We were all eager to work,

The next time I came in, it was wildly different. I expected to do some rehashing, but instead I was given a sequence and asked to sort it. I figured it was a test and came up with my best algorithm. Then they gave me another one. It was after my fourth that I concluded I'd be doing this for a while. I would briefly look up at my colleagues, and it appeared we were all doing the same thing. The sequences reminded me of something, but I couldn’t pinpoint what.

The job would look good on my resume, but the work felt very repetitive. It was towards the end of my second to last semester that in my instruction box I had a document. I didn’t think much at first. They would send us performance reports in document form, although I rarely read them. Towards the end of my shift I got bored and decided to see what they had sent. It was blueprints to something I hadn’t seen before. In the document it was described as a perpetual mechanism. When I got home I did my own research using the information that I derived from the document. It was a device used to precisely measure astronomical cycles, and was the first analogue computer. I was surprised by what I learned, but then I read that it was 2000 years old. 

It wasn’t long after this that I could tell my colleagues were getting frustrated with the internship. A few had already quit, but I noticed many had started conversing. This was more usual for programmers. That's when the guy, who I thought was a sophomore (who worked next to me), sparked up a conversation. He introduced himself as Paul. He explained to me that he had started university early and was actually a senior. We talked about how dull work was. Then he told me something unexpected. He explained to me that work had sent a document about mycelium. Then he asked, “Have you gotten anything strange in your work inbox?”

I decided to be honest and tell him about the mechanism, but before he could respond an alarm went off, and we were told to stay where we were by a speaker. It didn’t feel like a drill, but for some reason I didn’t feel safe. It wasn’t long until the alarm was called off, but many of my colleagues started asking questions.

When I was telling my girlfriend about my day she was very concerned. She wanted me to quit, but I told her I wanted to figure out what was going on. We struggled for the first time in our relationship, but she just wanted the best for me.

I would think about my internship even when not at the firm. Thinking about all the details led to possible conclusions, but nothing solid. Then it was one particular day that Paul and I began conversing again. I was used to it at this point, and expected a somewhat casual inquiry, but that's not what I got.

""I think I figured something out,"" he announced to me.

""What do you mean?"" I responded.

He said at first he wanted to know what we were doing. Then while thinking about the mycelium document he had a realization. We were sorting DNA sequences, but he didn't know what for. He wanted to share more information, but he didn't want to do it at the firm. We swapped numbers and contacted each other later that day. He explained that he had talked to other colleagues and he didn't want them to know we had this conversation. They told him they had received documents about nervous systems, not just in humans, but all types of organisms. Also he said some got documents on nucleases. He alluded to the fact that there could be something big going on. He said he had a plan for the next shift, but I wasn't sure what he meant. 

On the day of my next shift I arrived early to see what Paul would do, but as my colleagues began to fill in I was surprised to not see him.  It was towards the middle of my shift that I felt like something happened. Then I got a message. It said it was from Paul.

He told me he wanted to meet, and gave me directions to a location from the bathroom. Eventually I found a hallway where there was one open door. I didn't notice it was automatic and it closed behind me. It was a lab closet and I was alone. I was getting frustrated. 

The alarm activated briefly as the power went out. A backup generator went off and I saw  security started to flood out the rooms near me. I reached for the handle out of desperation and realized the door was now unlocked. The lights were darker, and I intended to sneak out, but then I saw that the security room and screens were left unattended. I decided to take a quick peak, then leave. I noticed many of the cameras weren’t working correctly, cutting out periodically.

I was about to turn around when I saw an image that will always be seared into my brain. It was a fleshy large black organism, with what I can only describe as roots growing everywhere around it. There were many machines, The images would flash out only to appear on another screen. It seemed as if it were growing quickly towards people. It had many roots connected to the wall behind it.

I began noticing how the image would flash only on the monitor I was looking at. The more I paid attention the more noticeable it became. Just before I left, every monitor suddenly displayed terrifying images. Whatever this monstrosity was, it appeared to be able to control the digital infrastructure, and it knew I was there.

I began to run through every open door I could. At some point I was running through hallways I didn't recognize. Until I found a door that I thought led to an exit. The door again closed behind me, but this time it appeared I was in the surveilling room. There was a floor below with scientists and men with rifles, trying to maintain distance.  Its roots would leave black soot everywhere it went, and they appeared to pulse in and out. I was trapped for sometime and the roots began to grow closer and closer. I could see something on the flesh of the main structure of the organism. I couldn't make out what it was at first, only the color. That’s when I realized I was observing a head half swallowed. The face immediately looked familiar, that’s when I realized who it was.

""Paul! NO!"" I yelled. 

Suddenly an exit opened. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew nothing good would become of me if I ended up like Paul. I escaped through the exit to the parking lot. I ran down the street and called my girlfriend.

There would be a news report, although the firm didn't comment. The story was that all the servers containing the work of the firm had been wiped during an “incident.“ There was no comment from the firm and it was forced to close. I learned most of the employees were kept in the dark about what was going on as the firm didn't even have their employees names or information any longer. I knew I needed to do something. That’s when I decided I wouldn't give up on Paul...."

pdffgw,1,2021-08-28,The Curse of Leetcoding,drunkenmonkey18,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pdffgw/the_curse_of_leetcoding/,"If you’re someone who got into programming via building websites or anything that does not have you to ramp up Leetcode then this might not be relevant. I am writing my journey of how I got into programming and how wrong I was about the trade of writing software. I apologise for writing a long post like this but I feel my story has to be heard. So here we go.

After getting into college my primary focus has been always to complete my undergrad and go grab an MBA degree and get into Investment Banking or Consulting or more of a traditional MBA career path. For this reason, I always saw Programming with a perspective of giving and take relationships. Hence in all of my first year, I wrote code which just helped me pass all of my computer science courses. Did I tell you that I was about to major in computer science? If no then I am telling you to know, My grades were on the average side of the line in my first year and I got a D grade in my programming course. I kinda felt bad getting a low grade and realised that I gotta get serious about programming because these types of grades don't make a good MBA profile.

Now enter into my second year when all the core computer science curriculum kicks in. There was a famous professor in my college who taught us data structures and algorithms which are the holy grail of Software engineering interviews. This is where things get interesting. He was the kind of guy who would make you work till 2 a.m in the morning with great assignments and also induce some competition and collaborative culture in your classroom. And boy did he provide a great vibe by telling stories like how our seniors who did well in his course got into reputed companies (FAAMG). I was always that guy who needs someone to fire up his ass, So I got going in this course and secured the top grade he could give. Until now programming was a side gig for me that could help me secure decent grades. Now, this course changed the whole MBA equation.  I got serious into competitive programming and started hitting Codeforces and Leetcode for interview practice. I religiously followed the ritual of solving problems so that I could crack a good internship and put it in my resume which increased the odds of getting into a top b-school.

Remember that all the while till this point there were many workshops and events which could give me exposure to the real world of writing useful software but I never cared because they counted little to my internship selection. So I went ahead with knocking down Leetcode problems as they need little googling (like you would never need stack overflow seriously) and you could solve them using predetermined methods. When I tried learning web development by doing some projects like pursuing some of my ideas, I gave up because I became too lazy to google the errors or even understand them.

Enter the internship season. As it started I got into a company that yearned from my first year of college. So I was pretty happy and chilled for the rest of the time until the start of the summer. In the meanwhile, I passed all of my courses with decent grades and learned some important stuff like operating systems and computer networks. I was always curious about how things worked in general but I am sort of that guy who never really cared for anything that didn't matter for cracking the job. As you've read this far you can understand where I went wrong really. Yes, I only did things that got me the job and not do that job. This is where shit hits the fan for the first time.

I started interning at this company and during my stint there I was asked to write some code in java which was a massive codebase. I kid you not I even could not figure out how to set environment variables for setting up JDK, Maven and IntelliJ. Now anyone in my position would try to google those things and learn them on the go and I did the same except I resented and despised doing that. I thought that this sort of work should be done by some lesser mortals whose time is not valuable and be used for doing this grunt work, not by some elite strategist like me who likes to whip my IDE and write some fancy algorithms which can make a huge impact on the business side.  I did the job but hated every bit of it. In all this mayhem that was going in my brain, they did give me a return offer. Yes, I hid every bit of resentment and wrote code, attended meetings, gave daily updates, collaborated with great peers. I had 1 year of free time until I join the same company as an employee. If you'd expect me to change my approach of writing software like building some real shit, nope I did not change even a little bit. It became even a lot worse when l learned that I can land up jobs if jacked Leetcode day and night. And why would through a painful path if presented with a straighter one?

Hence for the next year, I pretty much-Leetcoded every day just to stay interview ready. I did bother to write some code for building a front-end application but it was too much of a hassle. My elitist brain did not come to terms with the real world yet. It took only an error to just abandon my side project. I interviewed with a couple of companies but never took them seriously to join them. All this while for the last year I stalked Github/LinkedIn profiles of good programmers who built real shit. I wanted to become like them so that I can bring my ideas to life but the software interviewing process are all against them. Even worse I saw people making FAAMG just with DSA and some low-level system design shit.

It has been 2 months since I joined the same company where I interned. For the first part of the month, I really struggled because my frustration grew when I was not able to build the code successfully. The dependencies were deprecated and some of them were conflicting with each other and it was absolute mayhem when the codebase was handed over to me. It took me 1 month and 2 weeks to realize that to build and ship real shit you need to learn and figure everything on the go and not cramming up Leetcoding problems that test you on the preset conditions and environment. I even forgot how to take inputs because you would have just fill up these functions. Look I am not saying that Leetcode makes you dumber but if you do only Leetcode then that is shooting yourself in the foot.

Now I am much better. I am learning rails to write some code related to my startup idea. I designing my mockups on Figma. I am not gonna Leetcode in the near future and I even put the site's address in my blocklist. And I have given up on my MBA dreams when I figured that Suits aren't for me and I really like how software organizations are run."

* \- Canada has comparatively lesser fees than the USA in MEng, but I think the Job space is way smaller than in the USA.
* \- USA, meanwhile, has really high tuition fees, which I can in no way afford. I can take a loan, but it will be too big of a risk if I can't land a job in the USA and return to India. That will be death to me.

I have considered Australia too, but their good universities have really high fees, and I am unsure about post-Masters work opportunities.

pdiqn3,52,2021-08-28,Is anyone else getting horrifyingly overwhelmed while applying for grad school or is it just me,the_silverwastes,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/pdiqn3/is_anyone_else_getting_horrifyingly_overwhelmed/,"I'm currently a senior and I'm going to apply to a Master's in applied math this year, and the more I think about it, the more I feel less and less prepared and close to freaking out. Back when I was applying for undergrad, I'd been preparing myself since end of middle school/beginning of high school (yes I was one of those super college obsessed kids), so I was a lot more ready.

However, during my undergrad, I've been so so busy just trying to stay afloat and maintain a normal CGPA especially after I fucked it up during the first 2 covid semesters (finally brought it back above a 3.0 again this past spring), that I don't think I've focused on anything that I need to. I also transferred to a different university after my first year, and had only half of my credit hours transferred, so I've been taking an above average amount of workload every semester since then and I'm so so burnt out by now, especially because I took both this year's, and the last year's summer semesters as well. Anyway, I haven't been able to work on anything on my own, including research, or internships, or any sort of good experience that could help my applications. Just got rejected from a TA-ship because of my GPA too, and I feel like everything is starting to go SO bad. 

Adding to that, grad school applications, and my choice of school are scaring me too, as I'm trying to figure out which school would work for me, and which advisors would be nice to work with, and I have no clue because I'm not even sure if I have a confirmed area of math that I want to work in. I opened up an instructor's profile like 30 minutes ago and looked at some of their publications and FREAKED out because how am I even going to be able to do something even close to that, let alone just understand it at all. The realization is hitting me that I'll need to be able to look at and read stuff like that regularly starting now probably, but I don't even know how to start. 

On top of all of that, some universities I was looking at don't require the GRE which was nice to know, but some of them absolutely require it, and I'm not even sure if or when I'll be able to give it, or how to prepare for it once my semester starts in 2 weeks. Not even sure if I should at all at this point tbh but honestly I don't think I'm sure if I want/need to do anything at all. 

I realize this post is really really long but oh my god I just need someone to tell me what to do and how to prepare somehow so that I don't get rejected from even my bottom tier universities, or how to deal with the stress and plan it all out. I know I'm so so late but God I just need some direction because I'm SO freaked out right now.

EDIT: Thank you so much @ everyone who replied to this, all the advice has really helped me figure out that the way I'm approaching grad school and admissions is probably not the best and that I still have a lot more to think about and do. For now, I'm going to try to get research/math related experience during my final year, but if it doesn't seem like it's working out by the middle of this coming semester, I'm genuinely seriously going to be considering a gap year so that I can figure out exactly what I want to do, and also work on how to make myself more appealing to grad schools as well (i.e. with at leasttt some relevant work experience by then). 

My freak out is kind of over for now lol, so thank you again for helping with all of this :)"

pdky1d,8,2021-08-28,Question about Freelance pricing,Nahgloshii,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/pdky1d/question_about_freelance_pricing/," Afternoon,

I  have a question for those doing freelance work (or anyone with an  informed opinion really). I've kind of stumbled into a GIS role and  could use srom advice on pricing with a little backstory.

I'm  getting a GIS Certificate at a community college - a GIS Internship is  required. I took an ""internship"" this past summer. Essentially with a  two man team that take aerial imagery in RGB, CIR, NDVI, and a  proprietary algorithm.  They contract with HOAs. Before they got me,  they didn't know how they were going to deliver their product as maps to  the HOAs and eventual homeowners. The HOA requested to isolate the maps  to individual parcels (4 maps of each parcel). This community was 2,000  parcels - so they needed 8,000ish maps in less than a month. Luckily  I've gotten really good with Python and was able to learn as I went and  automate this process, ended up being 500 lines of code to make it work.  Wasn't much of an internship, it was more of 2 desperate guys not  wanting to pay a professional, they know nothing about GIS. If you were  to do this manually it would have taken literal months. Kind of stupid  depending on a community college intern for you final product...

I  basically saved their ""company"" and then they asked me to join their  ""team."" The internship is over and now they want me to process their  2021 images of this community (I did the 2020 images over the summer).  They offered me a small dollar amount to do it and I found it insulting  considering I essentially had the role of GIS Developer + Product  Developer + savior of the company.

So  here I am asking actual GIS Professionals and Freelancers what they  would charge for 8,000 unique image maps if you owned the script and the  unique parcel shapefiles needed to make accurate map extractions. If I  told them off and they would have to start from scratch. What would you  charge them?

Additionally, they  don't want to pay for the ESRI license required for Arcpy - I'm not  proficient in any other library. I'm wondering is a basic license would  be enough?"

How bad would this look again my other job history?,Sharktapus123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pdod52/looking_to_leave_my_company_that_i_rejoined_after/,"As my title states, I'm looking to potentially leave my current company after being in my current role for only 7 months. Reason being due to to their poor handling of COVID as well as more or less lying about allowing us flexibility in wfh/in-office schedules post office opening

Ultimately my concern is how this'll look against my prior work history with recruiters/new companies. For context,  I'm in my late 20s and actually used to work in this same company for roughly 5 years prior to this - a year as an intern during undergrad and then ~4 years as an FTE split across 3 different roles with the following history:

- 11 months in Deparrment 1; department ended up getting dismantled during reorgs and I got laid off only to get another opportunity in another department

- 2 years in department 2; loved the team but wanted to pursue analytics roles instead and pursued another role in department 3

- 11 months in department 3; left for another company due to a toxic team that my team had to support.

I ended up working at Company 2 for a year and a half, but decided to return to my first company due to an offer that included a massive pay bump and the opportunity to do more technical work that I was interested in (along with finding out the entirety of previously mentioned toxic team was fired or left for new jobs.) However, I'm 7 months into this new role and with talks about returning to the office despite the rise in the delta variant and rumblings that flexible work locations will not be on the table as promised, I'm considering looking elsewhere.

I was promoted last month, and the 8 peers in my division at my level have 3-6 years of experience.

Currently, I feel that I am providing a lot of value to my company. I feel fully immersed into the tech stack and the development workflow. But, I feel as if I have peaked in my learning on this product. By that I mean, senior devs on my team and others come to me consistently for advice and I am running weekly knowledge sessions for other devs.

On my team, I am now given the most critical projects even though there are others with 10-15 yrs of experience, so the experience could be valuable. I have 2 hours of 1-on-1 weekly meetings with our division's architect, plus many hours of debugging production issues, and he is the only person that I feel provides me with additional knowledge.

I am happy with this job since I am making 130k in Austin, TX one year out of college, my manager only cares about what I produce.

Let's say that if I were to move companies, I were paid the same amount (This actually is likely accurate unless I go to FAANG because my stock has increased 100% in one year). Am I at the sweet spot in a company where you are fully independent and others rely on you, or is this the point where you should make a transition so that you can continue learning?"

pdqf8w,3,2021-08-29,New Grad: Should I take a Junior QA role temporarily while working on my LC skills/projects to get a developer position?,due11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pdqf8w/new_grad_should_i_take_a_junior_qa_role/,"I'm 28 from Canada, graduated this June, and am still unemployed. My coding skills are not great and my DSA/LC skills are extremely weak (might need to retake a DSA course on udemy before starting the leetcode grind).  The only programming language that I'm okay-ish is Java. I have an 8-month Java developer internship and 1 year working in an infrastructure/network engineering internship role. However, my coding skills are pretty weak and I'm looking to be good enough to solve easy LC and maybe have a project on the side. I'm also looking to pickup Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

My concern is that I'll need a decent amount of time to get to a level where I'm good enough to have a chance at cracking the interview and getting a developer position. I have ADHD and other mental setbacks (depression, anxiety, self-hate, etc) unfortunately as well that make learning quickly for me difficult (I'm going to the doctors to work on this). 

I recently applied randomly for a Junior QA role and got an interview. The HR person said this role will be manually testing at first and ""eventually"" you will learn automation. She also mentioned that the role is a QA role with no opportunity down the line to transition to a developer role. She said they are looking for a QA-only person who will later transition to a senior QA. 

Obviously, that was a huge turn-off but I'm thinking if they offered me this position which is fully remote, maybe I can work this job, get some experience, and have some income all the while I grind leetcode on the side till I get good enough to interview for developer roles and bail from this QA role. 

I'm worried about the stigma of having a QA role on my resume though. Like after graduating, I couldn't find a dev job so I got into QA. I know hiring managers will look down on that and may throw my resume in the trash. That's why should I just not take any QA role, stay unemployed and take 2-3 months of grinding leetcode and working on projects. Financially, I am ok for at least 2-3 months due to some savings and I'm living in my parent's house. However, there is this pressure on me to start working from family on a daily basis. Plus being 28 and unemployed fucking sucks and my depression gets worse because of these thoughts but I'm not sure a QA role is going to change that. 

Any advice?"

pdu302,8,2021-08-29,Looking to leave my company that I rejoined after 7 months in my new role. How bad would this look again my other job history? (Cross-post from r/jobs),Sharktapus123,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pdu302/looking_to_leave_my_company_that_i_rejoined_after/,"As my title states, I'm looking to potentially leave my current company after being in my current role for only 7 months. Reason being due to to their poor handling of COVID as well as more or less lying about allowing us flexibility in wfh/in-office schedules post office opening

Ultimately my concern is how this'll look against my prior work history with recruiters/new companies. For context,  I'm in my late 20s and actually used to work in this same company for roughly 5 years prior to this - a year as an intern during undergrad and then ~4 years as an FTE split across 3 different roles with the following history:

- 11 months in Deparrment 1; department ended up getting dismantled during reorgs and I got laid off only to get another opportunity in another department

- 2 years in department 2; loved the team but wanted to pursue analytics roles instead and pursued another role in department 3

- 11 months in department 3; left for another company due to a toxic team that my team had to support.

I ended up working at Company 2 for a year and a half, but decided to return to my first company due to an offer that included a massive pay bump and the opportunity to do more technical work that I was interested in (along with finding out the entirety of previously mentioned toxic team was fired or left for new jobs.) However, I'm 7 months into this new role and with talks about returning to the office despite the rise in the delta variant and rumblings that flexible work locations will not be on the table as promised, I'm considering looking elsewhere.

I've already had a recruiter reach out to me for another opportunity with a fully remote role so I'm not super concerned about getting interviews as my skillset is pretty in demand, but I am worried about how it's going to look when the longest I've been in a single role post graduation is 2 years despite being in the same company for longer.

I'd really like to score a solid internship the coming summer (2022) and so I was wondering what projects/areas of CS I should focus on.

For reference, I'm doing a research project with a professor this summer that was focused around web scraping a lot of data from a website and then using some python data analysis to draw conclusions, as well using some machine learning and image recognition and filtering to sort images into collections. I also spend the summer learning DS+Algorithms and solving quite a few DSA problems (\~100) or so, and will continue to practice them until I apply. I am learning web development (I know the basics and have designed some websites, just wanted to learn it at a very good level) as part of a course that starts in a 3 weeks so I will hopefully have some projects to showcase for too!

Is there anything I should focus on specifically in terms of projects or DS to crack the internship? I will continue to focus on DSA since I know these companies put a lot of stress on that. Another thing I'd like to know is whether I have a realistic chance of getting an internship at these places or if I should focus on my applications to other places more and think about it next year (I saw a post that mentioned 2sigma generally takes 3rd year interns)."

I do quite like my major, but once I'm not in class and not doing assignments, I'm not going to be programming. I want to have a life that is separate from my career. Coding is not a hobby for me. I don't really have personal projects or anything because it's just my college major. My brother, an accounting major, doesn't have personal accounting projects in his freetime, why should it be different for me?

I had planned on going for my master's degree, but due to the pandemic I deferred admission to 2021. I have spent this year working (interning full time) at two different organizations, and also participated in a funded online research competition/internship.

Though I am not 100% sure of my interests, I am interested in climate and environmental science and data science. The deferred program is a master's in climate science, because last year that was what I was interested in. My internships explored various topics, including air pollution, environmental policy, and remote sensing and data science for climate change. I want to work in research and aim to do a PhD at some stage, no I'm not sure about that. 

I am unsure about going for the masters programme which I deferred because:
1) My interests have shifted slightly since last year and I don't know if this is the best fit anymore. 
2) I didn't apply to any highly competitive programs last year because I wasn't sure of my interests and felt I lacked the motivation and experience needed to make a compelling application. Now, at least I have clearer objectives which would perhaps make me a stronger candidate?
3) Classes will be online (at least initially)
4) I have an offer to work as a data scientist working on climate data at a start-up in my home country. The role seems interesting.

On the other hand, I feel that since I want to get into research, I should do a master's sooner rather than later since I don't have domain knowledge in the field I want to do a PhD in. Also, the organization where I have a job offer is a start-up and not the sort of place I see myself working at long-term, as I wish to do research. The work involves climate data and programming and modelling which is interesting, but it is not a research environment.

I am conflicted whether I should just go my master's this year to a place I'm not 100% sure about or work for a year at an organisation that is interesting but which I don't know if I'll be a good fit for."

pdzyhs,188,2021-08-29,"Mom sabotaged my entire life. She purposely sabotaged an interview, sent me to a violent high school, caused permanent health issues, and wanted to make my grandma a vegetable so I can move back home.",Guide262,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/pdzyhs/mom_sabotaged_my_entire_life_she_purposely/,"Found out about this thread, and I will prob vent every other day since it's cathartic. This is long but I have to vent. I lived with my mom and grandma, both controlling and narcissistic. My grandma arranged a marriage for my mom… with a man she never met. The only thing she knew that he was “rich”. He ended up leaving b/c of instigation from other dramatic family members. When he left, we also ended up being very poor. 

My mom was an angry person, and she beat me before pre-school age. She seriously got triggered over a toddler. My grandma just sat and watched TV while it happened. A few years later, I developed permanent facial twitching. I was bullied for this, and my parents also made fun of me, and never took me to the doctor. As an adult, I now take meds and do botox to control it. I am convinced this was caused by stress from the day I was born, but doctors say there’s no evidence. No one in my family has this. They did mention that if this was handled when I was younger, I would have been in a better place as an adult. There’s also no cure. I also developed behavioral issues starting in pre-school. I was seriously attacking other kids, and getting sent to time out. My mom loved coming to parent teacher meetings since it made her feel important. Up to this day, I still have a hard time with people interaction. 

Another example of sabotage: Because we lived in the ghetto (again, due to their failure), I was assigned to one of the worst high schools in the city. There was a ton of fights and low graduation rates. My mom refused to appeal, because 1. she didn’t want to take a 20 min bus ride to the school district to fill out a few forms, and 2. she really wanted me to attend the worst school. My grades ended up plummeting and I got into several fights. I got into a fight with an ex best friend. My mom asked me if I won. I said no..and she replied “haha I knew it, you deserved it”. I was lucky to even get into college. I took a shot at Ivy League anyways, got turned down (fair enough), and ended up going to a state school. 

When I was in elementary school, I was also assigned to a bad, low performing middle school. My teacher took the time to write an appeal letter, and I got into one of the top 3 middle schools! Going to a good middle school gave me the confidence to survive high school. Had I gone to both bad middle and high schools, I’d probably be a loser by now. This teacher was condescending, but I felt that she saw negative traits in my mom, so she decided to step in since my mom wouldn’t appeal. Thank goodness she did. During graduation, my teacher asked if mom was coming. I replied, “no”. This teacher was upset. She said, “your mom should be here, what does she do?!? All she does is sit at home and watch tv”. It was an awkward moment but now that I am older, I am grateful someone helped me. 

Now, on to college. I got an acceptance letter…my mom didn’t want to sign for me to leave. My grandma thankfully stepped in, and made it a point that our family line needs education. My mom told my grandma that it’s not fair that I get to go to college and she didn’t. My grandma also said my mom was lazy….I on the other hand, was born with a natural go getter personality. I eventually found out that my grandma sent my mom to a low performing high school, which ended up closing its doors. 

I graduated college during the housing crisis. My grandma and mom were fake nice and invited me to move back home. So I did. But later, they made fun of me for moving back home and said I was a failure. Eventually, I moved out to a new city to pursue entertainment. Instead, I got a job offer at a toxic non profit (healthcare related, my mom’s dream), which my mom pestered me to take the job since it was more pay than entertainment, so I did. I ended up being stuck in that job for 5 years. It was toxic, and it also made my resume unmarketable to anything entertainment. During this time, my grandma had stroke symptoms. My mom did nothing…she basically called me everyday, putting on a show, saying it’s so scary. I drove home to see what was going on, and my grandma was fine. She even insulted me and said I think I am so special, and she actually has more money than me. I was annoyed with their insults so I drove back home, didn’t even stay the full 24 hours, which my mom gave me shit for. While I was driving home, my mom kept calling me, asking if I am home yet. The annoyances, stress, and anxiety caused me to speed to 100mph, which I got a ticket for. 

Eventually, my grandma ended up in the hospital. She actually had brain cancer. My mom’s boss got involved because my mom is too illiterate to understand anything. They wanted to run all these tests and MRI, but my mom refused to sign any liability waivers because she said it’s “too risky” in the event the 1% bad reaction happens (example: injecting contrasts for MRIs). The doctors confronted my mom, and wanted to know why she didn’t do anything when my grandma was having symptoms. My mom stood there, nervous, and it was so satisfying to watch. 

It was either operate for a chance to live for 6 more months, or send to hospice. She decided on the hospice route. Prior, the doctors told us that if we chose surgery and they had to resuscitate her and it failed, she could become a vegetable. My mom spoke of keeping her as a vegetable (not pulling the plug), so I can move back home. If this happened, she would have had a big surprise as I would have not moved back home and left her with this mess. 

When she got moved into hospice, another one of my coworkers mom visited to offer prayers. This coworker has a sister who works in entertainment, and said she can share her contact information when all of this is over. A year after my grandma passed, I asked my mom for her coworkers contact info. She refused to give it to me for a month. I eventually got an interview, and I am convinced my mom said horrible things about me to the coworker, that made its way to the sister, and then to management. The interviewer said he knew of my relationship with my mom…that’s embarrassing. He was nice though. He took me over to the sister (she helped pass my resume, but refused to meet me prior), but actually didn’t want to help…she didn’t even want to shake my hand. The guy who interviewed me felt awkward seeing this. After 2 drawn out interviews, I was ghosted. My mom texted me ""they had layoffs and they’re not hiring"". I told her not true, someone from my school got hired. She then replied, “they don’t like you” and that I need to get over it. It was that point on, that I decided i will no longer visit my mom. Btw, this was a major TV Network and people usually got hired through connections. 

I ended up having to take classes, low paying side work, and unpaid internships to rebuild my resume. I still have massive debt that I am working on paying off. I now work in entertainment. I accomplished this with no connections. 

During 2020, my mom was furloughed from her job. She found every excuse in the book of why she couldn’t file for unemployment, and basically expected me to help. Since she didn’t help me appeal for schools, and sabotaged my job prospects, I didn’t help her. This is an example of how karma comes back to you. She also asked if I made a lot of money since I am in the movie industry. No, I work a 9-5 (still extremely competitive and requires connections), I’m not a high paid actor. She blew through my grandma’s inheritance in a few months. She had a nightmare that my grandma is in hell, so she spends thousands of dollars a month on rituals to get my grandma to of hell. She even asked me for a few thousand a month b/c she ran out. I told her I don’t have that. She replied but you work, what happen to your savings?!?! Speak for yourself. I am basically in debt and living paycheck to paycheck because I had to invest in myself and rebuild ( with classes, taking unpaid internships)…because she wouldn’t invest in me. If was a millionaire, she’d prob ask for something outrageous, like $25k month. 

My grandma also intentionally kept my mom illiterate so she’d rely on her….and that karma came back to her as she was dying.

In my 30s, I am still trying to pick up the pieces, and just rebuilding day by day. The irony is that my mom thinks she’s a wonderful parent, when in fact, she didn’t even do the bare minimum. She tells everyone that I was evil to my grandma, and that I still rely on her for money."

I never had to quit a job before so if anyone could tell give advice on this.

The owner just yells at you like your his sheep and he’s your master. And I felt like I was in modern day slavery. More people have quit to go to college and majority high school and college students that work there. And Some people quit because how the owner treat them. Like I literally have screenshots of text of why people quit. I also have video of him literally screaming at the co-owner and calling his employees pu**y and he didn’t know I was around But a lot of them left but me leaving just hurt there business more.

I'm in life sciences (Biology major and CS minor) and my GPA isn't good unfortunately. Barely even a 3.0 yet. Still in the 2 range with subpar grades. I graduate in summer 2022 (2 semesters to go, and 1 summer 2022 course). 

I luckily was someone able to get some really good research- 1 research position and 1 internship somehow + few good CS projects I highlighted. I have performed really well in this research position and my internship as well. 

But unfortunately my grades haven't been good. Luckily I started to improve my grades this summer 2021 [got my first A in this summer course, I know :'(  ] but before that my grades have been very subpar, but I'm optimistic that I will be able to do well till I graduate in summer 2022. I'm trying my best now. But my past terrible grades still haunt me.

Up till now both these positions only asked for CV's and cover letters and 1 tech interview (for my tech internship) where I did really well. 

This postion, the PhD student got back to me on Friday evening, and said they are considering my application after seeing my CV BUT they just wanted my uni transcript first and then 1 reference from a Biology professor.

I'm too scared and ashamed to show my transcript. I just feel like crying whenever I see my transcript and don't want anyone to know and send it to somehow. 

This position is a really good opportunity and I don't want to miss this but I feel I ashamed. What do I do? Should I just send my transcript (and explain why I did not perform well in most classes) and reference letter which I have to first ask from a Bio prof? I only got my first ever A this summer. 

I am aware research requires really good grades and I'm just trying my best now to bring my grades up after so many struggles but I just feel so hopeless and helpless and ashamed. 

Would appreciate literally any guidance 'cause I feel so helpless."

So i asked my professor what he thought about these numbers. He said his sister-in-law “gets $70k and she’s been doing it a few years. And realistically starting we’re looking at 40-60k.

Are the salaries super dependent on specific fields?

So my problem is that I don't really know what to aim at. I don't really expect biggies like UCLA or GaTech to give me an admit. But some universities I really would like to go to are USC, NCSU , Stony Brook, NYU Courant etc.

The thing is that I fucked up big time in my 11/12th grades hence couldn't do anything in JEE  or even get into good state level colleges. Wanted to correct my mistakes and started working my ass off from the first sem at my college. Hard work paid off got decent grades and a job. So my confusion now is that since I'm from a relatively unknown/low ranked university and have 0 research experience do I stand a chance to get into the above mentioned universities?

Here is my profile :

Undergrad : Btech CS, 3.98/4 (Tier 2/3 university),  Got 2nd rank in the dept of CS

GRE.           : 324 (168 q, 156v)

TOEFL.       : 108

Research   : No significant research experience. Applied for a lot of research Internship programs at IITs/ IIITs but couldn't make it. But interested in Systems / Data Science. Applied and got selected for a DRDO research internship but then COVID-19 happened.

Projects : Couple of decent projects ( think Image Captioning, Compression using Huffman coding etc), 5-6 mini projects mostly AI, Web Dev and Android.

Internship : Android Dev internship in a start-up, ML Intern in TCS, Dev internship in LG, Software Intern at a big Healthtech company ( think UHG, Cerner, Philips etc)

Work Ex : Currently working as a sde in one of those Healthtech companies.

Achievements : Runners up in a LG WebOS hackathon conducted at a global level, Numerous merit scholarships during undergrad.

Extra Curricular :  member of the University Student Souncil, Vice President of Computer Society of India (CSI) branch of our college through which we have conducted various events.

Regarding SOP I am kind of confident that I can paint a good picture of myself and why I want to pursue masters .

But far as LOR is considered we don't have any reputed professors as such who publish at top quality journals or anything ( one of the reasons I couldn't really get into research during undergrad). I have heard this is a very important factor in some universities. Although I do have one professor in mind who has a PhD from IIT Dhanbad and is really close to me. (Also topped 2 subjects that he taught).
I can ask my manager for another LOR.

These are the universities I have in mind :

Ambi :
USC, 
NYU Courant,
NCSU,
Stony Brook

Moderate :
University of Utah,
Northeastern University,
University of Florida

Safe :
Indiana University Bloomington,
UT Dallas,
Arizona State University,
SUNY buffalo

Forgot to mention that I'm from India.

Any kind of suggestions are welcome. And please excuse my writing skills as it's my first post on reddit 🙏."

I can explain more about what happened and the reasons they gave for not extending me an offer in the comments if anyone is interested.

Only have 80 LC solved with no DP or backtracking proficiency. Can I grind hard for 2 months and try my best to secure new grad offer in Nov/Dec? And when should I start applying? Thanks"

(Part 2: Tupperman v.s. The Little League Baseball Team)

(Note: Bargain Bin Superheroes is episodic; each part is self-contained. This story can be enjoyed without reading the previous sections.)

**Tupperman finished lugging the Tupperware box twice his size up the ramp to the Capitol building.** Normally, a grown man putting six children in a box and dragging them around the city would have been cause for concern, but the fact that the children in question could have kicked aside the flimsy lid with ease, combined with the reassuring police presence following Tupperman down the streets, converted what could have been a crisis worthy of the *actual* Superman intervening into a mildly amusing spot of Sunday news.

""Mayor Clara!"" Tupperman shouted at the windows. ""Can I speak with you?""

I sighed and did my best to ignore him. There was a *procedure* for getting an audience with government officials, thank you very much.

There was a *thunk* at my window. I groaned and looked outside.

Tupperman was, true to his name, materializing various pieces of Tupperware and hurling them at my office. Empty boxes of plastic weren't very aerodynamic, but he was a decent shot with those lids. The police force surrounding him looked like they were pretty sure he was committing *some* sort of crime, but weren't exactly sure what. ""Come on, Mayor! Look, you and I both know this is getting ridiculous. I wasn't even in costume when these kids jumped me, and I *know* you little tykes didn't clear this with the authorities in any way. We've got more wannabe heroes than actual villains in the city nowadays, and these would-be crime-fighters are doing more damage to themselves and others than the villains themselves. Look, I may be a supervillain, but I have to *live* here, you know? Why haven't you taken any actions against this?""

Alright, that was going a bit too far. He was on the news; I didn't need people across the world sympathizing with a supervillain over the authority of the government. And yet I couldn't move to refute him; I didn't want to set the precedent that just anybody could get an audience with the mayor by throwing a few discount food containers at my window. Fortunately, the police realized this too, and motioned to arrest him.

He sighed. ""Fine. We'll do this the hard way.""

With a sharp flick of his hands, human-sized cages of plastic materialized from nothingness around the hapless police officers. The ""superhero"" team Tupperman had ""captured"" moved to stop him, but Tupperman leapt into the air and began sprinting towards me on an invisible staircase—probably creating stationary Tupperware beneath his feet as he ran to push off of, a common materializer-type trick. The continuous clatter of empty Tupperware bore out my hypothesis as he reached my window.

""These windows don't open, you know,"" I said, irritated.

He grinned. ""Supervillain, remember?"" With a plastic protective shell around one hand, he bashed the decorative window in; I didn't flinch as safety glass bounced off my shirt.

As he entered my tiny office, his expression grew solemn.

""Look, Clara, I knew you back when you were a kid. You're savvy enough to see that kids trying to play superhero is going to cause disaster, and you're in a position where you can do something about it. Why aren't you clamping down on these people?"" He asked.

I sighed. ""You of all people should know. What's the federal policy on superhumans?""

He shrugged. ""Unless they prove useful to society in front of a Federal Appraisal Board, their abilities must be neutralized before they become legal adults. Byzantine and counterproductive policy, and it's caused more trouble than it's solve, but—""

""It's caused this trouble, too."" I looked out the window. ""My best friend's daughter could make fragrances. That's all. She'd re-create the smell of her grandmother's perfume on the anniversary of her funeral, every year."" I shook my head. ""Of course, that wasn't *useful to society*. Feds stormed in and destroyed an innocent, harmless beauty all because they're *scared* of it. Letting young'uns be superheroes? That gives them an *in*. Crime fighting is *great* optics right now—even if all they've done is serve as an intern to police, the press'll call them a superhero and the FAB can't touch them.""

""...ah.""

""It's why I tolerate your existence, too. Tupperman."" I snorted. ""You're no serious threat to anybody, and we both know it. But you provide a convenient... punching bag. A whetstone, for our bargain basement superheroes to sharpen themselves on.""

Tupperman narrowed his eyes. ""You've seen me go all-out. I *am* a serious threat, when I want to be.""

I smirked. ""But you don't want to be.""

""Yeah."" Tupperman sighed. ""Fine. I'll make a show of the kiddos defeating me. Give them a chance to keep their powers.""

I squeezed his hand. ""Thank you. For giving them a chance.""

""Yeah, yeah, whatever. Do something dramatic and make it look like you fought me off, okay? I don't want your reputation to take a hit.""

I rolled my eyes and took out a gun. ""Make it *look* like I fought you off? You have five seconds before you're carrying around your internal organs in a Tupperware jar.""

He laughed and leapt out the window. ""Curses! Foiled again by our wonderful Mayor!"" He leapt down towards the junior superhero team. ""C'mere, you little tykes! Let's have a proper battle!""

About to work as system administrator. Can anyone help me find a career path? any job that I can do fully remotely?

&amp;#x200B;

Long version:

I just finished a summer internship with a company and they told me they would hire me as a system administrator once I finished my degree. I always liked developement as a hobby, I can build simple webpages using html css and js, and I've made some cool projects in python. I want to get some work experience as a developer, especially backend since I've never touched that part of developement. But any further than that I don't really know where I should go or specialize. 

I've seen online that DevOps is a position that would benefit from having experience in both ends but to be honest after visiting r/devops and checking some job positions with this title I think I'm not sure what a devops is anymore or what path I should follow before landing a devops position. Some people say devops would greatly benefit from backgrounds as developers or sysadmins, some people say it's completely different and it does not matter if you've worked as dev or sysadmin. I thought it had to do with website deployment. I'm confused.

Also I've been keeping an eye on cybersecurity since it combines more or less the things I like. But I see posts every day on r/cybersecurity saying how there's not much demand for cybersecurity specialists since companies don't really value cybersecurity, that and the fact that I don't see many fully remote positions in this field throws me off a little bit, I still think it's an interesting field nonetheless.

I've also considered cloud services (AWS, Azure...), just like devops some people say it greatly benefits from dev and sysadmin background but I don't know anything about this field, I just know there are some amazon/google certs and that's it. I see a lot of companies asking for people with cloud knowledge especially in devops positions. So I might look into it.

Those are the 3 options I've been eyeing for now. I've also considered just focusing on developing since it's easy to land fully remote jobs, however I feel like that would not really benefit from the stuff I already have knowledge about. 

I hope I can find someone with the same interests as me who's been working for some years so they can tell me about how they feel about their career path and stuff. Anyways thanks for reading guys."

Data Structures and Algorithms I passed but I did not really understand it and it felt like extra credit carried me. I haven't done any meaningful internships I think, just data entry with excel and such at a water company and it felt more like business work than Computer Science work. 

I would like to work on a personal project, but I don't know where to start and how it can be helpful.

The thing that I have been considering most, is that in order to graduate from my master's program, I ***have*** to complete an internship (in the manner of my choosing). While I'm not totally sure something like this would qualify, it would be an amazing opportunity nonetheless. I do recognize LDPs are extremely competitive to get into, but I am trying to decide if I should even bring up the idea to my boss.

For reference, in order to apply for internal jobs, you are meant to be in your current position for 1 year, which I have not been (\~9-10 months). I've seen other people switch with less time, so I know they have flexibility on this. I would have to leave my current position, which I'm sure he would take into consideration.

My boss does know I need to do an internship to graduate, and said he would stay on the lookout for me. My boss is fairly high up, office in the *Executive Suite* (1 of maybe 15 people) along with VPs, medical directors, and the such- so may actually have some ploy, if he decided to vouch for me. Does this seem like something worthwhile to bring up?

My boss is aware that my current job and degree don't align, and that I am likely going to be on the search for something new once I graduate anyways, or at least within a few months of graduation. I am in a supervisory position, and would like to be in this position for \~2 years, as this is the minimum 'requirement' for many jobs, both inside outside my organization; but would consider leaving for great alternate opportunities."

I have completed one research internship already and currently engaged in another. Moreover I have three research publications but I am not the first author in either.

So what I have realised about myself is I usually have a very tough time coming up with original research questions or ideas. In fact, I usually get excited to work on research ideas by others (which align with my interests) but never anything original.

In addition, when I imagine life after my grad degree, I would love to work in a place where I am part of building a solution to an existing problem.

Hence my fear for a thesis based masters. I have heard many people say that when pursuing a masters degree, choosing a thesis based masters is a better option compared to course based. 

However, I fear that during the research period of the masters degree, I will not be able to come up with a good enough research question or idea. Plus the idea of being devoted to a single research problem for an extended period of time somewhat scares me. What if I get stuck at some point in the research? What if I don't end up completing the thesis? Plus the level of self discipline and commitment required when doing a thesis based masters really seems daunting.

Can someone please help address my concerns? These questions have been on my mind for quite some time."

Hello, I'm thinking of doing an MBA(or if anything relevant to Prod Man comes up) in a few years and I was wondering what could help me get there. I intend on applying to deferred programs at the end of this academic semester.

**Education:** I study at a tier 1 engineering college with a GPA of 3.2 ; Major in Mechanical ; Minor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

**Career:** I have interned at a Big 4 in management consulting and in APM role at a Telecom giant in India.I intend on geting into APM roles in unicorns out of college.I do have the option of getting into consulting firms as well ; however Im not that keen on those because of bad internship experience, bad hours.I like to have my time for exercise &amp; sports, spending time with friends etc

**Extracurriculars:** I was a part of the core team of the College festival which is quite huge and was part of various councils in college, was a Teaching Assistant for courses as well.

**Future goals:** First principle thinking : Good pay, good work life balance   
Based on current thinking : PM roles in USA at big organizations

What can I do to boost my profile over the next 4 years or progress in the PM path? What is a realistic school to aim for considering GPA?"

I have recently relocated from the UK to Eastern Europe.

Over the past 7 years I have been working for a software company. I started as an intern and worked hard to get to being a Senior and I have been a Senior for the past 2.5 years.

I am currently in the process of looking for a job and I applied for a software company that I really like and is one of the best employers in my home country. The position is an equivalent - a Senior. We went through a round of 4 interviews and an excel test and I got a job offer, however it was 1 level below a Senior.

When the recruiter called to bring me the news she said that it is due to some gaps that they have identified in a specific parts of the job, so that is why they are offering me that other position. I have rewinded all the interviews over and over and over and I am certain that they could not have identified such gaps with the questions they have asked me, let alone be that specific in the feedback I received from the recruiter. I would understand if they called me and told me that I am not fit for that role, but I don't understand what would these gaps be that are so huge that they can't offer me the role. After all, they have a 6 month probation period so in my mind they could see if I would be fit and decide in the following months? I even got the test sent by a friend who recently started there so I had time to practice (it was exactly the same).

I have a meeting with the Senior Manager in a weeks time where we will discuss the offer and I will certainly bring that up and ask what specific gaps have they identified, but I am not sure if there isn't anything I could do to either get the Senior position, or to negotiate anything better?

As a 33 years old this would be a major step back to me as I thought I could make it to Team Lead/Manager in the next 3-5-6 years, instead of having to work myself back to Senior.

I understand I can decline the offer, but the employer is one that I see myself with long-term, therefore I would appreciate any feedback as I want to try and find a common ground before having to decline.

Thanks in advance!"

SO basically we studied how a microprocessor works, his internal architecture, how the instructions works, we did a lot of vhdl creating microprocessors like MIPS. We studied operating systems and other strange exames about optimization of digital electronics.

I would say it was a bit far from embedded systems, and this makes me really really angry. I admit that I have other useful knowledges (that i already forgot), but i have very few knowledge useful to the actual job. Anyway.. at least I know how an embedded systems is supposed to work at a general level and a very internal level, but i don't know how to make it function.. lol

I have had an internship where i learnt basic concepts of the practical side of the embedded systems. But I was still far and honestly i wasn't that productive. I went then to a company where i did completely different things but i learnt a bit of other programming languages.

I want now to turn my career into what i first choosed: embedded systems. I want to do it even by moving country (i am in Europe). So I will start applying in neighbour countries where engineers are more valued and payed.

I am quite motivated, my problem is i am at minimum experience regarding embedded systems, will i be able to get jobs? How can i do it? What should i do first? I am already trying to learn again the basics and maybe develop some kind of projects. How can I improve my probabilities to get employed?"

pefsol,3,2021-08-30,Should I quit learning for a job I hate?,speediemable,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pefsol/should_i_quit_learning_for_a_job_i_hate/,"Hi! I‘m a 20 year old from Germany &amp; currently learning to work as a physical therapist. I wanted to go to university &amp; study something to work in Corporate later on, but my Grades are too bad. I then started doing charity work for a few month &amp; looked for a place in education that interested me while I‘m waiting to go to University. (Every semester that I‘m not signed into an University my chances of getting are are getting better)

The Thing is I got into a not really well paid education for physical therapists (this job is extremely underpaid) and I was very happy, but I started to feel worse and worse. When I started my first intership I started to like the job; I worked in a hospital and I really liked my coworkers. 
As soon as I got back into school I was back to hating what I was doing. I‘ve got this feeling every day for the last three months and several months before my first internship. I don‘t get along with my classmates, I‘m not interested in what I am studying and therefore I am far behind. I feel like everyone is ahead of me and I couldn‘t catch up even if I wanted to. 
Additionally my boyfriend will move next year around October, while I will be stuck in this city for another year to train becoming a physical therapist. I think we would be okay with long distance, but it sucks either way. Especially when I‘m stuck here, with barely any friends, a job that I hate and little to no money if I need to drive to another city in order to see my boyfriend. We are together for well over three years, planning our future &amp; going really strong. 
But quitting won‘t just be because of him. I don‘t want to work in the job I‘m learning, I hate my peers, I don‘t get along with my teachers, I cannot find any interest for the things I need to learn. 

A friend of mine recently told me they needed someone on their team in an callcenter. I would earn way more, I know I would like my colleagues and the work I would do there. If I quit now, she will hold the position for me. I could work the next year there &amp; start university next year in October with my boyfriend. With my current waiting semesters and my final grades I would definitively get into the subject that I would like to study, while working in a great environment, earn almost twice as much as I do now. 

I‘m still unsure what to do, because I know it will be very hard to explain this to my parents - my older brother quit many things &amp; lived live on the wrong track for years. They always compare me to him whenever I do anything like him or wrong. I also wanted to quit my charity work I did before starting this education because I felt incredibly uncomfortable &amp; I hated it. I fear that this will just continue and go on like this, that I will never find a work that I really like. I do hope that working in corporate or HR will be „my thing“ but how can I know for sure? I plan on doing an internship, but even this won‘t guarantee anything. I usually love the work when I start it &amp; later on realise that I despise waking up in the morning &amp; going to work. This is not the life that I want. 

Did someone have similar experiences and could help me?"

This is the [post](https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/oap0uw/what_are_my_options/)
Basically I didn't know much about whats going on in the IT field. I was and still doing the internship. Thanks to all the kind people in that comment section as now I am can somewhat read and talk IT terms like stack, front end, back end etc.

Many things had happened after that post in my work. I had given a pretty complex (at least for me) task. That task was actually a blessing in disguise. At first my knees were hitting but after some late nights and violent hair-pulling, my manager was pretty impressed with my work. That task and its result really skyrocketed my confidence, and hopefully I can ride on that wave for a foreseeable future. It taught me that I should focus more on frontend aspects specifically Angular. Front end part on that task was the hardest I worked on. It literally gave me headache but after that I was able to tackle more front end problems relatively fast and easy.

Now I started to work on my own side projects. Even made a simple CRUD Angular material HR management web app. And I want to give it more features and functions which is where my free-time will be spent.

Now I am curious what is a good presentable project to work on for my portfolio to get an entry level or a Jr. front end developer role. I might be shooting a bit high for a Jr. position, but I am willing to work for it. My day-to-day task at work involves CRUD web app development. What will be an employer look for in a Jr. developer applicant? Is CRUD apps too common for a front end portfolio?

Thanks."
pegeyc,46,2021-08-30,An Error in the Order of Things,WeirdBryceGuy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pegeyc/an_error_in_the_order_of_things/,"I can remember that terrible morning all too well.  

A year ago, *exactly* a year ago, while absent-mindedly gnawing on a particularly resilient coffee bean during a break from my internship work, I heard a sound; a sudden chorus of screams, intoned, shrilly, with the notes of some immense and communal agony. Within seconds of being audible, the concerted screams arose to an appalling crescendo, an escalation of mindless, animal terror. The walls of my room shook from the sheer sonic violence; the impact of those pain-infused sound waves loosing long-kept dust from corners and shelves of my room.  

I rushed to close the window, and watched incredulously as it rattled against the force of the tortured voices. Their screams were not at all diminished by the flimsy glass barrier. Outside, I saw the neighborhood in state of public hysteria; people running, aimlessly, in every direction; their faces contorted into eerily similar expressions of stupid, unrelatable shock.  

Another crescendo fractured the glass, and another shattered it; and coeval with the violent fragmentation was the arrival a noxious stench—a fulsome and miasmatic emission from some foul source beyond sight, yet nonetheless disturbingly potent at my window sill; perhaps the gaseous result of a nearby bloated corpse’s violent eruption, or the wind-carried stench of burning or boiling garbage. I reeled away from the window, physically and almost *spiritually* repulsed by the abysmally offensive odor.  

Sensing the advent of some awful thing—I could not then say what, but knew with absolute certainty that it was inimical to human life—I leapt clumsily into action, gathering whatever was in reach and shoving it into my backpack. I yelled for Emeryk to wake up and pack something, anything, and hoped—as I pulled a jumper over my head the wrong way—that there was enough urgency, enough vague yet palpable terror in my voice to pull my brother from his typically deep sleep.  

Once finished, I left my room, sprinted down the hall, and nearly stumbled over my cat resting at the threshold of the kitchen, beside which always rests her bowl. Scooping her up—and ignoring the subsequent clawing—I moved hastily along the counters, snatching items at random and knocking others to the floor; telling myself that I’d return the latter to their proper places later. Moving autonomously, my mind barely able to maintain a level of cognizance beyond a state of galvanizing panic, I packed and zipped and shouldered the newly, almost intolerably encumbered backpack, and bore my burden back down the hall, recognizing—at first dimly, and then profoundly—that I hadn’t yet heard the familiar sounds of my brother’s awakening.  

With little regard for privacy and dignity, I burst into his room, pulled the covers from his body, yanked him by his thin little ankle out onto the floor, and screamed—quite madly—for him to pack his things, and follow me outside. As I watched, I finally, internally questioned the order I had so demandingly given; *why, exactly, do we need to pack our things? Why is it so gravely important that we leave the house, and venture out into day, where some assuredly terrible, foul-reeking nightmare is sweeping through the neighborhood—if not the entire town—and causing people to cry out in abject terror, in almost operatic vocalizations of agony?* 

But before I could answer myself, before I could even begin to formulate an answer, Emeryk came to stand before me, dressed in an unzipped jacket, beneath which was an old grey t-shirt. From out of the pockets of his jeans—holed at the knees, intentionally—bulged socks, and glancing down I spotted his bare feet between the laces of his sneakers. He held two bags in his hand, and somehow, he’d had the sense of mind and the time to fill each with a single kind of clothing: shirts in the left, pants in the right.  

I nodded approvingly, proud of his clear-headedness in the circumstances, and together we proceeded to run through the hall, while the manic screams permeated the walls and shook the pictures upon them.  

We emerged into no small scene of chaos. People ran to and fro, some screaming, others conserving their breath in order to facilitate faster flight from *something*; some still yet to be identified or even witnessed source of horror.  

Once outside, the smell seemed to me to intensify by several degrees of foulness. I felt a sudden lightheadedness overcome me; a sort of stink-induced delirium. I saw Emeryk similarly discomforted, and grabbed him by the shoulder; so that we could steady each other. 

Turning to the left—from which several of the frightened people had come—I saw what I at first thought to be a visually perceptible wave of heat. The air, in a space several meters wide and high, seemed to shimmer, quite violently, and ripple along the length of itself; like some nigh invisible sheet of plastic trembling in a relentless wind. Several of my neighbors, also turning toward the phenomenon, shrieked madly, and fell back onto their lawns and porches as if struck by some devastating blow. *It was only later, nearly half an hour after the arrival and departure of the entity, that I noticed the severe burns and rashes upon their skin.* 

Emeryk, standing just beside me and looking in the same direction, said, “psia mać”, and I found myself repeating the swear.  

“How...how can it even *walk*?”  

I turned to him, and saw an expression of depthless bewilderment on his face; there was no trace of the groggy, harshly awakened face I’d seen only moments ago. I quickly glanced back toward the rippling thing, what to me was at most a strange atmospheric event; and admitted to myself that it *was* certainly weird, almost surreal; but I saw nothing about it which then could’ve explained Emeryk’s state of utter stupefaction; and, furthermore, there was nothing about its motion—or its appearance—that bespoke of conscious movement; no suggestions of, or resemblance to, legs or *walking.*  

The thing moved past us—noiselessly, I should add—and I steeled myself against the miasmatic wave. Its “body” was several meters across, and I imagined the whole thing as a sort of immense cube, even as the figure rippled and trembled and shifted with a ceaseless violence. Farther down the street, others who had gone onto their lawns to investigate the noises and smells recoiled away as it passed them, and, again, some even fell to their lawns; as if they’d been struck by a blow or force of some kind. I do not know why my brother and I were spared such violence.  

Voices brought my attention back toward the opposite direction, and I saw a group of people approaching our lawn, and for a moment I wondered why they would leave their houses after the thing had *passed* them—why had I left mine, at all?—and then I saw, with a sudden and black horror, the *states* of their houses. Ruin had been brought to them all; as if the paneling, woodwork, and supplemental stones had all been assailed, thickly and pervasively, by some ultra-caustic element. Nothing, in the passage of that bizarre hexahedral wave, had been left unblemished; all was now horribly marred, warped, and broken.  

Begrudgingly, not ready to accept the reality I knew to exist, I turned around—and saw my own house, my *home,* in a similar state of advanced structural decay.  

Gathered around our lawn—why, I couldn’t and still cannot say, perhaps the sight of youth comforted them, or emboldened them—the crowd began to murmur, as *the thing* moved along and eventually, mercifully, rounded a corner; going on to besiege—with its evil and corruptive aura—the homes of some other neighborhood, before presumably vanishing as suddenly and as inexplicably as it had come.  

“It...it had so many limbs—arms, legs, *others*—and yet I just can’t see how it could possibly *move.*”  

“Limbs? What are you talking about? It was a sphere, a black, awful sphere, rolling along and reeking of death.”  

“No, I’m absolutely certain that that thing was alive—not some shape. But there weren’t any limbs that I saw; just a throbbing mass of well, flesh, I suppose.”  

“It was a cube.” I offered this almost unconsciously; I’d been listening with half a brain, the other half endeavoring to salvage what it could of my disjointed synapses.  

“I didn’t see anything. But I *smelled* it—an awful, overpowering smell. I don’t think I’ll never forget it.”  

“No, I don’t either.”  

It was this final statement to which the disheveled and distraught congregation professed unanimous agreement. While seemingly every person had seen—*or not seen*—one thing or another, all in attendance had smelled that indigestibly foul stench. This consensus brought us closer—physically in that reflective moment, and later on, too; as a people who had collectively experienced an awful, unexplainable perversion of nature.  

“What do think it was, really?”  

“I don’t think we’re supposed to know.”  

“Why do you say that?”  

“That’s just how I feel—how *it* feels, now. That thing was plainly not from here.”  

“From Niemce? From Lublin?”  

“Not exactly.”  

A somber mood then befell the crowd, as everyone digested—in their own ways—the import, the strange, otherworldly suggestion of this latest exchange. Having witnessed it firsthand, and taking into account the inconsistent observations of the others, I’ve come to a conclusion of my own: one that I think, given how little is known about *it*, is as valid as any other.  

I believe we all witnessed a sort *aberration* of reality—an error in the programming of the universe; an errant or maybe entirely superfluous line of code, which, with the start-up of some dimensional task, brought upon a disruption in the world; a glitch, so incompatible with our notions of mundane operation, that we all perceived it differently; the only constant in the experience having been the smell. Through the sense of smell, we had all detected it in more or less the same fashion, attributed more or less the same severity to the sensation, and I believe this happened only because, compared to sight, the olfactory sense is fairly underdeveloped.  

Basically, our brains can readily accept, can sufficiently comprehend even the most heinous of smells, but visual stimuli require more brainpower to process—demands more of the *mind;* and our minds, despite what we may tell ourselves, were not—perhaps never will be—ready for such an unreal thing.  

Some saw a mass of limbs, moving collectively or separately in a manner which could not have *naturally* effected movement. Others saw massive, seemingly sentient shapes and less identifiable geometric forms—spheres, pyramids, or, in my case, translucent, wavering cubes—move with an unsettling ease upon the unevenly paved street. We all heard the cries of our terrified neighbors, saw them fall to the ground as if smote down by the searing backhand of God himself.  

And we all smelled that unforgettable smell; that effluence, not of evil, but of.... *error.*  

I am sharing this tightly kept secret now, exactly a year later, because of a coincidence—or what I’m hoping, so soulfully hoping, is nothing more than a coincidence. While working on a program, I noticed a flaw I’d made hours earlier; an error which has stealthily and irreparably poisoned every subsequent line; I will have to undo hours of work to rectify the mistake, but that is not important.  

This computational error then reminded me of that *other* error, and then, immediately following the recollection of this uncherished memory, I noticed out my window a sort of shifting of the air; a distortion in the atmosphere above the street before my house; and this shimmering, turbulent oddity of pressure seemed to move, paradoxically, of its own conscious volition, as if carried along on many, possibly innumerable limbs—but that can’t be so, can it? Because nothing on God’s green Earth could use such obviously *useless* and *warped* limbs to propel itself in any direction, certainly not along the poorly maintained [street.](https://reddit.com/r/bryceverse)..."

Although I have zero experience---i.e., never worked full-time before,  never had any relevant internship experience, have very little coding experience, and have never written any large application (I have written only very few adhoc programs of at most 200ish lines)----my role will be a level 2 SWE (similar to L5/E4/L4/61/SWEII at A/F/G/M/T). The latter is because I have a phd in CS and the company I am going to work for directly puts someone with a phd at that level. (I never had to write code during my phd since I worked on theoretical stuff.)

Given my lack of experience and since I am not appointed at the beginner level, I am very worried about what lies ahead, and would like to use the 2ish months I have to prepare so that I can avoid being kicked out.

So my question is: do you have any suggestions on how I can best prepare for this job?

I recently came across the following book: The Missing Readme ([https://themissingreadme.com/](https://themissingreadme.com/)), which seems like a place I could start. Is it a good place to start? What other resources would you recommend?

In general, I would be grateful if you have any suggestions for me.

Thanks!"

Piata de locuri de munca in domeniul software development imi pare acaparata de job-uri de full stack sau mobile. Problema este ca mie nu imi pare prea interesante aceaste arii. Am facut mici proiecte pentru facultate/in timpul liber si am avut contact cu diverse framework-uri, dar nu e ceva ce ma atrage. Sunt mai pasionat de subdomenii ca securitate, criptografie, programare functionala, chiar si ML, dar problema e ca toate astea sunt cam de nisa din cate constat.

Intrebarea mea este daca e nerealist sa ma gandesc ca voi gasi un loc bun de munca in cele enumerate de mai sus si ar trebui sa incep sa invat mai multe pe partea de webdev, fullstack etc. pentru ca asta e tendinta pietei sau sa ma axez in continuare pe ceea ce imi place mai tare."

pekzvr,3,2021-08-30,Anyone done 2 full-time summer internships simultaneously?,fincareethrowaway,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/pekzvr/anyone_done_2_fulltime_summer_internships/," 

Undergrad sophomore here

End of freshman year, I got accepted for a corporate finance summer internship at a Fortune 500 for next year. The turnaround time for my response was pretty short, and it was a pretty strong internship where I'd learn a lot, so I accepted. Plus, due to pandemic uncertainty and the Delta variant rising again, I accepted since I didn't know if I'd get another internship offer again.

Fast forward to now, it looks like I might genuinely be able to land my dream internship (something I'd wanted to do since my sophomore year of *high school*). I'm in the middle of the application/interview process for this -- I applied since I thought I wouldn't really have that strong of a chance of getting in, and it would help get me used to applications, interviews, etc.) This internship has a good balance between econ and finance, something I really appreciated.

In the case I did get this dream internship, I would ecstatic. However, there's no way I'm reneging on the other offer since I gave them my word (and reneging obviously looks bad). So I was wondering, has anyone here done two full-time summer internships at the same time and succeeded?

I'm assuming it takes a lot of communication and keeping both internships in the loop. And with things most likely being in-person for next summer, transportation will also be a factor. Obviously if this is just not feasible, I'll stick with the first offer, but just curious, has anyone actually managed to pull this off?"

I've decided I want to try and make the switch into SWE. Currently doing Econ Major, Stats and Psych minors. I've been working on side projects, self teaching languages, all that stuff. 

If I do get admitted into the CS major, would it be worth it since I would be charged $15k in retroactive tuition? There are two benefits of a major over a minor for me. 1. I can take more than 1.5 FCE in 300/400 CSC courses. The issue with this is I'd only be able to fit in 2.5 FCE of 300/400 CSC courses into my final year, so the major really just allows me to take 2 extra courses. It really comes down to the second benefit of 2. being able to put major over minor on my resume. Would it really help my resume that much? I wouldn't be able to use it when applying for internships next summer, only post-grad internships and full-time jobs.

I may not even be admitted to the major, but I still need to decide so I can plan my courses. Any advice would be appreciated :)"

The internship is full-time, unpaid, and it will last 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, if things go well, I could be offered a paid position. I replied, saying that I am interested, but I also had questions for her about the internship, like how many hours per week would I dedicate to this internship, since it's full-time. What are my duties in this role? Will I receive mentorship, will I be working remotely, etc. I think it's perfectly valid to have those questions. This morning, I got a response email from her. She retracted the internship opportunity, saying that her company ""isn't looking to bring on any interns at the moment"". WTF?! If they don't have internships, why tell me about it in the first place? Just because I had some valid questions about the internship, you're just going to retract this opportunity? It is unpaid and 3 months is a long time. I need to know if I could commit to this because hell, I need to feed myself and pay rent!

I have always shown an eager attitude to learn and improve, am quick and responsive to feedback.

Many of the software engineering competencies I've been measured by at Uber, I have met, except the software engineering competency (which last week my mentor said I've made 'great improvements' in that category).

I am a rising senior, so I'm aiming for a full time offer after school, what are my chances of receiving one? And for those who got return offers, did your mentor/manager give any indication leading up to the offer, or was it under wraps until the offer was presented?"

Demo: 30M, Canadian but born in China.  


Edu: Top 3 universities in Canada. Overall letter grade is B which translates to 3.0/4.0 GPA. Took 5 years to complete as I chose to major in sociology in my 3rd year, but decided in my 4th year to switch to Economics (Last 3 years GPA 3.3/4.0). So overall ended up with a major in Economics and minor in sociology.  


Other Edu: CFA level 3 candidate. Have passed the exams and is now waiting for work experience. Should have my charter by matriculation (2022).  


WE: \~1.5 years as an administrative/processing assistant for a jewelry repair company. Shipping and handling of average \~100 packages a day. Processed hundreds of jewelry pieces a week. Examined and documented jewelry pieces that came in with great detail and also did quality check after the repairs are complete. Also engaged in customer services over email and phone.  


Concurrently I also did 2 months as a seasonal operations professional at Tiffany &amp; Co. Helped with ensuring smooth operations of the store. Tasks included customer service, jewelry and stock maintenance, and helping out with sales when busy. Was offered full time sales position at another store, but did not pursue as I wasn't very interested in doing sales.  


Decided the jewelry industry was not for me and wanted to try my hands on entrepreneurship as both my parents have their own businesses. Started my own wine export company and did that for around 2 years and 4 months. The business was to export local Canadian wine to China. Learned a lot about the process of starting and registering a corporation. Cold called and emailed a lot of wineries at the nearby wine region of my province. Went down there for a week to tour the wineries and to speak with the owners about potential business opportunities. Spent a few weeks in China to promote the business, spoke with the importer/distributor there and made sure they had the right facilities and licenses. Created my own marketing materials as well. Also contacted logistics companies to ship the wine. Did over 100K in revenue. Was a great learning experience, but ultimately competition was fierce and I felt like I didn't have the proper business/management skills to progress.  


Decided to switch to finance and wanted to enter an equity research role as I felt like that would give me more breadth about different industries and companies. I wanted to learn about how different companies operated and what were some of the things that can affect their business. So while I was still working on my company I registered for the CFA exams. Got an intern ship role at a finch company (provides financial models and company data/metrics to other firms/funds). The Company is still small but has many big clients. Currently work here and have been here for 2 years and 8 months. Got 2 promotions, went from intern to associate and am now an equity research analyst. Built 15+ complete financial models. Update \~70-80 models every earnings season. Improved 25+ existing models to industry standard. Conducted historical financial statement analysis and future period forecasting. Have completed numerous client requests. Also mentored interns and associates by checking their work and answering questions to help them gain more experience and technical knowledge. Also help out our team leader with various tasks and I often take over some of his responsibilities while he is away on vacation.  


EC: During undergrad was an executive at a student club. Planned and executed numerous events, both professional and social.  


Volunteered at multiple political campaigns (door knocking, lit dropping, cold calling, and helped with organizing and coordinating various events.  


Part of the social committee at my current company. Helped plan various events such as the holiday party, games night, movie nights, etc. Main event that I am responsible for are the virtual coffee chats. They are recurring chats where we match up participates for 1 on 1 and group chats. Great way to meet and connect with people in the company especially since we hired a lot of employees during WFH.  


Also part of my current company's recruitment process. Have interviewed a few candidates for intern and associate positions.  


Will be participating in leadership training at my current company starting in mid September to next Feb.  


Post-MBA: Since both of my parents have their own business and since I also tried owing my own for a while, I want to use the financial analysis and modelling skills that I've acquired plus the business knowledge from the MBA to help make an impact at companies. Whether that be working at a startup or at an established company or management consulting. I want to do more strategy/growth. If staying on the finance path, my hope is to get into PE/VC but I realize these are very hard to get into without prior experience.  


Target schools: T15, but hopefully T10. H/S/W would be a dream come true.  


I realize I did not post a GMAT score. The reason is I am still in the studying process and will be taking the exam in October with hopes of applying to schools during R2. I know that's a big chunk of the application process and it would be difficult to do a good evaluation of my profile without having a score first. But what I'm hoping to get out of this is an opinion on whether the other components of my profile would be good enough to get me into a T10-15 IF i can get a GMAT score that is at or above the school averages? Also would appreciate any recommendations on schools given the general gist of my post-mba goals (I probably need to narrow it down a bit more).  


Thank you! Any comment would be greatly appreciated."

I am on track to graduate in the spring of 2022 with a minor in math as well. I have a passion for software engineering and want to build a career in that industry. I have enjoyed all of my programming classes and spent a lot of time studying outside of the course requirements to improve my programming skills. 

I have developed a full-scale mobile application with a couple of friends that now has over 6k users over the course of 18 months (we are still working on it). I am basically the backend developer and have built out our project utilizing a few services on the google cloud platform. And I also just finished an internship at a startup company in NYC last summer. I worked with a lot of serverless technology on the AWS platform and integrating a few 3rd party REST APIs. 

At this point, I want to be a successful SWE for an array of reasons but basically, I genuinely love building and tinkering with code/software, and it pays insanely well.

My 5ish year goal is to work at a FAANG (of course) but this is more of a mentality since getting ready for a job in FAANG will also set me up for other great jobs in SWE.

I am confused whether a Masters's degree in Software Engineering is better than one in Computer Science or vice versa? The question seems obvious: I want to be a Software Engineer so get a master's in that. However, most of the FAANG engineers I see on linked in have Computer Science degrees. 

I'm also torn explaining the difference between the two to my friends/family. Any advice/comments?"

   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I go to a tech school as a CS major and RBE major. I recently was accepted into Amazon's internship program. A lot of people here are feeling left out that they didn't make the cut or that they aren't good enough to get into internships they applied to. I promise you we all have been there. I was a complete fuck up in hs. I couldn't focus, I fucked around didn't pay that much attention. Screw hs, I fucked around freshman year. I thought I was never gonna be able to get anything like this. Then one day, I picked myself up and started leet coding. I do about 1-2 questions a day and was able to learn the skills needed to pass. Do I think I am a god now? Fuck no I still sometimes think what if I just got lucky so far, and will fall. That is ok. I still get rejected. I applied to over 50 internships and got rejected by almost all of them. That is ok. No one in life is perfect. The only thing you need is the ability to get rejected over and over again and keep picking yourself up. I promise you it will work out for you. Don't worry if you don't get the perfect internship or the 500k job. Take everything as a part of life and a stepping stone. Just work day by day, brick by brick and I promise you it will be ok:)"

&gt;With this in mind, Google is pleased to announce the 2022 STEP internship in Singapore. It will be open to under-represented groups who will be in the second year of their university studies by the Summer of 2022 and are studying Computer Science or a related subject. This program includes three main components: a software project, skills-based training, and professional development.  
&gt;  
&gt;This program is open to all qualified University students and is committed to addressing diversity in our company and in the technology industry. Students who are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented in the technology industry are encouraged to apply.  
&gt;  
&gt;This summer trainee program includes a development project that you will work on with a team of Googlers and other STEP Interns. You'll enhance your coding skills, and gain exposure to new tools and programming languages. You will attend ongoing technical talks by senior Googlers, match with a Google Engineer, to guide you through your summer experience, and engage in social activities, community building and networking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to address some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.

It doesn't help that I'm Asian and from the Bay Area... but I am a girl though (so ig that kind of breaks the stereotype??)  


It just feels kind of pointless if I'm competing with all the Bay Area kids that have tons of internships and projects to show their CS passion. I've been seeing tons of discussions about how competitive it is to apply for CS and I feel kind of hopeless. I could apply as a more health-related major and then switch, but at top schools this would be pretty difficult :/"
pezrv6,1,2021-08-31,How do I help my little brother deal with my parents fighting?,RiddleEatsRainbows,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pezrv6/how_do_i_help_my_little_brother_deal_with_my/,"So just for context- I'm 20, in college, my brother is 12. Also, this is long. My apologies.

To put it simply, our parents do a fantastic job of putting on a show to the rest of the world that we have a really balanced and well-functioning household. In reality, our home environment is absolute shit.

When my dad's mom died over 10 years ago, he began drinking. This eventually became his coping mechanism whenever things went to shit- which in this pandemic, has been a LOT, especially financially. Ever since then, as a child I was pretty accustomed to seeing my parents fighting, my mom crying, and him occasionally hitting her. Relatives know nothing about this, because like I said- my parents do a very good job of appearing all perfect in front of other people. I didn't do much as a kid to try and intervene, and I doubt I could've done anything anyway.

As I grew older I started yelling back whenever I saw him drunk, because the smell of alcohol and the change in behaviour absolutely disgusts me. My mother took me getting older as a chance to get me to convince my dad to stop drinking because he listens to me more than her. It did work for a small while, but after my dad figured out that I was doing it under mom's instructions, he pretty much just ignored me. My mother told me to keep trying, but I eventually refused to try altogether because I hated feeling like some sort of problem-solving tool. Now I pretty much don't intervene at all, unless I sense danger aka my dad probably about to hit her. This is an active choice- if I let myself go I know I'd get caught in an endless battle of fighting my dad to no avail whatsoever. I know they won't get divorced over this because that concept simply doesn't make sense to either of them (plus when he's sober he's actually a good and intelligent person, pretty much the guy my mom fell in love with), and reporting my father is simply not an option because that would rip the family apart. I'd consider the option if my mom or I were earning, but that's not the case- she's a housewife and I don't exactly make a living out of internships, just some spare cash.

Now on to my brother- he's a kid. A very good, soft-spoken, sensitive and thoughtful kid. I've seen my dad fully sober before his mom's death when I was a little girl, but my brother has been seeing these scenes of fighting and yelling ever since... forever, pretty much. When I was in school I'd take him away to a separate room and distract him with video games, but things changed since I moved away for university- he started proactively getting involved in those fights. 

I came back home last year because of the pandemic, and have been observing the situation. Sure, the fights and stuff happen a little less now, but they're still just as intense. Over time I realized my brother is in the exact same situation I was in at his age- being exposed to stuff that's going to leave a permanent mental mark and caring too much about people, especially my mother. Not that it's a bad thing- from my perspective, however, he's just a kid who should not be dealing with this stuff. 

My mother has a clear strategy- she's realized that if my brother is in the room, the fight won't be as intense and there's a less likely chance it's gonna turn physical. But that's just less likely- he's seen the hitting a couple times, and I've seen the effect it has on him. I'm really not okay with my mother venting to my brother either. I feel like if she talked to me or any other adult it would be okay, but from my perspective, my brother is still a kid who doesn't know how to separate himself from situations like these. I think he gets too emotionally involved the more he's exposed to such stuff, even in conversation, and I'm worried it'll lead up to him developing trust issues or some form of trauma in the future.

I know at this point my own mental health regarding this is beyond saving- I care more about my brother's mental health. What do I do to help him? Again, I know the obvious solution is to report my dad, but that is simply not feasible at the moment considering his position as the sole breadwinner of the family and my mother having no intention to return to the workforce. My long term sort of undeveloped plan has always been that I would work hard, save my money and eventually work towards a point where I could financially manage myself as well as my brother, and hopefully my mom as well (although that's complicated because she still loves him). It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm determined to get my brother out of that environment when I can. Or even better, he'll do the same as me and go to university as far as possible from them. But that's all just exploring a very uncertain future."

I'm 26 and finishing my degree in computer science this December. I'll be honest I don't have any revelant internship experience. Just a previous IT internship and additional helpdesk experience for a year. My GPA is a 3.56 right now. I know it's a pretty bad scenario. I spent my summer working on other areas of my life, getting a temp job doing data entry and going to therapy for my depression and learning to drive (Medical issue). It's not like I wasn't doing anything but it seems I lack the confidence to get my own experience by learning a new language or practicing leetcode. I don't go to a great school, and I'm nervous about the job market. I think I'll focus on web and mobile applications for now and study the Essential data structures and algorithm to cover what's necessary. I just get the feeling like I messed up my shot at securing a job.

pf5gnz,4,2021-08-31,Should I study a Master in Bioinformatics with an Economics degree?,MadGlobin,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/pf5gnz/should_i_study_a_master_in_bioinformatics_with_an/,"Hi, I have a very simple question, and I would like to hear the thoughts of you guys who are more familiar with this field \[Bioinformatics\] due to your background, your job, etc.

I have a bachelor's in Economics and I'm still deciding on what Master's degree I should pursue. I am highly interested in the Data Science field: I have done numerous courses, read several books, I know a lot of R, Python, SQL, etc., and in fact, I'm currently working as a Data Analyst. I also took additional Math courses at college (real analysis 1, real analysis 2, real analysis 3, and ""advanced"" linear algebra, but we just covered like half of Sheldon Axler's ""Linear Algebra Done Right"" in the latter, while Baby Rudin in the first two and different books on real analysis).

I was drawn to Bioinformatics because I have seen different videos and articles online talking about how this field is the intersection of Computer Science, Statistics, and Biology (depicted with a Venn diagram), similar to what people say when they describe Data Science as the intersection of Computer Science, Statistics/Math, and Communication skills. Despite not having formal training in ""Computer Science"", I believe my work experience (4 jobs counting the present one in the span of almost 2 years and if we also count internships), all the courses I have completed, and all the material I have read in the past, help me to have some training in that area as well as Statistics (due to courses on ML. I know it's not the same, but there's overlapping in several aspects). However, formally, I do have a lot of training in Statistics: as part of the Economics curriculum, we saw 5 different statistics subjects, which included 2 on econometrics (where we studied time series models, panel data models, linear regression in-depth, etc.).

The only problem is that I don't have any training in Biology, Chemistry, or Medicine. I was always interested in these fields but formally I have not studied anything on that at college.

**Then, my questions would be,** given that information:

1. Do you believe I have the chance to get accepted into a Master's program in Bioinformatics?
2. Do I necessarily need formal training in Computer Science and/or Biology/Chemistry/Medicine to get accepted into the average Master in Bioinformatics?
3. If I study online courses on Biology/Genomics/etc. (say, on Coursera), would this increase my chances of getting accepted into the average Master's despite not having the formal training in those fields?

I have researched more about Bioinformatics and I'm really interested. Particularly, I love the fact that it is constantly evolving and there's always something new to learn. I love to learn and this is just one other reason why I would love to study this.

By the way, I'm not from the US or Europe. I'm from Latin America.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts guys. Thank you so much for your time!

I have a bachelor's degree in strategic communication, obtained in 2015. I switched from a journalism major to strategic communication my junior year of college - I was always told I was a great writer, followed that my entire childhood, and thought journalism would be a way to make money off of that talent. I switched to the other side of the coin when I realized that I didn't enjoy going to classes or completing my coursework, going out and finding people to interview and talk to, going to networking events, applying for internships, was too much for me, because at the time I was also in with the wrong crowd and had developed serious heavy substance abuse issues. I was able to clean myself up with help and graduate in 4 years, but my issues in the city i lived in made me need to move back to the suburbs, away from the triggers  i spent 4 years living in. 

there aren't many PR firms or jobs in the suburbs, you pretty much have to go into the city if you don't want to apply to a ""marketing"" job and end up going door to door for the cable company. I took the summer off post-graduation to reevaluate what options were available to me. I quickly got the thought in my head to just forget my degree field and search for an office where I could get my foot in the door, as I also had a very minor record (misdemeanor weed possession) from my time in the city. I really didn't even think anyone would hire me. 

after years of therapy and self reflection and honestly, hard work, I know that my substance abuse issues stemmed from my low self esteem, my constant negative self-talk, and my feelings of inadequacy. The reasons for those feelings are probably better for a different sub, but they affected how I saw myself career-wise at the time. I never had one passion or thing I was interested in pursuing as a career except for writing when I was in school, which fell off once I began using substances and I haven't been able to reclaim that passion since. I do enjoy painting, photography, hiking, biking, and camping as hobbies. for work I never seemed to have a direction, but I do have a ridiculous work ethic for whatever task is at hand. I like to learn, be challenged, and help people. I will never want a job where you sit on your phone 8h/day. 

So I took an entry level data entry job at an emergency lighting manufacturing plant after the summer post-grad.  I then moved up to an operations admin role where I learned ERP, production planning, shipping and logistics. I continued to go to therapy and make headway in building up a bit of self esteem. After 3 years I was fed up with the company culture (ultra-religious and micromanaging) and took a role in the warranty department of a national, fortune 500, new home construction company. I have been there for 3 years and have moved up to, essentially, assistant manager of the department.

The work consists of coordinating warranty service for owners that purchase the homes. Scheduling inspections, scheduling contractors to make repairs, responding to emergency calls, etc.

The issue here is not that I dislike the work, my coworkers, or the company culture - its the behavior of the owners of these homes, that is causing me to start to be seriously concerned about my mental health and ability to stay sober. 

In short, they are rich lawyers and doctors and etc who throw literal toddler temper tantrums when an issue is not covered under warranty. A warranty that they signed at their agreement of sale, that they probably have never read. They spend hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions on cookie-cutter prefab homes, made with the cheapest materials possible, installed by the lowest bidding contractors. I assume they feel some buyers remorse for not doing the proper research (as one quick google search of the company's name will lead you to thousands of news articles, social media posts, etc about how their builds are utterly overpriced crap with serious architectural issues) and therefore feel entitled to scream and curse and whine and write letters to the CEO because they were fooled out of millions of dollars. 

I could write entire novels about the shit I run into in a day. I send appx 40 emails an hour while also on the phone and shoving lunch into my mouth while at my desk, no lunch breaks. I deal with idiot contractors who can't be bothered to show up to an appointment, and then I get screamed at that the owner lost money by staying home waiting for them and wasted their time. I have to kiss these entitled people's asses. The stress of something out of my control going wrong and me getting blamed for it and having to deal with the fallout is burning me out. The volume of claims I deal with is too high. Upper management just tells us we need to do more. 

I never wanted to be in a front-facing role, I enjoyed working on spreadsheets and MRP at my last job a lot more than this. I enjoyed looking at inventory data and telling our buyer what needed to be purchased when. I was beginning to find some fascination in lean theories and applying them to the warehouse. But I couldn't stand the work environment, the religious bosses, the ignorance of people twice my age who's mistakes I fixed daily. 

I'm now afraid I have a useless degree with no experience, no creative portfolio to back up my creative interests if i ever wanted to pursue them professionally, and no clear industry experience or resume-building roles thus far. I fear all my work and time has been wasted just doing what I could do, learning whatever I can, ""proving my worth"". But I think I really need to start searching elsewhere or else the stress of this position might set my personal progress back quite alot. I love my coworkers and it's a hard decision, but I have to weigh mental health vs. trying to stick this out. It's been 3 years, and with the pandemic people's attitudes have only gotten more harsh, entitled, and impatient. 

my fiance and I bought a house in January, so I also feel like if I go anywhere else I won't make enough to afford our bills. 

I need a bit of a smack in the head to tell me to stop thinking in absolutes, and I need some advice on what I could look to do next. Is it worth it try to re-enter the PR / marketing / social media world? Or a more creative field, or something partially creative/partially data based like UX? Or to try to re-enter ERP/MRP/Production Planning? 

I enjoy being outside, being challenged, helping people, being allowed to be creative, working as a team and independently, contributing to growth and efficiency. Again I'm sorry if this is long and rambling."

1. Are you currently in the final rounds of interviews or have offers with any other companies?

What is the purpose of this question? Does answering yes make me seem like a more desirable candidate? Would it result in a higher offer within the salary range? Or could it have the opposite effect and have them pursue other candidates and not waste their time with me. 

2. Are you willing to work long hours?

pf8snm,1,2021-08-31,Some good learning problems,ghouleon2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pf8snm/some_good_learning_problems/,"Hey all,

I have been reading a lot of reading on this sub of individuals having problems figuring out what to learn and why. Thought I’d provide a couple of problems that I have used to train interns and do coding interviews for new hires. I hope this helps! These are based on some actual problems that I have had to solve in my career as a consultant. I’ve been coaching/mentoring interns and junior developers for many years, and usually these projects will be continually built up over 3-6 months.

Disclaimer: I do ask usually that these are done in specific languages, but I would highly suggest doing it in the prescribed language, then try and figure out how to do the same thing in a different language and can help grow your research and problem solving skills.

1. Using PHP, create an authentication service that takes in a username and password and verifies that the user can log in. Provide Postman and unit testing proof.

Why: Secure authentication is an important pattern to understand. Doing this in PHP can provide a challenging problem outside of the typical tech stack.


2. Using Java, MySQL,and Angular, create a simple customer entry form that stores customer information. 

Why: this teaches full stack development, in my experience, you will have to work in full stack not just on the front end or the back end. Understanding RESTful API’s and frameworks such as Angular can give a glance at full stack development patterns.


3. Using Python, create a bot using Panda to pull the most recent 25 tweets for a specific company. Advanced: perform sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine if they are positive or negative.

Why: teaches calling external API’s, getting API tokens, and basic ML principles.


I apologize if you don’t find this useful, but thought maybe if someone is struggling on what to learn or how to move forward this might help! Feel free to add your own questions and build on these! Have fun 😊"

pfa2j3,383,2021-08-31,How to Succeed at Berkeley,johnnydaggers,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pfa2j3/how_to_succeed_at_berkeley/,"Hello new Berkeley students!

Over the years I've written a couple of long comments on posts here from people who find themselves struggling part-way though the semester. People seemed to think they were pretty helpful, so I thought I would try to give you all a leg-up and frontload the advice now.

For context, I did my undergrad at Berkeley in engineering and I'm finishing up a PhD at Cal. I have been a TA and a GSI and have seen courses from the ""other side.""

Obviously a lot of this may have to be adjusted to adapt to the hybrid system we're using right now due to COVID-19, but the main themes still apply.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Getting straight A's is not as hard as people say once you learn ""the system"". Most of the 4.0 students I knew used the system. I was a solid B/B- student for two years until I figured it out the system myself and then I had a 4.0 every semester after that.

One caveat first, this advice is for students in engineering, math, and the sciences. I don't know how relevant this advice will be for students in the liberal arts.

Here's the system:

1. **Never skip lecture.**  Even if you think they're not helpful, boring, or whatever, you still must go. It is way easier to stay up to speed on assignments and exam material if you're actually going to class. Professors tend to drop *huge hints* that aren't in the course notes or books.
2. **Do whatever you need to be mentally present in lecture.** It's really important to be mentally present during class. Turn your phone off and physically separate it by giving it to a friend during class if you have to.
3. **Do not skip discussion sections, but bail on bad GSIs.**  Again, be mentally present there. Put your phone away. Take really good notes in section because this is where they present tips that will be on the exam. If your GSI is bad at teaching or you can't understand them, find another section if possible. Give yourself every reason to stay mentally present.
4. **Actually do the readings before class.**  You don't have to ""read read"" it, but you must know ahead of time the core concepts that will be covered in lecture. The second/third time you see something is usually when it ""clicks"" and it is way better for your grades if that happens while you're seeing the material how your professor presents it.
5. **Treat unfinished assignments like you're playing Russian roulette.**  Unfinished assignments should make you very uncomfortable. Every day you postpone finishing a homework is like adding a bullet to the gun. Sure, you might be able to finish it the night before, but what if something unplanned comes up? That cute guy/girl in your class wants to get boba but you have a homework due tonight at midnight? Now you have a tough decision that leaves you feeling bad the next day either way you choose.
6. **If you are struggling with a problem on an assignment or practice exam, move on and revisit in office hours.**  Math and physics majors may tell you otherwise, but in my experience there is actually very little to gain in terms of learning by hitting your head against the wall. Get in front of the professor or GSI at the earliest available opportunity (office hours or discussion) explain your difficulty and what you have tried so far, and then ask them to help get you unstuck. If you're following  *Rule 5*  you should have no problem finding a time to talk to them before the due date.
7. **If you are doing Rules 1-6, you probably don't have to study much for exams.** This was the most surprising thing to me. **""Studying"" is the biggest pyramid scheme in college that wastes your time**. Being in a library reading will not magically make your grades better. Instead, what you should be doing is ""practicing."" If you have been keeping up with the class properly, then you probably just need to do a practice exam or two before the real thing and you'll very likely get an A. Review solutions only after you have finished completely and go back through the solutions to problems you missed and think about whether there are any strategies in those problems that you could add your arsenal. Once I started following the system. I would spend maybe 3 hours reviewing before midterms and finals and still ace them after I was on the system.
8. (Bonus)  **Ask your GSI/professor to help you understand why you got exam/homework problems wrong.**  This is a really nice way to discover holes in your knowledge or any misunderstandings you have about concepts. This is the stuff that kills you on the final exam, and reviewing missed points on assignments and exams with experts on the material is the most time-efficient ways to stitch up those holes.

**At Berkeley you will learn that ""working the hardest you have ever worked in your life"" will still not be enough to succeed.** You have to work *better* than you have ever worked in your life in order to achieve true success in this world.

**Success = Effort x Effectiveness**

Becoming really effective means taking on a growth mindset and actually putting in consistent efforts to strengthen your weak spots. The system I presented above is really good at helping you find and address those weak spots.

Finally, I want to address mental health issues. This system is not incompatible with learning disabilities and/or depression. I know this because I was diagnosed with dysgraphia, ADHD, and depression and implemented the system in my life while dealing with all three at Berkeley. Everyone draws a unique hand in life and it's up to you to figure out the best way to play it.

However, no matter who you are, Berkeley is naturally going to be  *stressful.* I think college is stressful for just about anyone at any institution. Stress does all sorts of weird things to people's mental state, so if you're not proactive about it you can succumb to apathy and depression pretty easily. Instead of being reactive to the challenges that school throws at you, you have to be proactive and make sure you are keeping your brain healthy so it can resist self-destructive behaviors. Here's my advice to kill the stress and succeed in a difficult undergrad institution:

1. **Make getting 7+ hours of sleep every night your #1 priority**. I know this sounds like an impractical thing to make your #1 priority, but sleep is the absolute top thing that allows your brain to resist stress. If you can achieve solid sleep you will be 2-3x more productive during the day and actually spend  *less*  time working to get the same results in your classes. Even when you have something due the next day you must follow this rule because otherwise you will consistently not get enough sleep and procrastinate your work up until the last minute. It's a deadly cycle that will destroy your productivity and mental health and put you right back in this position.
2. **Eat at least 3 (healthy) meals per day at reasonably spaced intervals and drink lots of water.**  Your brain needs the proper nutrition and hydration to function. If you're skipping meals because you're late to class, you're sabotaging your brain's ability to function properly.
3. **""Relaxation time"" must actually be relaxing.**  Watching tv/movies or using social media is actually very mentally exhausting without us realizing it. Visual entertainment is extremely stimulating for our brains (which is why we get the ""*gooood chemicals*"" when we watch it.) If you need to relax after a long day of class, go to the gym, do yoga, meditate, draw a picture, or go for a walk instead of watching Netflix. You'll be amazed what 15 minutes of mindfulness can do for your ability to get a lot done afterwards.
4. **As soon as a reading/assignment is assigned, work your butt off to get it to 80% and then put it down.**  This is the key to getting straight A's at Berkeley. You have to give yourself enough time to mentally ""chew"" on material and seek out help in office hours, which is absolutely impossible if you're rushing to finish it before a deadline. Following the  [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), getting 80% of an assignment done should only take 20% of the total time. Skim through the reading/notes before class to get to a retention level of about 80% of what you would get in a real reading of the material (this means you understand the main points and can write a rough outline of what is discussed). In class you'll get the other 20% filled in for you or at least have an idea of what sections to go re-read. On homework, if you get stuck on something, put it aside and work on the next part of the assignment until you have about 80% done. Then go to office hours and ask for clarification/hints on the parts that didn't come quickly to you. You will find the material in your classes much more interesting and motivating if you work this way.
5. **Never, ever skip class unless you really can't help it.**  This is the other thing that truly unlocks straight A's. Stress largely originates from uncertainty and the fear that comes with it. ""What will be on the exam? What if I didn't study that thing? What if I fail the exam? What if I don't get a good internship because I have a bad grade?..."" The easiest way to combat this is to just go to class and be mentally present. Professors will tell you exactly what they expect you to know in class and lectures push you to think in ways you would not alone. There's a reason that university lectures did not go extinct after books were invented. Trying to catch up after just one day of missed class is a killer headwind to overcome so do everything in your power to avoid giving yourself that handicap. It really kills motivation to go to the next class if you missed the previous one.

The key to college is doing less work but doing it consistently as opposed to chaotically scrambling from one task to the next while taking liberties with things that help you maintain mental health. Optimizing for short-term gains over long-term gains is what gets students sub-optimal results."

So  they offered me an intern position with an entry level salary and a  salary plan. I've told them that I will take the offer with a low salary  in the first 3 months but after that period I want to negotiate my  salary.

pfc1u7,4,2021-08-31,Internship hunt strategy,abercrombie-CEO,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pfc1u7/internship_hunt_strategy/,"Hi everyone I’m a CS junior from a T15 school hoping to land a summer 22 internship. Since I started applying, I’ve realized that I’m going to need to practice Leetcode before I can get past a lot of these interviews.

My question is, should I delay applying to more companies until after I have a month or so of practice under my belt? That way I don’t burn through all the jobs before I’m ready to actually pass the interviews.

Another question, how do I find companies with more relaxed hiring practices than the top tech/finance shops? I want something bigger than a local startup, but a no-name regional company or something would be perfect."
pfcejj,3,2021-08-31,Worried my doctor will take me off my medication due to weight loss,cbaket,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pfcejj/worried_my_doctor_will_take_me_off_my_medication/,"Quick background:

First prescribed 10mg adderall IR in October 2019, BID. Dose increased in March 2020 to 15mg, BID.  Dose increased in March 2021 to 20mg, BID 

For reference, I am a 5'5 late 20 something female
Appt. in October 2019 weighed 139pds
Appt. in March 2020 weighed 136 pds
Appt. in March 2021 weighed 125 pds
Current weight per my at home scale: 119pds

When I went in for my appointment in March 2021, I was already nervous as I knew I had lost weight.  During my previous appointment my doctor had mentioned keeping an eye on it as ""you don't have weight to lose."" 

Of course my doc addressed the 11 pound weight loss and I discussed how the last year had been hectic as I got a labrador retriever puppy in March 2020 &amp;amp;amp;amp; anyone that has ever owned a lab knows they are ACTIVE which means I was doing a LOT more outdoors, especially hiking. I also was in graduate school, completing an internship, working full-time AND was dealing with everything that comes along with having to reschedule your wedding due to a certain pandemic we're dealing with...so my life was hectic to say the least. 

For the last several weeks I've noticed my appetite is gone most days and there are many days I consume under 1,000 calories, but I don't necessarily attribute this to the adderall. I'm in a second graduate program working towards becoming a School Psychologist and still working full-time...honestly, I'm stressed AF and feel this is more why I'm struggling with sleep and my appetite is gone....leading me to lose another 7 pounds (at home scale weighed me at 119 BUT home scales are always a little off) 

I know I need to bring this up with my doctor
as part of me is concerned it's due to issues concerning my autoimmune disease, but I'm nervous he is going to take me off my medication and the thought of working full-time, being in an advanced graduate program without my medication makes me even more stressed. 

I don't know what I'm hoping to get out of posting this, maybe someone has experienced something similar and can provide some insight?  Or a helpful way to address my concerns with my doc?  Maybe I just needed to process what I'm thinking concerning this issue? I don't know, I just don't want to worry my husband and my family so I turned to Reddit.  Thanks in advance for any responses!"

I'm kind of stuck at the moment, I'm not really sure what to do next. I was kind of forced to move to Germany 4 months ago, tried to learn a little bit of german and I am at A1 level but I really don't have the time, dedication, and desire to learn a 3rd language. I am a computer science graduate, I want to get a job as a front end, worked with HTML, CSS, JS and Vue.js before, and for the last 2 months I also learned some Node, but right now I'm still focusing on Vue and the front-end and after getting 1-2 more medium-big projects on my resume I want to start applying, but I know the language will be a big problem, getting a entry-junior level job without german, only with english will probably be extremely hard since I have no working experience in the field either. I was wandering if it would be possible to get a remote job from UK while living in Germany, a remote junior job or internship, would that be even harder, or even possible?

TL;DR Can I get aremote junior job or internship in UK while living in Germany?"

I currently have a cgpa of 3.73/4.0 going into my senior year at National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST Islamabad) which is ranked 143 globally for CS major by QS. 
I want to get opinions if I have shortlisted my universities correctly. My resume consists of a research internship in deep learning with a capstone project and an industrial internship in a Software Development Intern capacity for a Canadian software house. 

I will be taking my GRE soon and hope to get a score of about 320-325..
My shortlisted universities include:

- UC irvine - masters in data science
- University of Rochester - masters in data analytics
- Ryerson University - masters in data analytics
- University of Manchester - masters in data analytics

My top choice is UCI. And I am also enrolled in the Google's certification for Data Analysts, which they claim is enough to land a Data Analyst role.

My only concern is that I will be a fresh grad with only a couple of internships and no full time job experience, will that be something that hinders my chances?

P.S: I don't intend to pursue academia hence i am only applying to coursework based programs. I intend to work in the industry upon graduation.

Feel free to evaluate and advice accordingly. Thanks!"
pfg0yk,11,2021-08-31,I’m starting an Internship in a month and I don’t feel like I know anything because of online school,Funblade,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pfg0yk/im_starting_an_internship_in_a_month_and_i_dont/,"So the title is pretty much it. I will be starting as an electrical engineering intern at a company and from someone I know who is currently working there as the intern I will be doing a lot of circuit stuff. The problem is I just finished a course in circuits and I still feel like I know nothing because of how it was taught. 
Our labs were supposed to teach us how to put together circuits using breadboards and learn multisim but we weren’t given any actual components so it was all done in tinkercad with the TA giving us the answers because she didn’t care. 
This was the professors first time teaching after graduating and did a poor job as well as the normal struggle of online school. 
I don’t feel like I know the basics and struggle doing any circuit analysis. 

I have my notes, but I need online sources to learn all about circuits (or at least the basics) before I start my internship in a month. I don’t wanna fail my internship before I get started. 

Any tips and resources are greatly appreciated."

pfgonc,7,2021-08-31,Worried about academic LOR’s. Working a job. Can I do something in the next year to improve on this?,noir_geralt,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pfgonc/worried_about_academic_lors_working_a_job_can_i/,"Hi all, I’m from India and currently work in a quant based company established in the US (my seniors/managers are from the US). I wanted to apply to Masters Programs in CS &amp; Statistics/ML (I haven’t decided the exact field as of yet) in Fall’23 so I seem to have quite a bit of time to hone whatever is lacking in my resume. 

I graduated in 2020 from one of the top institutes here and have a decent GPA of 9.05/10 (rank 3 in my department). In addition to that, I think I’ll be able to score 320+ in the GRE and also have a decent resume for applying. I think I have done decent course projects in my undergrad, though I don’t have any good CS papers to showcase. 

There are two things I’m mainly worried about:-

1. Lack of academic papers in the field I’m applying. I have heard that having papers is good but with 2 years of experience in the field, perhaps that is not as big of a problem?
2. LOR’s — see below 

Many premier institutes like CMU, Stanford, Georgia etc. ask for 3+ letters of recommendations. I can get one from my current supervisor at my job, I think.  One LOR, I can get from one of the two internships I had done (I’ve tried to connect with the other manager when I had gotten my job but unfortunately did not get a reply)

Other than that I need an academic reco. Problem is, I’m extremely scared to ask any of my professors for letters of recommendations. I’m hesitant to send an email to the prof. under which I had done my undergrad project since the project hadn’t gone well especially since it was quite open-ended and it was disrupted/slightly unfinished due to the pandemic. She did give a reference during my job search but was basing it on my grades in her class (which were nothing spectacular, 9/10)

I have around 5-7 subjects in which I had scored quite well but I’ve always kept a low profile in college and I’m not sure if any of the prof’s know me by name, especially when I’ll be asking them after 2 years of experience. Also, most profs in my college give recos on the basis of projects done under them. 

Even if I manage to get a reco from one of them, I’m not sure what the quality of the recommendation will be like. Can I make use of this time (the whole next year) to get some good academic recommendation? Is it possible to do this along with a job? Or am I overthinking everything and my profile seems okay?

I don’t want anything lacking with my profile when I’ll be applying next year, since I really want to get into the premier institutes I have in mind. 

Thank you anyone for going through this!"

A recruiter recently reached out to me about a software engineering internship position within the MIG (Mass Infrastructure Group, formerly Enterprise Networking) team in San Jose. I was wondering if anyone had experience working there or is familiar with what it is? The only thing I understood is that it's related to computer networking (only have some experience in C, no networking stuff though) and seems to be more hardware related since it talks about silicon chips on their site. Also there was an interview with the teams VP which talked about 5G. If anyone could shed some insight as to what the team exactly does I'd really appreciate it! Am definitely interested in delving into networking and lower-level stuff.
