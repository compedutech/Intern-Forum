I feel at the end of this school year I'll have gained knowledge about how to build more professional looking code, but all I have to show for now is a few hackish projects. 

This may be a misconception, but I feel when companies want a student in their third or fourth year, they basically want someone who can do full-time employees work (which maybe I could, but I would need a lot of mentoring and time). Many internships ask for candidates to have a ""strong understanding in X language"" or ""3+ years experience in X language"". I can code in Java, C, Python decently well, but I wouldn't say that I have mastered any, I know I have a lot to learn. 

So yeah can someone give me advice on what companies look for in a student intern? "

**Backstory**
When I graduate about two years ago, I worked in the film/tv industry as a freelance video editor. Money was okay when I worked, but the work itself was inconsistent and unsteady (worked only as long as the show last), then I'd be left without a job and looking. Some people like this lifestyle, but I realized soon it wasn't for me (too much anxiety with looking for work). In short, my summary of the career prospect of the film/tv industry based on my experience: grim at best, exploitative at worst.

I finally managed to muster the courage and finances to switch career paths into something I thought would have more stability and career prospects. I had a bachelor's degree in broadcasting, and an minor in english + two years of freelance tv editing experience. Basically, nothing of direct experience other than soft skills I can really leverage to make a sturdy career change.

But, I figure the most overlap was in advertising. I networked with some classmates who work in the industry and managed to interview and land an account servicing internship (fortunately it was paid - minimum but at that point, i was expecting unpaid even) at a top advertising agency. And this is where I've been the past three months. I joined with a smaller department within the agency and worked super, super hard. I stayed late often and really impressed the team and the supervisors. If tv/film taught me anything, it's how to value the opportunity to have stable job - and I made damn sure I'd do everything in my power to have one.

My initial contract was for 2 months. When that was up, I was extended for another month with my boss promising me that by the end of the month, i would be hired on full time to the team. Another lesson, I learned from tv/film, promises mean nothing until you either sign that contract/or receive that paycheck. I continued to work hard, ensuring them that at the end of the month, I was the only viable candidate.
 
Then two unfortunate things happened: 1) The team unexpectedly lost a client. 2) the new business pitch they were 90% sure they'd get, didn't happen. Suddenly, there was no more room in the budget to hire another full time staff. But, I still had the full support of my department and supervisors who went to HR and asked if any other department in the agency was hriing (4th quarter - rare case).

Then a week ago, HR replied they had an opening with another team and asked me to interview the next day. this was 5PM. I knew it'd be a late night cause I was helping prep finance reports - left the office at 10PM, got home at 11:45PM (prepped for an hour), woke up at 5:30 to get to the office at 8AM to finish an important new business presentation by 11AM to finally prep for another 2 hours before interviewin at 3PM.

I knew I had a bad interview. Everything came up super rehearsed and I messed up on some big questions. I just found out now that I was not selected to move on to the next round of interviews. I have another 2 weeks with this company (they extended my contract again for another 2 weeks), but I'm so disappointed right.

Please, help me try to find some positives here. This company won't likely be hiring again until next year. Do I have enough experience to apply elsewhere? 

**TL;DR** Interned at a ad agency for 3 months. Despite praises and recognized hard work, didn't move on to the second round of interview against external candidates. "

However around the end of February I found out that the money part had fell through and I could no longer afford to get my masters. I have since then been looking for a software programming job. I have sent out hundreds of resumes and have had a few interviews (both test and HR interviews). The first few said I needed one to two years experience more and to prove I have that I started making a game in my basement. I added that to the resume and sent out lots more and just got a interview with a huge firm where I am located. After thinking I nailed the interview with my biggest trip ups include a poorly written memory management question and a testing question (as I have never taking a testing course) I get the all time low rejection letter. I have no clue what I am doing wrong I did a full year internship with the college programming, I am currently trying to show my skills and get my name out there, and I feel I have a good grasp on the technical questions they ask me. I am at my wits end what do I keep doing wrong. I feel the longer I stay at this help desk job the less likely someone will look at me as a viable software designer and the more I will get passed over. I feel I will be stuck in IT for ever and never doing what I want to do. Thanks for reading my plight and if you have anyideas on what I could be doing better please let me know. "

It's with a team that is doing really cool work, and the co-workers seemed pretty nice. 

I'm in the process of interviewing with other companies right now. I have an offer from my last internship (where the company isn't as prestigious, the pay isn't as great, the commute is slightly better, but the coworkers are truly awesome), but that's it so far. I'm interviewing with some other companies right now, some are in my desired location, but none are nearly as prestigious as Apple. 

Apple has a great team, great pay, and is a very prestigious company. Otherwise, I haven't heard too many good things about working there. My team at Apple works long hours and Cupertino is an hour commute to SF (where I want to live). Also, while it is a very prestigious company, it isn't as sought after as Google or Facebook (I haven't heard back from those companies yet, so I'm probably rejected there). I would develop a very valuable skill set at Apple, but I'm genuinely worried that I won't be happy there.

What should I do? Is having Apple on your resume worth sacrificing the happiness that I would probably have at another company?"

The recruiter also gave me the green light saying I can do whatever I like before starting. 

The only problem is I'm having a hard time finding an internship that will hire a new grad knowing they won't come back and also finding one that won't have anything in their NDA preventing me from working full time at  the company I already signed my offer for.

I'm 21, in my 4th year of University, working for a BS in Computer Information Systems. I got a job at a local Hospital doing Help Desk work, the location is amazing and the pay is really good from what I was making before (worked in retail). I have a lot of fun at work and at time's it's really easy (no calls = no work, just make sure the place doesn't go under!). 

I eventually got close with our Director of Creative Services. It’s a really small sub-department in IT, only 1 Web Developer, 1 photography and 1 videographer/multimedia specialist. They used to have a dedicated Graphics Artist but she quit, the Director does the Graphic Art and Web Design as well. 

We got to talking about setting me up with an internship. I would be filling the spot of the missing “graphic artist” which I have no problem doing, but I told him I would want Web Development in there as well, I had no problem doing both since I enjoy designing just as much as I do developing. We eventually settled that if I were to get the internship/part-time job, I would begin as a Web Designer, but said there would be tons of room and side projects regarding development. 

At first he had to get the position of an intern/part-time approved by HR and the CIO, which never happened still. Everytime he brought up the idea the CIO would always be too focused on something else. Another factor was that I had a very small, limited school-project portfolio. They were all dinky little projects that had to meet a certain critera(not much room for thinking out the box) but I always made them look and function amazingly. So in the meantime he asked if I would be willing to do some side work for him which he would use to show the CIO and HR when they were ready to discuss it. These consisted of flyers basically but on the side I took our existing hospital web-applications and gave them a redesign and more modern, user friendly interfaces (these things look like 90’s websites.) Also on a side note, I am creating his wife’s website and he offered to pay which is great.

This guy is awesome, I would love to work under him. But things are taking so long. He has been trying to get the position approved by the CIO and HR, but they are telling him to wait because his department might be getting transferred to officially under the Marketing Department and no longer IT (I don’t think this would be a problem if I could still focus on design and development.) My school advisor is telling me to start looking for another job somewhere, but part of me really thinks this could be worth it. I talked to him about the whole position and I would be starting as a Jr. Web Designer until  I graduated and would most likely be offered a promotion if I did a good job. He said then if I stuck around for a few years I could even get people working underneath me. All sounds too good to be true. What should I do guys, I’ve tried hard to plan everything out but staying at the Help Desk when I’m in need of much more challenging things, not to mention I would want to do something I love. Am I going in the right direction in this? I trust the Director, I know he is doing all he can to get me the in, but it is not his call ya know?

Since I'm a freshman, I had no clue what I needed to bring or how to prepare. I found the list of recruiters and tried to read through some of the sites and find some that would be of interest to me, but that's about the extent of my preparation. I didn't prepare a resume because it would be a nearly blank page.

All but one of the companies' recruiters that I tried to talk to(5 in total) turned me away because I had no experience, and the one I did talk to didn't go as I'd hoped.

I asked one question, then blanked. The question I asked was ""what can I do in the next one to two years to ensure that I'm a top candidate for an internship, and in the next four to be a top candidate for a full time position?"" That went great. I got a good idea of what they're looking for, but after I asked that question I blanked.

Nothing came to mind. I awkwardly thanked him for his time, shook his hand, and walked off. I left after that.

I really want the one in the spring to go more smoothly and to get more out of it, but I really don't know how to prepare. What should I put on my resume? Just my grades and the two clubs I'm in? What are some good questions to ask?

2i455z,2,2014-10-02,"[question] Is it better to go the Ph.D route or straight into industry, specifically in computer systems?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i455z/question_is_it_better_to_go_the_phd_route_or/,"As the title says, my current area of study is (most generically defined as) [computer systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_systems). I'm a master's student right now about to graduate next year, with the option to continue on to Ph.D.

I've been torn up about this the whole time I've been in graduate school. I just really want to build stuff that matters (which is part of why I'm drawn to researching) and isn't either:

   - the latest widget/app that my manager says is important to work on but seems totally pointless, or

   - a niche research tool/widget that fades into obscurity after I defend my thesis.

Is there anyone on this sub who's successfully done a Ph.D in what I guess I'd call low-level tool-building, and then has gone on to use that Ph.D research experience while building more things (that may not be related to their thesis topic)? 

Furthermore, is there anyone who has a strong argument against a Ph.D in this area?

Would it just make more sense to join a startup as a systems engineer? 

It seems people with an MS can make out well in research and development, but (since I haven't been there and done that) I'm not sure if a Ph.D is necessary to get where I want to go. Being a full-time professor isn't really on my list of things to do in life, but I wouldn't mind lecturing at some point. I have the MS because my undergraduate was in the humanities. I have also successfully done two internships at medium-sized companies that do work in my area.  

edit: by computer systems I do not mean CIS"

Im supposed to work in web development at least thats what I applied for but they have a academy(basically a room in the office for interns) where they group all their interns and I was put into graphics. First two days I did more stuff like printing paper, putting paper into files, fixing lightbulbs, even removing dirty ceilings. I dont know how the other interns feel about this but I dont live 10 minutes away from the office, the commute is long about 40 min to a hour and its not even paid. This is during the fall so I have classes and I spent like 10 hours a week on this internship. I made a prezi presentation so far that is the most technical thing Ive done. The web developer guy is in another office in england (this is in us) so I dont even have a mentor. I hoping to wait and it will get better and if anything I can get experience. How much are web developer interns paid if at all and should I look for a better internship. Ive taken classes in objected orientated programming and worked in java, javascript, html, css. Any advice

I haven't made much headway into my thesis and I just started my third year.

The tiny alarm bells inside my mind is ringing. The first year of my Phd studies was spent in choosing an advisor. All through the second year I was working on a research project which ultimately failed because me or my advisor failed to see the fundamental assertion failure in our reasoning. 

Come third year and I have jumped from 2-3 problems not having anything concrete to do. I am really feeling helpless here and I feel that the whole Phd thing may not be for me. 

Has anyone been in similar situation ? My questions are as follows :
1) If I do decide to drop out (with a MS in CS degree), how do I sell my ""failure"" to prospective recruiters? 
2) I had a summer internship with a startup and I was an R&amp;D engineer with a EDA company before coming here. How can I capitalize on those ? I am a C++ programmer if thats worth anything.

**we've almost completed this journey, this is last batter up to plate, just one more pitch**

The next morning, 4am morning time to be specific, I extricate myself from Her, get cleaned up and head to the Office. I grab a small UPS, what we call power interruption prevention, the maintenance guy pulls in as I'm loading it into my car. 

&gt; MM: Ah HA! Caught you stealing equipment again I see!

&gt; Me: Morning MM, hows the home life?

&gt; MM: I'm here at work at 4am, that give you a clue.

I laugh and wave him into the parlor, I walk over to our stores, and point at Moby. He quirks a brow and says nice artwork, what about it.

* ^(Moby is a huge power conditioning UPS, it will keep a server with two 700 Watt powersupplies running for about 4 hours, it's name is Moby because an intern got bored one year and painted a white whale on the side of it)

&gt; Me: We have to get that to the SaS office.

&gt; MM: Bugger me blind, will that fit in your car?

&gt; Me: Nope, and it's heavier than I can lift.

&gt; MM: Damn your black heart, we gotta tote it in the van right?

I smile and pat him on the shoulder, you're a manager you could delegate it. He laughs and nods his head in agreement. (He doesn't have any assigned staff) I know just the bloke, and he should be about awake now, plus he owes me one for a freezer he wanted moved last month. I wish him luck and head to rearrange things at the other building.

I get to SaS office and lights are on in the building, at first I thought I had messed up and left them on the other night. I was mistaken, it was 5am and who would appear but my favorite Power Conservationist.

&gt; Me: Morning OfficeManager, you get here this early often?

&gt; OM: Some days, especially on days when I expect there to be problems. Someone plugged everything back up before I got here, and there were 4 machines left on, I'm certain I turned everything off when I closed up Friday.

&gt; Me: Oh, you did a fine job at that, everything was nice and quiet when I got in here. I guess CompTech goes along with your unplug everything philosophy. 

&gt; OM: Anyone in the know does, it's the best security you can get. If they are off, then nothing can get into them.

&gt; Me: Can't argue with that logic.

I move past him, or try to move past him, but he does a pretty good job of blocking me.

&gt; OM: Are you supposed to be here?

&gt; Me: Not only am I supposed to be here, but you are NOT supposed to be here.

&gt; OM: You trying to get me fired? I don't think you have that kind of pull.

I reach and push him gently out of the way and step past him, I don't have any strong feelings about him having this job, as long as they keep him off the server and figure out a compromise on all of this power nonsense.

He declares he is going to call the boss and get permission to call the police, I give him a thumbs up and go into the server room. I make the changes to GP, then shutdown the server and start unhooking everything for the move. OM shows up in the doorway, he gleefully informs me the boss man is coming in to take care of things himself and that I should stop what I am doing before I mess up. Suddenly there is a door bell ringing someplace, he looks confused then rushes up towards the front. I move peripherals to the barricaded cubicle.

He comes back with MaintenanceMan in tow. I give MM a nod and look to OfficeManager.

&gt; Me: Is there a problem?

&gt; OM: This guy is here to tear up the carpet and put down flooring. He says you know whats going on, why do I not know about this.

&gt; Me: Because no one told you. Yes I do know him, and he is gonna to tear up the carpet in the server room.

&gt; OM: You mean my office!!!

&gt; Me: It's not your office. You should go find a corner and pretend to be furniture, you've gone as far as I am willing to let you go this morning.

&gt; OM: What did I do? I've done nothing to you.

&gt; Me: Nothing direct, I really do wish you would go away, you're not helping my morning at all.

He storms off shouting about never knowing what is going on to be a help with anything. Shaking my head I show MM where he needs to do the flooring, he looks at it a bit and says I'll get a hand truck to move stuff. I show him the cat hole room, warn him about falling clawed objects, and tell him we'll store the filing cabinets in here. He gets to work and has most of the cabinets moved by the time I have the server stuff moved, I help with the furniture, that we stack along the wall. I watch for a bit as he tears into the carpet, it's not down properly so it comes out pretty easily. He goes out muttering sticky side down, sticky side down and returns with a roll of rubber flooring. I won't go into more detail, but I watch as MM does wonders on the room, soon it's got a blower on the mats that he keeps moving around the room and the key think is the server room now has a static dissipating floor.

He says he will need help with that big honking battery that I needed, and I look to see OM glaring at me across the room. I wave him over, he sulks a moment and comes over to the server room door.

&gt; Me: Does your maintenance guy come in early?

&gt; OM: Out maintenance guy? We don't have a maintenance guy, why do you think we have a maintenance guy.

&gt; Me: Who was the dunderhead that dropped the server I resuscitated last week?

&gt; OM: Oh he's the grounds guy for the park, I can call him but he won't be here for a while, he works out of city office someplace. I'm not sure when he starts work.

I look and see that it almost time for people to start showing, I've heard the phone ring a few times. I look at the MM and shrug.

&gt; Me: Got a friend to help with getting it in here?

&gt; MM: Let me see who I can rustle up, but I think it's going to cost something this time.

&gt; Me: I got a CoffeeShack gift card in my pocket, that enough grease for the gander?

He carps for a bit, raises a hand and turns to walk a little bit away.

&gt; OM: I can help move it, what do we need to move?

&gt; Me: It's a power conditioning battery backup for the server room.

&gt; OM: That is a horrid floor in there now, I'm not sure I like it. (Did he just ask me a question and then ignore me?)

&gt; Me: It's not your office, we're relocating you to the Cat Room.

&gt; OM: What cat room? Is that one of the closets.

I shake my head and move towards someone I want to talk to, I over hear MM talking to someone in what sounds like a negotiation. He agrees to something and hangs up. He demands the card that I hand over, I blurt out that its got 20 dollars on it I think.

&gt; MM: Let's move the cabinets and furniture back. You better decide where that monster battery goes before the help gets here. And no lip about who is coming to help.

&gt; Me: Roger, lets move these back.

We get the filing cabinets back in the proper order, luckily they were numbered. The furniture is back in the room and his phone chirps.

&gt; MM: Helps here.

He turns and heads out front, where I find about 6 army guys standing in a line with some guy going ballistic about slow ass running. MM walks over and talks a minute and the guys rush the van, they grab Moby and hoist it up on shoulders and start marching in place. While I'm trying to process, screaming man and his compadres follow MM inside.

About the time I get my thoughts in order, here comes the loud man and his half dozen still jogging. He tosses me a wave, barks out something in some language and the half dozen start singing about how much they enjoy running, then they take off.

&gt; MM: (pointing a finger) That did not happen.

&gt; Me: No one will believe me, hell I saw it and I'm not sure about it.

Inside the Moby is in place, by we need to do some wiring, luckily MM thought ahead and brought some tools and parts. We find the breaker box with OM's help, then isolate which circuit that is and luckily it's on its own breaker. He starts going at stuff and talking with OM, so I head back to move server stuff back into the room.

The floor feels off, like it's shifting, I make a mental note to ask about it before he leaves. Then a sharp pain stabs my skull, in a panic I head to the electrical room.

&gt; MM: Yeah, this is what most call the Mains, you pull this out and drop this arm and the power is off.

&gt; OM: That will save me so much time, I won't have to go around unplugging all of those power strips.

&gt; MM: Do what now? You don't flip these to turn off computers, this will cut your power to everything. It looks like it will take out power to your security system, phones, just about everything.

&gt; OM: Oh that's OK, no one is on the phone when I turn everything off anyways.

Defeated I slink away, hoping that I can convince someone to beat something into that mans head before the day is through. The last I hear is MM trying to get OM to notice he said '**security system**'.

MM comes in and does his work on the wall socket, mumbling about something. He looks over his shoulder at me.

&gt; MM: They are having an audit right? That's what this hullabaloo is about?

&gt; Me: Yep, why is something wrong? Oh, whats up with the floor?

&gt; MM: Not set, won't be for days, it'll need to be redone, there will be spots that are clearly valleys and I expect some ridges. You will know if something is moved in here for sure.

&gt; Me: That wiring going to do the job?

&gt; MM: Yep, unless they check it against code. Shouldn't start any fires, but it will be fine today. We can restring tomorrow and run a completely new circuit.

Great, it shouldn't start any fires but it won't pass code. I'll let him explain that to whoever he wants, I'll pray that nothing burns down unplanned.

Suddenly SaSOwner is in the door, he looks around and nods his head, I point behind him and he see's OfficeManager there like a puppy that needs to go out for a tinkle.

&gt; SO: OM, we need to talk, lets go into my office.

&gt; OM: Oh yes, we definitely need to talk.

SaSOwner turns to me.

&gt; SO: We ready for the audit?

&gt; Me: It's going to be close but I think we got it made, maybe not in the shade, but a little sunburn never hurt.

&gt; SO: Thanks for all this, I appreciate it greatly.

&gt; Me: Sure thing, I'll hang around for the audit in case he has questions.

&gt; SO: I appreciate that, I'll leave you guys to it.

MM looks at me when they leave, he looks like he has something to say. He stands, closes the door and moves closer to talk low.

&gt; MM: Thats who you've been working for this week?

&gt; Me: Yes, he's BigTuna's life long friend.

&gt; MM: That he is, they grew up together, I mean literally, close as brothers without sharing a parent.

&gt; Me: BT told me, said he was family, seemed pretty choked up about it.

&gt; MM: Well, that guy just got out of '**the**' hospital, he tried to commit suicide a few months back. 

I don't know what to say, so I say nothing, he continues.

&gt; MM: I'm not sure if this is secret, but he tried to, well, he did it because his only other life long friend died to cancer. His wife passed away just after Christmas.

Damn, now I'm about to tear up, nothing seems to want to get past the lump in my throat.

&gt; Me: I didn't know that, he seems to be a good guy.

&gt; MM: He is, good in the community, he goes to my church. I did not expect to see him bossing an office. 

I nod and turn to the server, he plates the plug and locks Moby's tail into the socket. The room vibrates when Moby comes up, strange how it does that without any real moving parts.

I boot up the server and check the changes to GP for the removable media. MM is standing there watching silently, I'm still not sure what to say. He seems to understand, pats me on the shoulder and says to call if I need more help. Once he is gone I tear up a bit, and then go back to work. I have a brain storm and disable CD burning as well, it's a separate rule from removable media.

I head up front and SaSOwner is loud enough to be heard through a closed door, he seems to have settle in the against column on the power issue, I don't eavesdrop any longer than that and head out the front door.

People are coming in and most are happy to see me, a few ask where my blanky is, couple joke about my missing stuffed animal. I smile and wave at them, I nod to those that ask if I will be back for the audit. One corners me about the files, he apparently really needs to access one of them.

&gt; Me: I need some breakfast not in a cup, and I'll be straight back to get that fixed. Should be done before the audit.

He thanks me greatly, as I get to my car my phone goes off, it's on silent so it's dancing a merry jig in my pocket. 

&gt; Me: It's me, you're you, tell me something new.

&gt; BT: Oh man you didn't work all night did you? Please don't be in stranger mode.

&gt; Me: No, been going since 4 or so, in a good mood, I think SaSOwner is laying down the law about the power conservationism policies in his office.

&gt; BT: You said his office right?

&gt; Me: Yep, he seems to have decided against letting OM unplug everything at night. I just overheard a little as I passed his office.

&gt; BT: You heard him through the door?

&gt; Me: Oh year, I imagine everyone did as they passed his doorway.

&gt; BT: Good, good...

I wait a second but he seems to be off on his own.

&gt; Me: Did you need something? You called me? I think.

&gt; BT: Oh yes, did you get the server room ready for the audit? 

&gt; Me: Yep, just hope no one comes by for a code inspection. Nothing dangerous, just not done properly enough to suit MM.

&gt; BT: Did he say it will catch on fire?

&gt; Me: Nah, he actually said, it shouldn't catch on fire.

&gt; BT: Lol, then it will pass code, just not his damn code. Everyone working?

&gt; Me: No one rushed out to get me so I think so, we got their files back, but I'll have to work on the shares after something edible, think my stomach is gnawing on my liver.

&gt; BT: Oh, go do that, please be back for the auditor, he might have questions. We are also meeting with CompTech at 3pm if the auditor doesn't shut it all down.

&gt; Me: So, we as in SaSOwner and me? Or we include more heads on the bobble?

&gt; BT: Three plus you two, me, and two of their other Customers. The ones that recommended, well, approved of their service to me.

&gt; Me: Are we negotiating? Discussing? Demanding? Should I get sticks and stones?

&gt; BT: No, we're going to explain to them what is happening, and we're going to let them decide if they want to toe the line or lose a few customers.

&gt; Me: 10-4, I'll be back way before the auditor, and I'm looking forward to that meeting.

He hangs up and I look to the door, but get in my car instead. I get a ham roll, a couple dozen donuts, a bucket of strong coffee, and head back to SaS office. The donuts are met with applause, and I'm the hero once more when I get most of the people back to files they had thought long gone.

&gt; Someone: Hey I can't get to my MP3s on this thumb drive, you know anything about that?

**this one is long, but I will finish up in one more part, thanks for sticking with me, I hope you have enjoyed reading as much as I've enjoyed writing, the last one is almost all gratification**"

However, I'm not the best self teacher, so going to school and having face time with teachers is a must for me. Right now, I'm going to a community college in Illinois to get a certificate in programming. http://www.kishwaukeecollege.edu/programs_of_study/pdf/CIS-CERT.pdf[1] (I'm currently going the java route to further prepare myself in case I end up doing mobile games)

The thing about this is, though, it seems like this option won't prepare me enough for the ""real world"" of game development. The three programming classes I'm taking right now ( c++, java, and intro to programming logic) only seem like a broad introduction to the languages, and don't go into specifics like some university classes do. I'm hoping that I can get an internship at a software development company soon, but I'm wondering if that will be enough.

Should I get my certificate, get an internship, and try to make a couple games before I try to get a job in the game development field, or should I go to a four year university after finishing the certificate? I know this is probably a very general question, but some opinions from people who are already in the game development field would be greatly appreciated.

And I used to live up to that stereotype. 

Hell, I studied at Yale University of Medicine for Gods sake, getting my M.D degree in the late 1980's. After an internship at the New York State University, I returned to Yale to complete my residency in psychiatry. I was fascinated with the way the mind and the body works, and how they work in unison. But all my beliefs were built stoically upon scientific and medical facts. If only you all knew me, you'd know that I would normally be the LAST person to entertain the idea of what I'm about to tell you. Jesus, it's taken me months to even come to terms with it myself, or to speak the words out loud. In fact you guys are the only people I've told this to so far, and I'm only doing this because for once I can be truly anonymous, and I can get a gauge of what the public would think. Plus, Reddit is renowned for operating on the same ""scientific facts only"" basis, so it makes sense to come to you guys, so I can get even a marginal idea as to how my colleagues will react when it comes time to share the findings of my research.

If I didn't have hard proof of what I've found out, I wouldn't be so sure of myself. The tapes, they are…I still can't believe what is on the tapes. It feels like a dream. That's why I know I need to share my findings, because I KNOW that I am not making this up. I mightn't know where to go from here, but I may be the one to finally have proof that we not alone. 

I guess I should tell you a little bit about why I got into psychiatry. I got into namely because of what happened to one of my best friends in high school. 

Ryan. 

Ryan was one of the funniest, most easy going people I have ever or will ever meet. Seriously, NOTHING could phase him. I remember when he first got his licence and his Dad brought him this insanely cool Beetle, which was matte black. Ryan had wanted it for so long, and when he woke up on his 17th birthday, it was there in his drive way. I will never forget the look on his face when he pulled up out the front of my house, he was beaming and could barely contain his excitement. Well you can imagine my horror and dismay when we went to go to the Ice cream parlour to meet our other friends and an old lady reversed straight into him at some traffic lights. We had been checking out some girls walking past, and hadn't been paying attention at all, and the huge jolt scared the hell out of both of us. I stared at him in disbelief and watched him make sense of what had happened, look at me, look at the old lady now standing at the front of his half-crushed beetle and just start laughing. 

""Fuck man!"" He snorted. ""Trust this shit to happen the first day I get my car!""

He got out to exchange details with the lady and he couldn't have been nicer to her. I sat and waited while *he* comforted *her* until the cops came.

But that's just the kind of guy Ryan was.

He was athletic, and popular, but nice to everyone. He loved to stick up for the underdog. He was smart and the sort of person who had a laugh that made other people laugh. I would leave his house, my stomach cramped, because every time he would laugh I would nearly die laughing at the sounds he made. He didn't have a fake laugh. He never made a ""teehee"" or a polite chuckle, he LAUGHED. From deep within himself. And it was contagious.

Then he started to change.

 It was hardly noticeable at first. Around the age of 20, when we were just coming into our prime, he started to withdraw. Small things at first. I'd call around to ask if he wanted to come catch a movie, or go to a party and he would say no. He didn't feel like it. His mom would come out and encourage him to come with me, saying he hadn't been getting out much at all, and that he should go and enjoy himself. But he'd just sit and watch TV. At first I brushed it off, and thought maybe he wasn't feeling well, or he was tired, but eventually weeks passed and I didn't hang out with him. I would call him to talk and he would be very abrupt and it just seemed like he wanted to hang up as soon as he'd answered the phone.

After that happened a few times, I decided maybe he just didn't want to be friends anymore. I'd tried everything. For months I had tried to engage him, and he didn't seem at all interested. 

So you can imagine my surprise when one day his mom called me, and asked me to come over. She said Ryan wanted to see me. She sounded almost…desperate. 

Of course I went. That's what friends are for, right? I was hoping I'd get my friend back, but if not, I was hoping for at least an explanation.

So over I went to his house, and his Mom answered the door. She opened the door before I had even got a chance to knock, looking pale and frazzled. Her once auburn hair, now tinged with grey, frizzing erratically around her face. She stood, ushering me to come in as soon as I'd gotten on the road outside their house.

""James, darling, I'm so glad you are here!"" She said, wrapping me in a tight hug."" Ryan could really use a friend at the moment dear.""

""Sure Mrs Crosby, no problem."" I said, taking off my jacket and heading towards Ryan's room.

Nothing really prepared me for what I saw when I got there. What I was confronted with had never once crossed my mind. I thought Ryan didn't like me anymore, I didn’t know he was….unwell.

I pushed on the door of his room to go in, but found it blocked my something heavy. I banged on the door, while his Mom hovered in the background pretending to look busy.

""Bro! It's me, open up."" I called.

I heard rustling and movement from within, but still the door stayed shut.

""Ryan! Open up dude!"" I yelled again.

More movement and what sounded like heavy furniture being pushed around. Suddenly, the door peeled open an inch and I saw a darting eye looking straight at me.

""Oh..oh…you came. Oh. Ok. Um. Um. You can come in. I suppose. Not her though. Not her."" He stammered out in haste.

""Ok…Um. Well open up and let me in buddy.""

With that he finally opened the door, and before I could say a word, dragged me into his room by my collar.

I guess I know now that Ryan was already gone at that point. The Ryan I knew and loved, anyway.

The Ryan that replaced him was manic. He was rocking back and forth, staring at me wide eyed. His mousy brown hair looked like it hadn't been combed or cut in a year. He was wringing his hands and sitting on the edge of his bed, while all around me there were posters, photos and letters covering every inch of the walls and ceilings. The stench was insane. It was such a far stretch from the impeccably neat Ryan I used to know, that I was actually scared.

""Ryan. What the hell man? What's going on here? What happened to your room?""

""YOU HAD TO COME HERE JAMES BECAUSE I CAN'T TALK ON THE PHONE"" he whisper shouted. 

""Why?"" I asked before he interrupted me with ""SHHHHHHHHH. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN"" he whisper shouted again.

""Ok"" I whispered back. ""Just tell me what's going on dude, maybe I can help. ""

""That's why you had to come here James. They can hear us talk on the phone. They listen all the time.""

""Who's they?' I asked, confused.

""THEY. The others. They can hear through the phone lines. I know this because I was watching the News this morning and the news reader said the phrase ""Maple Avenue"" and I knew that was code to say that immediately after I spoke on the phone, people would be writing down what I said"" he explained, almost a matter of factly, like what he was saying should make all the sense in the world.

""Maple Avenue? What""

""That's their code for me James, that's how they pass the messages on. It doesn't matter anyway. They're coming to get me. God wants me now. I won’t be here anymore tomorrow. So I wanted to tell you that."" He said, pacing.

""Jesus I need to sit down"" I mumbled, all of a sudden feeling light headed.

""I'm not going to make it James!!!  I'm not. You've just confirmed it yourself, you said 'Jesus', I know he's here, Jesus has come for me, I'm not going to see the sun go down tomorrow, I'll be dead!!"" He said grabbing me by the shoulders as I sat on his computer chair and shaking me.

""Dude, dude just snap out of it ok!!"" I remember screaming at him. ""Stop saying this stuff, you're starting to freak me the fuck out man!! Just stop it!""

At that point, his Mom knocked on the door – ""Maybe it's time for you to go James"" she said sadly. She was a woman defeated. There was no more desperation. She looked resigned.

I turned to walk out and I took one last look at this person who stood in place of my dearest friend. His once cheerful blue eyes were now grey and bloodshot, and they stared into my soul as he said ""I don't want to die, James.""

And that was the last I saw of him. The next morning his Mom found him in his room. He had stabbed himself in the chest with a butchers knife. 

It took me a long time to work out how my friend had become someone that I had never met. I now know that he had paranoid schizophrenia, and he was suffering from auditory hallucinations that filled his head with horrible things, which culminated in his suicide.

I could not fathom how someone as bright and as fun loving as Ryan could change into what I had seen that day. How did he change? Why him? Does something trigger it? How can we fix this so that other people don't have to go through what Ryan's family went through.

That's why I got into psychiatry.

To find answers.

And now I have answers, to a question I didn't even know I asked. And it's not what I thought. And I don't know what to think about Ryan anymore. I'm tormented now, that I didn't help him when he needed it. I wasn't there for him when I should have been. I should have listened and asked him questions. 

I need to stop for now Reddit. I don't know if I'm ready for what's to come. The repercussions for me, for the whole medical industry, hell, for the WORLD. I don't think anyone's ready.

Put it this way, if I was just going to retell what I've found during my research, I'm almost positive that 99% of you wouldn't believe me for a second.

But I have the tapes. And you can find out for yourselves.

My university is not ranked overall that well, but the CS program is decent.
Problem is, I switched my major to CS really late in college, so I didn't have a chance to pick up any internships while in school.

After I graduated, I did manage to get two full time jobs, one after another. They both were a stint of 6 months, so total: one year of work experience. It's a long story as to why they were so short. I have a gap between my graduation date and the 1st job, a gap between my 1st &amp; 2nd jobs, and a gap between my 2nd job and now (so far only a month).

I'm just really unsure as to the breadth of interviewing topics I should be reviewing. **With one year of work experience, and two years out of school: Will my interview questions be like a typical new grad, or somewhere between *new grad* and *senior*?** I know *senior* means that most/all topics are fair game.

I am applying to a wide assortment of companies from the Big 4 types, to maybe-you've-heard-of-them startups. Also, does my one year experience mean that they would likely offer the same salary as a new grad, or maybe a tiny bump?

tldr: Two years out of school, no internships, one year of full time experience. Will they ask me questions **on almost any topic, or more topics,** in interviews, now that I'm *not* a recent grad?"

I've been working as an intern at a large company for a few months now. We are writing embedded software and I've been told the only way(i think) to compile and test our product(a cluster for cars) is by using ""MULTI IDE"". And I've been recommended to use Eclipse, as almost everyone uses it(one guy is editing via CodeBlocks, and one other via Notepad++). I considered using CodeBlocks but i didn't like it that much from my experience at home.

It just struck me last night that i can use Sublime Text, which i really really like.

So my question is are there some plugins that people use for C development? I've been googling for about half an hour and didn't see anything useful(or it didn't seem like it). 

Currently i have 

* Sublime Linter
* Sidebar Enchantments
* Bracket Highlighter
* All Autocomplete

The things i miss from Eclipse are

* When i move my cursor over a defined constant it shows its value (i know it cannot show the value when i move the cursor over, so my idea is to show the value when i press some hotkey or something?). Edit: Also applies when im searching for functions (Eclipse allows me to open it automatically via the F3 button)

My problem is Java Server Pages. I've read that it's quite a dead technology and nobody uses it anymore (exists only in legacy code?). So is it smart to do a program with JSP's? Does employers ignore my project? Problem is that I know at some level how to code with JSP's so I would be able to focus more on project and it's architecture rather than some new technology which I don't know.

TLDR:
Graduating late. From another country. Want to get a job at Big 4. Thinking of interning 6 months at such a place, then doing a masters with that cash and contacts, then trying for a full time offer after masters.

First a little info about myself. I'm computer engineering college student from a SEAsian country (college is ranked decently top 100, QS, World rankings) and my country has 2 (effectively 3) years of conscription meaning one only starts college at the age of 21. I took a year off school to work in a few Silicon Valley startups and now I am back, and will only graduate when I am 26.

Although I don't have very good grades (lets say its around GPA 3.2ish), but I have a slew of side projects under my belt, and 1 year of real developer work experience in SV, and potentially a good final year project in the field of computer vision. Having experienced culture in SV, I absolutely love it, and I would like my first career to be that in a current big 4 engineering or computer science firm (Think maybe Tesla/Boeing or Google/Microsoft) that sort. I am currently pursuing a very embedded-systems cum computer vision focused modules and projects. This is my area of interest.

It's a big stretch, considering the kind of competition I've seen from people I have had the chance to meet in Stanford or Berkeley. I am thinking of possibly applying for an internship of 6 months at one of these firms (saving enough), then doing my masters (either Meng. or Msc not sure yet). Primary reason is I wish to work/live there. H1B visa requirements and getting a full time offer from them is better with Masters.

Would like to know what are your thoughts on this path? Please feel free to ask more questions."

The internship was meant to only be for the summer, but I performed well and my boss offered me to stay on part-time until I graduate. My boss has told me there is a possibility for me to be offered a full-time position when I graduate, but they would continue interviewing other candidates for the position.

**Problem**: I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of for a couple reasons.      
* Since the extension of my internship, my responsibilities have risen dramatically but my pay has stayed the same.    
* I feel like they are dangling the possibility of a full-time offer and an incentive for me to give 150%, which is great for them but makes it difficult for me to allocate time to my schooling.     
* I really like this company and want a full time offer, but don't like the feeling of being taken advantage of.

What can I do to get where I want to be? Just sending out cold applications doesn't seem to be netting any interviews. Should I contact a recruiter in that area? Should I focus on something entrepreneurial (an app, etc) in hopes of getting noticed?

I’m graduating this fall and am just feeling really overwhelmed at the moment at the prospect of finding a job. 

I’m graduating a semester early and have only one summer internship under my belt. My internship was a joke (i.e. excel spread sheet pivot tables) and I only ended up doing compsci related work during the last two weeks, and had a difficult time completing it because no one really gave me the time of day when it came to asking questions, and the company I was working at had me using a computer that didn’t have most of the software to edit files (yay for notepad++).

I started out in IT and switched a few semesters ago when I realized that the same amount of math was required to complete both IT and my track of computer science. I decided to switch because I assumed it meant job stability and higher pay, not because I enjoy programming. Most of my classes involve web dev type stuff and mainframe classes, which I’m fairy competent at and feel most comfortable with. But other than that…to put it bluntly, I’m not a good programmer. Most of my class assignments in courses like Data Structures and OOD were completed by collaborating with other classmates. I don’t feel confident in my ability to code and reading job descriptions make me feel like most concepts went over my head. 

I applied to several part-time/student jobs in my college’s IT department and interviewed for a few, but I was turned down. I interview well (probably because most of the interviews don’t involve technical questions) but I believe it’s most likely due to the fact that I’m about to graduate and they’d rather have someone who will be working for them longer than 2.5 months. When I graduate I plan on moving to another state once I’ve secured a job (I’ll be starting the job seek very soon), so while I’d love to have a job here to get some more experience until I move, I just don’t know if I can secure one in time. I also don’t want to focus my efforts on securing a temporary job when I should be looking for one where I plan to move.

I’m not really sure where this is going. I’m just scared that **if** I even get a job, I won’t know what the hell I’m doing and I’ll get fired. I’ve been told that this is a common feeling for new graduates but I was just looking for some advice or personal anecdotes that might help. Thanks in advance.

Two weeks passed. Two weeks of nothing, no word from Leyva; no threats, no communication, nothing. 

Since Kimberley Bachmann’s death, her parents, Gregory and Audrey were in protective custody. Apparently the mother was so hysterical she’d been sedated since they heard of Paul’s death. She didn’t know Kimberly was dead. Amelia, her brother Simon  and her two sisters, Chelsea and Portia were all in a safe house. Veronica Yu had made a statement and refused protective custody. We had an unmarked car watching her apartment. 

Ash had been leading the investigation, with huge pressure from Capt. Thomas, who was generally just being an fucking ass. The press had been given a basic statement, but we tried desperately to contain any details of the investigation. The last thing we wanted was to spook Leyva, or give him a sick glory by making him infamous. 

This is the worst part, the waiting. Nothing was happening in the real world, but the evidence was mounting. 

Paul Bachmann’s autopsy revealed Leyva had removed his tongue before killing him. The word “AUTHOR” was cut into his back. It was only revealed when the body was cleaned down before examination. Curiously, crime scene investigators found a bag at Bachmann’s apartment full of neatly folded, blood stained clothes. DNA results proved the blood to be Paul Bachmann’s and there was DNA from the wearer – believed to be Leyva. If he had calmly folded his clothes and changed at the scene, there was a potential Leyva had left the crime scene in different clothes. There was no way of telling anything from Paul Bachmann’s closet was missing, he lived alone. CCTV showed no non-resident entering or leaving the building within hours of Bachmann’s murder. We interviewed Every. Single. Damn. Resident. In that building. Also, we were unable to determine who called in Paul’s murder; 911 received a call around 10pm reporting a break in, but it wasn’t from Paul Bachmann or any of his neighbours, doorman or cleaning staff. Investigation could only conclude it was Leyva himself. I listened to that recording hundreds of times, but it simply made no sense. 

“911 what’s your emergency?”
“I think someone’s breaking in upstairs.”
“What’s your name Sir?”
“Michael Stanley.”
“Where are you located?”
“(Address.) Come soon, I can hear glass breaking.”
“Sir are you in any immediate danger?”
“No Ma’am, I’m in my apartment.”
“Okay, stay there, don’t leave your apartment, we’re sending a car to you.”

Michael Stanley was a broker who lived below Bachmann – and he was away in Dubai for three months. We searched the apartment but there was no evidence anyone had been there since the cleaning lady two days before. We contacted Mr Stanley, who was definitely in Dubai and had no knowledge of a 911 call. 

Kimberly Bachmann’s death was clearly more violent, although there was no evidence of a struggle. CCTV saw her enter the building with a man at around 11pm. Unsurprisingly, he avoided showing his face to the camera, which cemented my thought that Leyva was smart and his killings were premeditated. 

The level of violence at the Kimberley scene told us that the crime was in some way… personal. The level of rage it took to literally club someone’s skull apart was, by any stretch, difficult to imagine. Tissue samples were collected at the scene and the team were able to piece together the skull; Kimberly had been struck innumerable times with a large, blunt object that made an unusual impression in the reconstructed skull, it wasn’t a weapon we knew of, maybe some kind of bat or club. Kimberley’s tongue had also been removed with a sharp, surgical grade knife and on her back was the word “JAMES”.  At the scene again, we found a nondescript bag of neatly folded clothes, stuck together with brain tissue and blood spatter.

Two weeks became three weeks, and still nothing. All we had was a poor quality photo booth photo, a basic height and build description and no Leyva. Our entire team had eyes and ears on the streets, but nobody knew this guy. We had a few stops and starts, but aside from a few poor eyewitness accounts at some society parties and casting calls, nobody could tell us anything about the guy. He was a nobody. 


It was a cold Thursday afternoon, the kind where you take a breath and almost sneeze because it’s just so damn cold. I had a rare day off and went to visit my Mother at her residential care home. Normally I go alone, but this time I brought a visitor.

“Jack!” she recognised me instantly. Today was a good day. 
“Hi Mom.” I held her close for a moment, grateful she knew my face. 
“I was just having tea.” She gestured to the table next to her, set up with an old timey tea pot and fancy china cups. They were from our home in England. 
“And who is this?” my Mom didn’t sound confused, in fact, she was happier than I’d seen her in a long time. 
“Oh god, sorry, this is my friend, Christina. Christina is a Doctor.”
“Oh my so lovely to meet you! Sit.” I missed my Mom when she wasn’t on a good day, and it was a risk bringing Christina here, but somehow it felt right. Safe. She makes me pour the tea and they both talk about Christina’s intern placement, my Mom’s life back in England and how she misses it, in fact, my Mom has almost perfect recall today. It was almost a perfect afternoon.
“Oh and guess who came to see me the other day?”
“Uhm, Mrs Laker?” she was our neighbour from when my Mom lived in my childhood home. 
“No! Your brother.” Ah, shit.
“Mom…”
“And he’s cut his hair, I almost didn’t recognise him.”
“Mom…” I feel tense, my stomach hurts and I just for once don’t want to deal with my brother and my Mom and my family history. Just once.
“In fact… he left something for you. For your birthday.” She gets up and starts opening drawers on her dresser. This has happened before, but normally she tells me Harry doesn’t visit, or asks if he’s doing well in school. “Here.”
She hands me a blue envelope, sealed shut. I feel trepidation, but I carefully open the envelope at the bottom fold. 

It’s a birthday card. 

My brother had been dead for twenty years. 

I open up the generic, well wishing card and with adrenaline running through my veins, the letters are all written under hard pressure from a blue biro.

ON YOUR BIRTHDAY
MAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
MAY HE BLESS YOU, DETECTIVE 




For the next week, I tried to sleep. With the best will in the world, logically I knew I’d be no good to the investigation fatigued. Ash insisted I go home, but I ended up lying down on a couch in one of our victim’s support rooms. Usually meant for families and non custodial parties, it wasn’t ideal to attempt to sleep there but I couldn’t go home.

At some point, I drifted off only to be woken by my cell buzzing in my jacket pocket. I fumbled for it, still half asleep. 

“Detective Harper.”
“I like your friend.” The voice was without tone or any kind of warmth; like cold hail on concrete. 
“Who is this?” I was awake now, sitting upright. 
“Your redheaded doctor friend. I doubt she’s a natural redhead though.”
I consider trying to get hold of Ash, or anyone, but I need to keep whoever this is on the phone.
“Who is this?”
“I shouldn’t worry, Detective, I’m sure she’ll be fine on her walk home in the early hours of the morning. All alone.”
“Are you threatening me?”
“Oh no. Threats are for angry people. I’m not angry. I just wanted to congratulate you on your excellent investigation. I’m sure you’ll catch your man soon.” The voice sounds vaguely amused, calm. Too calm for this to be a normal conversation.
“Why are you calling me, Mr Leyva?”
Silence for a moment. “Maybe I wanted to hear your voice. I’m enjoying the game, but it will too soon be all over. We can’t play forever.”
“I don’t consider homicide a game, Mr Leyva. Are you ready to give yourself up?”
“I’d say at this point, Detective, no. I hope you enjoyed my art work, but I do have to go now. It was nice to hear your voice, Jack Harper.” He didn’t hang up.  “I suggest you check your desk, Detective Harper. I sent you a birthday gift. Goodbye.” He terminated the call. 

It was 7am on February 13th, my birthday. 

I headed straight to Ash, only to find he’d gone home to rest for few hours. I didn’t blame him, but I needed to get someone to find out where Leyva was calling from. I had no doubt in my mind he’d make it that easy, but we had to turn over every rock.  
“Angelina, can you find out where he was calling from, asap and can you send a squad car over to Mount Sinai and check on Dr Christina Angelo? Send someone to her home address if necessary, Levya just made a threat.” the department was a hive of activity, the Commissioner had pulled out all the stops with pressure from the Mayor.  The Bachmann family were rich and influential – which meant our resources were pretty much unlimited, even three weeks in with no further evidence.

Our mission control room was just one of our meeting rooms set up to be the hive of the investigation. Images of ‘Marissa’, Paul and Kimberley are pinned to huge cork boards; it’s just like on TV in that sense. I can hear the local TV station somewhere, and I catch a few sound bytes as I walk down the hall – “…NYPD are yet to release names of any suspects, a source close to the department tells us CBS New York that the investigation is being headed by Detective Daniel Ash and Captain Nicholas Thomas of the homicide division. Last night’s activity is not thought to be involved with the ongoing Bachmann Investigation.” Captain Thomas my ass, he was clearly at home having breakfast with his wife. Or his Mistress. 

I make it to my desk and immediately see a red Hermes purse sitting on my desk. It’s the same red Hermes purse Amelia Bachmann put on my in tray just over twenty four hours ago. I feel sick. 

There’s barely anyone in the office, they’re either involved in the investigation or they’re out on calls; these kind of incidents can cause mass hysteria, hence Ash not releasing any suspect details to the press as yet. All we need is the public calling in every 6”2 white male with brown hair. 
I slip on some latex gloves from my pocket and for a second I wonder if Leyva has left me a bomb, but I guess that’s not his style. The purse looks normal, as purses go, and I carefully look inside. 

Black and white photographs. Hundreds of them, it seems. Ash, outside his home, talking on his cell. Ash again, smoking in his car, outside cafes, talking to informants on the street. Doctor Angelo leaving the hospital. Me. Me outside the precinct, me getting coffee at Starbucks. Amelia Bachmann, outside the precinct on the day she came to report Leyva’s threats, carrying her Hermes purse. Getting into a town car. Paul Bachmann on his way to work. Kimberly Bachmann in the park with a friend, walking a dog. Marissa, the call girl, sitting on a bed, looking up into the camera. Smiling. Sophie Blackwater, standing on a balcony somewhere at night, looking out over the city. Me again, outside the residential home. My Mom, sitting, drinking tea and smiling, thinking Leyva is my brother, Harry. 

For a moment I just cover my face. Leyva has been moving closer and closer to us over the last three weeks and we’ve missed it. Up until he left me a birthday card, he was able to get in to see my Mom. He was smart, charming and people put trust in him. Kimberley, Marissa, Amelia. Maybe even Paul. Getting my cell number wouldn’t have been hard if he had Amelia’s purse, with my card in. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. 

I call Ash. 

“Dan, Leyva has just had a package delivered here, it’s Amelia’s purse. Photographs of us inside. My Mom, Christina, the vicitims… he’s fucking watching us, you need to get here and get here quick.”
“Jack… what the fuck?”
“Dan, I don’t have time to explain please get to the station and watch your fucking back, okay?”
“Ok.” He sounds confused, but he’s on his way, he’s good like that, he just… believes me. 

Angelina comes running in – “Just confirmed, Dr Angelo is at work. Uniform are going to stay at the hospital but she’s refusing to leave.”
Typical. Christina Angelo is a woman after my own heart. 


I think of my Mom, confused as to why all my nice Police friends are constantly visiting. Sitting outside her door, watching over her. I think of Christina, working in the ER among stab victims and kids with burns and I think of Audrey Bachmann, almost catatonic with sadness at losing her son. Too many Mothers have lost children in this case. Audrey has lost two. Sophie Blackwater’s parents still don’t know what happened to their daughter. Marissa, well, she’s somebody’s baby too and I just feel rage. I feel unadulterated, pure white hot rage. 

“Jack, are you okay? You’re shaking.”
“Just… get this to evidence, Angelina… he’s closing in on us.”




Two hours later, Ash and I are in a side room, away from the activity. We need peace to talk out the case so far, examine the evidence. 
This is Police work. Long hours, unforgiving suspects and destroyed families. It’s bleak and dark and it’s on our doorstep today. 
Ash runs his hands through his hair and I swear he’s got greyer, older since the investigation began. 
“So here’s what we know; Leyva definitely killed Paul and Kimberley Bachmann. He’s most likely killed Marissa and Sophie. He has show intent to me, you, Christina Angelo, Amelia Bachmann and your Mom.” 

I practically have my head on the table in exhaustion, but something was keeping me going. Maybe it was anger, I don’t know. “We have no body for Marissa, we don’t even know her last name. We have DNA evidence that matches no-one in the system, we don’t have Sophie Blackman’s body, we don’t have sweet fuck all, Ash. We have nothing except some crazy notebooks, a photograph collection and some clothes at the Bachmann scenes. Amelia Bachmann is still in protective custody. She lost her purse and its entire contents when she was coming back to town after Paul was murdered. We. Have. Nothing.”

Ash has all the photos from the scenes laid out in front of us. I press my fingers onto my closed eyes for a moment. “Dan… we’ve been over this a hundred times.”
“Then let’s make it a hundred and one.” 
I sigh, frustrated. Back then I was a new detective, impatient and personally afflicted. Ash passes me the evidence logs for both scenes and suddenly I see something that shouldn’t be there. 

Officer H Harper

“Dan… there’s definitely no other Harper here, is there?”
“Thankfully for me, no.” He’s chewing again. 
I turn the paper round and point to the page. 
“Right, so someone took your name wrong?”
“No. It’s on both scene logs. Different uniform Officers.”
Ash cranes his head over and looks again. “Lutz and Mahoney. What did they log in?”

“That’s the thing. Nothing.” 

“So they were on the scene but they did nothing?” Ash is rifling through papers. “Wait – shit – Jack, Officer Harper was the guy who was at the Kimberly Bachmann scene when our boys got there… Lutz spoke to him and… FUCK! He took the first statement from the doorman at Paul Bachmann’s scene.”

“What Precinct is he from; badge number?”

Ash swings round in his chair to an archaic computer behind him and furiously starts tapping like a Secretary in a movie, making busy noise. Suddenly, he stops and leans back.  

“What?” my mouth has gone dry.

“Did you ever lose your badge? Misplace it?”

“Never. Why?”

“It’s your fucking badge number.”

I get up and take a look at the screen. There it is, my number, my name, my face. DET. JACK HARPER. 

Ash is quiet for a moment. “Have you ever used a dupe?”

Duplicate badges are fucking illegal, but let’s just say if an officer loses his badge on a Saturday night whilst having a few too many drinks, he’s not going to want to report it. 

“Never.” 
“Someone either has your badge, or duped your badge, and they’re using it at our crime scenes.”

I check the witness statement again. Officer H Harper. I try to keep my voice from shaking. “Ash. Run Harold Harper.”

“There’s like, 45 in this area alone.”

I swallow. It’s dry. “Try Harold Harper, 14th January, 1974.”

“Jack why…?” Ash turns and sees my face, and immediately runs it. 
“Okay… Harold James Harper, born January 1974, died August 17th, 1984…wait, Harold James Harper, born 14th January 1974, registered address… Powell Avenue, Bronx NYC. Lived there since… 2003.”

There’s just silence. 

“This is too much of a co-incidence, Dan.” My legs feel like they’re going out from under me and I sink down into the vacant chair. 

“It’s a pretty common name, Jack.”

“Same birthday?”

Ash taps away on the computer. “Same social security number.”
More silence. Ash has stopped chewing. 

“Harry’s dead, Dan.” He looks at me with tired eyes. “I know he’s dead.”

“Someone is using his identity.”

“Leyva. He’s fucking with us, he wants to outsmart us and leave a breadcrumb trail. He’s luring us into the candy house.”

“Jack…”

“We need to get to Powell Avenue.”

I hear Ash sigh deeply. “Jack if you…”

“I don’t want off the case, Dan. We need to end this.”




At Powell Avenue, we find a new renter who is very confused as to why fifteen memembers of the NYPD are on her doorstep. After brief questioning, we ascertain they’d moved in only four months ago, oddly co-incidental with Leyva’s sudden latch onto Veronica Yu. 

A search of the property yields nothing, but I step around the back into a large, green area. It’s pretty, and even though it’s a bitingly cold day, I can hear children playing somewhere nearby. Ash joins me whilst the team are searching inside. 

“This is a very nice garden.” His voice is slightly loaded as he lights up a cigarette. 
Before I can reply, an older woman with her hair in curlers leans over a neighbouring fence. “It is a nice garden. Our old neighbour put it in.”

Ash smiles his charming old ladies smile “Oh yeah, what was your old neighbour like?”

“Oh, he was so nice. He’d help anyone out! Did this garden up real pretty too.”

“Was this… - Ash pretends to check his notebook – Mr…Harper?”

“Yes! Mr Harper! He would always help me with my shopping. He always worked on this garden; even in the Winter. He kept funny hours, said he couldn’t sleep.”

“Funny hours?”

“Yes, I think he worked shifts or something. I think he said he worked for the Police.” She noses around the garden, obviously looking to see what we’re up to.

“Did you catch Mr Harper’s first name, Mrs…?”

“Mrs Lobo, yes, it was Harry. Nice boy. Are you investigating that boy Tony from upstairs? I think he’s dealing drugs, you know.”

“Thank you, Mrs Lobo. I can’t comment on the investigation but thank you so much.” Ash grins, she smiles and with one last craning-neck look around, she heads back indoors. 

Ash looks at me. I know what he’s going to say, so I say it first.
“Let’s get digging.”



By 5:30, we’ve set up three forensic tents, have a helicopter flying over and eight residents are in a nice hotel for the night. We’ve found the remains of what looks like a woman, badly decomposed, but somehow I know it’s Marissa. The body is in three pieces, a head, a torso and the limbs are buried separately. No hands or feet anywhere. 

By 9:30 we’ve found a second body. Male. No torso. 

At 10:45pm we find a third body. Ash comes out of the forensic tent and motions for me to follow him. He doesn’t speak. 

I look down into the hole. It’s a decent depth, at least six foot. The body was practically a skeleton. What we call dry; the final stage of decomposition. A CSI hands me an evidence bag, and in it is a necklace. Valuable. Huge blue stone set in diamonds. It’s Sophie Blackwater’s. 

My heart sinks deep in my chest. Logically I knew Sophie was dead, but somehow, despite all the bodies in this case, this makes me the saddest. I see her parents, struggling through tears, pleading for their missing daughter to get in contact. The slow reaction of the investigation when it transpired they’d had a major argument the week before her disappearance. “Sophie, if you are watching this, please call. Please come home. We love you and we’re sorry. Please… please come home. We love you.” 

Now she was gone. 

Ash breaks the silence. “The press are outside.”

“Probably one of the neighbours.” 

“Thomas is on his way.”

“Excellent.”

“British-American sarcasm?”

“Something like that.” I’m still holding Sophie’s necklace. I’m holding it again ten hours later when I speak to her parents. Devastated isn’t the word. 



There is no adequate word to explain the agony of losing a child. I can’t describe to you what is sounds like when you have to tell a parent their child is gone. How it sounds like screaming and gasping and crying. It’s not a wail or a cry or a sob. It’s so much more. It’s the sound of your heart breaking. Unless you’ve heard it, you can’t possibly imagine. 

Marissa’s DNA is in the system. Her name is Marcie Jonas and she’s from Mosheim, Tennessee. She’s 26 years old. Ash calls her Father and I hear the sound from across the room. As if someone has stabbed a man in the heart. 

 


That night, nobody calls. We have the kind of night that goes by in slow motion. Ash doesn’t even chew any gum, he just reads over case notes and analyses photographs. I catch him occasionally chewing on a pencil, but it’s silent. It’s so quiet in the office.

Midnight hits and I realise I’ve just missed my birthday. I don’t care. Sophie Blackwater, Marcie Jonas, Paul and Kimberley Bachmann, they won’t have any more birthdays. 

My Brother’s tenth birthday was in January 1984. By the end of the summer, it was his last ever birthday. I don’t think my Mother ever truly recovered from that day in August, 1984. I remember it was hot that day. The kind of sunny day that makes you believe nothing can ever be bad again. By Christmas, my Father had moved out. In February 1985, my Mother forgot my fifth birthday. She never forgave herself. 


The clock on the wall shows five minutes past 4 on the morning of February 14th, 2004. The office is silent. Ash has fallen asleep on his paperwork. I let him rest, he’s exhausted. There are three people in the mission control room and there is no sound in the building. No faxes whirring, no traffic outside, everything is still. 

Most critically ill people die in the 4am window. 

I was born at 4am on Feburary 12th, 1978.

At exactly twenty-five years and 24 hours, six minutes and seventeen seconds after I was born, my cell display lights up, violently buzzing on the table. Ash sleeps on. I reach out and turn the display over, expecting it to be Christina finishing a shift, or my Mom asking me where she left her glasses. 

Its 4:06am. 

Somebody is calling me. I focus my tired eyes and see who it is. 




HARRY HARPER CALLING





It’s 4:06am and I’ll never sleep right again.

2i8pu7,1,2014-10-03,Tips for improving development speed and not feeling like I need to know everything about the code I'm changing?,samwill10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i8pu7/tips_for_improving_development_speed_and_not/,"I had an internship this summer at a company with a pretty fast-paced production cycle. I had a rough-and-tumble time because, due to pretty unlucky circumstances, every project I got assigned had to be put off/cancelled after ~3 weeks, which is pretty bad for a 12 week internship. 

At the end of the internship, I got told that, even taking into account how often my projects got switched on me, I wouldn't be getting an return offer for a full-time after I graduate this year because there was still a rough bar for how much code I could have written, and I didn't meet that. Thinking back over my projects, I agreed with my superiors. I took at least a week to get acclimated to the code I was working in each time I got a new project, and once I did feel ""comfortable"" with starting to write code, I often got stuck going down rabbit holes of trying to figure out how pieces of existing code worked together when I really didn't even need to know. I'm extremely detail-oriented, almost to a fault, and it slows me down a lot. This also renders me unsuccessful at hackathons because I end up spending too much time trying to figure out how to do something instead of just diving in and seeing what happens. 

Anyone have tips for getting over this mindset as I look for full-time work? Is there anything I can do to practice not being this way? It can be directly coding related, or just more general."
2i8qyv,2,2014-10-03,Loyalty and money or opportunity?,_RAZOR_,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2i8qyv/loyalty_and_money_or_opportunity/,"Sorry for the long post. I'm having a hard time working through this.  
  
I recently graduated from university with a degree in engineering at the top of my class. I worked a one year internship at a large construction company in project management related to my field of study. My experience went well and I got invited back the following summer with more money and more responsibility.  
  
The downside is that this industry requires constant travel. You are always on a project for 6-12 months, and you go wherever they assign you. On the upside, you are compensated very well in terms of a travel allowance.  
I had a hard time finding a more stationary job, so after graduation I asked if they would hire me full time. The president of the company said Yes, absolutely. I then got another offer - better salary and a better title, no living allowance but still always traveling (expenses paid - overall money comparable). I took it and said sorry to my old job.  
  
It was horrible, owner was a maniac, company is doomed to fail.  
  
After 3 days I wrote again to my old employer, they said they would still take me back, and that's where I work now 3 months later.  
  
I have been treated very well. Company truck. Better salary than other new grads (who also don't get a truck). They have great confidence in me and give me a lot of responsibility above what I should given my position. Its a fantastic learning experience and the people at the top all seem to have high hopes for me. Plus its a huge company.  I'm basically at the forefront of the biggest project the company has ever built, 3rd in command but currently holding the reins.  
  
But - living away from home and work life balance does not exist.  
  
Added complication - I'm newly engaged, saving for a wedding and a house with a mountain of student loans.  
  
So - I've recently been offered an interview through with a new company, all I need to do is apply. Once again better salary and better title. Plus I am acquainted with people who have worked there for 30+ years who rave about the working conditions and company as a whole. And . . . No travel! All local work! And in the end I would likely only take home a little bit less than I do now (85K after tax currently to ~100K before tax at new job).  
  
What to do?  
Try for the new job and possibly end up screwing an employer who has treated me very well AND given me a second chance? Me leaving right now would have a serious impact on this project (the largest they have built).  
  
I should add, 2 senior guys at the new company are retiring and looking for someone to step up and join the upper ranks.  My current company is larger with more entrenched upper management.  

  
Or - Stay at my current job, remain loyal, make good money, but possibly get shipped off even farther on my next assignment?  
  
Maybe I should reach out to the new company, express interest, but explain that I can't make a move right now but would like to be considered in the future?

2iayth,2,2014-10-04,What's the point anymore?,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2iayth/whats_the_point_anymore/,"For the past four or five years I believe I have been battling depression. I've never told anyone and I've just bottled it up inside. I guess I should start with my upbringing. I'm a typical suburban kid who's family is fairly well off... not so much as some of the people I know, but nothing to complain about. I guess that's one part of my problem. I'm privileged enough to have a roof over my head, food to eat, and access to water. That's more than billions of people out there. So why do I deserve to be depressed when there are so many people worse off than me?

But a little bit about me... I didn't start talking until I was three and when I did, I had problems with my pronunciation of a couple common sounds. Nothing too serious I guess, and I did go to speech therapy for a couple years which helped a little bit, but by the time I got to grade school, I was self-conscious about it. I guess that's part of the reason why I developed a more quiet side. If i didn't talk as much then I wouldn't expose my self to ridicule. 

Up until the 4th grade I would say I stuck to myself and my two main friends that I knew my whole life. Then come 5th grade I started breaking out of my shell and hanging out with a lot of kids in my grade (~40 people in a small school). Everything was going well. I danced with the girl I liked in 6th grade and made a bunch of new friends. All in all life was good. 

But the second half of 8th grade was when things really started to go down hill. My grandfather passed. My aunt was diagnosed with cancer (and eventually passed away). My house caught on fire (luckily no one was hurt). But the thing that really got to me was when a girl said my voice was emotionless and sounded funny. To me, I could never really tell when I'm putting emotion in my voice or not. I assume that when I talk, other people hear a monotone per se, but when I hear myself talk, I hear the fluctuations and emotion in my voice. I guess that's not the case. So with the combinations of all those things piling together, I began to become depressed right before high school.

I reverted back to my old self heading into high school. I hung out with the two kids I had known my whole life and that's it. I never had great social skills, and struggled to meet new people. I rarely talked to girls in high school and definitely never flirted. Even guys could be a struggle to talk to at times because I felt they were too immature (most of them were). Instead of expanding my social horizons, I just told myself I'd focus on my academics, especially since my parents were sending me to a private Catholic school and had to pay out of pocket. I got good grades, and challenged myself academically, but never really challenged myself socially because of fear that people wouldn't like me. I'd go home most days and aimlessly spend hours just waiting for life to get better, but everyday it'd be the same routine: wake up -&gt; go to school -&gt; come home and do homework -&gt; then go to bed. Doing that for four straight years was miserable and now I see how much time I wasted. I never went to junior or senior prom. Went to homecoming once I think and hated it. All in all, my high school years were nothing to look back on in a positive light. 

I invested so much into my academics. I'm now in my freshman year of college and my academics are all I have to show for the past 19 years of my life. Sure I played a couple sports, but don't really play them anymore. Sure I had a couple friends back home, but now we only text once in awhile. I've sunk so low that I struggle to study and get work done. I already withdrew from one of my classes because I fell too far behind and got a D on my first test. I've spent 13 years in school now, and getting a D on that test was tough. I wasn't bothered by the fact that I did poorly. Just the fact that I spent hours upon hours of my life doing schoolwork just to do poorly in a class. That's what really got to me. 

I've never even liked school, I just saw it as an opportunity to improve my life. I thought to myself, sure I won't have a great social life in high school, but once I get into a good school with a degree, I'll be able to make a lot of money and enjoy myself then. But now that I'm in college I realize how much bullshit that is. Every second I'm in class I always imagine a better world outside of academia, but every second I realize that I'm trapped in here for at least the next four years. I haven't made any contributions to society and why should I have to wait until I'm 23 until I can get a ""real"" job in the ""real"" world. If there is a ""real world"" out there than what does that make the world I'm living in now? A ""fake world?"" I'm done with this. I've had suicidal thoughts before, and they have increased more and more over the years. I have 3 friends here at college, and that's it. Can't talk to girls. Can't get good grades. Struggle to talk to most guys. Can't make any impactful contributions to society. If I were to live to 80, I've already lived a quarter of my life and don't have anything to show for it. People always say happiness is greater than money. Well guess what? I'm not going to have any happiness or money at this rate.

My future doesn't look bright either. I'm good at every subject but great at nothing. How am I supposed to pick a major if I'm taking the same basic history, english, math, and science courses over and over again? Sometimes I think it'd be easier to just end it so I wouldn't have to spend another roughly 60 years not doing anything worthwhile. If I were to die, you could probably count on your hands how many people would actually care. I have two sisters, and a grand total of five legit friends throughout my life. 

The thing that brings the most joy to my life is probably my dog, but she's 5 hours away back home so I'll get to see her at Thanksgiving, winter break, spring break, and any summers that I don't get any internships I guess. I literally don't have much in my life at the moment that I get excited about or enjoy. I'll spend hours surfing the web or playing a game that I really don't care about. 

I just got off a FaceTime call with my parents and as usual I didn't say much. Just the usual ""hi how's it going,"" then the ""how are your classes going?"" and then we say bye. When the people closest to me only talk about my classes with me, it really makes me realize how little I actually do. If my worth and value comes from the classes I take, then what's the point? I'd rather skip the BS small talk and just not talk to them about things I no longer care about. I struggle enough to talk as it is, and when people talk about boring ass topics like school, then I feel I'm just wasting my time. Not that my time is worth much but you get the point.

My mom has asked me a few times over the years if I'm ""ok"" when I'm clearly depressed, and of course I just lie and say ""yeah, what do you mean?"" I want to get better, but I don't know how and if I don't get better, then why spend the rest of my life in this miserable state of existence?"

So, sorry if this is a repeat.
I got my BS in biology, but late in my degree had a change of heart.  I would like to pursue a job in CS, like software developer.  I am currently in a MS degree program for CS.  I have taken all the prerequisites (programming 1,2,&amp;3, computer architecture, software engineering, databases, networking, discrete math, calculus, and statistics), which I feel is close to the same schooling of a BS graduate.  I was thinking with that schooling I might be able to get a job in the field, but without an official degree in CS yet it might not cut it without experience.  My other option is to do an internship to get experience.  I am currently working a factory job full time(a little over $1700/month) which I would have to quit if I did an internship.  I live in Michigan and would like to stay in Michigan.
My question is: Will an internship help me enough where it would be justifiable to quit my current job?  Do I have close to the same chances of find a job in the field without an internship?  Do I need to finish my MS degree before I can get an entry level job?"

I could just go to hospital, where they have more of a neutral ""We're not going to force you into going down any path"" look on things, but last time I was there, I still got worse. I cried until my eyes were hurting, until I couldn't breath and stressed out until I had a really bad nose bleed."

I cannot land jobs at agencies or the corporate world, much less internships.  Had a few interviews, but didn't make it beyond that.  

I regret the major I picked nearly every day.  It's definitely not my passion and I feel I only picked it because I enjoyed 2 electives I took in college that covered the subject (before declaring the major) and because the major was easy to do.  I feel like I fucked up and there's no going back, and I wonder how I was so stupid when I picked my major.  

At the same time I view a career change as this huge unclimbable mountain and I feel like I'm stuck in PR or working a dead end minimum wage job at Wal-Mart. (I'm actually unemployed right now, I don't have any job really) and not doing anything with my life.  

So what is my passion?  I've always been good with technology/computers.  My relatives were shocked I didn't go into the field.

2idf95,2,2014-10-05,"My wife is Goldilocks. Is there a fulfilling career out there for her, or is she looking for something that doesn't exist?",proxross,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2idf95/my_wife_is_goldilocks_is_there_a_fulfilling/,"Hello, and thanks for reading. This is my first ever Reddit post (long time lurker) and it is to ask all of you for some thoughts on career advice for my wife.

She will be graduating with a Masters in Social Work next year and is struggling for what to do with her career. She likes the notion of helping others (hence the MSW) but after going through the programs and associated internships she has found a clash with the culture and her personality. She is a very straight-shooter type and the social work/non-profit element of exploring feelings and working with sensitive ""delicate flower types"" isn't lining up well. 

Factoring that in, the next best thing we could come up with is working for some sort of for-profit company that helps people, or at least a non-profit that isn't so touchy-feely and has clear objectives and for-profit like business practices (like Kiva). HOWEVER. She also comes from a pre-graduate school background of international development and struggles with the way that a lot of these types of companies are run. Often, these companies are founded by MBAs, or people that have worked their entire careers in unrelated industries and have decided to ""give back"" without having any ""get-your-hands-dirty""/""on-the-ground"" experience to tell them what the real issues are. That style tends to exclude, omit or marginalize the type of experience my wife has, which frustrates her because she feels that she would fit in well at such a company, but her background isn't something they would consider. And yes, this is true because if you look at the LinkedIn profiles of staff members at these types of companies, they lean heavily on the MBA/finance/economic/technology raised types of candidates, not to mention her interview response rate. Now, I'm not saying all companies are like this, but let me put it this way: I've been fairly hands off up until this point because my wife is a strong, intelligent, driven woman that prides herself in her independence. For me to get involved to the point where I'm asking strangers on the internet for help hopefully shows that we've looked for a company that does what she want to be a part of, that has staff with people of her professional and academic background, and we haven't found a fit yet. 

Our final thought is hey, why not just start a business? This would likely be the best solution as it would eliminate any cultural differences and allow her to do what she wanted, but we're recently married and in the near future have plans to buy a house, start a family and the risk for this seems a bit high. Surely there has to be:

1. A company that already exists that...
2. Has a primary objective to help under-privileged people that... 
3. Has its core practices based on experiences from people who have done the actual work that...
4. Hires people from diverse educational and professional backgrounds that...
5. Aren't a bunch of overly concerned, hyper-sensitive people who let their emotions prohibit progress on getting stuff done that...
6. Has a focus on international work, since that is where her background and passion reside.

Now - we've both given this an enormous amount of thought and particularly with her, research. If there is someone who knows of a company as described as above, please let me know. If you have experience in this situation or have had the experience with anything I've written so far, by all means share. What I'm trying to avoid are replies based on speculation. Trust me, we've speculated. What would really help is solid, actionable advice and guidance!

For what it is worth: We're both in our mid-thirties and I am able support both of us comfortably, though not comfortably enough to the point where moving our savings towards starting a business is a clear decision. We're based in the US.

Thanks!"

I learned C# in school, Java by..well its almost C# and JS by using it in my first internship. But now I want to learn C++ by myself. I got myself a book from my local library, c++ primer 5th edition, and started reading but I kept noticing I already knew this. I'm now almost 125 pages in and all I learned was the basics of pointers and a few Coding Conventions. 

So my questions is how do you learn a programming language when someone already knows one? Are there any tips? Should one jump in and watch where the winds will take him? Or should one learn again from the beginning to the end?

Before one starts asking, yes I read the side bar but i think my question goes beyond that."

I would ultimately want an internship designing databases AND writing queries. Is that possible for a single position? Would I be doing more? Do companies even need database people to write queries for them, or are they just written by software engineers who don't touch databases?

I've also been told that if you go into databases right out of college you can become stuck there and it will be difficult to transfer to a software development position. Has this been true in anyone's experience? I want to try databases, SE, and QA to get a feel of which one I like the best.

I've been really feeling how bad my anxiety gets the last few months or so. I've always been extremely anxious around people but the last few months have pushed me to a tipping point of sorts. I'm graduating college in a few months and I've been looking back at all of the missed opportunities, all of the regrets, and all of the fuckups I've had over the years and its really getting to me. 

I'm 22 and I've never had a real job before. I've applied for a lot, gotten maybe 2 or 3 interviews, and bombed those catastrophically. After awhile I just gave up and decided to focus on school. With graduation coming up and looking at how bland and empty my resume will be, I decided to start applying for internships. Long story short, I got one.

What a fucking mistake that was. The job description was vague but I said screw it because it would like pretty nice on a resume once I'm done with it but I seriously regret this decision. Its only been two weeks but working here drives my anxiety to new levels. I work with people 15 - 20 years older than me and I feel like they all judge me and talk down to me. No one ever gives me any sort of direction or instruction on how to do assignments they give me, they just plop a stack of paperwork on my desk before I arrive and I'm just supposed to know what to do with them. And then when I finally work up the nerve to talk to someone about it, they make me feel like a fucking moron for not knowing how to do it.

The other day the secretary was out and so I was placed at her desk. I had to manage the phone, deal with the front door, sort and distribute mail, and do all of my other stuff on top of it. I seriously felt like I was going to have a mental breakdown. Answering and talking on the phone is one of my biggest hangups (get it) and it was even worse due to the fact that the majority of questions people had I had no answers to. I'm instructed to transfer these kinds of calls to other people in the office but everyone comes and goes throughout the day so I end up transferring the person to a deadline, resulting in them calling back and asking why I'm a fucking idiot. Multiply this response for everything else that I do for 8.5 hours a day. During my breaks I go to my car and just sit, trying not to cry and trying to stop myself from shaking from the stress of not fucking up during the course of the day. I don't eat during lunch because of the nausea, I feel like I'm losing weight. By the end of the day I just drive 1.5 hours back up to school where I try not to lose my shit and cry on the drive home.

Things don't stop there either. I'm the same way in school, too. I barely have any friends. I don't talk to anyone because I know I'll probably fuck up and look stupid in front of them. I've (obviously) never been on a date or had a girlfriend. The idea of that happening is so far from reality it barely phases me anymore. But the fact that I'm graduating soon makes me feel like shit about it. I'm going to graduate and move back home where there's no one my age and be alone. I've wasted 4 years of being surrounded by people my age by living in constant fear of them. Thinking about how badly I've fucked things up so far in life depresses me beyond belief. I don't even know why I try. 

The one area/activity that doesn't completely paralyze me is rock climbing. I've been climbing at my school's gym for 4 years now and I've never made one friend. Not one. I climb three days a week, for long sessions and not once has anyone talked to me. But I haven't tried either so I have no right to complain. I'm confident and not anxious there for whatever reason, but everywhere else in life I feel like breaking down. I can't explain it.

I guess the end-point here is that I've realized that I need to get help. My school has counseling services but nerves and arrogance have put me off from seeking help for almost 4 years now. Its free as a student so I might as well take advantage of it. I don't know if it is going to help me though. If he tries to prescribe meds, I won't be able to take them. I have no job, so that means no money of my own. I can't talk to my parents or anyone else about this for a lot of reasons. My mom has anxiety problems of her own and constantly worries about me and I fear that coming forth with my own issues will just make her even worse. I don't have anyone else to talk to, even as a ""shoulder to cry on"", so to speak. I don't see myself getting better but if I don't try I fear I'm gonna jump off a bridge or something years down the line. I'm tired of being alone, feeling like shit all of the time, and not experiencing life because of the fear and stress of interacting with people.

If anyone has got tips or similar experiences, I'm all ears."

I'll be surprised if anyone has the time to read all of this, and that's okay. Thank you for any amount you care to read. :)


I am a graduate student in a nursing program. I'm a good student and I take school and my work very seriously. Before this, I had never had a bad experience with an academic program, ever. I have been completely blindsided by this situation and it's affected me so badly that I am considering dropping out of the program. Considering quitting is very out of character for me. I'm usually the ""tough one,"" but this is crushing me. Everyone has their limits and this has worn me down over 2 years.


So here it is: There is one faculty member, who also happens to be the department chair, who has apparently decided that I am on his personal shitlist. I don't know how this happened, but I've heard from students that he's singled out people before. Don't have the details though. Starting a couple years ago (I came into the program in 2012), every time I had to speak with him he always seemed on the verge of just bitching me out, especially if we were alone. So at first I figured okay, so he doesn't like me. I'm an adult, I can deal. Just smile and try to stay out of his way. 


That was fine until he started escalating. I've taken three courses with him, and a couple semesters ago other people started noticing his behavior towards me. Other students started asking me why he would be rude to me in class, or borderline-chew me out, or would just be generally unforgiving. Like, if another student forgot to bring in homework, he would smile and say it was totally fine, not to worry about it; but if I did something like that, he would berate me in front of everyone. At first I was okay, it just made me try harder. I thought maybe he was just pushing me to do better. Oh, I was very wrong. It got to the point that he was obviously looking for reasons to get mean, but he still never really crossed the line. Just made me beyond stressed out, started to get depressed, just scared all the time that I was going to fuck up somehow or run into him in the hallway. Made me really jumpy and anxious. The general atmosphere got really hostile and it started affecting my health. I lost a lot of weight and I had some other stress-related health problems. I got seriously depressed and it started to affect my home life.


Despite all of that I still got straight A's and did really well in my internships. Both of my site reviews stated that I was one of the best interns they had ever had, and they both wanted me to continue working with them. So fast forward to this semester. Like most medical (and I guess, graduate) programs we have yearly progress reviews with faculty. I was actually kind of excited about mine because I knew I had done really well and I was looking forward to getting some positive feedback. I really felt like I needed it after all the hostility and negativity. So who decide to do my faculty review? Yep you guessed it. Dr. Department Chair. He didn't do everyone's. Just mine and a couple others.


By this time I had had enough bad experiences with him that I had already begun secretly recording my interactions with him. (Yes, I live in a single-party consent state. I researched it before I did it) I never got anything too bad. Mostly he is one of those people that says really nasty things in really subtle ways, usually with a smile on his face. Sometimes I didn't realize how awful something he said was until I was away from him. Maybe I should say how I interact with him... I definitely don't kiss his ass (maybe why he hates me), but I am *always* respectful and polite. I take pride in being a professional, and I consider school my job. I am not going to allow someone to take advantage of me, but I am also not going to do something stupid like get bratty or something. My response when I get mad in these situations is to just nod my head and not respond, not get baited into an argument. Anyway, the end of year review is supposed to be feedback from all your teachers, your advisors, your supervisors, anyone who worked with you. It's meant to be constructive so you know what to work on.


So, recall that this is at the culmination of two of the worst years I have ever had, emotionally and physically, much of which was due to him and other weird, unprofessional things that happened to me in the program. I went into this meeting and he spent the first 30 minutes (no joke) berating me about a quiz that I had missed and had to make up about 6 months before. Then he spent the next 30 minutes talking about how all the teachers, including him, feel that I am disrespectful and unprofessional. He said that I had disrespected him. He said a lot of very specific things, like that I think I know more than my teachers. He said that I think that I shouldn't have to take tests. He said that I think I'm too good to have to go to class or sit next to my classmates. He said all of these things as ""You think ____,"" saying that I actually do think and do those things. He said that certain teachers had told him these things, in addition to what he thought of me. What bothers me the most about this is that he said that I THINK THESE THINGS. **That is completely untrue!** He never asked me my thoughts on anything. In fact, I barely spoke more than two words during the entire hour I was in there. I was too much in shock. I knew I couldn't defend myself, because this was clearly not about my performance, since he was reveling in his cruelty, making little smiles every time he said something particularly vicious. Nothing I could have said would have helped, so I just let him go on. I was in shock inside. I think because I wasn't responding by getting visibly mad it made him more angry, because he got progressively nastier as the hour wore on. 


At the end I was so stunned that I just wanted to get out. He gave me my progress review and told me to sign it. He had failed my clinical work for the year, despite that I had nothing but wonderful reviews in my clinical work. He said it wouldn't affect my gpa, but still. I was so desperate to get out of his office that I didn't care at that point, I just signed it. I should have read it first. 


I got to my car and just cried. It was too much, to have everything I worked for failed because he had such a problem with me, for some reason I didn't even know. All the teachers that I got along great with. According to him, they believed all that shit too. I had developed (I thought) good relationships with all of them except him. To hear that they had problems with me too was heartbreaking, and I didn't understand it. I looked at the progress review form then... He had put everything he said in writing. Lifeinsthesky1 thinks she is better than everyone else. Lifeinthesky1 thinks she is too good for this program. And so on. All in first person, as though I actually thought and said those things. All untrue. AND THEN HE HAD MADE ME SIGN IT. That was the final stab to my stomach. He did not say one positive thing to me the entire time I was in there. No, other students did not have this experience. Just me.


The thing is that if there had been actual criticism, I would have been fine with it. We need critique to improve. But this wasn't critique... and it was almost all false. After a few days I worked up the guts to talk to the teachers that had supposedly told him some of these things. They were pretty upset when I told them what happened. One in particular, who was the supposed source of much of Dr. Department Chair's ""information,"" was visibly angry and immediately told me in no uncertain terms that he did *not* say any of that. That made me feel a little better, at least, to know that I wasn't crazy. But then what? He still subjected me to all that and made me sign an actual document that went into my file. He said that it wouldn't be permanent once I graduated and it's not shared with employers, but still, it's in there and any other faculty or staff can see it. 


Of course, the malicious abuse is continuing. I do my best to stay out of his way and be polite when I see him. I worry about the things he says to the department about me. He still, if he's alone with me, makes disguised-but-nasty comments about my performance or professionalism. It's weird because I do my best to be professional, despite how he's acting towards me, and performance-wise I do very well.


So to the point. I'm sorry this was so long. I haven't told anyone this whole story yet and I got pretty emotional writing it all down. I am tired. I am so tired of his mistreatment. I pay a lot of money for this school and I have worked really hard to get here. I feel like I deserve to be treated respectfully. I do have a pretty thick skin but I feel like that review meeting crossed the line, and making me sign that paper was going too far. My question is, is what he did slander or libel? Do I have grounds for a lawsuit against him or the department or the university? I know he talked to the other faculty about me and it did effect the intern position I got (he gave me the worst one we have). I have the recording of the meeting, but like I said he didn't say anything overtly abusive (he's too smart for that I think), just a lot about me as a person. My health has suffered, physically and mentally, and I don't know if I can keep forging ahead in this place, but I don't want to waste the time and money I've spent, and I still love what I'm doing. 


I think it's worth noting that this has NEVER happened to me before, ever, in any academic or professional setting. No one has EVER said these things about me before. I mentioned to a few of the people I worked with outside this program some of the things that were said about me, and they outright laughed. Said it was crazy to say that stuff about me, of all people. Yet Dr. Department Chair has something of a reputation for being a dick, and people talk about him being unprofessional and mean. The whole thing is as insulting as it was upsetting. He undermined me both as a professional and as a person.


I haven't given my state, and I know that makes it kind of difficult. I don't know if I should pursue this with a lawyer or not. I feel justified in being outraged at how I've been treated, but I don't know if that translates to having legal grounds for a lawsuit. I'm not one of those people that's always looking to sue... I have really no idea how it works because I've never been in a position like this before. But I feel like I've put up with enough, and the only way this will stop is if I pursue legal action. 


Thank you for reading this. Any advice would be appreciated.


Tl;dr: 2.5 years into a graduate program and the department chair has gotten progressively more unprofessional towards me, becoming what I feel is abusive. He has created a hostile environment towards me that has gotten so bad that I have had very real and serious consequences to my physical and mental health. I recorded a meeting with him where he said that I say/do a lot of things that were untrue, and where he said a lot of personal and mean things about me as a person, and then he made me sign a document agreeing to all of it. Found out later that he had lied about what other teachers had said about me, that he included in the document. I want to know if what he did qualifies as slander or libel and if I can do anything legally about his abuse. I don't want to drop out of this program. I really want to finish. :(

Thank you reddit. Just getting this off my chest has made me feel a little better. :)

I have no experience from internships or side projects, but am in the process of working on a capstone project for my degree.  This project is a group project that consists of working with a client from outside of the University and seems to be a way for students to gain experience with working in a group environment as well as working for someone else with deadlines and expectations. What I was wondering about is what else would I be able to do in order to become a better candidate post graduation for a job in the CS area.  I was unable to get a internship over the summer because of personal reasons but I still want to get some experience before I graduate since this industry seems to be driven more off experience when it comes to getting a job.


Edit: I am also wondering what technologies/languages I should try to pick up since I only have experience with Java and C++."

So how did an English teacher with minimal experience (and actually no credentials) become the sole system admin for a school with four servers (seven now), a website that hadn’t been updated since 2011, over 900 devices, and 3000 users (and BYOD)? 


During an internship for my MA in Education, I just happend to fix my cooperating teacher’s laptop for them - a simple driver issue. As it had turned out, there hadn’t been a tech at the site in over a year. Long story short, my paperwork was rushed through, I was screened (A process that had people asking me questions such as “Do you know what ‘reimaging’ is?” “What’s Active Directory?”, “How would you troubleshoot a network issue?” and a few dozen other questions anyone with a sense about computers could easily answer - next thing I know I’m signing a contract. What’s the worst that could happen? 


That was October 2013, and let me just say that had I known then what I know now I would have never accepted the position - and not only because I’m making about $10 per hour (pre-tax, I really don’t want to talk about it)… but that’s not the point of this post. Over the last half year or so, I’ve cataloged thousands of calls, some ranging from simple password resets, to major server rebuilds (which I taught myself how to do - trial by fire and all) to some of the most inane things that not only make me as an educator, and a person of somewhat good common sense, literally weep. 


Being that I am an English teacher, writing has been another hobby (as well as a source of living for some time of my life) - and also a form of therapy. I have about two dozen “good” bad stories that I’d like to catalog in one place - so until I run out of steam, I am going to share them here. The goal is to not specifically to poke fun at the level of competency around me - but rather to share experiences with people that can understand and hopefully relate - and ultimately even share their own stories in the same vein. 



I have several ideas to run with, including character profiles and insane job responsibilities - but to start this project off I want to tell a story that began about two months ago



***


 I was on my way to setting up a high stakes testing lab after our custodial staff manhandled them to clean the floors over the summer when I stopped by a teacher I hadn’t had many run ins with prior to that day. The conversation went as most of my conversations since starting this gig have, the user asks how I’m doing, and moves into some awkward relationship building (on their part, I’m an easy going kind of guy), and after a few seconds I decided to continue to the lab of 50 computers that needed to literally be reassembled. The user follows. After a few seconds of keeping pace with me, I turn to the late 20-something and bluntly asked if there was something I could help them with. 


“I need new speakers. Mine don’t seem to be working.” about sums up the user’s confusing babble.


I inform the user that small things like speakers were not supplied by the school - but they could request some with their department budget. Unsatisfied with this reply, the user seemed pretty upset, at which point I remind the user of my self-imposed workflow policy of “Email me and I’ll put you on my docket.” I genuinely meant this.


The user huffed and left me to my own business and I filed the incident under “I’ll deal with that crazy at a later date.” and didn’t think about it again.


Until a month later, when I received the following email, from the district’s standard tech request system, and not the website I put together to help maintain the ticket system. I feel the need to tell the user that when this form is used, my AP of Admin and my principal, the only people I answer to, receive a copy. This will be somewhat important a little later. 


“No sound. Nothing. Hard to watch required videos and be expected to pass tests without sound. You said you would replace the speakers and yet you never did.” 


I added this to my docket and got around to it sometime later that afternoon. I set up an appointment with the user for when I would be stopping by, and the user assured me they’d be in the room at the time - they weren't. Fortunately, I had keys and was able to let myself in to the classroom. My good fortune continues as when I enter the room, there’s only one computer (despite my inventory saying there were supposed to be four present - but that’s a tale for another day). 


I hop on to the computer, and yet another surprise is found - the user is logged in and has not locked their workstation. I’m actually happy about this, so I can replicate the environment in which the error is occurring. The first thing I do is load up YouTube and play one of the videos on the front page, and sure enough - there’s no sound. 


First and foremost, the educator in me gets riles up - as the “required” videos the user spoke of is supposed to be done outside of school (I had to do it as well). But then, it’s not my place to judge how others use their “free” (see: instruction) time. Onward to the rest of the story! 


The first thing I check is to make sure the speakers were powered on. They weren't. I click the speakers over to the on position, and electricity fills them instantly - and then in the third period, plasticpal made sound


Easy job was easy, and feeling satisfied, I leave a note on the user’s workstation saying the sound was working once again, explained to the user what had happened and asked them to confirm with me that they noticed it was working - and carry on about my day. 


The user did not email, which in my experience, isn’t exactly rare in our line of work. But I knew for a fact that the audio was working. I did not think about this incident again (outside of a laugh or three with a special bottle of whiskey).


Until I received the following email, again sent to both of my admins, about a month later:


“No sound on the computer. This is my 3 request. Was told it fixed first time but still havent ‘herd’ anything.” 
(^a literal copy + paste)


It wasn't the snarky comments or ""better than you are"" attitude that irked me, nor the fact that my name is being muddied with my admins - but more the fact that I knew that I would have to actually deal with this in person again.


I wrote the user back asking when they would be in their room,to which they promptly emailed me back detailing every minute detail during their day, but not actually specifying a time for me to come by. So I just bluntly decided to ask, ""6:25 is a good time,"" I receive back. Problem, I'm not on campus that early. Solution, according to the user: Come in a ""few minutes"" early.


I explain that was not an option, the user work replies telling me that its expected that I help the users,and that I should work around them. I said that's what I was trying to do, but during the hours of 7:30-3. ""Well technically 7:20 to 3:30"" they reply.


At this point, I decided to leave the user in ignorance because it did not matter. My hours aren’t set by me, and there’s no OT (or “comp time”) if I work even a second over at the request of an admin - so on the principle of it all, I said no. This conversation went back and forth for several messages until finally I found out the user was going to be in their room come first hour of work the following day.


But before I get called to my P’s office - to get reamed for not jumping when the user said to jump. “Why is it taking 3 requests to get work done?” I explained the situation, but I may as well have been talking to the wall. 


The next morning, I make my way out go the user's location (which is a half mile exactly from my office). Knock on the door. Nothing. Knock again. Nothing again. I let myself in with a key,and jump right in to the task at hand. I'd walk you through how I troubleshat the issue dearest reader, but I don't think that's necessarily pertinent to this story, suffusive to say that the speakers were still powered on and sound was indeed still coming out of them. I turned on one of my favorite 10 hour video of ambiance music, wrote a note explaining sound was working, and took my leave. Surely the have “herd” the sound. 


I bump into the user later on that day. I explain that I had just left their room and sound was working,to which they asked what I did. Jokingly I said I turned their speakers on and they were not amused. I explained that I hadn't done anything except to verify the sound was working - when the user explained there still was no sound. Reluctantly, I decided to ask the user to show me exactly what they were doing that was causing sound to not work. Better to snip this now, I guess.


We get back to the user's room and they immediately close out of the Youtube mix I’d loaded up earlier, to open up another IE (sigh) window to load up a clip they had watched that, according to the user, ""hadn't had sound all year long.""


The clip quickly clicked into place; Strangely the user was right: There was no audio on the video at all. For a moment, if only briefly, I questioned what was real. 

That is until I looked at the video : A black and white film found on YouTube that, in the title and description read: ""A silent film from the 20’s.”

I was in the air force for 4 years, I had a desk job so I was able to take classes while I was in. I took physics, math and a ton of stuff. Around 60 credits, unfortunately only about 6 transferred. Anyways I didn't learn anything I realized, the classes were from a local college but they were specifically easy for the military.

I started going to a community college and I really struggled, I failed algebra, retook it, failed trig, retook it, failed calculus, retook it. I don't know what I am doing with my life, I just can't learn. I really wanted to get out of the air force, I hated it and it was the worst experience of my life. I just couldn't stand it, having no control over my life, going on random 2 month deployments to nowhere and having to drop everything I am doing (those classes? yea you just sort of get exempts on everything and pass anyways) and get fucked.

Anyways I am not in a state university and I fucking hate it. I work really, really hard. All I basically do is spend time on class, 80+ hour weeks plus some side stuff so I am profitable and I am not doing well at all. I hate my life, I am getting Ds or Cs in all my computer science and math classes. I can't keep up with the work, I just work and work and work and I never get anything done. 

I know I am not smart, I know I am not the most focused and hardest working person but this is beyond infuriating. I just never do well, I am extremely competitive so I want to get 100 percent on everything I do, I want to be the best at everything but I am always the worst. It is extremely embarrassing, upsetting and frustrating to me. 

I have 3 more semesters left but if I change schools and make my degree a BA it would only take me 1 more semester. Does it really matter? I am going to graduate with under a 2.5 GPA no matter what I do at this point so obviously my GPA is not going on my resume. I applied for about 60 internships and no one would touch me because my GPA wasn't about 3.2. 

I really don't know what to do, I just feel like I am fucked. I'm not a great programmer, I am not a smart person, I can't do well in any of my classes, I am not social, I don't do anything and I don't make friends I am just wasting my time in college. What the fuck do I do? I am fucking miserable. I don't know how to learn and I am not smart enough to get by without putting a shit load of effort in but this makes me fall behind so far I never have a chance to catch up.

I am thinking about just dropping out of school, is there really any point in getting a CS degree with a 2.2gpa? I mind as well drop out and spend the next two years learning something, working on a real project and then using that on my resume. Doesn't that look better than CS 101 - Command line interface solitare CS 102 A really neat tree sort CS 103 A totally unusable iterator CS 105 An unusable database

What do I do? Should I just cut my losses and drop out of school? I really don't think school is for me, I don't learn but I am also not smart enough to learn on my own I guess. I am just sort of stupid and lazy so I don't know what to do. Maybe I shouldn't even be doing CS, maybe I should just work retail for the rest of my life I don't know but I work hard and get nothing out of it."

2ifh6v,158,2014-10-06,There's something off about my new neighbors [UPDATE],AlaskanStoryteller,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ifh6v/theres_something_off_about_my_new_neighbors_update/,"Here is the first part of what's been happening: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ic3es/there_is_something_off_about_my_new_neighbors/

To address some concerns: I have filled my parents (and a couple other neighbors) in on all the weird stuff that's been happening. We do have guns in our house and we know how to use them. I'm not super concerned about being able to defend myself, though I would be pretty concerned if I actually had to against my neighbors. That's some scary shit. Anyway, back to what's happened since last night...

So last night after I submitted my post about what had been going on, I left to meet some friends. As I was about to open my front door, I saw someone standing on my porch, huddled against the house. I couldn't see much, so I stood debating about what to do. I finally decided to just throw the door open and demand an explanation. I gathered my courage and held my breath as I flung the door open. To my surprise, the person standing on the porch was a girl, about my age. She had shoulder length black-red hair, a nose ring, eyebrow piercing, and black fingernails that held a cigarette between her now trembling fingers. She looked like a deer in the headlights when I threw the door open, and looked as though she was about to run. I furrowed my brow.

""Who are you?"" I stepped closer cautiously, now more curious than anything.

""Look, I'm sorry."" She had a twinge of a French accent. ""I'm Alana. I uh... Sorry. I just had to get away."" She gestured towards the house next door, where the weird, foreign sounding chanting was still in full swing. ""I get so *sick* of it sometimes. Pretending to be..."" Her voice trailed off as she seemed to realize she had said too much. She laughed. ""You know what I mean. Parents, right?"" She took a long drag on her cigarette and blew it out between her lips. ""That's why I moved to Nice. Only come back once a year now."" She waltzed down to the end of my driveway and dropped her cigarette in the street. ""Again, sorry for standing on your porch. Like I said, parent stuff.""

And with that she was gone. She turned around and walked back up the driveway towards the house. I know she thought I stopped watching her; she couldn't see me from where she was. She glanced over her shoulder, and pulled something out of her bag. At first I froze when I saw the blonde head of hair. I was certain for a moment that it was her own mother's severed head. Air returned to my lungs when I saw her swing it up over her head. A wig. Of course. For a second I was relieved, but then I realized that that was still weird. I sighed and walked to my car, reluctantly accepting the fact that I would not be finding out anymore that night. When I got home around 2am the street was silent, and no light or movement came from the Braverman's.

Fast forward to today, pretty normal morning. I slept until almost 12pm though, so when I got up I had a bunch of texts and missed calls, mostly from my friend Donna asking if I wanted to have a study session with her at a local coffee shop. I said yes and hastily got ready. When I walked out the door the street was covered in fog. I shivered and hurried towards my car, when seemingly out of nowhere someone grabbed my arm.

""What the **fuck**!!"" I yelled as I yanked my arm away. Alana stood before my with wide, pleading eyes and a finger to her lips. 

""Come over real quick.""

""Fuck no what do you want?!"" This was too weird, I don't even know her!

""Please? I just want to show you something. They'll be back in like twenty minutes please we don't have time to talk about this."" The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end; she was scared. Really scared.

""Okay... I have to be somewhere. So real quick.""

As she led me inside, she told me a version of what has been going on. I'm just going to summarize what she said. Basically, her parents were always a good Catholic couple, as normal as they come. So when Alana was in middle school and rebelled against their traditional values by converting to Wiccan, they had a cow, to put it mildly. She said they went as far as to hire an exorcist.

""And it wasn't even *real*, you know? I don't believe in that stuff, I was 13 for Christ's sake. I actually go to Catholic church now in France. But they could never let it go.""

So she went to Connecticut for college, got an internship with French vogue, and moved to Paris. Now she works for a small publishing firm in Nice, but that's beside the point. She comes home once a year, she said, and everything is like it always has been.

""Until now. It's terrifying. They do strange things and they tell me it's all 'part of church'. Bullshit! I've been to mass in the Vatican, and I've never seen or heard anything like the shit they do. And they make me pretend to be like them. All polished and perfect. And for who? Their weird ass friends? Those people look more like me than them anyway."" She pulled me into the house.

You know how when you go into other people's houses they always have a smell? And when it comes to your own house you never notice the smell? Their house had no smell. None at all. Everything was totally normal, of course. The upstairs was as I had remembered it from when Tory lived there; all the doors were open but one.

""That's their room. And this is the one they set up for when I stay here. But this..."" She gestured to the one closed door. ""They wouldn't let me in there. Said it was storage and they were embarrassed. Well, last night while their little friends were here I went to snoop and it was locked. They aren't all that bright though, so I found the key pretty easily. And what I found... I just don't understand. They'll be back soon so look quick and tell me what you think I should do. I'm afraid to sleep here another night.""

And with that she opened the door. The smell of rubbing alcohol hit me like a truck, but soon I couldn't even focus on the smell. I can barely even describe what I saw in front of me. A large black pot with what looked like grease in it, full to the top, sat off to one side. Dolls were stacked in one corner with their mouths and eyes stitched shut. But the creepiest thing was the loom. It stood against the back wall, directly across from us, and had woven strips of... Something woven through it. It looked like normal cloth at first, but I realized it was obviously stained with something. And thicker than normal cloth. I have no idea what it was but it looked *wrong*. A big basin stood in front of the loom with a dark liquid that looked... Off. Suddenly, Alana checked her watch and rushed me out of the room. She shut and locked the door and ushered me downstairs and back out into the street.

""So? I don't know what to do, it's like they're witches or something!"" 

I just stared at her. ""Dude, call the cops.""

""On what grounds? 'Hey my parents have some creepy dolls and are doing a strange sewing project'?"" She was frantic.

""Look, I'll talk to my parents about it but I don't know what to tell you. Something is definitely up with your folks, they act way too normal and do way too weird of things when they're not acting normal. I don't know what's going on, but we'll figure it out, okay? I have to go, but try to find out what you can. I'll be back tonight and we can talk.""

So I left, and when I got home I told my parents everything. My dad was immediately on the defensive and told me to never go inside their house again, but that he wanted to help Alana and didn't know what we should do. He said he would get some of his cop friends to look into it, as discreetly as possible. I told Alana all this when I met up with her about an hour ago, but she didn't say much. I know she's scared and I offered to have her stay with me but she said that would just make them more suspicious. Tomorrow is Monday, so the cops are going to find as much information on Tom and Sandra Braverman as they possibly can, and get back to us. I'm sorry that this post raised more questions than answers but I am totally lost and getting your opinions helps tremendously. "
2ifi2x,1,2014-10-06,Setting up IT Support infrastructure,mikkel421427,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2ifi2x/setting_up_it_support_infrastructure/,"Greetings!

Very recently (read: 3 weeks ago), I was hired on as an intern at the local theatre, and I was handed the task of cleaning out the depot so that the single permanent IT technician would have a better place to work other than his own office desk. This has since led me to take on the task of, in general, trying to put up a more dedicated IT infrastructure. So far, it has been going well. The IT workshop now has two desks, one being the desk on where I'm currently typing this and the other one being a dedicated workbench, intended for Hardware fixings. Now, the hardware side of it, I have fairly nicely locked down (A screwdriver and a case of bits, mostly insulated (best I could manage, I nicked it from the basement woodshop), planning to get my hands on a soldering iron, and a voltmeter. Already got a powerstrip attached to the table so that I can have multiple PCs hooked up, so that together with the networking switch, me and my boss would be able to update multiple PCs at once). 

Now, this is all well and good, but I have run into a bit of a snag. While we do run on a TerminalServer (Remote Desktop'ing into your workstation, pretty much), the first, and pretty much only, avenue of action in case a machine shits itself when it comes to the software is to nuke it from orbit and reinstall Windows. And by this, I mean from scratch. So, in order to try as hard as possible to get away from the nuclear solutions, I am turning to you guys in a hope that you can recommend me some software (preferably stuff you can shove onto a USB-stick or similar) which can do some of the following things:

*  Restore from an image. I have already thought about Deep Freeze, since that's what they use at my dad's school (the kids got smart, the IT department became smarter), but I would like to know if you can think of anything better/cheaper/more practical/whatever.

* Clean the computer. Here I'm talking about anything from CCleaner to Malwarebytes and everything in between. Not anti-virus software, though. We already run F-secure.

* Possibly automate some stuff. I'm only an intern here until mid-December and from then on, my future is a little bit uncertain. I might move company, might stay here, or might just be straight-up out of work and my boss simply doesn't have the time to do everything, since he handles pretty much ALL the IT in this place, ranging from the ticket sales system, to the terminal server, to the great big F-off screen outside that shows what's going on in the building. 

* Help him monitor stuff remotely. This one is a rather recent addition, but it fell into my head after they were discussing the ventilation system in one of the theatre halls, they ran into the issue that they didn't have any way of checking if the ventilation was working properly other than adjusting it on the computer (which is in one end of the building, followed by going all the way to the theatre hall itself (in the other end of the building). Now, this point is not a requirement, since it'll likely end up being rather expensive and not completely necessary, but it would still be nice to be able to control most of the building without being chained to the desk.

* Something else I haven't thought of, but that you guys think would be nice to just have, just in case.

One last requirement for all of this. It has to be fairly easy to learn how to use, or at least somewhat quickly googlable. I don't have proper training as an IT technician, I mainly use Plug'N'Play stuff and my boss simply doesn't have the time between helping set up IT for the shows that are coming in and making sure that the building IT in general doesn't burn to the ground.

Go by the assumption that we have nothing in place, software-wise, other than F-Secure when it comes to Software repair.

If you can provide documentation for why we should choose precisely this or that piece of software, it would be nice, since, in his eyes, at least, the argumentation of ""A bunch of guys claiming to be trained IT technicians on the internet said we should put this near the computers!"" isn't that good of an argument.

In advance, thanks for the help guys! Both from me (An Intern, honoured for being chosen to do this), and my boss (who sadly isn't here right now since he's off trying to make ticket sales behave)."
2ifrk3,7,2014-10-06,Weird situation i'm in. Please help.,asamer538,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ifrk3/weird_situation_im_in_please_help/,"I'm in a very consuing situation at the moment and appreciate any advice anyone can give.

Background:

I'm 24 years old. I have a good job as an Environmental Consultant and I'm considered to be by many a 'very mature' guy (you will see why it's relevant later). I have been in relationships before (some were serious and some were not) and i have now been single for the past two years.

The girl, let's call her Carol (20/f), is someone that was a friend of a friend for a while. We hung out in lare groups a couple of times and I found her to be quite the beauty. I also foundout that she's taken and that her bf lives in another country but travels to come see her every once in a while.

This summer, Carol and I started talking a lot over facebook. It started out as her asking me questions since she was doing an internship at another enviornmental consultancy. We got to know each other a lot and all of a sudden started seeing each other almost daily! It started out as meeting up in starbucks after work and a week later we were going out for dinner every other night. The conversation never stopped. After dinner, we would go back and continue texting. During weekends we would see each other and keep texting till the sun is out! 

I fell in love with her...and my feelings for her kept growing more and more each day. I did not tell her since she has a boyfriend but it was quite obvious that i was interested.

She has been dating her boyfriend for 4 years! Yes, ever since she was 16. They met during a summer vacation and have been in a long distance relationship since. He does the effort to come see her and so does she. My friends and I met him and their personalities are worlds apart. She wants to be a chemical engineer and is so ambitious. She dreams of travelling the world and working in exotic locations. he loves his village, still trying to finish undergrad, plans to work with his dad because finding a job is 'too difficult'. he still lives off his parents money.

Fastforward, her internship is over and she is now continuing her degree. Me and her still talk daily with a lot of flirting going on. Until one day, i told her how i felt and that i'm going to block her because i can't keep talking to her this way and being around her makes it hard for me to get over her. her reply was as follows:

""you have no idea how much i care about you. Im not trying to tease you or have any hidden messaes behind my words. But I really love you. Very Obviously so too. And its sincere from the bottom of my heart"".

After that day our flirting increased and at times became a bit sexaul (not too much but the right amount of teasing). Until, she woke up one day and said she feels horrible bcz this is cheating and that she should confess to her bf and pray that he forgives her. Her bf, like any normal guy, said he will forgive her if she blocks me from her life. She refused to do so. Her bf said he still loves her but wont talk to her until she blocks me out. I told her im ready to be with her but she said that when he left her and stopped talking to her she realized how much she loves him. And that she loves both of us -_- but the two of them share history since he was her first everything. 

My questions (at last) are as follows: 
1.
What should I do in such a situation? I thought of blocking her msyelf and making the decision easy for her, but i'm so attached to her. 

2.
How can I allow her to see what both me and her friends see about her bf. That she is simply too good for him. That she deserves better. 


Any advice whatsoever will be appricated 

THANK YOU for taking the time to read this long post. 


EDIT 1: 

Today me and her actaully did a bit of sexting. It has actually went this far! She woke up an hour after feeling guilty and said the following:

""I love my bf. I want it to work with him with all my heart. And i wasn't physically attracted to you for a good year after knowing you until I thought of you as perfect man. You are sexy, intelligent and handsome. I feel the fire when our eyes lock and thinking of you in that way drives my body crazy to the point where I just want to sleep with you and i cannot get my mind off of it. But I want it to stop. I know I keep falling into the same cycle but my bf doesn't deserve this. I can't go on. And I do love him, I swear I do and I dont think I love you YET.I just have a burning desire towards you and im only throwing gas on the flame. ""

I can't focus on work anymore. I need help. This has messed up my mind and mood so much.

2ig14v,1,2014-10-06,Which of these three careers should I pick? MBA Dilemma of Choice,Brotrocious,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ig14v/which_of_these_three_careers_should_i_pick_mba/,"I just started my MBA degree at a top 10 program, and I'm having trouble deciding what I want to pursue now that i'm here. I'm hoping that writing this out, and the advice that I get might help me make up my mind.

My background is in engineering, specifically in energy. Both a large traditional oil and gas firm, and a cleantech startup. I studied aerospace engineering at a tier 2 undergrad school.

I'm paying the full cost of tuition and living expenses through loans, so it's going to be an expensive process for the next two years. The only reason I bring this up is that it definitely colors my options with regards to what I should pursue afterwards.

I guess i'll start by listing out the areas that I find appealing, and what I see as the positives and negatives around each one.

**Finance: Investment Banking**

 Pros: Extremely highly paid, very strong placement from my school, linear recruiting process, prestigious/good exit options to other industries/areas of the the financial world, almost impossible to get a job (at my career stage) in this industry except as a first year MBA intern

Cons: Extremely long work hours (100+ hours a week) and the downsides of no getting much sleep and working every weekend, I don't think I would find the work very interesting


**Management Consulting**

Pros: Well paid, good career exit options, linear recruiting process, decent placement from my school into top firms


Cons: Long work hours (but not as bad as investment banking), travel, excessive powerpoint presentations

**High Tech Firms**

Pros: Typically great working environment, aligns with my personal interests, better work life balance

Cons: Lower compensation, only a few large firms recruit at my school, recruiting is later in the year so harder to have a backup plan, likely have to move to west coast

I guess i'm currently leaning towards tech, since I value having a decent life outside of work, and the companies interest me more. I feel like i'm being foolish to not take advantage of the strength my school has in finance though. On the other hand, I don't think i could deal with the no sleep/lifestyle of investment banking.

Any thoughts of guidance would really be appreciated. I know I'm spoiled with options, but for someone who likes to take time to evaluate things before making a decision, writing off whole areas is really hard."

I'm a part-time intern and this has to be done in two weeks so I really don't have the time to complete this manually so I'd love it if this could be automated by a python script.  I have a file full of the drawings in question and I also have a .csv file (although I can save it as a .xlsx if it matters) which has the drawing name in one coloum and the location of the file in another.  How would I automate this?  My pseudocode for this is as follows (although it'll look more like C than python as I'm more familiar with it--haven't coded in a while though so it'll look pretty bad).  Any and all help is appreciated, thanks!

    \\This is assuming column A contains the filename and
    \\column B contains the file path

    path=B2;

    For(name=A2; name++; name&lt;=A(final)){

        file(path);
        file.title=name;
        path++;

    }

So this is generally how I think it'll work.  Anyone who can translate this to python for me would be greatly appreciated and save me a ton of time!  Thank you so much for your time and help!  In the meantime I'm going to google what I can about this and try to throw something together.

Edit: Along with specifying what cell the new name is in would I need so specify the file type as well?  Like saying ""file.title=name+filetype(path);"" or something?  Thanks!"

Here is my answer:

After I earned my bachelors in Business Administration, interned for Company X as an Analyst, where I provided analysis support for the sales team by reviewing annual reports and business models  to identify strong investment opportunities f. Once my internship ended, I used my analytical skills to take on a project with Company Z - where I was responsible for our increase in revenue savings by $100K by implementing XYZ program on time. One of my best strengths is my ability to solve problems, I take a problem and work through a solution using a combination of communication with teams and using analytical tools like Excels and Oracle. Since my project is winding down, I seeking for a similar role, where I can join a strong team and make a positive impact on team dynamic, so I am really excited about this opportunity. 

What do you guys think about my answer?
How can I improve this?

To me it sounds like a robot. 

Please help. Thank you!

EDIT: 
I rewrite my answer.

I just finished a project with X Company, where I was responsible for our increase revenue savings in our supply chain. I love working in a fast-past environment, where I have the opportunity work in teams to accomplish a common goal. Being a Administrator seemed like a great way to bridge my interests with a career, so I very excited for this opportunity. 


How does that sound?"

Not nearly recognized as the University of Texas, so finding an internship this past summer was difficult.

Here's a quick summary of what I have been doing: Interned at a semiconductor this past summer where I was the only student from my school here surrounded by Electrical Engineers from Universities throughout the States. I applied for my position even though it was for EE students, but they liked my drive and passion and hired me. Now my position was not strictly for EE's meaning it was something all computer science students could do considering it was very software related. They kept me here to work part time during the Fall during my senior year of College.

My questions are that after my project is done here at this semiconductor for my Co-Op, there won't be much for me to do considering it is a company filled with Electrical Engineers with those requirements. How should I go about starting to look for positions in Texas and California starting today considering I am a Senior.

My University is not as recognized as most major ones, so should I really press the fact that this semiconductor hired me even though I didn't ""technically"" have the requirements, but that they did see my passion and strengths and hired me based off that?

Also, I know I should really start polishing up my LinkedIn, but anywhere else I can start to look and apply? My University doesn't have the most adequate career services but I will go there to see what my opportunities are. "

I have solid work experience on top of my two previous internships, which means I'll hit the ground running. I have been working in the field for a few years, so you'll get a great bang for your buck.

As for paperwork, it's fairly easy (for you, at least). You need to let my school validate your existence and fill your part of the paperwork for the work visa. I will be the one handling most of it.

I've recently begun looking into web development as a career instead. I have basic programming experience in python and worked on computer vision research in C++ for a few months. Some of my questions are:

1. How much is not having a degree in computer science going to affect my employment prospects? I've taken loads of math courses and have a minor in math. Would these things help in any way?

2. What road map do you suggest for someone just starting out with the limited experience that I have, in terms of learning the language frameworks and technologies? I'm going through the Ruby tutorial by Zed Shaw (http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/) right now and it seems to be going pretty smoothly. I've also dabbled in some HTML / CSS before, so I assume it won't take long before I'm caught up to speed? What about Javascript? 

3. How do I figure out if I want to do back-end work vs. front-end work? Would I even need to know HTML/CSS/JS if I'm looking into doing more back-end type stuff? Is the market better for front-end or back-end, or does it depend on location? I live in NYC if it makes any difference.

4. How long do you think it'd take to make myself employable if I coded for 3 hours a day?

I do departmental IT support which involves a lot of work with MS DeployStudio, MDT, Active Directory, Excel, Photoshop, Illustrator, and diagnosing a multitude of issues with both OS X and Windows. Previously I also did computer repair for the university doing repairs mostly on Mac's and Dell's both desktop and notebook ranging from RAM upgrades to Motherboard replacements, to data recovery. All of my other experience is some customer service positions in the food industry like cook and cashier at a fast food chain and a busser at another restaurant. Does anyone have any insight as to the best way build my resume to gear it towards a software engineering internship? I have a good resume now but for a more general position that isn't specific to my future career. 

TL;DR: Applying for a software engineering internship at Google and one or two other companies, how do professional software developers build their resume's. Answer's that are specific to my skills would be super helpful."

Looking for advice",thatdudekak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2iisn0/senior_unsure_if_internship_will_lead_to_job/,"Hey I am currently a CS student at a small private University in Austin, Texas. Not nearly recognized as the University of Texas, so finding an internship this past summer was difficult.
Here's a quick summary of what I have been doing: Interned at a semiconductor this past summer where I was the only student from my school here surrounded by Electrical Engineers from Universities throughout the States. I applied for my position even though it was for EE students, but they liked my drive and passion and hired me. Now my position was not strictly for EE's meaning it was something all computer science students could do considering it was very software related. They kept me here to work part time during the Fall during my senior year of College.
My questions are that after my project is done here at this semiconductor for my Co-Op, there won't be much for me to do considering it is a company filled with Electrical Engineers with those requirements. How should I go about starting to look for positions in Texas and California starting today considering I am a Senior.
My University is not as recognized as most major ones, so should I really press the fact that this semiconductor hired me even though I didn't ""technically"" have the requirements, but that they did see my passion and strengths and hired me based off that?
Also, I know I should really start polishing up my LinkedIn, but anywhere else I can start to look and apply? My University doesn't have the most adequate career services but I will go there to see what my opportunities are."

First, let me give you a little bit of info about myself. I am a 22 (23 in Jan.) male living in the US. I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at a state school. I graduate in May 2015. My expected GPA will be well north of a 3.0. Currently, I work as a Technical Writer/Drafter intern for a large company based here in the US. I also have experience in the automotive industry (1.5 years). I was born in Colombia; however, I do have dual citizenship (US and Colombia). I also speak Spanish fluently. 

I have always wanted to move far away and experience this amazing rock we all share. The thought of uprooting my life and moving far away excites me. I'm sure it's something we can all relate to. Anyway, since I'm about to graduate next year, how soon should I start applying for jobs overseas? I'm guessing the sooner the better... 

Just how 'desirable' will I be overseas? I know I have a STEM degree on my side, but even in the states, entry level engineering jobs can be tough to find. My current employer does have positions worldwide; however, the industry my company is in doesn't interest me at all. 

What countries would give me my best chance of getting out of the US? I know the UK, Australia, and Germany all have flourishing STEM industries. Feel free to inform me of others. Will the lack of language be a hindrance on my chances in non-English speaking countries? I can always learn!

Continuing my education is something I have always wanted to pursue. How feasible would it be for me to get a job overseas and continue my education? Would it be more ideal to apply for a student visa than getting sponsored by a company? Also, how could I pay for school overseas? I'm sure I could get some scholarships, but from what I have read, I would not receive enough to cover full tuition and cost of living. Once again, I should probably be applying for programs now... right?

Regarding my dual citizenship, would this affect my chances of moving overseas? I definitely do not want to move to Colombia.  

I know you all see these questions over and over and over again, and I just want to say thanks in advance for being patient with me and helping me out! If there's anything I left out, let me know!"

2ik9c4,5,2014-10-07,Strattera withdrawal?,SchoolIInMyFuture,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2ik9c4/strattera_withdrawal/,"For the past few nights, I have been having issues with sleep - strange ones.  After a trial run on Strattera and experiencing no real positive effect, my doctor told me to discontinue taking it and ever since, I have been having weird experiences.

I hop into bed around 11:45 as normal, feeling tired and ready to go to bed, but I can't fall asleep.  I keep tossing and turning and unable to find a comfortable position.  I start to feel sleepy, then something wakes me up.  Fast forward another 20 minutes, and I start to fall asleep again, only this time I *need* to wake myself up.

It couldn't have been more than a few minutes after I actually fell asleep - passing that intern stage where you're partially sleeping but not quite there yet.  My dream instantly goes to me fearing there is a spider in my bed.  I murmur ""no"" (which I do believe I actually spoke, not just in my dream) and feel my entire body constricted and compressed.  And while in a dream state, I consciously tell myself ""wake up"" and I do.  I took a second to make sure I wasn't still dreaming...I took an ice cube out of the cup of water next to my bed and rubbed it on my face, got up, assessed whether I was vividly dreaming or conscious or not (I was) and got up to go to the bathroom.  But even awake, the sensation in my dream was present with me - the last time I felt such a sensation was when I was taking Oxycodin after my wisdom teeth were taken out - it was powerful and felt from head to toe.  It was actually quite good feeling, if not a bit alarming because of this has never happened to me before.  

After getting back into bed, I continue to toss and turn until finally, perhaps 30 minutes later, I fall asleep.  An hour later I wake up - my entire body feeling stiff, very stiff.  You know when you feel like stretching out every part of your body?  It felt like that, but stretching out did no good.  I fall asleep once again having bizarre dreams culminating with a rapid switch to a nightmare - A storm was approaching my house, with only myself another unidentified person in it.  All of a sudden I hear sirens, loud ones.  I say, ""oh no"" and run to the door leading to the garage and look through the peephole only to see firetrucks rushing into my garage.  My hearts starts pounding and once again I mutter out ""no"" (which I believe I *actually* did - I could ""feel"" my body working to make the sound, if that makes any sense) and told myself to wake up, which I did.  Again, I check to make sure I am conscious and not dreaming, gather my thoughts, and attempt to go back to bed once again.  

This is the third or fourth time this same strange series of events takes place when I go to sleep.  The first time, I had a dream about punching someone, then being covered by dozens of hands, squeezing my body.  The second and third time I cannot remember what happened, but the same overwhelming physical sensation of constriction was present - something I have never felt before in my life.  The remedy was always the same - when I felt it I ""woke up"" in my dream and quickly exited it, back into a fully conscious and wakeful state.

I should mention that there was a lapse in my Strattera prescription that caused me to go without for three days with no such effect, but this has happened as soon as I stopped taking it for good.  Coincidence, perhaps, but something tells me it is due to the medication.  It also means I am flat out exhausted today and I am sure you all know just how much worse exhaustion makes your ADHD.

Thoughts?  Comments?  Did someone drop me some acid and I just don't know it?  "

2iktb7,3,2014-10-07,"How should I approach discussing my most recent job on my resume? It was my first salaried position after college, and lasted as long as my other jobs combined!",fryzoid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2iktb7/how_should_i_approach_discussing_my_most_recent/,"Hi /jobs/, I'd really appreciate it if someone can critique/discuss this new section of my resume; it has been driving me nuts! Originally, I posted in the Resumes subreddit a few times about this, but unfortunately I didn't get any responses. Since I don't live near where I went to school anymore, I don't have easy access to any critiques, but I'm really only worried about how to approach this most recent job description.

Not only did this job provide much more experience in many different areas when combined with my previous experience, it's also my only salaried position, and it lasted a lot longer than the previous jobs I have listed on my resume (first being internship and the second being a temp job at a large corp. I had right after I graduated in 2010). 

My title was ""Inventory Controller,"" but I also performed many accounting and IT and systems-related functions as well (we had no outside IT). In my last year there, we also had no Controller (the last CFO had quit, and he was my boss) and I was the one who ended up taking a lot of his responsibilities. I think this is a good thing, and provided me with more experience/knowledge than I would have had otherwise. 

**Length:** While I am set on keeping my resume to one side of one page long, is it okay that I have used 5 bullet points on this job, while the two jobs before it only have 5 bullets between the two of them?

**Content:** This is what I have so far on my revised resume. In the beginning, I literally had 15 things that I edited away and narrowed down to these five points: If any seem unnecessary or redundant, I would like to consolidate them to maybe make room for something else or nothing at all. If they are poorly worded, I would like to revise them. Also, I have read that focusing on achievements is important. If it is important, I am curious if I accomplished this with what I wrote.

Anyway, here are the five points I have narrowed it down to:

* Designed and implemented new accounting system procedures and controls for inventory costing and valuation. Improved cost test results from 90% accuracy to 99.9% accuracy over one year period.

* Coordinated physical counts at global warehouses, managed relations with 3rd party logistics companies, and secured financing for purchase orders and finished goods inventories.

* Forecasted daily operating cash flows and performed daily bank reconciliations; reported to company CEO.

* Performed month-end and year-end closing journal entries and account reconciliations.

* Built custom scripts and reports to improve company reporting accuracies and efficiencies.

I appreciate any and all feedback! Thanks :)"

I'm actually not sure if this is a general ADHD thing or if it's just me, but sometimes I just seem to get into a slump where it seems like I just can't or won't do anything. 

Most of the time I get in these slumps when I'm just generally unhappy or overwhelmed, then it's like my mind just shuts off and I can't do anything. Even if I really want to, I just can't get it together. 

But this time, there's nothing that I can think of that set it off. I've been doing really well this year. I'm on a bunch of committees, I work hard for my internship and I like my classes… but these past few days I've just blown everything off for no apparent reason. I'm medicated (lower dose than I used to be, but it's been working so far), I just can't seem to function for some reason.

Like right now, I'm supposed to be in class. I blew off both of my classes today. I'm not sure why, I just feel defeated.

So, does this kind of thing happen to anyone else? And what have you done to snap out of it?"

I'm 25 turning 26 and am getting so frustrated and discouraged at the lack of finding anything.

As I said I'm almost 26, I just graduated with a degree in business last year. I have a steady work history, where I have management type experience and even some HR experience from my first job where I was for 3 years, basically my high school job so I put it last on my resume. I do think I have a decent looking resume now and have gotten a few nibbles, but nothing materializes.

For example a job I really want right now is at a place called Global Advanced Metals and is literally down the street from me, it's for a Contract HR Assistant, that even says HR experience isn't even necessary. I found the posting 8 days after it was posted. I went into the place (in a suit, shaved, the whole 9) after applying online and dropped off my resume on nice card stock with references and then called the next Monday (yesterday) and still haven't received any acknowledgement. I mean with the steady work history (all from places near me) plus a degree and some peripheral exp, and applying not early but not super late by any means I would think; it all just baffles me.

I start thinking, is it because I'm a guy? I look too young? my mind starts going all the depressing places. Am I too old maybe?
I've worked throughout from 16 years old till now and took awhile to figure out what I wanted to do. I finally got my degree after on and off schooling for 6 years basically. I talked to my aunt who worked in HR, she's retired now and lives far away and she basically said she's sorry she can't help me connections wise because she knows I'm a good worker, but she kind of burned a few bridges where she worked when the company wouldn't pay for her cancer treatments (another story).
I also hate it because tons of positions I look at say ""Entry-Level"" than specify 2 to as much as 5 years required exp. I start thinking how could going to college have been such a mistake.

My ultimate goal is HRIS and I understand there not being to much entry for that from what I read about the position, but the things I read about getting into it, Generalist/HR Assistant/Payroll, especially payroll all say you need experience, how does anyone get exp for a position where all the supposed entry levels all require exp.

I apologize for sounding angry, but I guess I kind of am, I've been looking really hard for more than a year, the last 3-6 months like a mad man and still nothing. I've applied for internships, but of course they all require you be in school. I have loans I have to pay and can't go back to school again, not now anyway. My only saving grace is a really part time job I have right now and I live with my parents. If I didn't have those things I swear I'd be lying in a ditch somewhere.

&gt;$VB: Alright, got it?  Good.  Stay right here, I'll be right back I'm going to grab you some spare parts.

As the $VB is walking away to some supply closet somewhere $UncleBoss walks by, sees me, and sticks his head in the door.

&gt;$UB: Wait.. he's sending you ***where***?  Hang on, go into my office, close the door and sit down, I'll be right there.

I nod, head into $UncleBoss's office and sit down, admiring his work battlestation.  3 big Mac Monitors and a laptop dock with a brand new MBP sitting in it next to the iPad lying on his desk.  I forgot how big of an Apple fan $UncleBoss was.

I recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I have been job hunting, and would like to be involved in Embedded Systems/Firmware Engineering in my career.

I would prefer to start off as an intern, as this would give the company (as well as myself) the opportunity to evaluate if this is a good fit. 

I have completed an internship at NASA AMES Research Center, and a few start-up companies. At my recent internship I created a self-test routine in Python that would at input/output commands to a console. This was exciting because it would test certain features on a circuit board such as; Fan Duty Cycle, and read different temperature modules (system, and ambient). This succeeded and aided in the testing process for our Thermoelectric Cooling Circuit Board. I was able to navigate and learn WingIDE, allowing me to improve on my software skills. I recently helped create a Charlieplexing LED with comparators, quad buffer tri-state, XOR Gate, voltage translator, and charge pump. This allowed our group to light up an array of LEDs that are independent of each other. This experience was awesome, and it gave me a better understanding of circuit design. 

I enjoy a mixture of hardware and software - primarily because it's fun and challenging! Feel free to message me any questions! Thank you."

A little bit of information about myself. I am a 21 male living in the United States. I'm studying Business Administration with an emphasis in Global Business. I graduate this December 2014. My expected GPA will be above a 3.5. I am currently working as a Marketing Intern at my University. I speak Spanish and Portuguese. I plan to go to grad school (International Affairs/Relations) however not until Fall 2016 so I will have over year in between now and then.

Between this time I would love to have international experience and work abroad. My question would be where and what position are they hiring foreigners the most. I have student loans to pay in the meantime so I would like to find a paid position. I have been looking at teaching English abroad but many programs require TEFL certifications and the programs that do not require this the deadlines to apply have passed. Should I contact a recruiting agencies abroad? Can anyone guide me in my job search? Areas of Interest: Middle East and Europe or ANYWHERE!"

I was hoping to gather some opinions on the job-outlook benefit of doing an internship.

I'm currently an M.S student in Bioinformatics (just started this Fall).  The program itself is ~2 years and includes coursework and a thesis with the option to do an internship/coop over the summer.  I'm only planning on an M.S then going to find a job.

My options basically are: 
A. Do an internship/coop over this summer, and get some great experience but delay my predicted thesis completion date.  
B. Start my thesis over the summer and presumably finish earlier and (hopefully) find employment sooner - meaning more money.

It really comes down to the value of doing an internship.  How much will doing an internship/coop actually help on the job search.

I'd love to hear all of your opinions and stories as I certainly am not sure how to value the potential work experience.  

Thanks everyone!

I know Java and I'm taking an advanced course in it this year, and I just recently finished the Python code on code academy. However those are the only two I know, and I have no portfolio of accomplishments because I've never actually done any noteworthy projects to add to it. 

I'm trying to build up the amount of knowledge I have by adding more languages. Besides the obvious of C and its derivatives, what else should I know? I've taken a close in visual basic and aced it but that's not enough to do more than basics, Not even I/O.

I would attempt android development after my advanced java, but I do not have an idea what I should make and my motivation wanes unless I'm working on it with or for someone else. Why go balls out for an application someone won't even use? 

So, what languages should I know, what kind of things could I add to my portfolio, and finally, how do I prepare for that internship? What kind of questions would they even ask me?"

It seems like anytime someone says something about being unsure of going in to engineering the first response or there are many responses saying “Don’t do it for the money”. I know this is a sub for engineering students, but I’m curious; how much money do you guys think engineers make? Most of my friends that graduated with a BSEE and took jobs out of undergrad made about 60. I’m finishing my MS in computer engineering and a standard offer is about 83 for semiconductor industry. A few companies do it differently but for the most part you end up right in that range for starting out with a masters. I have a standing offer from a fortune top 50 company in semiconductor and it’s the highest anyone of my classmates has gotten so far at 90.

So, maybe I have a skewed sense of what “big money” is but engineering isn’t really about the money at all. If you want big money you’re better off trying to work in the business side of these engineering companies. Seemingly the technical side of a business never makes as much as the business side. That being said, is that big money or do you guys potentially know something I don’t so far as salary goes. Engineering will give you a comfortable life but it’s not likely going to make you a millionaire in industry (start ups and individually owned companies aside). Sure, there are great internships out there like intel that pays interns in the order of about 70k. That’s not a long term position that you can stick to though.

The pay and outlook may be better than some other career fields but it’s hardly the easiest thing to get a degree in compared to the prospect of how much money you’ll be making. There are plenty of fields that offer jobs competitive with an engineers salary and the degree might not be nearly as technically challenging.

I am currently a senior at my University where I am obviously in upper division courses for computer science. I also intern right now at a semiconductor where I am developing a testing lab for development boards.

My problem is that I feel like I am not learning the right way. I am okay with new languages, and developing an understanding for data structures and how they work and everything like that, but when it comes to implementation I always feel lost. Like right now I am trying to right python scripts to automate tests for my internship and trying to learn new python modules on the fly, and I feel like I am not understanding it at all. Or I read it and understand but forget it the next day. 

I just feel like at this point in my Computer Science career I should be able to learn new technologies quickly and implement them as well as understand how different programs work just based on reading the code. Is this accurate? Also, how can I go about training myself to soak this new stuff in and actually keep it?"

I realise how ambiguous it looks! I'm a maths student looking for a career in computer science, I will NOT have a degree in CS.**

Hi, I'm a second-year maths student who has recently discovered an interest in computer science and I've decided I probably want a career where I can work with computers but from quite a mathematical angle. 

The areas of maths I'm most interested in are linear algebra, probability and combinatorics -- all of which I believe have strong applications in CS. I also really enjoy scientific programming with python, but I have little experience using the language for anything else.

1. If I'm being honest, I'm not really sure what that career is (maybe data science or something). I'd be very grateful if you could suggest careers in computer science with a strong mathematical component. 
1. What's more, I would appreciate guidance on what areas of computer science I need to brush up on in order to be well qualified for such a career (right now I'm trying to teach myself basic data structures and algorithms).
1. And one last thing: I realise internships are very important in computer science. Given my current situation, would I be able to secure a computer science internship for next summer? Or would I have to work on my programming and deepen my knowledge of computer science before any company would take me seriously? (and miss out on an internship before I graduate?)
 
Thanks so much! I'd really appreciate any help, the world of computer science can be so impenetrable when you're looking at it from the outside.

(And just in case you think I'm being lazy, I think I've read every post here containing the words ""math major"" without finding my answer)"
2iprp9,3,2014-10-08,Recent grad – Are most CS jobs like this?,MB_Zeppin,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2iprp9/recent_grad_are_most_cs_jobs_like_this/,"I recently graduated from college last May with dual degrees in History and Computer Science and was hired by a large pharmaceutical firm, ostensibly as a software developer. I started working back in mid-July and haven't been terribly thrilled with the experience. I miss the sense of community, cooperation, and curiosity that came of constantly working in a CS lab pursuing common interests but I'm also routinely disinterested with my work and have trouble maintaining the discipline to complete my responsibilities. Thus far, very little of my time has been spent working with computer science related concepts and I have written perhaps a dozen lines of code.

Instead I largely use software that requires a CS background to understand and operate but which is not itself terribly interesting. For instance, we're doing some data processing work that's being done in Hadoop. In order to use Hadoop I have to be familiar with Python, Java, MapReduce, some SQL, etc. but the actual work that I do is attempting to get a scripting language to work, getting Hadoop to recognize all of our remote drives, pasting some code from an outside contractor in, and that sort of thing. All fairly menial tasks that simply require a large amount of background knowledge and persistence to do. When I go into work tomorrow I'll be loading some XML data into a Fedora repository for use as a back-end. After that I might help some interns wireframe a UI for a web front end. Based on conversations with my manager, this is what I can expect in future.

Speaking to my friends who have recently graduated and been hired by financial firms and similar, this seems to be a common experience for them as well, although one of them has done a little bit of development in COBOL.

I originally went to school to become a history teacher but after taking an introductory computer science course I enjoyed the discipline so much that I dropped my education major to pursue it. I remained strongly passionate about computer science throughout the 4 years, took extra classes, did research projects over the summer, and developed some software for local non-profits. After only a few months of working in the field my interest in remaining within the field is waning.

Is the experience of myself and my peers representative of typical positions within the Computer Science industry? If so, how do you guys keep yourselves productive, motivated, and interested?"
2ipvmh,3,2014-10-08,Benefits of Doing Your Internship Overseas,advercomm,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/2ipvmh/benefits_of_doing_your_internship_overseas/,"An internship is important for every student to help them prepare for the real world of finding a job. This is the primary reason why schools encourage this type of program so that students will be well oriented on the realities of life and what they should expect.

Of course, the most common type of internship is usually done locally. But for some, getting an internship abroad is a whole new different experience. Other than that, it will help them be exposed to different cultures that will surely open their eyes on how business works on the other side of the world. In addition, getting an international internship can provide you with much credibility when you finally apply for a job in your country. 

So if you are not yet convinced on how beneficial an [international internship](http://www.crosscontinental.org/intern-abroad/) is then here are a few pointers that you should know about:

1. Make friends – A network of friends on foreign land is something that you might want to consider for both your personal and professional relationship. This means that whenever you find internship abroad and get to make friends then surely you won’t have a hard time in getting a real job there someday plus you will have some company when you get there.

2. Boost your resume – Having an abroad internship experience is something that will lighten up your resume. If you apply for job locally then chances are you will be hired since a foreign company was able to train you. 

3. Global experience – Learning about the work culture of your country is great but experiencing an international work culture is something else and will put you on a flexible state. You can also land a job much faster in your home country since you were accredited by a foreign company.

This semester, I'm taking two additional, required undergrad courses. Completion of the degree will take me about 3 years.

Right now, I'm pretty certain that I won't finish --  I'm leaning heavily on dropping out at the end of the year, getting a job and going from there.  I'm wondering: what should I expect in terms of job prospects? If it helps, I will have taken the following courses:

Computer Programming I &amp; II; Multi-User Operating Systems; Computer Architecture; Data Structures; Discrete Structures; Object-Oriented Software Design

I hope to get in/take two courses from the following next semester:

Mobil App Development; Web App Architecture &amp; Development; Media Processing and Computing  

Right now, next semester, I'm scheduled to take a grad course in natural language processing and a math-heavy foundation course for data mining.  I'm more interested in pursuing the courses already mentioned, however. 

For what it's worth, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA in every CS and math course taken (I've effectively completed a math minor), although I have no internship experience.

At the end of the day, I'm unsure of what I want, career-wise. On this topic, I've been waging internal battles for a few years now. Right now, I think it's best to get out there, acquire real world experience.

So I'm a third year CS student... My resume is not exactly typical though. I've been involved in a lot of social justice/mental health initiatives, I have never done an internship, and I have two years of research in a cognitive neuroscience lab... I also have three publications in cognitive science and about the same number of guest lectures/conference presentations ranging from guest lecturing in sexual diversity studies classrooms to doing workshops/presentations at mental health national conferences...

And also general advice about entering the computer-science industry?,mikogk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2iqsvf/anyone_know_much_about_neurosciencerelated/,"Let me start by saying that I really enjoy computer-science and learning how computers work from the ground up. I've recently built my first desktop PC, I enjoy tinkering with Linux and Android a lot and i just love the idea of technology making everyday people's lives easier or better.

A little background -- I'm currently a fourth-year Neuroscience Major at a university in Los Angeles. I took a year-off after high school to live in South America, came here as a Biochem Major, and late last year decided that i wanted to work with computers. I'll be taking a 5th year towards graduation for two main reasons. 

1) I lack software engineering experience and I want to use my time as a student to be kind of ""forgiven"" for my lack of experience in applying for internships as a student, and have extra time to network and hone my technical skills and knowledge.

2) My Neuroscience degree requires a year of related research at the university and I don't think I'd want to rush that.

I chose to graduate as a Neuroscience major partly because it was too late to change my major to computer science and because it seemed to have the most interesting prospective technical applications of the biology related degrees I could have chosen from.

I recently went to a workshop for how to complete this research requirement and the idea popped into my head that they MUST use computers. My question is, where can I be useful? Brain-imaging, brain scans and just data analysis all use computer-programs, and there is tons of data collected and stored in databases--another widespread application that needs lots of management.

Another question is, what would be a worthwhile direction to go in if I eventually want to work in a tech company? Brain science isn't the first thing I'd think to write a program for, and I wasn't able to take a databases class (the only CS classes I had space for were Data Structures and Algorithms... which are both quite important). What is the best way to approach this?

Sorry for any redundant questions, and if my question seems vague or if it seems like I just need to do my own footwork. I've been trying to think about ways to use my time here in a way to gear me to more technical work, and I'm so excited by the epiphany I've had that it really is possible to make use of my remaining time, and that all my time wasn't a waste. If any clarification is needed or you have any general advice beyond that, I would love to hear what you have to say."

I'm a CS student from Belgium graduating in June. Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out what I want to do afterwards.
I don't really have to feeling that I already want to start working fulltime. As I always wanted to see the world, I guess that it will be the right time to do this after my graduation.
If possible, I would like to combine this with doing a paid internship abroad, so I would get some more work experience from it and earn money I could use while travelling. I'm currently on an Erasmus exchange in Norway, and it turns out internships here are very well paid.
Other options would be doing some extra studying (business?, management?), or finding a fulltime job with remote possibilities.

Its metal and plastic with other comfort pieces. 

Second, everywhere we go in the building requires us to scan our badge to get in and out. 

Anyways I was asked to deliver a package to our loading deck. Ok no problem, I am a young intern. I go to the elevator lobby hit parking level one and on my way out of the lobby I come to a hallway with scanners at both entrance. Well FML I realized I didn't have my badge. So I'm waiting a minute or two when someone comes in, for a second I think hey I should just follow into the elevator lobby that way I can get to my floor and get my badge; but my lazy self was like fuck that this package is heavy just leave it down there. 

So I reach the FedEx/UPS area at our guards desk and realize that I can't get back in, else I be trapped in that hallway, so my dumbass just says hey I am going to go in through the visitor's center.

Well I get to the visitor's center and of course I forgot that they have metal detectors -_-

So I take off my belt and shoes and I'm like fuck it, maybe it will work. Nope.

So I'm like holy shit I can't take this shit off here, so I wakwardly am like heyyy I'll brb and grab my stuff and go outside. 

That when the game plan is hatched. 

So I realize I have to take it off and stash it somewhere and then come back. But where will it not be noticed? hmm.... Already kicking myself because, cautious guy like me always tells himself to have hiding place ready, in case, you know?
Well first thing first I have to take it off and I can't whip my dick out in public so i go to the closest public restroom. In a rush I take it off quickly in a stall and walk out without washing my hands - attracting attention. So I start waking to the other side of the building where I know there is grass. I go up to the second level and start looking around.

Damn nice grass and tables, no where to stash......
and then I see mulch. Thank GOD! for mulch. So I'm walking along these big planters and I find my spot. A little deeper hole with water. So I sit down and wait for the walking traffic to dissipate and stick it in. Well of course it's fucking mud so I just cram some other mulch on top. Literally putting a $200 piece of equipment in the ground. I'm wearing nice clothes too so I'm looking pretty shady if anyone notices this guy has mud all over his hands. So I had back to the restroom and wash them. good to go. 

Walking back to my office building I'm brainstorming ideas. And I decide that I was going to say that I was going to use this as an excuse to go to McDonalds (next to the bathroom) but didn't have my wallet, hence no Mcdonalds. Butt fuck that right, security guards are probably thinking well wtf made the metal detector go off before you left all wierdly. AND let me tell THANK GOD I AM A CHRISTIAN cause I am wearing my metal cross with metal. So I go in and make a show of taking off my cross, to prevent those questions, and get through. Co-worker brings my badge down and I am now back in the building. 

Now I don't want to leave immediatley cause I'm guessing I already garnered unwanted attention so I've rationalized that I'll go down close to McDonalds lunch time since I already had breakfast and don't want to buy more just for show.  

Current considerations: 
Should I bring the small pencil pouch, I use for transorting it, to bring it in because it's dirty? It would look suspicious carrying only a pencil case, especially because I am a 23 year old guy.
If I put it in my pocket it will get my trouser all dirty and i can;t clean it there because I am in public. I guess I might just have to bring the pencil case, to take it to the restroom, to clean it and then put it in my pocket so it's not noticeable. 
Should I say fuck it and go grab it now, else I lose an expensive piece of equipment?
Will my boss and co-workers notice when I'm gone for 20 mintues; they didn't the first time I was not there.


Updates coming


TL;DR I forgot my badge inside a secured building and set off metal detector trying to get in through the vistiors center. Awkwardly left and hatched a quick/successful plan to get  back in and then recollect my extender later. haven't yet though.......

Intel i7 with 32GB ram, SSD, plus a second, 2 TB drive for storage, I don't remember the exact model of video card, but it cost $299 in addition to the computer, and was hooked up to dual 21"" monitors. He basically runs Office and a couple legal programs.  We would not normally recommend this powerful of a rig for office work, but he picked it out of a Dell catalog, and wanted it.  Hey, it's his money.   A week after install, customer calls and complains that it is slow.  He said it was fine for a couple hours after I left, but then it was slow.

&gt;Me : I am sorry to hear that.  I'll come over and take a look at it.

&gt;Rich Lawyer :  I want this fixed.  I don't have time to wait on my computer.

&gt;Me : Let's see what's going on.

&gt;RL : I open Outlook, and get the ""Blue Ring of Waiting.""  It sucks.  Fix it.

Sure enough, it takes about 5 minutes to open MS Outlook.  Then I see it.  His inbox has over 15,000 messages. All in the main folder of the Inbox. They date back about 6 years.

&gt;Me : We need to move some of these emails to subfolders.

&gt;RL : I need those emails.  I need a record for legal purposes.

&gt;Me :  We need to get those emails out of the inbox.  At least the older stuff.  You will still be able to access it, but it won't load them all up when you open outlook.  

&gt;RL : I don't have time to search for my emails. I need them.

&gt;Me : Do you have time to wait for Outlook to search through each email every time you start it?  That's what it is doing now.  You see those books over there?  Imagine if you had to read them all every day before you started work.  Even the ones that have nothing to do with what you are doing that day.  

&gt; RL : So you can't fix this without screwing up my email?  I want your boss to look at this.

&gt; Me : OK.  lets call him in.  I won't tell him what I found, and we'll see what he says.

Boss comes in, takes one look and tells him to clean up his email.  RL argued and got very angry.


&gt;Boss :  If someone broke into my house, and I shoot him, should I talk to the police before talking to you?

&gt;RL : That would be stupid.  You would probably end up making things very bad for your self.

&gt;B :  So I should follow your advice on legal matters, because Law is what you do, and you know more than I do.

&gt;RL : That's why I get paid the big bucks.

&gt;B : Computers are why *I* get paid the big bucks.

&gt;me :  When do I get paid these big bucks everyone is talking about?

&gt;B and RL at the same time : When your name is on the door.

RL ended up having an intern go through his emails, filing them by customer. "

I have a condition called FSH Muscular Dystropy which kinda sucks but isn't to bad.  But I have no idea where to go I'm gold with computers and that so I went into coding but I don't feel like that I'm that great at it... And sometimes it's just a hassle but I digress.  I've tried hard to get a job hell I even put up an Web page on a free hosting site hoping something might happen or I'll get a internship.  People ask you what you want to do as a job or be when you grow up?. I can't answer I have no idea and no real passion about things I did about bodybuilding but that's a different story... 

I found a amazing girlfriend but now I'm feeling like I'm a dead weight to her.  She doesn't see anything like that but it's in my head... I feel complete and utterly lost and confused and we'll stressed with no prior experience or jobs on a resume of 20 year soon to be 21 year old Its going to be even more hard..  People say the future is bright but how can I say that when I have no idea on what I'm even attending to study is going to be enjoyable for me..  

Tldr; studying to do programming because decent with computers but not sure if it's want I want to do. And no idea on what I do want to do.

I am currently studying computer science in my first year. I have applied and been offered a job as an IT intern in a company. The only problem is that I have to work 40 hours a week. The bad part is that I think I might be able to do them. They pay per month would be REALLY good ( with a fund from the government it would amount to 1350 euro). By accepting this I would basically sacrifice my social life. What I am trying to decide is if it would be worth it.

2ithhv,16,2014-10-09,"20F with no direction, I just want to do something.. fun and meaningful",lovetothelightning,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2ithhv/20f_with_no_direction_i_just_want_to_do_something/,"I apologize for making this a bit long.
I am 20, I graduated from HS a couple years ago and took a year off to figure things out, then got a job at a retail store where I worked for about 6 months. Those 6 months were hell due to shitty management, but I did meet my boyfriend there. He is in a similar position as me, with no direction. I quit my job and started going to community college, just to do something with myself. I had wanted to get some kind of physical science degree, eventually transfer colleges, but after a couple semesters I think I might not be cut out for university, especially a subject as rigorous as biology or chemistry. My boyfriend is interested in drama and acting, but that's a whole different situation.

Basically, right now I have absolutely no idea what to do, all I know is that I HAVE to get out and go somewhere. I can't drive and even if I could I can't afford a car (my boyfriend is looking into getting himself a car though). I've been job searching my area but there's limited options for someone with no degree and no transportation besides walking/biking. There's also very very few opportunities for volunteering or internships. I had started to look into the AmeriCorps program, which both me and my boyfriend are very interested in, because it would allow us to get out, even if we had to live on a small stipend. I'm usually very optimistic but lately nothing has been going right for us, so while I want to apply for this program, I am doubtful that either of us would get in. I've been trying to find other similar programs and internships but I don't really know what I'm looking for. It's our dream to live in a big city, hopefully like in California or Washington or something, but the only thing standing in our way is lack of money and fear of failure. That's why I'm looking into programs that, if accepted, it'll be the exact swift kick in the butt that we need, along with the offer of money so we can move (we have some money saved up but only enough to last us a few months).

So here are some interests of mine:

* Volunteer work type stuff. Specifically environmental or helping the homeless/disadvantaged people. I like helping.

* I love cooking. I've applied to plenty of cook/prep cook/baker positions in the area but I have no professional experience.. I do have the option to do the culinary arts program at my CC, but I'm kinda worried about the trouble that switching around programs would cause with financial aid. I also am very interested in this free college thing? in San Diego that offers a culinary program, but I do not live in San Diego..

* Art. Painting, drawing, etc. I'm good at it, it's been my only passion my whole life but the past couple of years I feel kinda hopeless with it. But it is something I enjoy and am good at. I have this dream of making album/poster art for bands, but well.. that's kind of a difficult position to get into. I gotta keep building a portfolio if I want freelance art work.

* Science, I like science very much but I am not good at studying and have never had a high GPA. Chemistry was my forte, but I'm not a genius at it. (I like geology, anthropology, paleontology, sociology, psychology... etc. I like psychology a lot but don't think I could do the schooling.)

* I do enjoy fashion and make-up, but that's a recent interest. I think doing special effects make-up would be so cool, but I'm not really qualified for it.

That's all I can think of for now. There's lots of things I like, just not a lot of opportunities that I can take involving them. Like I said, I mostly want something that can kick my butt into gear. If you know of anything similar to AmeriCorps, please tell me (I'm not really looking to go out of country, but I may consider it). Also, if you know of a city that is fun/interesting and has some good opportunities for someone with little education and experience, PLEASE let me know! I don't know where to go (although San Diego is sounding nice)."

I definitely messed up on one of them on the technical questions (phone interview), did ok on one, and then got 1/1 questions correct on the most recent one I had. 

I get it. I'm not a CS major so the road is going to be a bit tougher and I have to prove that I actually know shit and am not BSing the people who interview me. I have a GitHub with projects, a portfolio website that I set up, have taken a decent amount of CS classes at school (plan to take more) and try my hardest at these interviews. 

I have gotten 0 offers. I know I don't deserve anything, but god damn, I used to go on my college's career website and apply to everything relevant to programming and now I just feel so discouraged. Like what's the point of applying if the same shit is going to happen...

Am I on the right track? If not, what should I be doing to work towards that first internship? (Haven't had one before, btw).

**Idea**: - Connect Unix to Windows 7computer using possibly a crossover cable
* Use something like FTP to transfer files from Unix to Windows 7
* Transfer files from Windows 7 machine to internal network.


**Back story first**: So I'm a new intern at my workplace and I've been given the amazing challenge.
There is a really old Unix Machine that Security says by no means can it be connected to the internal network. (It's too old and it's a security hazard).
Now the idea that a coworker and I have come up with is to take a computer that is running Windows 7 with 2 network cards. 1 network card will be used to connect to the Unix machine and the other network card will be used to connect to the internal network.
The Unix machine already has a FTP server set up on it because my other coworkers were using Filezilla to access the files. Unfortunately now we can’t connect the Unix machine to the network.

**My Problem**: I don’t know what process or what specifics are needed to get 2 network cards to work correctly.

I haven't had much luck finding such jobs, and even worse is I am entry level and these jobs are requiring many years of experience.

I've looked for internships or easier positions just maybe in sales or finance where the only requirement is a degree, but then I have been told a few times or questioned, why am I applying for such a position, it seems to be under me as a UC Berkeley grad, and to go for these higher up positions instead.

Although I have been putting in the effort to finding jobs, I objectively think that I am not trying hard enough. I certainly am not doing this ""treat finding a job like a job, 9-5"". It's partly because I am not financially struggling as I live with my parents, and a bit of a slump since most of my days are spent in the house, half lazying about, half finding a job.

I've read here a few times just having a job would be more motivating and of course productive, but then if I find something, I feel as if I would settle into that and then when I get back from work I'd just want to do my hobbies as opposed to finding a more appropriate and better job. Additionally, I wouldn't be planning to stay with a low skilled job for very long, so I feel that poses its own problems.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially anything for a fresh graduate. I find myself relating to these posts, and it helps."

I'm pretty open to taking anything anywhere. Long hours for low pay, to get the actual experience. Relocation isn't a big deal, even if it's just temporary.

1: Is this even a good idea? Is it feasible? Is being technically enrolled IN school a requirement for an internship?

2: Where's the best place to find internships, beyond checking the carrers section of the websites of tech companies? Is there a Monster.com for dev internships, perhaps?

So, I recently interned with a middle-sized company, and extended my offer into full-time work afterwards. As a bit of background, I spent most of my internship building a large module, but have had an incredible amount of (mostly political) difficulty getting it merged back into the main code base.

Shortly after making the transition from intern to full-timer, I was quietly moved to another team - I myself didn't find out about it until I was required to show up at daily scrum meetings. I was then approached by a few project managers, who were almost hostile in their opposition to me continuing work on my previous project. 

Since then, I've been sort of pressured into abandoning my work to take on their backlog of bugs. This involves learning an entirely different stack, setting up new dev environments, etc. What's more, there is absolutely no direction given - I'm just pointed to a nebulous blob of tickets, and told that I should find something to fix. 

Since the issue tracking system is very poorly managed, there's no indication as to what issues are important, which I could feasibly contribute to, or even which are still unsolved. The first bug I worked on was closed as ""fixed"", even though I was able to perfectly reproduce the bug on production. Another issue was a duplicate of someone else's. I was able to push a fix to a third, but was met with disapproval because it wasn't one of the ""right"" issues to work on.

At this point, I'm feeling pressured at every single meeting to divine what's ""important"". What's more, I'm also told asked almost daily if I will give up on my 4 month long project and close out the ticket, and publicly embarrassed when if I say no.

I know this may sound a bit rant-y and specific, but my question is - how much of this is normal? I feel like I'm being pushed from dev work to QA/QE, which is not a career I want. Is it usual to have new employees sift through tickets themselves? If so, what can I do to get up to speed? Because at this point, I'm just feeling stressed and unproductive.

I really don't want to get there, because I fear I would be stuck, having little time and energy to study/practice programming and hardly getting more employable.

Can you help me to find a path that would get me a job or internship within one year considering the following skills?

- I'm a years long linux user (debian and archlinux), accustomed with command line and run some personal server with it.
- I'm learning C++, I'm at chapter 13 of C++ Primer 5th, so this mean I covered most of the basic. I also made a simple 2d game with C++ and SDL.
- Last year I learnt basic python.

But I'm open to learn other languages and tools if they are better suited to achieve my goal.

I'm stuck in a bit of a conundrum here, and would really appreciate any advice/thoughts on my situation. Also, sorry about the super long writeup, I've been thinking about this for quite some time now.

I am currently a junior at a reasonably good public school studying biomedical engineering, but the program is the first engineering-related program that the school has had for a LONG time (apparently the last time my school has had an engineering program was in the '20's, and so we don't have ANY ties to mechE or EE departments). The reason why I'm in this program was because I didn't initially plan on doing BME; I first entered college thinking that I would do genetic engineering, but slowly moved away from bio/chem things and towards technical stuff. Mind you, we are currently NOT ABET-accredited, but the department says that my year will be retroactively accredited. My GPA is okay, around a 3.2 (taking organic chemistry was a terrible misstep on my part)

For BME here, we typically aren't taking very engineery classes until Junior year (although I have taken statics and matsci last year). So here's the thing: I'm taking electronics this semester (as everyone in my program does), and to be honest, I'm enjoying it. While I'm not doing the best with the conceptual material, I find it a lot easier to understand and figure out on my own than other classes. Building circuits in the lab has actually been fairly enjoyable as well, and I'm not sitting around cursing at myself when I'm in the lab at midnight or by myself. I honestly am starting to think that electronics is my thing; I haven't felt this way about any class for a long, long time. 

As of this year, I'm also spending considerable amounts of time at a somewhat nearby school with a solid engineering program doing BME research (believe me, at this point, I would switch to EE research if I could), and I'm getting back in touch with friends that go to that school that are also doing engineering. I recently went to a engineering career fair at that school (since no engineering company wants to come over to my school's career fairs), and I ended up talking to far more electrical engineering companies about internships and co-ops than BME companies. Might even land something for next semester :D

I've taken all the more EE- electives (which is only really one- microcontrollers) that my school has to offer, and am not interested in the rest of the electives. My three close BME friends are also planning/considering to leave the field for greener pastures. I've tried everything that I could for BME (research, genetic engineering, etc.) that my school could offer, and I'm starting to feel more and more isolated from this university in more ways than one. All my projects besides research are electronics-related. I honestly am getting very sick and tired of BME, and especially the reactions that recruiters often make when I mention that; it always feels like an uphill battle just to get to the same point that a mechE and EE major is already at without any work. Honestly, I don't have very much to gain from hanging around anymore, and I'm considering transferring to the university that I do research at (apparently the EE transfer requirements aren't as strict as some of the other fields). But I'm so close to finishing, as I just need two more classes after the end of this year. Should I take the jump, switch, and use two years to transfer and finish a degree in EE (which is what my EE friends have estimated would probably take me to get through)? Or should I just grit my teeth and ride it out at this point?"

I even took the GRE if I want to move forward to grad school down the line.

But in the face of it all, both the struggles, time commitments, and ambiguity after graduation, I am getting...anxious? Depressed? Idk...I always read that people should enjoy themselves, adventure, and be spontaneous in college as you'll never get another chance. I never had money or time for any of that, it was perplexing. Weekends have always been for work, ""breaks"" (spring, summer, thanksgiving) were opportunities to get overtime hours, catch up on school/intern work, etc.

Ive been working hard to get my life off the ground, saying that these frivolous fancies are for people who already have careers, only to realize that once I begin my career i will have less time and energy than ever before. Im not too burnt out really (tho i have been before), i get afternoons here and mornings there to myself, but i havent had two or more consecutive days off in *years* and I invest my intermittent stretches of down time just sleeping/crashing, or doing something mundane.

I feel uncentered. Like i forgot to have fun or live my life. Like I only understand happiness anecdotally, as if it is some dessert course that never comes. Im tired and done with being bitter towards people who took college as something other than working all the time, but admiting these things and writing this post makes me feel entitled, like a failure.

Do all college grads face this? I feel like it takes a lot of nerve to really waste the time to take a break during *or* after college in this economy. How could I possibly justify it? What would I even do? I feel too anomic to learn to live life again, too cynical to take the prospect seriously, and too conflicted to do anything other than continue to ride this wave of stubborn momentum.

So I'm a sophomore computer science major. I'm currently deciding if I should spend this coming summer and fall studying abroad, or if I should not go and work my butt off to land an internship. 

The study abroad program I want to do would leave mid July and I'd return around mid November. It's in New Zealand and I AM guaranteed an internship while I'm there. However, the internship is really just doing basic IT, and I want to work in software engineering, so career-wise I don't think it will help me all that much. 

My school really pushes that we should try to get an internship every summer in order to get a job in the field. I really, really, reallyyyy want to go abroad, but if losing this summer for getting an internship is really going to hurt me, then I won't... 




Other notes:

-Money isn't an issue as I have a generous scholarship.   

-Program is done through my uni, so all credits will transfer.   

-I was too much of a beginner to land an internship last summer, so I already feel behind career-wise. 

-GPA is OK, but not stellar. (3.13 right now, but probably gonna go up after this semester.) So, I don't even know if I can get an internship.

-There are other study abroad programs I can do, but they don't offer classes in my major, so I'd end up behind schedule and have to  overload. "

This is going to sound really petty but I'm worried about making as much money as possible for my upcoming graduation in May 2015. I go to a top ten school, and had an internship paying me roughly 7,000 a month this summer. However; I didn't receive an offer from them, so I went back to the job search in the fall. I currently have one offer for around 72,000 and a few more interviews next week. However I'm hearing of people who I consider roughly equal talents getting offers in the high 90,000 range, from return offers from their internship. Are return offers from internship usually higher than other offers? Do I have any hope of reaching the 90,000 range? I know this is a great place too be in, but all the debt I have is driving me crazy, that I won't be able to get an offer that high since I got no return offer. I'm really nervous about it because I think that it will take me maybe half a decade to make up that 130% increase in salary, and I'll forever lag behind where I would if I start with a higher offer.

Alright, so I got a job working in an engineering office as a GIS/Drafting Technician 2 years ago, which I left a year ago for lack of being able to afford living in the area.  It took 18 months to land that job and it was something unsustainable on a single income.  I moved back home and began searching again while working a small job just to supplement the family income a little. 



I went to school in the south, got a Geography degree in which I focused all of my coursework on GIS studies.  My grades weren't amazing through my Sophomore year but I got into GIS courses and brought up my average quite a bit. I went from a C average to a high B average.  Really enjoyed the coursework and started searching out jobs my second semester senior year whether it was an internship or full gig.  No bites what so ever.  I was on a forum totally unrelated and asked for some guidance and was able to get a position through a member knowing someone at the top of a company.  I was actually denied that at first and they gained a new contract I guess so they did hire me on. 



Anyways, I have no idea what I'm doing now as I have been out of practice for some time but really enjoyed the work I've done.  I have an interview Wednesday but it is a civilian job, so I imagine a Reserves candidate will be chosen over myself for obvious reasons.  I have thought about an online Masters as my local school really just puts you into the same exact coursework and adds a lengthy paper on top of it and calls you a masters student.  I'm ineligible to even attend that school as I got my undergrad there anyways.   

If anyone knows of some learning resources and/or a good online masters program, I'd be interested in hearing about it.

I am a software developer at a start up in India.I completed my undergrad in Information Technology in 2013. I have a decent GPA and 2 publications.
The main thing that is confusing the heck out of me at this point is how I should shortlist my universities.
Yes I have already gone through the programs and shortlisted the ones that are relevant to that program.Money is a concern so I have also taken that into account.
However, I am really and truly concerned about other things.Listing them below


* 1. How do I judge whether or not my application is good enough for the school I have selected? Essentially how do you figure out which university is safe/moderate/ambitious.
* 2. I am definitely looking for schools in area where its easier to get an internship and a job later on. People have often told me Bay area is the best.But does that mean I should sacrifice other good schools that have an excellent faculty for my program of choice?



I would add more questions in a while.Work crisis calls right now.
Could a generous soul out there please help me out? :(
Thanks!"

-------------------------

As some of you are no doubt aware, Glassdoor data for new graduate positions is highly unreliable, and many universities don't publish signing bonus and equity numbers alongside salary in departmental surveys, or don't make the information available until late in the year, long past offer deadlines.
Having seen the popularity of [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/ccrvc75) in the [Should I Negotiate with Google thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/) I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here in CSCQ to get a better idea of what we should really expect when interviewing and negotiating.
In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, I propose something like the following format.
For each commenter:

    * Target School: Yes/No
    * Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}

I've been casually looking for other jobs (Engineering and I.T.) because I've been getting pretty over worked due to some staffing changes recently. I may be offered a position that not only pays more, but will offer some project management experience. This is great, but I feel like the longer I wait to get into Engineering the more difficult it will be. I also don't wan't to seem like a job hopper so I'm guessing I should at least put a year into the new position.
  
There are a few different ways I can think of handling this, I'm just not quite sure what the best in the long term. 
  
1. I pass on the opportunity and stick it out for the next 6 months and see what I can land after graduation.
2. I accept the offer and stick around for a year or so, then look for an Engineering job 6-12 months after graduation.
3. I accept the offer and look for a job straight out of graduation, but this means I'd only be with the new company 6 months or so.  

I'm almost certain if I decide to stay in I.T. I will regret it later even though I think it'd be easy to move up the ladder. I am good at I.T. but enjoy Engineering more, even if I'm not as strong in it.    
  
If you were in my shoes, what would you do? I should probably point out that internships are not an option at the moment because I need insurance and to be paid a certain amount to keep up on bills and pay off debt before graduation."

I just downloaded Microsoft visual C++ and I picked up beginning C++ progamming for dummies.  I'm an electrical engineering major in school right now, and I started noticing a lot of internships want students with knowledge of C++.

I have a background in MatLab and I'm pretty proficient in it.  I can use it pretty efficiently to manipulate data and create functions to do some basic engineering problem solving.

So, I'm wondering how long it would take to learn C++ to a degree where I could use it in an engineering environment.  I already learned some basic things like conditionals, declaring variables, etc.

Also, is C++ as useful in data manipulation and analysis as MatLab is?

I apologize if I'm breaking the rules by posting this here. I know I should be doing this on /r/depression but there's such a thick pallor there, and the more I read that subreddit, the heavier this weight on my soul gets. 

I'm diagnosed with Asperger's, and very much INTJ. I over-analyze and over-think things, and I'm cognizant that my overthinking has brought me to this point. But I think I really need help from those who think the same way I do. 

Now, where do I begin?

I am:

* 27
* a foreign student from Singapore who has been studying in the US for 3 years.
* an International Relations major.
* was supposed to graduate this Spring, but medical and surgical complications happened. I missed at least 60% of classes.
* I committed plagiarism in order to alleviate my workload, and was caught. Even though the punishment was light as the act of plagiarism was on a research paper plan, I decided to apply for medical withdrawal
* I am now a super senior
* During my surgery period, I received and accepted an offer to write an entry for a prestigious encyclopedia for political science. But I never got to writing it.
* I returned to Singapore to take a break for 1 term. I then took on an internship with an industry advocacy NGO to pass the time and make myself useful. I accepted a research project within the NGO
* I have completed basic research for the project and all I need to do is to write the sucker
* But I can't. I stare at MS Word, and I just fucking can't. 
* NGO asks me to write a fluff piece for the quarterly newsletter. I finish it without fuss and boss praised me for it.
* But I still fucking can't write the fucking fucker
* Then I think about the encyclopedia gig and what a useless fucker I am. I didn't even tell them that they should find someone else
* Grad school application season is here. I want to start my applications but I can't. I don't even like myself enough to sell myself to grad schools.
* 3 weeks later I still can't write. I'm sitting in the office feeling like the most useless fucker in the universe
* I lose all interest and derive no pleasure in what I usually like to do. Video games feel so empty. Reading... nothing. Painting my Warhammer 40k shit just results in nothing. I don't even get hard from porn anymore.
* I checked on my insurance policies and discovered I have $800,000 in life insurance. Dad has nothing left in his retirement fund because he's sent two kids overseas for school. Mom had Stage 3 breast cancer and defeated it. It may recur anytime. I feel like a financial sinkhole for them.
* I come to the conclusion that I hate myself and deserve to die.

The John Adams quote used to inspire me for my pursuit of an academic career:

&gt;I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.

But I read it now and no longer have any fucks. Reading about Hong Kong, Syria and Ukraine would have lit a fire in my belly to write op-eds for my student newspapers, but I just don't give a shit anymore. Those people can die for all I care.

I need help. I seriously need help. I have enough of a theory of mind to be aware that I do, but I can't stop the self-loathing and I cannot help myself. I think of myself as a plagiariser and because of that I don't have any place to consider myself of any intellectual or academic worth. This country has high-rise apartment blocks all over the place and it really is no trouble for me to walk to the nearest one and fling myself off the top floor. What can I do?!"

I am from Ireland, with citizenship. I am studying ""Computing in Game Development"" in a fairly unknown IT. (4 year Hons. Bachelor Degree). It covers the fundamentals of CS.

I have since realized that I probably don't want to work in games. (but it's a nice way of keeping the degree interesting at least). I am finished 3/4 years, and am currently doing a year long internship with a company Citrix in the UK. Seeking to work in the US after graduation.

So when I graduate I'll have done 1 year long internship, working mostly in SDET type role, lots of automation etc, with some really nice projects I to be able to say I contributed to / talk about. Also have a lot of project work from my degree, (3D games with lots of cool math etc.) as well as some small solo development. Python scripts that crawl a blog's server and downloads music, C++ library code that deals with perceptual image hashing, stuff like that. All hosted on github / good things to talk about.

So right now it looks like I might have two options. 

I hear first off that working for a company with offices in both locations helps (which Citrix happens to have). I hear that you usually have to work there for a year, and then they can sponsor you with a visa to transfer. Would something along the lines of my internship count towards that? Would they be in the position to sponsor me for a position in the US after graduation?

My second option would simply be to apply to grad positions in the US, and hope to get through with someone who is comfortable with sponsoring someone. It seems like there is going to be a relatively small number of large companies who would routinely go down this road, so it seems kind of a long shot. Would you think I would have a chance given that I don't exactly have a big name degree but some fairly solid experience?

Thanks in advance for any input!, I appreciate this is a bit of a common topic but I couldn't really gauge an opinion from topics I searched through. I don't have a current CV as I'm employed for the next 9 months~, but I could drum one up if it's of interest."

I'm 23 this year, I have a year and a half minimum to complete my bachelor's degree(Computer Science), and I am working at a broker-dealer in the Operations department.

I managed to land a full-time position(was an intern) by automating many processes in Excel via VBA which freed up the developers time for company-wide issues.

I make 44K base, with O/T and had a 12k bonus last year.(NYC)

This isn't my first full-time semester since i started working, but it seems I took on more then I can and am falling behind in my courses.

My problem is I don't like finance, I feel that my job is either boring (My job description is just daily tasks- glorified button pressing essentially), OR If i am assigned a project, then I feel like an extremely underpaid developer. 

I'm contemplating quitting my job, and finding an internship in a tech company for some pocket change, this way I can attend school full-time, but then I would be losing my salary, benefits, and it might not look good to future recruiters saying that ""I couldn't handle the workload"".

The alternative is to cut down on classes, but I dont wan't to spend years just to get a bachelor's degree, while either being bored with my work or underpaid for my additional projects. 

(Not to mention that I had a chance to internally transfer to a Trade Analysis(Front/Middle office) position, and that chance was taken away only because of my degree.) The point is that I don't want my degree to hold me back from other opportunities. 

Just curious on your inputs. Thanks!

I'm concerned because I'm consistently seeing advice to not to include coursework or experience in irrelevant fields. That's all I've got though!

2j8ezp,0,2014-10-14,Internships: Working with outdated / not innovative products and portfolio,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j8ezp/internships_working_with_outdated_not_innovative/,"I just finished my bachelors studies and I have solid two years experience as a full stack developer in which me and my team did tons of research and development. We worked on a project that was on the innovative side and we mostly used modern and creative tools to accomplish our goals. The project was a success and we had lots of fun exploring and testing everything new but above all I loved how innovative and inspirational the startup world really is. 

The country in which i'm residing has a lot of job and trainee offerings for developers and most of them claim to be on the innovative side. However when I read the requirements and offerings of the listing I notice that all of them include training or require a skill set that is in my opinion very outdated. Starting from supporting old CMSs (Joomla, Type3) etc., using MySQL and PHP combined with old JS Frameworks.

Now I don't want to seem arrogant or anything but why bother? Why bother teaching interns outdated stuff? Why bother building new technologies based on that old same stuff? Isn't researching and innovating a field where you constantly have to look and explore the newest technologies? I would understand if it's about supporting old software but that is mostly not the case.

Like this company for example claims to create ""smart"" and ""innovative"" apps for Android, yet it forces its interns to use Eclipse and hasn't heard of AndroidAnnotations or Square Spoon. Why would anybody do that to themselves?!

Or another example: a company claims to be just as ""innovative"" and ""modern"", yet requires jQuery, Wordpress and Bootstrap as a skillset to develop the newest web apps. Hardly ever heard of AngularJS or Dart, Single-page apps and stuff. 

I don't want to waste 3 to 6 months of my life coding with outdated IDEs and frameworks still using session stores instead of JWS. This are just very small examples but you get the idea. And no, I'm not the guy that screams ""Relational DB's don't scale"" or ""Rails is slow"", ""mongoDB FTW!""

So why the hell would anybody pursue a career down that path? I've already given up looking for internships or job offers in the technical field because there's nothing that can truly offer me ""innovative"" stuff. I love designing and coding, I love working with modern frameworks, yet it seems nobody wants the world to go down that road. And keep in mind, I'm talking about innovative agencies, that claim to be the top notch in ""smart technologies"". 

Funding is a bit scarce right now so I need to find a half-time position for a few months - ideally an internship.
So what should I do? Should I start looking for other job openings at startups? Or change the field, like enter IT Research Projects ? Something with an IT background but focused more on researching and planing innovative projects? I really don't see any future for me as a developer in those openings.

tl;dr: cynical rant: everybody claims to be ""innovative"", ""smart"", ""pushing forward"" yet uses outdated shit to create more shit."

I hope someone reads my story.,NerfHerdess,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2j90dc/my_experience_i_hope_someone_reads_my_story/,"I would like to share my story with you regarding Minnesota School of Business. The term “crooks” does not even begin to describe how they operate.

Once I was young and naive with a bad high school GPA but ambition.  I applied everywhere for college when I was 23 yet no one would take me. Except one. There it was; my golden beacon of opportunity. I enrolled at MSB for paralegal studies to pursue a career in law.  

Admissions was so nice, letting me take out 10x the amount of student loans anyone probably ever should because they told me it would be much easier on me if I didn’t have to work and I could even use my student loans to pay my rent!

I excelled greatly in the subject and loved every minute of it. I couldn’t believe how easy it was.  I realized quickly that not a lot of my teachers actually had teaching degrees. One was an old retired attorney, another a paralegal. But they did not go to school to teach, nor had they ever taught classes before.

A semester away from graduating with my bachelor’s degree I fell very ill and was unable to attend classes. I figured I would just drop out for the time being and re take the semester.  I searched online for potential jobs and internships out in DC. My goal was to work for the department of justice and work my way up the paralegal ranks. “Please select your school from the list below.”  No matter how hard I looked, or what company I went to look for jobs, my school was never listed. 
That’s when I found out that my school was not accredited. At. All. No one would accept a degree from this imaginary fake school.  I did not go back to finish my semesters.

Years pass. I am a paralegal, without a degree, working in a firm that I helped open.  I got a job working the corporate books for a firm but showed immense potential so another attorney whisked me away to start up our own.  We are successful, busy and I love every minute of it. I helped build something and I am so pleased with my life. My attorney mentions that I would be a great lawyer.

Looking to transfer my credits to school to get into law school I was heartbroken. Not one single “accredited” college would accept any credits for transfer. I would have to take 4 more years of college over again THEN go to law school for 4 years. At 27, this is just not an option. Especially after porking out close to $62,000.00 for “private” college at MSB. I would not be able to financially survive with that sort of school debt.

I had a mental breakdown. I was depressed, didn't eat, couldn't sleep and hated everything. 

Luckily, there is currently a class action law suit open against MSB for these reasons. False representation claiming their school is accredited, etc.  Please keep hope that these bastards will burn for the future they have ripped away from me so easily.

2j92hg,26,2014-10-14,Rejected from Google internship before interview despite being offered interview last year? Am I blacklisted?,googleappthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j92hg/rejected_from_google_internship_before_interview/,"I got offered a Google internship interview last year (sophomore year) after submitting my resume online. It took too long for them to get back to me, so by the time they did, I told the recruiter that I had already committed to another internship, so I couldn't interview anymore. 

I submitted an app again this year, with more classes + another summer internship + projects on my resume, but I just received an email saying they decided ""not to proceed"" with my application. I think my resume is good enough to get to the phone screen, at least (I've used it to get interviews at Facebook, Microsoft, etc and also received an offer from Microsoft already). So I'm wondering if Google blacklisted me? I'm really surprised I didn't even get an interview...

More background: I go to a target school, have done 4 internships (started doing them in high school). I have a perfect GPA. The only things that I can see might be weird about my resume are the fact that I haven't taken some cool upper level classes like Machine Learning that other juniors might have. And maybe that my internships have all been heavily web-based (JavaScript is probably my most used language). One other caveat is Google is coming to campus to do on-campus interviews for the internship positions soon--perhaps other students from my school are better on paper than I am. I'm really just shocked I didn't make it to a phone screen...

Any ideas on what might've turned them off from me? I'm not too heartbroken because I'm pretty sure I'm going to accept Microsoft's offer, but I really want to fix whatever it is before I apply to full-time positions next year.

Would it be of any use to actually ask the person who contacted me why I've been rejected?"

However they want me to go in for a final interview at their facility about 2 hours away in a few days.

So, I'd have to ask for a day from my new/potential future employer to go interview for another company. 

Sounds kinda bad, and I don't know how my new bosses would take it. Should I even ask or is that just bad form (especially considering I've only been there a few days)?

I'm going to ask the new company if they'd consider a Skype interview, but they've already emphasized that they really want me to go in in-person.

Any advice appreciated."

I currently have a 3.06 GPA.

I have no internship experience, but I have a lot of research experience. Is all hope lost with this GPA? I am interested in hardware internships primarily, but there are many more software internships available. Unfortunately that means that I will be compared to computer science majors. At least at my school, they tend to have substantially higher GPAs than comp eng majors.

I've already applied to a few companies, and this week I'm planning on applying to as many companies as I can. What can I do to improve my chances? Lately I've had the feeling that anything &lt; 3.5 and your resume is automatically thrown in the trash.

 I'm not very optimistic about an internship because, from what I've heard from fellow students, most IT internships that students at my college obtain tend to not be very educational, and often focus on doing basic office tasks (copy this, file that) rather than genuine IT work. At my current job, I deal with faculty and students, troubleshoot a wide variety of technological issues, and learn quite a bit about different operating systems and technologies.

By the time I graduate, if I stick to my current job, I'll have around 2 years of help desk experience under my belt. Currently, I'm encouraged to constantly learn, and I'm often able to follow along with another higher ranking IT employee to fix an issue that I am unable to fix myself.

I really don't know what path I should pursue, but right now I seem to be gaining a lot of solid experience at my job, and I need the money for living expenses and various school-related fees. What do you all think would be the wisest thing to do? Any additional advice?"

I think having this name on my resume plus the starting salary will lead me to greater success as I grow older. 

However, I love my home state and my family. Even while in college right now, I make a fairly lengthy drive from my college town to visit my parents weekly, which I know sounds weird, but was pretty much expected when I first moved out.

Lately my mother (who is a tiny Asian lady, bless her heart), has just been acting all nostalgic, showing me little things I gave her when I was a child, telling stories about how much she missed me when I was away during my internship, and constantly reminding me that I'm leaving next year. 

It's literally breaking my heart and although it's not going to sway my decision to accept the offer, it certainly is swaying my thoughts about how homesick I'll be and how long I'll be with the company for. Due to certain reasons, I need to be with the company for at least 5 years, and after that I'll determine where to go from there. 

So does anyone have similar experiences once they moved away? Is this just what they call ""growing up""?"

It is a fairly non-technical program. There are a few courses that teach us about databases (mostly SQL), systems design and analysis, enterprise architecture and beginner java coding. To me, that is more of an IT project management kind of deal. In addition, this program offers no technical stream. There is a beginner java course and it leads no where due to the student body. (There use to be a client-server application development course in Java). 

My dilemma is I realize I have developed an interest in programming and computer science. I mean just the other day I had a blast trying to figure out how to solve for a Taylor series up to a certain point as part of my beginner java course weekly problem sets. Anyways, I digress. I am currently finishing my 3rd year in this program with some internship experience (about a year developing and designing BI tools like Qlikview and Tableau). I am wondering if there is a way to possibly transition and spin this business/IT degree into a software development career? I mean the obvious thing to do is to switch majors, however that isn't a luxury I can afford anymore. I really don't want to waste my 3 years of my parent's money to switch and put myself in another 4 years of debt.

One option I've mapped in my head is to graduate and work in the IT field with one of my previous companies that I interned with while taking computer science courses in college (which is the equivalent to community college here in Canada) to fill in the knowledge gaps before making the transition. Does this seem feasible?

It's going to be a long read, sorry. I will appreciate it though.

I have been unemployed for 6 months. I earned my electrical engineering degree back in April. GPA of 3.3, no internship since I had to work while in college to help my mother and pay my bills. Needed to focus on school after I left the job.Worked as a bank teller for 2 years.

 Electronics is a hobby of mine and i've worked on many projects, from RF jammer to autonomous car. I even learned how to crack WEP, WPA2, WPA router security. Hacked into my neighbors routers, free internet for life. I like electronics and really do think I chose the right major, just happen to live in the wrong place for it. Miami, Florida. Absolutely no electronic design jobs available, not even technicians. I have been getting interviews with big companies like Intel and Texas Instruments. Haven't gotten a offer though. In total, I have done 8 interviews, learning from mistakes. In regards to relocation, I can only relocate if the company helps me. Only $800 in the bank and parents can't help.  Loans are coming due in a few weeks, calling soon to defer. Another stress load.

I am in the application process to be an Air force officer but unfortunately I failed one section of the exam. Need to wait until March to retake, it's a long process. I was just thinking of enlisting, they have some cool jobs I am interested in.

I was also thinking about going into IT, just don't know where to start. Not fluent in programming yet, learning C. Did take a intro Java class that made it up to arraylists. Through that class, I have been able to teach myself C better. I have been messing around with computers since I was 15. I know how build one from scratch and can use google like a pro.

Most of my friends are doing something unrelated to electrical engineering.

My school is a top uni for my major and I'd say I'm pretty good at finance for the most part. 

Personally, I don't love finance. I don't *mind* some aspects of it (like valuation or strategy) but HATED others (like investments). Seeing my older friends who went to high paying prestigious jobs (70k+ starting salaries) in ""safe"" cities (cheaper cost of living but not as much to do) complain about how they wish they were back in school or how soul sucking work was, I became terrified of being stuck in long hours considering I didn't even *like* finance as much as my peers. 


So I took a lower paying internship in fashion instead and LOVED it. I've always been more about shopping anyways and my study breaks were to read all the Vogues/ELLE's, Business of Fashion, and look at clothes. Like, even my friends teased me saying 'stop looking at clothes we need to finish this model"" and stuff. 

I got a full time offer, in my dream city (NYC!!!), in a reputable company, in a field I obsess over during my free time/not-so-free time. I accepted it it being all in the stars at first, but I'm now second guessing my choices. 

While my peers working in banking, consulting, etc. are making 60k-six figures in cheaper cities like Houston, Birmingham, or Minneapolis, I'm starting only with 50k. I feel like in NYC that's horrendously low and now I'm wondering if I should have sucked it up and gone the finance route. People with just as good or even lesser GPAs/resumes than me managed to get jobs in the field and I turned down a prestigious offer to pursue fashion instead. 

At the same time, I have my other spectrum of friends who don't even have jobs lined up or are still struggling to find jobs. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this since all my friends are in either extreme (and I'm embarrassed about my low salary with my big-shot friends and feel ashamed/entitled with my not so fortunate friends.)

Not to mention focusing on school is MUCH harder now. 

I think I need outsider perspective. 

Am I selling myself short? Am I being an entitled brat who isn't thankful I have a job in the first place? Maybe someone with more life experience can give me advice, I'd really appreciate it. "

I'm pretty sure the single biggest thing holding me back is my lack of experience. I did not have any internships during my 4 years of school and it's killing me. Nearly every position I've been able to find requires at least some experience. I've applied to most entry-level position that I can find but clearly something is missing.

Additionally, I do not have a portfolio to speak of. I do not have a github account to document my projects through school. I just made a linked-in account today so that I have some web presence (I do not have a facebook/twitter/g+/etc.). So I fear that this is yet another (major) strike against me.

I'm looking for some suggestions on what I should do to either get a job or increase my value as a potential new employee. Hell, even the names of some hiring/temp agencies in the Portland area that I could get into contact with would be helpful at this point. 



In summary:

* Looking to work in Portland or surrounding area
* Graduated in September

* B.S. in Software Engineering

* 3.45 GPA
* No work experience or internships
* No portfolio
* Live in southern Oregon (but want to move to Portland ASAP)
* Starting to stress about loans

tl;dr: Need job in Portland as an entry-level software engineer because I have no experience. Should I keep applying? Should I just move to Portland and go to a temp agency? "

I went to community college when I was 19 for 2 years, always intending to transfer to a good university. At that point, I was interested in psychology and perhaps a future in academia or counseling. I set myself up well (3.97 GPA, honors program classes, president of psychology club, tutored psych in the learning center, wrote for the school paper, completed a leadership seminar, won an award in psychology), but when transfer time rolled around, I was starting to feel like not only did I want to spend my twenties obtaining a PhD in psych, but I wasn't really that interested in learning about psychology anymore anyway -- I was disillusioned with the field itself. 

Then I made a huge mistake: I took ""a semester off"" to reevaluate. My dad was opening a restaurant at that time, so I started working there full-time. 

A semester off turned into 3 years off from school. During that time, I: 
- Worked at the restaurant
- Wrote two columns regularly for a high-traffic website (I have always loved writing) 
- Became a paid freelance writer for a local lifestyle magazine (unfortunately, this is only a once monthly contribution) 
- Obtained and completed two unpaid graphic design internships because I used to design blogs/websites/posters/etc. when I was a kid and teenager and enjoyed it 
- Quit smoking cigarettes (a year and a half ago after smoking for seven years) and started exercising 5x/week. I mainly run, lift weights, and practice yoga. 

Over the summer and after my 26th birthday, I started to have a major panic attack because I felt like I had completely fucked up my life by not completing college. The restaurant is also failing, mostly because of its poor location, so I needed to change something anyway. 

I applied to schools and got into some good ones, but although I got a decent amount of aid, it still wasn't enough to go. Thus, I ended up at a state university, which I hate. 

In my desperation, I decided to pursue a degree in communication design (also known as graphic design) with a concentration in interactive design because I already had some internships on my resume and a little bit of experience in the field. However, the program will require 3 years with no chance of acceleration to complete the Bachelor's, and I will be about $40,000 in debt and newly 29 years old by the time I'm finished. I'm not even sure if this is a smart degree to get based on the time, cost, and the fact that the average graphic designer only makes $50,000 with more probably making closer to $35,000 per year. I like the field, but I don't love it at all, and I'm feeling like I might be making a mistake by pursuing a degree in a low-paying, competitive field that I'm not extremely passionate about. I think I mostly jumped into this program because I was desperate to do something that wasn't spending my life waiting tables. I also now live in a small college town surrounded by traditional students all week, which is pretty isolating. I drive an hour and a half home every weekend to work and come back during the school week. This complete lack of a social life is killing me. I've gotten involved with some things and met people, but at the end of the day, my peers are 19 and I'm 26. We just don't have very much in common.

My other interests are writing and fitness. My ""dream jobs"" are book author, pop culture essayist, magazine writer and editor, or to be able to make a living helping people with their fitness and exercise goals. I'm not sure which of the following choices are best: 

- Try to continue landing freelance writing gigs and continue working in restaurants on the side 
- Obtain some personal training/group fitness/yoga teacher certifications and pursue a career in fitness and continue working in restaurants on the side 
- Transfer universities to a better school in a larger city and pursue a degree in English or journalism where a) the school's name will carry more weight, b) I can complete a degree faster due to summer/winter session support, c) I won't be as socially isolated 
- Stay here for another 2 1/2 years and finish the design degree 

I really don't know what to do. Nursing? Half kidding..."

I started with finance but picked up the double major two years ago (beginning of sophomore year). I have four more classes to go in computer science, among which I am taking two now. I have taken 7 classes in computer science major so far with a high GPA (~3.9) in them.

I was recruiting for fully finance industry positions up until this past summer, and I had a summer internship in finance. That was my first time working full-time in the financial industry, and it was kind of... boring. I didn't get the feeling this is what I could bear doing 60 hours a week for the next however many years, which is why I'm now looking to go into full programming roles.

My resume looks like a finance student's resume. I have had four internships in various areas of the financial industry. I currently have a TA position in an intro level CS course, and that's it for work experience in technology. Also, my finance GPA is lower than my CS GPA so my overall GPA looks not so stellar (still acceptable).

I am wondering what my next steps should be. I've been applying to jobs and getting some interviews, but partly due to my lack of preparation and international student status, I rarely advance to next rounds. I've sent my resume to some startups for part-time internships, but I'm not sure whether taking an internship now is a good idea. Due to visa restrictions, I may have to work unpaid (CPT dealine passed for this semester).

[Resume with some info blocked out](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqflbj37qb0anjk/Resume%28redacted%29.pdf?dl=0): I'm not looking for resume critiques, although they are welcome. This is for reference.

So today is my first day, and he hasn't given me very much insight at all as to what I'll be doing. I haven't had a ton of contact with him, no interview (after the initial one for the internship) to ask for a more detailed job description, and he's a busy man so my emails and calls to him usually don't get returned. I went to an orientation hoping for answers, but it consisted of 200+ people working all kinds of jobs and went through stuff like company policy and that's it. 

So I have to arrive at the stadium in the middle of the game tonight and I'm really nervous. I hate not knowing what to do, and I have very little idea when it comes to where to go, who to talk to or what my responsibilities will be. I guess I just have to go with the flow but I tend to get really nervous and will feel terrible if I need to follow around these busy people during the game asking them a ton of questions. 

Does anyone have any tips for a situation like this?

Not many people may see it but I hope you find it inspiring.

Right now, I am attending college, 2 semesters away from a Degree in Computer Networking. I have an Internship at a computer shop, and I am an avid gamer, and long time lurker of PC Master Race.

I grew up on Roller Coaster Tycoon (started when I was around 5 so technically it was my father playing it and me watching for a long time) and Pokemon on my Game-boy Advance. Until, of-course, my private school banned Pokemon because they considered it satanic (This was around 4th grade). 

Internet was a world I could not explore. Still the fastest internet in the area I grew up is 1.5Mbps, but until I was 15 we still only had dial-up speeds. I had to drive 25 miles to school every day, as the bus routes did not even go out to where I was. To me, YouTube was a myth, as back then 240 and 144p did not exist. The only Multi-player experiences I knew of were a Runescape that took ages to load a single area (I chopped a lot of trees…).

Somehow, I eventually survived until public high school, and discovered an Alpha Minecraft. Through this time period I had no access to Internet besides the school itself. Minecraft introduced me to the first-person aspect of games,  and just in time too. My sophomore year, I took a “Operating Systems” class. Basically, Using Windows XP, 101. 

This classroom had a separate LAN from the school’s network, and I was handed down a relic. A cracked version of Half-Life on a flash drive (The school had a proxy so you could not play a legitimate version). I quickly backed up the files on multiple sources, and began distributing it with my friends in the class. From there, every day after the class work was done, we would all hit the LAN and play for as long as we could. I caught on quickly and the games slowly turned from an even 8-player free-for-all, to a 7v1 on Crossfire with me holding a Crossbow and a Long Jump Module, in which the scores would be on average 127-17. The games did not last long, however, as the teachers began to catch on and confiscate the game files (aaaand I had lost some friends because of the game at that point…).

This is where it all went Italian Job style. My group of friends (that were left) would all meet at breakfast and distribute the copies. From there we would set a time to play (typically at the end of a period), and play across the network on different computers every day. This only work some of the time, and I could not figure out why, until I discovered subnetting and various security measures, like MAC filtering (why we could not use our own laptops).

Then it happened. Playing Half-Life after class one day, and I am approached by the Network Administrator. *gulp* Basically, I had to stop playing the game on computers across the network, but I also had to spend next semester working with him. Bam. Half-Life got me busted, and threw me into a world of Linux, Networking, and Coding *blech*. From there I discovered Steam, built the Desktop (without help) for under $550 I still have today (different video card), got A+ Certified, moved to the city, got 40Mbps Internet *Hallelujah*, attended college, got an internship, and am now writing this because I finished the work in my NET class and don’t have a copy of Half-Life with me.

In all seriousness, I owe the people that helped me get here everything, but without Half-Life I would not have been exposed to the world of Telecommunications, Information Technology, or Multiplayer games.

TL:DR - I got busted for playing Half-Life in Highschool, was thrown head-first into the world of Linux and Networking, fell in love with it, and am about to finish a degree in Networking.

I am scheduled to be there MWF from 8 to 4:30.  My supervisor never is able to plan anything, meaning if I need to meet her elsewhere besides the office, she will text me 15 minutes before hand or the night before.  She will text me about work related things on my days off, and at all times of the day.  Sometimes where I need to meet her will be 40 minutes away.  One time she sent me a text on a Friday night because she was bored.

She is a horrible supervisor besides that.  She never gives me opportunities to learn, constantly cuts me off in my interactions with patients.  She refused to stop so I could eat my lunch or go to the bathroom.  I am denied basic human needs since she gets paid per client she sees.

I have tried many times to discuss this with her and she complies for the day and then back to the same pattern.  She is constantly demeaning and tells me that I am not as experienced as her and don't know what I'm doing.  Obviously I am aware of this.  I have no problem admitting that.  However, This is my 3rd internship, after this I will be working, I feel that I shouldn't be treated as a 19 year old college kid.  Instead of her helping me incorporate my previous experience with this one, she acts as if I have no experience whatsoever.

On top of all of this, she constantly vents to me about her personal problems, including her divorce and her husband cheating on her.  She has actually cried to me many times in person and over the phone.  It puts me in such an awkward position because while I feel bad for her, I am here to learn on the job.  


Things I have done already:
- contacted my school liason who suggested I talk to my supervisor and remind her what is appropriate.
-talked to my supervisor and have told her the things I need to be able to learn in this internship.
-talked to my supervisor's boss and asked for less time with her/ another supervisor.


My question is what else can I do to fix this?  I am trying my best to learn but at the same time I am not an employee and I do not want to step on anyone's toes.  I cannot leave this internship, I am here until April. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.  "

2jgpg6,5,2014-10-16,[Advice] Reorganized with no way of moving lateral or up unless I try to leave,nangaho,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2jgpg6/advice_reorganized_with_no_way_of_moving_lateral/,"Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to summarize the long story the best that I can. The title is pretty much the TL;DR. 

I work for the Federal Government (US). The Agency I work for went through a reorganization of all of IT to form one huge organization. As part of the reorganization people were allowed to select where they were going to land, and as management put it, everyone got to where they want it. I landed in an organization that can be best described as the sales department in a company. We make sure customer relations are good and ""sell"" IT, services, support and start projects for agency customers. We take care of high level requests and are often in talks with agency executives and upper management. I was put here instead of selecting to be in it. Non the less I still do the job I'm assigned and I'm actually one of the best in the group. 

When I started one of the first things I did was to ask my manager about promotions and moving up. My manager tells me that as long as I had happy customers and did my duties that I would be promoted. Not long after a volunteering project came up and I took it. It was technical, and I did really well with it. 

By this time my manager tells my to apply to a position that was open in the group as it would guarantee me a promotion since the IT executives froze promotions indefinitely. The position was essentially the same job I did and had done for the past 3 years. So I applied. And the HR system rejected me instantly. It turns out that I'm 2 levels below it and you can only apply to one level above you. I let my manager know of this and I'm told that they'll just promote me.

Mid April, at this point the project I volunteered for ended and I was given another one. My manager tells me they'll promote me after it. This was a agency wide email migration and I was the team lead of support for HQ. This was the most stressful job I have ever been given. Not nearly enough resources to do half of what was being asked for and I had scheduling targets that were being moved around every few hours or so for whole the month prior to execution. It was very unmanageable. On top of this I was left sitting with the previous organization that I worked for and they decided to assign my cubicle to an intern. They told me to pack up and leave ASAP on the week before migration. So I was leading a large scale effort, shuffling around IT resources and packing my stuff into boxes. Only to do everything again the next day because some executive decided to make changes to the scheduling. The project finally ends in early June and everyone is praising me for the success of what was done. I even got 2 non-monetary awards for it. 

To this day I'm still taking on high visibility projects and doing well but I'm highly stressed by the whole situation. I even have Tier-1 and 2 Tech Support asking me for help on just about everything.

It is now almost a year after I started and I still haven't seen a penny more to my name. I'm told to apply to other openings IT has but they're all in management, I get rejected by HR every time. Every time I've asked my manager I'm told a different excuse. I've spent a good part of the year applying for jobs in public sector that got nowhere. 

This month I started applying to private companies and I immediately got an interview with a tech company, a highly technical entry level position but it seems far better than what I've gone through. I let my manager know about it and that I've been asked to go to a second interview and start what looks like an on-boarding process. My manager immediately tells me that other people will get involved to make me a counteroffer because they want to keep me in the agency.

I'm not sure what to do and what to pursue. Any comments or suggestions are well appreciated. This is my first post but I've been lurking for some time now."

I have very little experience in this industry as I have mostly worked in bars/restaurants all my life.  I really want to make something I have a passion for my career and I know that I need to start at the bottom.  I worked for a local boutique for about 8 months being mostly a sales associate but I did help run the web store and did do merchandising for the store as well.  The problem was that job was 5 years ago and the business has now went under which to me makes the experience almost irrelevant.  I do have a degree but I got it in History so I feel that it doesn't help that much either besides the fact that I did get a degree.

The reason I stayed in the service industry was the fact that I was making a lot of money and became comfortable in that lifestyle.  But more recently I've just felt that I'm not accomplishing anything and not really moving forward with my life.  This is why I'm now trying to start a career in fashion.

I've been applying to mostly jobs that are mostly assistant merchandiser/assistant buyer positions since ultimately one day I would love to be a buyer.  I do have interests in e-commerce, marketing and design as well.  I honestly just want to learn everything I can about the industry and gain every skill that I can.  I'm open to internships but unfortunately most of them require being in school.  I did have an interview for a paid internship with Timberland for their marketing department for product launch and collaborations but unfortunately two days after the interview I found out that the position was suspended indefinitely.  I live in San Diego and we have a good amount action sports apparel companies in the area and Orange County and Los Angeles are only hour to two hour drives away which I wouldn't mind doing.  I have also emailed many companies in the area offering volunteered help in order to just gain some experience but only one, John Elliot +Co, replied back saying they love the enthusiasm but they aren't look for any help right now.  All other companies don't even reply back which is frustrating because most of them have only a few employees.

I'm trying to get my foot in the door where I can and it doesn't matter the size of the company.  I've expanded my job search and have even been applying for warehouse positions to just get my foot in the door and prove my worth but I don't even get responses from them either.  I just don't really know how else to put myself out there.  I see ""entry level"" jobs and I apply to them and don't get a response and a month later I still see that same position available.  I'm getting really frustrated and I don't want to give up but I don't know what to do.  I've talked to some people in the industry and they've been great with giving me advice but don't have any leads on jobs/internships.

I know that this is really long and I appreciate any advice that anyone has.  I don't want to start looking for a different career path but the lack of responses from companies has started getting me really down.

Thanks in advance"

I'm a good programmer, but  I find all my classes in Comp Sci either boring or extremely difficult.  I can't stand math based classes, barely managed to pass Calc 2 and am struggling in Discrete Mathematics now.

The only classes I've enjoyed that I've taken in college are philosophy or sociology classes.  However my cumulative GPA is shit(2.1) so I can't really change majors to anything that requires grad school.  All the internships I've looked at for the upcoming summer have a requirement of at least 2.8, so I won't be able to get an internship in the coming summer.

I currently owe $21,000 in student loans.  I don't know what I'll do if I decide not to continue college, but I feel like I'm digging myself a deeper and deeper hole and not going into a field that I'll really enjoy.  I enjoy problem solving but I'd be more interested in a field with more creativity.

I feel trapped, I can't drop out and I don't even know if I'll even be able to get a job if I continue at college.  I wish I could just start college fresh again, but that's not really an option."

I started working back in 2009 as a Junior Derivatives Trader in a Top Tier Investment Bank (18 months fixed term contract).
It ended in December 2010 when the job market was still really hard, so I had to make a career change and work as a front office developer, mainly in VBA and C# for the past years.

Today, I want to switch back to an algorithmic trader position in an Investment Bank or a Hedge Fund, and I am wondering how can I find my path to this role.
Money is not a problem, so I am thinking about going back to school, for another Msc or an MBA, or even a PhD.
I am also considering applying for an internship in an algorithmic trading desk or any other entry role.

Anyway, If you have experienced a similar situation or you have a deep knowledge of the current job market in the US or London, I'd really appreciate it if you could comment and give me your thoughts and advice =)


**TL;DR :** 

I'm 30 with a Msc in Math, and experience as a Trader and Developer (C#, VBA, SQL).
I want to work as an algorithmic trader. What should I do ?

1. PhD

2. Another Msc, MBA and start over with an associate Program in an Investment Bank
3. Learn R language, Machine Learning, etc... then maybe start with an internship
4. Anything else ?

Your help is greatly appreciated ! =)"

They wanted me back for a third rotation, but I resigned before my expected start date this January. I did my co-op in software testing. I recently interviewed and got an internship offer from a company that is far better than where I co-oped but it is for Q&amp;A testing. Should I accept the offer, even though it is not really what I wanted to do, at this better company? They'll be paying me almost double the hourly wage that I was getting for my co-op. 

If I accepted this position, that'd be two software testing positions on my resume. Does that put me at a disadvantage when I graduate in a year and a half and want to apply for development positions?

To summarize: Do I accept the new offer from the superior company? Will I be at a disadvantage when applying to development positions later when most of my experience is in testing?

I worked as a software dev intern for the last two years of my schooling and have been a developer since.  I had very strong references from my employment and wrote excellent essays.

Its surprising that they overlooked the low undergrad gpa.  Judging from the last year it seems alot of people who were very qualified and despite my expectations I applied anyways.  This might signify that they are trying to expand and therefore allowing more people to matriculate."

Just some background on me. I am 22, I work a 9-5 M-F job with a high interest in Computers (Web Technology, Hardware Building etc) and video games.

Just like most teenagers, I grew up with video games and it's now my main source of entertainment. There is nothing wrong with playing video games right?...right? 

My father said to me ""You are getting to old for games"" when I was around 13 or so as it was ""for babies"". I ignored him... He is old fashioned and thinks they are a waste of time. 

As I got older, I started to get into computer more and working with servers and learning different technologies. To this day, I still love it as well as Video Games.

Anyway, fast forward to about June of this year, I got a internship at a shop where I am working Monday to Friday, 9 till 5. While, I absolutely love it...I fear going home now. Every evening when I get home, is just misery, negativity and I just need away from it all.

I will admit, I play video games in the evening for a while, while also working on computers (I do a small bit of freelancing) and managing a couple of websites. 

Tonight, a carer for my grandfather (Who has Motor Neuronopathy) was talking to my father and I about a trip that I am about to go on.

I explained to him that I was going over for my birthday and a games festival (Specifically, Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest). The carer asked me if I was ""into video games"". I didn't have time to respond quick enough for my dad to jump in and say ""He plays all the time. From the moment he gets home from his so-called job, he plays games all night and maybe decides to go to bed for a couple of hours and then goes back to his ""job"" (finger quotes here). He is never fucking off it"".

The last thing that I do is ever argue with my dad because ""He is always right"". He would have embarrassed me and make fun of me in front of the carer.

I have had enough! (Wow, I am even tearing up writing this post). I am not going to London on Monday just for my birthday or JUST the festival...but to get away from him. He is driving up the fucking walls. 

He is only fucking worried if he has enough of cigarettes in the house.

I am really considering making the London trip a ""one-way"" and never come back to Ireland again! 

:(

EDIT: I never really explained about the lies part, but he has a tendency of lying to me, to family and friends about me and make me feel like shit...."
2jjs3r,238,2014-10-17,So I`m 6 months into my first programming job,eriken,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2jjs3r/so_im_6_months_into_my_first_programming_job/,"Hello.

This is a post about my background and the lessons I have accumulated over the past 6 months. It might be abit lenghty, but it´s friday and I´ve had a few energy drinks.

Two years ago I was in a job I hated. I worked as a social case worker. I had a bachelors degree in social science, a degree I realised had been a huge mistake. I had just turned thirthy and I felt I was far from where I thought I would be at thirthy.

Up to this point in life I had never made a true concioucs choice about what I wanted to do in life, everything had sort of just happend. Atleast that´s what it felt like. Anyway, I needed a plan. A plan that would please me and not everyone around me. What did I really enjoy apart from sex and basketball? Well I was allways good with computers. I used make money helping people in my neighbourhood fixing computers. I even made a cataloging system in Access 97 for a friend of my mothers.


Actually I had done more than that, I had made a few web sites with php &amp; mysql, I had made a Quake 3 server browser with Visual Basic and I took a intro course in Java at my University for extra points. 

It became surprisingly obvious that I should just become a programmer. Ofcourse! *But, dude, you´re gonna be that old creepy guy at the University..* Oh shut up!

So I quit my job, best day since my first blowjob, enlisted at the University and got a parttime job that didn´t suck too much. You guessed right; psych ward assistant. 

As I had made my desicion over the summer I was too late to apply for the degree programs so I just picked courses as they became available; Intro to Programming and Intro to databases. I was top in my class, I was motivated and I didn´t party. Next semester I picked Intro to programming part 2, annother database course and some descrete mathematics. Smooth sailing. But I soon realised that since I was not on a degree program there were certain obligatory courses I did not have access too. Hence it would take 3 more years before I could finish the degree. I would be 33 years before I was done. I knew I could get through the curriculum alot faster if it wasn´t for the god damn bureaucracy.

One of my closest friends is a programmer. He told me to drop out and study for myself, he said as long as I had a portifolio that was all that mattered, tech companies care very little for degrees. We made a curriculum and a time frame and I made my living room into a study hall. 

Over the next year I made a podcast manager in Qt, hello pointers. I made a chat server and client also in Qt, hello socket programming. I made a backup system with sync, written in Python and Go. The last project was not a coincidence, my friend who helped me out works for a backup company. And one day his boss told everyone to keep an eye out for an intern, they needed a monkey for all those small tasks that were piling up. 

Apart from fucking up the algorithm task at the interview, it went quite smooth, I kept pushing that I had a passion for this and that this was basicly what I had done the last two years, sitting in my living room coding. 3 days later I got a call, I was given a 60 % postion with little pay. I screamed yes.

My first task was to fix a legacy system for resizing image files. It was roughly 3 000 lines of python. I implemented a new processing library for more functionality, an integration to their new filestore, statistics through Statsd and Graphite and logging through Logstash and Kibana. I worked 60 hour weeks in a 60 % position for 2 months. New task; make our task scheduler modular. Here´s Quartz and Spring, you know Java right? Sure.
1 month later, done. Boss says; ""good, I think we need to bump you to a 100 % position, also here´s a a few more dollars per hour, good job so far"". Next project; a distributed checksum checker for corrupt files. Here are sharded database clusters and Redis, have fun with Go routines en masse.

Today, I commited my last set of code before release on monday. And tomorrow I´m buying myself a brand new MBP 15 inch. I have earned it.

So, do I have a lesson? If you have passion, if you have dedication, if you have a sense of desperation and if you have great friends and contacts you can make your life alot less sucky. 

I also want to thank this subreddit. It is an awesome place for anyone trying to master this profession. My favourite subreddit."

A job has now popped up at another video game studio for a position that really want and need.

My question is how should I go about this to really stand out? So far I have 4 options in mind. 


1. Apply normally.

2. Call, ask to speak to the HR person handling it to and ask some questions about the position to try and ''stand out'' (which I did for my internship to show I was/am really passionate about this)

3. Get in touch with a contact person from this company, which is one of my mentor from my internships ex coworkers from when he worked at there and ask him who to contact about it/his advice on how to apply to the position. 

4. Get in touch with the dude I would be working under, who is friends with both my mentor and another close coworkers from my internship and send my CV and stuff to him. 

5. Ask my mentor and coworker who know the guy I would be working for/a lot of people at the company to use them as my references, apply for the job, then call and ask some questions about the position such as when it starts and so on. 

Or maybe something else?

Maybe I am over thinking it, but I really need and want this job so I want to go about this in the best way possible since I have connections for the first time in my life. 

Thanks!"

Recently I was offered a 4 month internship at a medium sized company, expenses only with a heavy implication of a full time position at the end (quotes like ""we're looking to train someone for a long-term position"", ""need someone on a permanent basis"" etc) I was SO excited and felt like I'd finally been given a big opportunity for my first real job. 

I've enjoyed it immensely - the people are great, the work is great and I've been treated like an employee rather than an intern. Last week, I set up a ""progress meeting"" with my boss so I could ask whether there was potential for a full time job. At that point, whenever there were talks about future projects I was always included in those plans even if they were after the end date of my internship. 

Before the meeting she announces to everyone that they're hiring someone for a position which has responsibilities similar to my own. I was completely shocked, as before hearing this I genuinely believed I had a real chance of being offered a job. Later on, my fears were confirmed that although I've been doing a great job and they'd love to hire me, they're unable to take me on. Nothing personal, they just can't afford two new people. 

I'm crushed. I was so hopeful that after all these months of stress I was finally going to land a job. It's been a very difficult year as I've moved thousands of miles away from my family whom I miss everyday. I've had to move house twice in very last-minute stressful situations and I spent most of this internship working two jobs which took a big toll on me emotionally.

I know that as an intern I'm not entitled to a job offer. This post is just to vent because I felt completely blindsided. I had no clue that they were hiring someone else (apparently it was already decided before I even came along), and I have the impression that if I'd never approached them they would have waited until the very last day to tell me I didn't have a job. 

I've already started job hunting and I'm really grateful for the experience that this internship has given me, so it's not as if all hope is lost. I'm just feeling really upset, and I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced this situation, and how it turned out for them?"

-I've been sexually attracted to my mother since I was 12 years old. I have never told anyone and never will. It's always made me feel like a bad/disgusting person and I'm not a psychiatrist but I would guess that this is the main reason why I don't have the ability to start a relationship with a woman. When you have a stigmatized perversion like this you never truly fit in anywhere and feel like an impostor. I have friends but they don't really know what I am. 

-A big reason why I have not committed suicide already is because my older sister already did. She was bipolar. It crushed my parents and my younger brother so badly that I promised myself that I would not do the same. That was 5 years ago. I still think about her all the time. Her death permeates every facet of my life. 

-A year ago I found child pornography on my dad's computer accidentally. Internet connection was slow, so I go onto his laptop and up pops this site of ""non-nude child models"". It was some brazilian site with scantily-clad little girls in risque positions. I closed it and never said a word. Until that point I had had a wonderful relationship with my father, which was good since I'm all fucked up when it comes to my mom. My dad was my rock and always supportive and I loved him dearly and now that image of him as become tarnished and rocked my world even further. 

-I finally graduated college and got an internship but I hate it. Everyone there is much older than me. I fucking hate sports and think they're boring 90% of the time so I have fucking NOTHING to talk about or connect with anyone except very superficial stuff. The job is mediocre at about $48-52k/year, has bad hours, weekend work and people in my department are looked down upon. Morale is bad in by department with the poor management. Many people I shadow don't bother to cover up their jadedness and openly whine to me all day about how much they don't like their job. I don't know what to do about grad school/finding a better job since I want to move out. I think moving out could help some of my problems but frankly I cannot find anything feasible to pursue in grad school that I would enjoy. I stumbled into this career path on accident in the first place. 

I look forward to nothing in my life right now. I try to numb myself with books, movies, and video games and only further isolate myself apart from hanging out with my 3 friends here and there. I cannot imagine starting a family since I don't how the fuck I'm gonna find a girl that's okay with dating a 28 year old virgin who's never been in a relationship. People online say virginity isn't a big deal but that's only because they're on the outside looking it. It IS a big deal at my age. It's an immediate redflag that I'm fucked up, socially retarded, impotent, or just a flat-out loser. 

I'm completely alone, unable to confide these things in anyone. Not that I ever would. I could not bring myself to even tell a professional about these things. I don't want to kill myself but I fucking hate my life right now. It just gets worse every year. 

I'm starting to get to the point where I won't even care if I hurt people by offing myself. So what if my pedophile dad mourns me? Do I really have a great enough relationship with my friends that they wouldn't be over it in a year or two? 

I just have a knot of hatred, humiliation, fear about the future, debilitating self-pity, and despair lodged deep in my fucking guts. This is why people put shotguns to their face and make themselves unrecognizable. I get it now. 

But I'm here. I don't just want to wallow in self-pity forever. I made it through college, I got a job even if it's shitty, I've had a good friendship with my 2 buddies since middle school, I love my pet even though she's getting old and won't be with me soon, there are books/movies/video games I want to enjoy even if they're a childish waste of time, I think I can someday put all this pain into my art for other people and I still want to find someone I can love.

A spider on the curtains. A spider on my shoe. One tiny, black spider. I wasn’t afraid of spiders, I never was. Until I started to see them everywhere. My world was made out of spiders. Some were bigger than others, some had a different colour. I saw the spiders everywere. I thought I lost my mind. I’ve told people, that I saw spiders. No one else saw them. No one. They looked at me like I was crazy. They’ve asked if I ever killed one. I told them I didn’t. But I have killed one. Once. I’ve had nightmares for a week, involving spiders.
It started with a spider. Then I had to visit a doctor. The spiders were crawling out of my skin. I could see and feel them. Sometimes I could even hear them. They started talking to me. They told me that everyone was after me. Everyone wanted me dead. They told me to do things to other people. Horrible things, like tackling an old lady or punching a kid  in the face. 
The doctor was very worried. He asked me for how long this has been going on. I could feel that he didn’t believe me. The spider behind him on the wall was huge. Almost the biggest one I have ever seen. Only the spider from my nightmares was bigger. I wanted to ask the doctor if he didn’t see the spider behind him. The spider told me to shut up. The doctor wouldn’t believe me. He thought I was insane, just like everyone else. The spiders were my only friends.

The doctor gave me some medicine. He would send someone to my house everyday to make sure I took them. Elise came. Elise told me she was a nurse. She was sweet. She believed me. I told her that I was afraid of the pills. How much I distrust the world. She told me I should take a pill. She told me how they worked. That they started working within half an hour. That she would stay that long. Elise stayed half an hour. I took the pill. When I noticed my fear for the pills was unnecessary, I was relieved. Elise asked me  if she could leave. She told me her colleague would come this evening, because I have to take a pill every twelve hours to keep the spiders away. She would come back the next day.

Elise came back the next morning. She asked me how I was, if her colleague was nice to me. I told her everything was fine. Then I saw him. The man. On the other side of the street stood a man. I had never seen him before in my life. He wore sunglasses and a black suit. His head was bald. He shouldn’t have worn those sunglasses. It was a very cloudy morning. Elise could tell that I was feeling uneasy. She told me I should take  my pill. Then I noticed. The mark on her wrist. Elise lied to me. She was one of thém. One of the people the spiders warned me for. Théy wanted me dead. I started to scream and pushed Elise away. She tried to grab me but I pushed her away from me. I locked my door and flushed the pills. That I could be fooled this easy. I sat down in my kitchen, underneath the window. Shortly after, I heard voices. They came for me. The man with the sunglasses stood near the window. I could feel him. He was talking to someone. Then they opened the door.
Two men came in. They had a stretcher with them. They told me they were nurses. They would like to take me with them, because they didn’t think I was safe here. They were very calm and polite. Until I noticed the mark. I stood up and wanted to flee, but they were faster. They gave me a shot.

Now I am here. In this house, or whatever it is. There are all sorts of crazy people here. They kidnapped me. They want to turn me into one of thém. One of the people the spiders warned me for. 
I haven’t seen a single spider since I’m here. I kind of miss them. They made me feel safe. Now I don’t know who to trust.
They made me talk to a shrink. The lady only looked at me and nodded. After three times I stopped talking. I don’t speak to anyone anymore.

This morning there was a new girl. Her name is Susan. She has blonde hair and blue eyes. She has an ugly skin. She told me she was an intern. Susan doesn’t have a mark. Everyone else does. I talk to Susan. I tell her to be careful, to trust no one. Everyone wants to harm her, and she has to watch out for the man with the sunglasses. Susan listens, she believes me.

Until one morning. Susan doesn’t show up to me. Tanja does. She starts to ask about all the things I told Susan. I trusted Susan. I get angry. I get so angry and start to scream. I see the man with the sunglasses standing in front of the window. He smiles at me. It is not a friendly smile. I start to scream louder. Tanja walks away. Soon she returns with a man and a woman. The woman pulls out a syringe and a bottle.  I try to hit it out of her hands but Tanja and the man hold me tight. The woman empties the syringe in my arm. I go limp and can’t stand anymore. My voice won’t work either. 

They drag me trough the hallway. I see Susan. She looks scared and upset. All I can do is look at her. I want her to feel guilty. 
Suddenly, I see a giant spider showing up from behind the wall. He walks towards Susan. She doesn’t see anything, she doesn’t notice. The spider opens his jaws and bites of her head.

I’m not scared. I know the spider is my only friend. The spiders have always been my only friends. 
While they drag me trough the hallway, I feel nothing but satisfaction. They open my cell and drag me to a bed in the middle of the room. There are thousands of spiders. They are everywhere. They all watch silently as they put me on the bed. There is a small smile on my face when I notice the giant spider in the doorway.  He smiles at me. Then he spits out very familiar sunglasses. He walks over to Tanja and the man. He opens his jaws and crushes their heads. I can’t do anything but smile.
I hear someone scream and close my eyes.

It started with a spider. It also ends with one.

Is this true and, if so, what the hell do I say in the message?

If the profs at my school are any indication, they would just be annoyed at receiving an email from some random person.

What do you think?

Keep in mind that I've done my homework with respect to the faculty, labs, and programs to which I am applying.  I have an excellent GPA, a couple of good research projects, and a couple of semi-reasonable internships.  In case its relevant, I'm CompE from Canada.

Thanks in advance! Also, if you have any other advice, I'd love to hear it.

[These are my github repos for reference](https://github.com/dkanellis). 

The main way I preferred acquiring knowledge was through books since I found them to be extensive and providing more than beginner knowledge.

Specifically I have read these books thus far:

* Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
* Java A Beginner's Guide
* Some of: Pro JPA 2
* Some of: Cracking the Coding Interview

My goal is to acquire as much professional knowledge as I can. I want to make my projects look professional therefore allowing me to have a better chance at job interviews for internships or even graduate jobs.

What I want is to acquire very good knowledge in making efficient, professional and clean code. *Clean Code* provided me with very good tools but now I need something more oriented towards Class Design.

**My question is:** How should I go from here? Is there any good book that you could recommend me to help me with good class design or is there something entirely different that I should be doing. Personally I was thinking of starting to read *Java: The Complete Reference*."

2jpzla,36,2014-10-19,How to Succeed in Undergrad: A Brief Guide for Freshmen and Prospective Students.,dat_cake,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2jpzla/how_to_succeed_in_undergrad_a_brief_guide_for/,"Hello all, I am a graduating senior and would like to share my knowledge of how to be successful in undergrad. This comes from my own personal experience and the experience and advice of my peers. This is intended for prospective engineering students and freshmen. Hopefully this helps you plan out your classes and long-term goals.


__Freshman Year:__

Make friends! Come to class with a positive attitude every day, and have an open mind. Join clubs, and try to get involved with a long-term extra curricular (music organizations, professional societies, etc) to increase your chances of having leadership positions further down the road. 

Study hard. Freshmen with high GPAs have substantially better chances of getting early internships and research positions. Freshman year is really the only time GPA alone matters, because you likely don't have any experience yet.

Summer after Freshman Year:
Internships are unlikely at this point, but by all means pursue one. If you can't get real world experience like this, then take a summer class or two at a community college to get ahead. Each class you take over the summer is one less you have to take during the year, which means you have more time to devote to your extra-curriculars. Try to work a part time job too, even if its delivering pizzas.



__Sophomore Year:__

Continue to hit the books and stay involved. By now you will have a better understanding of your skills and interests. Try to get involved with research or a part-time job relevant to engineering, such as doing drafting work or tutoring.

This summer your priorities are:

1. Internship

2. Studying Abroad

3. Doing research with faculty (if you have high GPA and interest in research)

4. Taking Classes.

Options 1 and 3 will greatly increase your chance of landing an internship next summer.



__Junior Year:__

By now you should be prepared to take on leadership roles in your extra curriculars. Junior year is also the hardest in terms of coursework for most disciplines. You need to land an internship or more formal research position in the summer, so make this your first priority.

Junior Year summer:
It is pretty much expected that you have an internship or some other research experience if you want to be a competitive applicant for a job or grad school after you graduate. Make getting an internship a top priority during the school year. If you can't land an internship, its not the end of the world. Try pursing volunteer activities or continue working your part time job if you have one.

(By research I mean formal programs like NSF Research Experiences for Undergrads, NIST, etc.)



__Senior Year:__

Very open-ended. Many people take an extra semester or two because of co-ops or wanting to space out their class schedule if they can afford the extra tuition. Taking an extra year is perfectly fine just so long as its not because you were failing classes (but you gotta do what you gotta do). Focus on your senior project (if you have one) and networking for a job. If you want to go to graduate school, be aware that most applications are due mid-December and require a great deal of preparation.


Hopefully this helps those of you who aren't really sure what it takes to be successful and helps to filter out any bad info you may be getting. Feel free to comment or PM me with questions.

EDIT - 

This is by no means a list of requirements! Like I mentioned in the comments, this is a sort of ""best case scenario"" of what an undergrad engineering experience would be. I've combined and summarized everything I've learned from professors, advisors, and recruiters on what an outstanding undergraduate career is.

Thanks for reading, and best of luck!"
2jq5ki,6,2014-10-19,GRE Scores -- Try Again?,betabot,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2jq5ki/gre_scores_try_again/,"Hey,

I just got done with my second attempt at the GRE, and my scores are really starting to concern me. I have a 162 verbal and 162 quantitative. The rest of my application is fairly strong I believe.

Context:

- Strong LORs (including one from a leading researcher in my area of interest)

- Decent research (~7 publications with lead authorship)

- Some industry (internship at Microsoft, upcoming internship at Google)

- Decent GPA from state school (3.73)

I'm planning to apply to the top 5 CS grad schools for a PhD in Computer Science/Robotics.

Do you think I should invest the time and money to take the GRE again? I'm willing to take it a few more times if necessary, but there may be diminishing returns at this point. What do you think?"
2jq6wn,20,2014-10-19,"As a soon-to-be-graduated CS undergrad without internship experience, what should I be looking for?",AdrianCRUNK,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jq6wn/as_a_soontobegraduated_cs_undergrad_without/,"So I switched into CS from a completely unrelated field (architecture) and have spent my summers taking classes in order to play catch-up and graduate as soon as possible. My CS friends were getting summer internships but I didn't have enough time. I didn't really think anything of it though; once I was done with school I would just get a software engineering job like everyone else - maybe not at the big tech companies, but somewhere worthwhile.

But I failed to realize the enormous impact that an internship makes in terms of skill development and networking. Everyone I talk to in career fairs either has had at least one internship or is an underclassman looking for one. I went to a resume workshop, and the recruiter I talked to was visibly dismayed by my lack of experience. He said that beyond a small personal project I was working on (and class projects, some of which I'm not too excited to show off), I didn't really have any ""cards in play"".

So with that in mind, is it appropriate for me to search for a full-time software engineering job? Or should I search for something smaller-scale? Alternatively, would it make sense to apply for internships this late in my studies? (I'm set to graduate Spring 2015.) Or should I look for other ways to develop my skills?"

2jqlai,4,2014-10-19,I’m a new CS graduate feeling very overwhelmed and worthless at my new job. Should I tell my employer to lower their expectations of me?,drizzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jqlai/im_a_new_cs_graduate_feeling_very_overwhelmed_and/,"Hello everyone,
 
I’m currently an new iOS dev with a top tier mobile shop in North America. I started about 6 weeks ago and have been deathly worried about my performance. Currently they have me on one project where I’m working with 2 other guys that work on the app from home. The first month was okay, as I was assigned pretty simple tasks that I could handle. However the last 2 weeks have been brutal. My project manager (one of the 2 guys) assigned me 2 issues that I’ve struggled with a ton. About a day or 2 into getting into them, I voiced my concern to him that I was pretty lost. He gave me a brief rundown of what “could” be going on, and then left me to figure out what was actually happening. So then over the next week and a bit, I went down a few routes that lead to no where, and chewed up a lot of time doing so.  

Then came the bombshell that freaked me out. One day I got into the office, I had a message from him telling me to “Pick up my pace” and that I should have both solutions done for by the afternoon. I ended up missing that deadline, submitting my buggy partial work and re-assigning the issues for him. This crushed me, as in both of my previous jobs as a dev intern I’ve never missed a deadline and was praised for my work. 

All of this being said, what do I do now? Should I tell my PM to lower his expectations of me (as I’m very new to this job, and no in-office mentor to go to)? Or should I keep quiet and keep struggling. I was thinking it might be a good idea to go the president (she was the one who interviewed and hired me) and explain my anxiety, but I don't know if that would help. 

I would love to hear what you guys think.

Thanks"
2jr0uz,40,2014-10-19,Still looking for a development job 6 months after school and getting killed by structures and algorithms among other things,upshaw87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jr0uz/still_looking_for_a_development_job_6_months/,"So I graduated from computer engineering back in April and I'm having a hell of a time finding a junior developer position. It's not like I'm not getting any interest from the applications I send in. I wouldn't say I have a crazy amount of callbacks, but, unless job postings slow down, I can get at least a couple calls a week usually. And the stereotypical HR or ""getting to know you"" interview is usually something I can get through pretty easily as well. 

The things that always trip me up are the technical interviews, specifically data structures and algorithms. To put this in context, I only took one class for those in my entire degree and never really touched them ever again in any other class or my internship. I don't know how if it's similar for software engineering or computer science majors, but I don't feel like I know a whole lot in that area. I can be presented with a problem that is probably pretty basic, but it will take me forever to find a solution if I ever do.

For instance, in one interview I was asked to check the number of unique characters in a string without using any other structures. I came up with an initial solution in short enough time but then realized that it wouldn't work. Took me another 5 to 10 minutes to realize the actual solution. I got to it myself, but it still took me way too long. On top of that I completely borked the other producer-consumer question.

In another interview I was asked to do a code review on a C# class that essentially searched through a bunch of text files for occurrences of a certain string. The code they gave me searched every single file character by character for matches to the input. While it would work, it's obviously woefully inefficient as the amount of data increases. They asked me to suggest some optimizations though and I had no idea beyond ""you may not need to search the entire file"". There was another question where I coded a search algorithm, they again asked for optimization suggestions and I again had very few suggestions when I should have. After the interview I tried thinking more about the optimizations and came up with way better answers, but that doesn't really matter because I couldn't do it in the moment. I ended up getting called in for a face to face interview with that company this week so I must have done something right, but it's still bothering me a lot and leaving me nervous that I'm going to get hammered in what's going to be a 2-3 hour interview.

In the last two weeks or so I've really started working through some Project Euler and Cracking the Coding Interview problems when I finally realized this was a huge problem. I'm not sure that it's enough though. I feel like I've got these huge holes in my knowledge and where there aren't holes there's rust or inexperience. With CTCI, for instance, I'm currently stuck on binary trees. I've used BSTs before, but it's been almost two years and I have to do a lot of refreshing. We never even touched Red-Black, AVL etc. though, so I haven't a clue about them. I'm not bad with worst case time complexity of algorithms, but average case just eludes me because we never really practised it. Those are just a few examples.

I'm not trying to say that I don't know anything about programming at all because I'm well aware that I do. It's just that when I look at other people they generally seem way more competent than me. The worst part is that there is a certain amount of truth to that and I don't know how much. I have no idea if I'm actually a terrible developer given my lack of knowledge in certain areas or not and if I'm fucked for finding a decent job in this industry.

I think this turned into more of a ramble than I wanted, but does anyone have any advice or insights? I doubt my abilities and potential more and more as this search goes on longer and longer."

i can code reasonable HTML5, CSS3, PHP, and MySQL primarily using Laravel, which i understand a lot of. i am able to throw together a CRUD app for a joke database in about a day with responsive design. i can use the various features of laravel (Eloquent, Blade, etc) comfortably with the laravel docs lying around, and feel very comfortable with the command line.

i get sql injection and how to avoid it, i understand OOP, and i can use enough javascript/jquery to fiddle with a google maps, hide divs, use ajax, animations, delay links, etc.

i can use sql to do a belongs to, has one, many-to-many with pivot table, etc. i can use joins on sql tables but still find this tricky.


im travelling and working on personal projects right now, but i would like to apply for jobs in 2 months. i will continue on the path im on.

is there anything specific i havent mentioned i should know before interning? i have absolutely no photoshop/illustrator skills, but i honestly dont even like doing this stuff."

I've been working here for a little over three months now. (Prior to this I'd only had one three-month internship during college.) Before I came along, the other junior dev was tasked with pretty much everything and had to work with a codebase that was written by another junior employee who, it turns out, had quit not too long ago. And recently our boss hired two new devs, one of whom is still in college and the other with less than a year of schooling and maybe the same amount of experience time.

The project we're working on is poorly documented and architected, which drives me NUTS, and every time this comes up in meetings the boss kind of just dismisses our concerns and says we'll refactor stuff later. Of course the priority is to get the app out the door as soon as possible, and I get that, but I feel like not addressing maintainability issues while we're already aware of them is gonna backfire on us later. 

My main concern is that I don't feel like this is the best environment for me to get better as a developer. I don't have much confidence in the boss or in the product and it's kind of worrying me. Our boss/project manager works on something totally different and outright admits he doesn't really know how to help whenever we come to him with a problem. The developers I work with aren't that much better either--I mean, most of us are relatively inexperienced, and one of them tends to code solo without any regard for how his features are going to get integrated into the app, i.e. his code isn't modular or even readable at times. And he works so fast that he just goes from feature to feature without any review because the rest of us are too busy with our own work.

Wouldn't the boss benefit from hiring someone more experienced to sort of rein everybody in and guide the project, since he himself doesn't really know anything about the stack we work with? Right now it feels like the blind leading the blind and it's a total motivation killer. Is this actually normal for small companies? What's the best thing to do in this situation?"

On one hand, I'm very enticed by the specs and design of the Y50, and ESPECIALLY its reported cool temperature even when gaming. However, I've heard nothing but horror stories about its apparently piss-poor non-IPS display. Is it truly that bad, such that I'd have to shell out an extra 90$ for an IPS display? Or are there newer Y50 builds with IPS screens?

On the other hand, the ASUS one has a whopping 16GB of RAM (not like I'll ever use all that much), and a better screen. However, it is reported to be rather uncomfortably warm while gaming. I don't always have access to a desk (long trips to internships and back, as well as habit), so I usually work on my laptop upon my lap, on a train or bus. Is the heat intolerable, by anyone's experience, or can it be ignored for the most part?

2jrnfb,1,2014-10-20,I'm planning it.,justathrowaway90890,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2jrnfb/im_planning_it/,"I feel like my life is empty ... everyday all the time. Since I was young, It was very hard to make friends, because I was bullied and made fun of at a young age. So naturally, that kind of made it hard for me to trust people, or connect with them somehow, at least. So growing up, not so many friends. I'm 23, and have none. none ... and I'm over it. I have put myself out there. I have called people who I've worked with and tried to set up times to hang out. No one calls back, no one texts me, nothing. This has happened for years. I've just accepted that I'm somehow meant to be a lonely person. That naturally, I've got some sort of essence that subconsciously tells others to not hang out with me. 
Next, my ex-boyfriend is toying with me again. We broke up over a year and a half ago, and he contacts me every couple months to say hi. We end up talking for a week on average before I come to my senses and tell him to go away forever again. He doesn't though. And it hurts every time because he just wants to talk. Just talk. And it's like- I'm not here to be your friend. I wanted to be your GF, but you proved way too irresponsible and didn't have the same priorities as I did. He's 8 years older than me, and still lives at home. You read correct. Some parts more than other parts of me want to be with him still, and it kills me inside. Because despite his extreme short comings- he's the only person I've ever gotten along with so well, who can make me laugh, and who can actually want to ' hang out ' with me. I kind of adore hearing about his day and care about whats going on in his life. Does he for me ... I'm not sure. Sometimes I barely get a word in before he cuts me off to make a joke. I'm making him sound like some pathetic jerk- which he can be sometimes. 
Next, after four years with my ex, I broke it off for good ( we broke up once in between those four years for 4 months ), and moved away to go to school to pursue a field I want to work in. I've finished school and too totally complete it, I must do an internship. I moved again to another city, and it's been 3 months since I moved and I still have not found an internship. This worries me greatly. If I don't find an internship soon and complete my hours, I can kiss my degree goodbye. School was expensive, and I've struggled in school for years, but I worked hard and got through the school work and tests and proficiencies and presentations and blah blah blah. Should I have moved to this city? I don't know anymore...There is work - but it's tough to burst into. Only because it's professional city, where they want the best of the best. Not some out of school intern. 
Next, I'm rooming with 3 other girls in a house. I had my own apartment before - which I was grateful for having - but I'm not adjusting well to having to share a room with one of them. The three of them share the same religion, and I'm the odd one out, they don't know that of course. The one I share the room with is the overly extremist religious girl. Everything is about church, "" Heavenly Father"", and all her friends that are also overly religious. I. can't. stand. it. Lately I have just been ignoring her all together- which yes- makes it a bit awkward but I don't care anymore. She runs her mouth like she's on speed. And it's all about her of course. It all goes back to her and God and blah blah blah. GAH.... So I'm having a very hard time adjusting. 
Next... Guys are always complaining about how they can't get a girl. Well ... I can't seem to get a guy. I have never been asked out, never been told I'm pretty or attractive, and I barely get glanced at. It. Sucks. I want to be with some one I can hold, and make happy, and have deep conversations about life, and share passion. I crave it. It makes me sad- because I feel like- who wants me...?
Theres more to it though. 
Next, about a year ago I got diagnosed with a well known disease. I won't say what it is, but there is no cure for it, and basically, the quality of my life is just slowly deteriorating. I have not fully accepted this and am still in huge denial. I have to remind myself that I have this disease if I have a symptom occur. It goes back to finding a partner... who wants someone who has a disease that eventually will over come them? No one wants that.
I have no friends and have a very hard time making them if I ever do. I still love my ex, but know he's not good for me, and yet my emotions still get in the way of wanting him back ( even to the point of considering moving back to my home town to reconcile with him), internship is rough...I have not found one yet and am getting worried school might just buckle for me, and I have no one to love... and a disease that I shouldn't have to deal with.

All this sound temporary except for a few things I know, but I don't know how much longer I can take of it. My life is so empty... there is no fun or joy in any activity that I do. Even if I get motivated to do something, after a while I just stop caring about it and ditch it. Like... there is no point almost. No matter what I do... I'm still sad, unhappy, gloomy... And it's been like this at least since I was 15. I've been to therapists and psychologists, I've gotten ""help"" ( AKA been on pills and talked to therapists before eventually dipping out because they weren't really helping me). I hate to sound like nothing is good enough for me, but that's basically what it's coming out to be like. And it's not that at all ... I just want purpose. And I've been searching for it for years now.

I'm planning on driving out to the ocean and taking my gun. And if you read all that... thank you... "
2jrrc3,10,2014-10-20,VLSM for a school project,floorfiLLa,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2jrrc3/vlsm_for_a_school_project/,"Hi,

I'm actually a student in IT security &amp; administration, and I have to achieve a big project for the end of the year.

This project involve building from scratch the whole network of a university, which means - among others - to determine the adressing plan for the campus and his remote sites.

My team is facing an intern schism, and we all have a different opinion on the subject. 
Actually, we have multiple equipments to adress, here is the non exhaustive list :

- PC (installed in classrooms for example)
- BYOD PC (brought by teachers for example)
- Printers
- TOIP terminals 
- Servers
- Wi-Fi hotspots
- Management network (for switch &amp; routers)
- Security equipments (fingerprint access reader, security cam...)

So as you can see, our question is, what is the best way to determine our adressing plan? 

If we take a /8 for example ;

10.0.0.0

The second octet would be for the localization of the equipment, the third would be for the type of the equipment ?

Or should we use a more generalist adressing plan, without localization distinction ?

In terms of sizing, we aim for a total of 5k students/teachers on site, which mean we will have to think about the future and the growth of the campus...

We just wanted to have your point of view on the topic, and if already of you have already been concerned by this kind of problematic. 

Thanks !

TLDR; We need a professionnal point of view on a school project topic"

I was hoping someone could just look through my profile and help me out? I've been a bit of a train-wreck over the past month worrying about this. I'd really appreciate it. I'm applying to a Masters in Computer Science and my primary focus would be AI.


* I gave my GRE in August and got a **327** (167Q, 160V, 4.5AWA). 


* My GPA hasn't been great. India uses a percentage system so I have a 60% over the past 3 years. Problem is I have to re-appear for the finals of both my Microprocessors and Advanced Microprocessors classes. **Edit: For reference, the highest percentage (for the class of 2015) is 75%.**


My explanation for my GPA is that the entire curriculum here is based on rote memorization. I don't know how this comes across as but I feel rather strongly about this. It doesn't feel like anybody is ever actually learning anything.


* I've been conducting various workshops and seminars in college over the past 1.5 years. Webdev basics, Basics of Game AI, Introduction to Git etc. Does this add to my application significantly?


* I expect to get good recommendation letters from my college professors. One of the professors whom I've approached expressed his surprise that I hadn't been doing well in my exams because he considered me to be one of the best students in his class. But he's still more than happy to write a letter for me.

* There's some other stuff that I have. Personal projects, project head for a CS committee. Participated in a bunch of hackathons, managed to secure a college-high rank (300 globally, previous best was 650) just this past weekend. A remote internship.

---------------------------------


**TL;DR:** 327 GRE, academics aren't great (according to the Indian grading system), teaching experience, a bunch of personal projects, hackathons participation. Can manage funding by myself. Chances?


---------------------------------

Questions:

1) Should I mention the reason for my poor GPA in my statement of purpose?


2) Should I email any professors from universities that I plan on applying to? Does this benefit my application?

---------------------------------

**Edit 2:** Read previous posts about this but we use a different system here (the highest anybody has ever gotten in the grading system's history is probably an 80%) so I don't know how to judge those posts."

Most of my experience is C/C++ for embedded and real time systems, Python for desktop apps, and JavaScript for the usual web stuff. I’ve recently decided that I want to work in data analytics for healthcare and medicine. I’m particularly fascinated by genomics, so I feel like bioinformatics is the best fit.

I’m trying to decide on a good path to move forward. I feel like my biggest challenge is that even though my engineering fundamentals are strong, I have no domain experience. I want to participate in the field at a high level, having a deep understanding of the different science and technologies involved to help push the industry forward. I don’t want to just be a code monkey crunching somebody else’s data over and over.

I’m open to anything, whether it be teaching myself the necessary skills, starting my own company, going back to school, trying to get an internship or job where I can learn, doing volunteer work, etc.

The tentative plan I've come up with at this point is to try hard the next couple months to get an internship or job where they’re willing to train me in big data analytics, then harness that experience to move into something specific to bioinformatics then work my way up. If I can’t find something that’s a good fit, I’ll go back to school. I still have a couple years until I finish my bachelors. I’m planning to do a computer science or computer engineering degree, with some biology classes on the side (possibly try to minor). After that I would go to grad school for biotech or bioinformatics.

I’m looking for any general advice or suggestions. Thanks!

2jtdno,2,2014-10-20,Should I transfer back from UT Austin to UT Dallas?,dumebringer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jtdno/should_i_transfer_back_from_ut_austin_to_ut_dallas/,"Hey everyone, I've got a bit of a dilemma. I'm currently a CS student at UT Austin, and I really don't like it here.

For my freshman and sophomore years, I attended UT Dallas. I loved the classes, the location, and just the atmosphere in general. All of the professors that I had were very enthusiastic about teaching their students, and all of them really seemed to be striving to make UTD better. The classes were smaller, and I had a personal relationship with several of my professors.

This semester (first semester junior year), I transferred to UT Austin because I heard the degree holds a lot of weight. The thing is though, I really don't like it here. I don't like Austin, I don't care for the culture, and the professors and administration all have pretty much exact opposite attitude that the ones at UTD had. Here, it's more like a ""fuck you, you're lucky to even be here at this prestigious school"" attitude. My advisers haven't been helpful, and none of my professors really seem to care all that much about students on an individual level (in their defense, the classes are massive). To top it all off, they didn't even count a lot of my credits, so I'm retaking multiple courses here and my graduation has been pushed back by one or two semesters.

At UTD, I had a 3.87 GPA. Here, my GPA won't be terrible, but it won't be great. It's not that the classes are harder, it's just that they're more work, I'm less motivated because I'm constantly feeling down, and I'm even less motivated to be retaking classes that were difficult in the first place (I pulled off As initially, but I'm not sure if I will this time around).

At UTD, I'm closer to home, traffic isn't nearly as bad, and my fiance is there. I'm trying to make this decision without that in mind though, because I want what would be best for the long term, not just right now.

If I transfer back, I'll have wasted most of this semester, but I'm OK with that, because I'm gonna graduate late here anyway. I honestly feel like I was getting a better education at UTD, and I've never been happier than when I was there, but I just don't know what to do. I know UTD is well respected in the area, but I have no idea how everyone else sees them.

So basically, I don't know if a degree from UT with so-so grades would be better than a degree from UTD with great grades, and if so, then by how much. I know I'd be happier back at UTD, but I don't want to mess up my future. I also don't have very long to figure this out.

Also, money isn't an issue: I attended UTD with a full ride, so if they'd give it back (doubtful) that would be great, and if not I'm lucky that my father was in the military, so I'll have the Hazlewood Act to pay my way.

Anyway, I'm kind of rambling now, if you guys have any advice I would greatly appreciate it.


Edit: I just looked up some statistics, and it seems as though UT's starting salary is around $63k for new grads, and the average for UTD's engineering and computer science school (can't find just CS) is around $61k. I'm not sure about employment rates of UT's grads, but UTD's is around 89%. I guess UT could land me a more ""prestigious"" job, but I think there are more than enough opportunities for me at UTD (they helped me get an internship last summer and a research position during school as well). I'm *really* starting to lean more to UTD. And thank you guys for the responses, any feedback is still welcome."

I am currently 28 years of age. I am an American citizen (male) who spent two years in a foreign country getting a master's degree in an engineering discipline. My undergraduate degree was pre-medicine and engineering, but I hit a few bumps along the road during my undergrad career (mainly family issues), and as a result things didn't go as planned. Originally I wanted to go to medical school, but when it turned out it wasn't an option I had to explore other options. I wasn't completely sure if I even wanted a M.S. in the first place, but since jobs were a bit hard to come by, I applied, and when I got into one of the top universities in a particular country, I decided to just go for it.

For a number of reasons, after about a year, I started to have second thoughts. Maybe it was the fact that I was far from home, or maybe it was the fact that I just found my projects boring (my undergrad institution had delayed sending my transcripts, which made it impossible for me to enroll until halfway through the semester - funding had dried up and I was stuck on the sidelines). I considered quitting a few times but I either was afraid of facing ""failure"" or would figure that I was in too deep to quit and tried to force myself through it. Ended up being miserable and depressed for about six months, but eventually got my degree. The thing is that my thesis was pretty much half-assed and cobbled together from really shoddy data. To this day, I never felt that my thesis was all it could have been had I worked a bit harder.

During the following months, my advisor allowed me to return to the lab as an intern if I wanted to fix up my thesis.  I had the choice of leaving and returning to the States, but I felt that it would be an opportunity to redeem myself. Unfortunately, I couldn't really find the motivation to continue my work. Every day I felt apathetic and depressed going into the office.  My work was basically stalled for months, because for one reason or another I couldn't bear to see it anymore, but because I was at the same time kind of afraid to quit. Long story short, when about five months ago, my advisor called me up to provide a manuscript for a conference, I ended up making up quite a substantial amount of a data. More recently, my advisor tried to encourage me to turn the conference manuscript into a journal article, and even had one of the other professors in the department collaborate with it. Essentially I was forced to keep on perpetuating the made-up data.

Now, I know that this is quite a serious thing in academia. I deeply regret all the academic misconduct that I've done.  I had never really intended for it to turn out like this, but at the same time I was afraid that quitting prematurely would be admitting defeat or failure. Recently I quit my research/internship just because I felt burned out and couldn't deal with it anymore.

For the record, my advisor and my immediate supervisor haven't had the chance to go over the actual data and results, but now that I'm quitting, the project is getting transferred to one of my supervisors for further work.   They don't know that most of what I've done for about 6 or 7 months is essentially a lie, but still, I can't emphasize how sad I am about what I did.  Originally, I had planned to get a PhD, but this is going to be out of the question now.  I don't know what to do from here. I feel pretty bad having to come to terms with the fact that basically more than a year of my life has been a waste of time. 

I don't know what my choices in academia are at the moment.  If this path is totally gone for me, or if there's some way I can pick up the pieces again.  Perhaps I would like to begin by confessing what I've done, but even that, I just don't know how to go about doing it. I realize that I should have held myself to higher standards or even just had the guts to quit after the first year, but like I said, I was afraid of what other people would have thought of me. I've let a lot of people down and have wasted time, money and resources and not just my own. To be honest I'm afraid of what is going to happen to me if I do confess, but also find that it really troubles me if I don't.

Okay so I'm a student from India and have a GRE score of 323 applying to ECE program of Georgia Tech. My Major CGPA is 9.30/10.0 (which translates to 4.0 on US scale) and I have had internship at IIT Delhi. I have already created many projects and have written a strong SOP.

I visited their website and saw that their average GRE score is 325 :( and they said your chances will be reduced. Can any redditor help me out by relieving some stress

PS- Not exactly looking for sugar coated words, if you think I can't make the cut please say it. It'll help if I get rejected."
2jvs6e,125,2014-10-21,Becoming the expert on handheld scanners,RandomPullOutGuy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2jvs6e/becoming_the_expert_on_handheld_scanners/,"This story starts, May 3rd 2014. My 3rd day into my internship that has become a career. I have been ordered to go pick up a handheld that needs a certain application installed on it. This application is a mobile retail application that is used for inventory control.

Week 1: the files i have been given are four .cab files and an installation booklet for a different model scanner, but it all ""should just work"". I cannot get the scanner connected to my computer, which the instruction say should just connect. along with the dinasour that i am using, a Dell Optiplex GX520 (produced in 2005, Lets run WIN 7 on it). i finally find that the mobile application needs to be downloaded, but is the wrong application for in 7 WMDC needed.

needless to say i get everything installed and to no avail, nothing.

Week 3: I contact support, they send me a whole new batch of files. I get these installed and nothing. I end up getting really busy because my main project is a Win7 upgrade for the whole company, they haven't started the upgrade yet 2 months after xp support has ended.

Late june/ Early july: I finally get to pick the gun up again. I contact support and get a WHOLE NEW set of cab files, no instructions, just ""use the files that are new but closely named in the order that the original files are listed"". These files install, but i am still getting issues. I contact our level 2 guys about server config and they never get back to me. The program will open but is throwing a weird error. I finally figure out the config file is caty wompus and just try to copy the config file from an old gun and rename as the new gun config file. Low and behold, it works. 

I contact the program support again and they tell me that the config setting that is throwing an error is not need just comment it out.

Aug 1 10:00am: More time to work on the sore that has grown on my desk. The program opens and i can log on. I take it to be delivered to the Inventory manager. I drop it off and RUN away smiling because well, that gun is off my desk. 

Aug 1 11:15am: I get a call. ""hey uhh, the program is working, but i can use the scanner to scan UPCs i can only enter by hand. So i fire up the googles. It turns out this gun is shipped WITHOUT THE GODDAMN APPLICATION TO ALLOW THE GUN TO SCAN!!!!!!!!!!!! So i run back over, new 3 year old laptop in hand, still better than the GX520. I find the program to install, install the program, and blind someone with the laser.

At last the gun is working fine.

Fast forward 1.5 months, i am back in school for my last semester working remotely to my job 3.5 hours away. When a bing sounds from my laptop. 

New Email: ""we have 3 guns that are having issues. please help""

O so descriptive. I call the guy and ask what is going wrong and what the model numbers on the scanners are. 2 different problems on a different model gun, but as you would expect, I am the ""Expert"" at these guns, because i got one to run. So i contact the programs support line, and these guns are no longer supported. 

guess its time to shoot from the hip.

First gun: No laser. I talk to the on property inventory manager and i  have him install the laser program, teaching end users to install something on windows CE is painful.

Second and third gun, no program installed. No problem, i will just follow my instructions from the other gun. Program installs, but wont go online due to sql error. I figure out that an old sql object is causing the crash. 

But now, the whole program can't be seen, only the top 2/3rds. I look into my pile of files and find the old file they sent me. the old file was WeaponX.cab and the new file was WeaponXVGA.cab. I have the guy i am talking to my boss on property, who has never worked on this guns through the uninstall, and re-install of the WeaponX.cab file and finally all guns are working fine.


TL;DR: Doing something once makes you an expert forever, on everything closely related."

I'm currently in the process of migrating a server 2008 file/print server to a server 2012 at my internship. Before I migrate however, I ofcourse want to prepare as much as possible.. now I've got almost everything sorted out except for the printers.

I have exported the current printers on the 2008 server to a printer migration file, and I was wondering what is going to happen when I migrate everything over to the 2012 server and import the file there while the old server is still running. I've done my research and tried several things on a test box, but I don't know what is going to happen when there are 2 print servers with identical printers and share names on the domain.

Does anyone have any experience with this and is willing to help me out? Please excuse any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language. Thanks!"

[These are my github repos for reference](https://github.com/dkanellis). 

The main way I preferred acquiring knowledge was through books since I found them to be extensive and providing more than beginner knowledge.

Specifically I have read these books thus far:

* Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
* Java A Beginner's Guide
* Some of: Pro JPA 2
* Some of: Cracking the Coding Interview

My goal is to acquire as much professional knowledge as I can. I want to make my projects look professional therefore allowing me to have a better chance at job interviews for internships or even graduate jobs.

What I want is to acquire very good knowledge in making efficient, professional and clean code. *Clean Code* provided me with very good tools but now I need something more oriented towards Class Design.

**My question is:** How should I go from here? Is there any good book that you could recommend me to help me with good class design or is there something entirely different that I should be doing. Personally I was thinking of starting to read *Java: The Complete Reference*."

Only about 20 companies were offering positions in my field(s), and about ten of those 20 were offering internships. I will only look into a full time position if I could start the job after I graduate next spring, and I have an exam the same day in a class that I have no idea how I am doing in (the professor has yet to start grading assignments, I got a 63 on the first exam, but it only counts for 15% of the total grade, and I know I clearly did not do my best on it due to blanking out).

(but hear me out..),csoffertaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jwvjs/extending_an_offer_deadline_3_months_but_hear_me/,"**Current situation:** I'm interviewing for an an internship at 3-4 well-funded startups in Silicon Valley. The internship would be 4 months long starting in May of next year. The interviews have all gone extremely well, and I'm anticipating at least one offer. I got all of these interviews through a conference I attended a couple weeks ago.



**Some background:** the University I'm attending offers one of the best internship programs in the world, and nearly every big name in tech hires a ton of interns from us every term. This upcoming term is my 4th co-op term, and I was aiming to apply to Google, Facebook, and I have a friend recommending me for a position at Microsoft. I think I have a pretty decent chance at landing one of these. All of these interviews would take place through my school.



**The issue:** if I do receive an offer from one of the SF startups, it would probably be within the next couple weeks. However, the internship process at my school starts January and ends in February, meaning if I do happen to land an interview and offer with a big name, it would still be several months away. My preference would be working at a big name company as opposed to one of these startups.



So my question, is there any way to delay the offers from the startups until I find out if I get an offer from a top company?


Some additional points I'd like to emphasize, illustrating that my circumstances are somewhat different:


* The internships are all starting in May, which is still 7 months away... The reason they're interviewing so early is due to the conference I attended
* They are startups, and don't have a quota of X amount of interns to fill. This is why I believe, if they want me now, they'd be willing to wait for me

EDIT: Another alternative I could do is apply to the top jobs now, outside of my school's system, and hope for an interview soon? "
2jwykj,1,2014-10-21,Recruiter communication problem,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2jwykj/recruiter_communication_problem/,"So, I'm applying for CS internships for next summer. Toward the end of last year I interviewed with a company on-campus. It went well and I got an email from a recruiter a couple of weeks later saying my interviewer was impressed but unfortunately all spots were full for summer 2014, and they would put me on a fast track in the fall for final round interviews on-site in September.

Well, August came and the recruiter didn't answer my emails asking about next steps. He finally answered one in September and said sorry and asked for an updated resume. Then no answer. Two weeks later is our campus career fair. I go and talk to him in person. He apologizes profusely and says he will email me in the next couple of days. He doesn't. I email a week later and ask what's up. Never answers. I email again earlier today. No answer. 

This seems extremely unprofessional to me. All other recruiters I've talked to are really good about answering emails and making me feel like the company actually wants me to work there. I would just give up, but this is a place I really want to work and I feel like I already have a foot in the door since my first interview went really well.

I know there is another recruiter at the company for my school who a friend is talking to about a similar position. She is apparently much more responsive than my recruiter.

What should I do? Just keep emailing my recruiter? Give up? Try contacting my friend's recruiter? I'm becoming extremely frustrated. 

Btw I know this guy still works at the company because I know someone else talking to him who emailed him last week saying he had an offer deadline, and the guy actually got back to him to schedule second round. "

I've taken a smattering of statistics and done a bit of programming in python, though nothing terribly impressive. I'm hoping my mathematics background is enough to make up for deficiencies in programming.

Am I hireable as a data scientist? Should I be looking for internships or something similar (and if so, any recommendations)? I found the Data Incubator and requested an application, but haven't received one (it may be too late for the next session).

I had an IT internship phone interview this morning and for the most part, I think it went pretty well. One part where I stumbled a bit was where I had to explain my changes in major while in college.

I was a biomedical science major as a freshman, then business in sophomore year and finally in my junior year I decided to go to computer science and minor in business. It sounds so horrible typing it out like that, but that's essentially what I did. I know I'm going to stay in computer science because I'm loving the courses I'm taking and I am just itching to get experience in a professional environment.

But I'm a junior taking introductory courses right now. I have basically all of my core requirements completed so the rest of the time I'm here I'm going to be taking CS related courses. I clarified that in the interview. My experiences in internships/organizations on campus are pretty good too but none of them are focused around computer science (until I joined our computing society the beginning of this semester.)

How can I make myself a strong candidate for my next interview tomorrow morning?"

I am happy to see this subreddit exists! I am stuck trying to make some really big decisions in my new fledgling IT career and really need to know if it is the right thing to do.


Background, current skills:
I am 28, and have worked in restaurants for the past 6 years. I am in my second quarter at a local community college going for the ATA in IT. I only have a single MTA cert under my belt but to finish school I will have the A+, Net+, Sec+, a handful of other MTA's, CCENT, and CCNA. I will have all of these within a year of now at present speed. Straight A student currently, and volunteering to help the Center for Disability Services for IT on the side, and helping the community college to set up a SAN in the near future. Given the opportunity, I want to work with virtualization or networks (ambiguous I know, I haven't truely decided but definitely not geek squad!). I live in Western Washington where there are a lot of industry related jobs.


The questions:
I have 2 current opportunities; one is an unpaid internship in computer hardware repair and the other is a paid internal position with the restaurant chain I work at as IT (90% hardware, minimal skill). The catch for the paid position is I have to stay at my current restaurant gig on the weekends for the 1 year commitment this job requires. Neither are really ideal or relevant to what I am trying to do. I dont want to keep working in the restaurant as my position has made me develop hip problems that have caused major pain on my back, hips, and legs. Physical therapy says I have to quit that job to get better. Do I take either? Do I hold out for something better? If I take one, my fear is I will be unable to grab a better job if it comes along. 


Another question is how can I be proactive in being more visible to prospective employers? I've made a website documenting all my recent endeavors that are relevant. It would be nice to get a possible employers perspective to see if this is worth maintaining or even a good idea. Here's the link: http://stevenbaron.net

2jy8hh,192,2014-10-21,Layer what? I don't see that on the OSI model...,jwhardcastle,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2jy8hh/layer_what_i_dont_see_that_on_the_osi_model/,"I was waiting for /u/thefultonhow to post this, but he seems to be otherwise occupied.  Could be he's wallowing because our intern quit today.  Something about her driving 100+ miles one way every day just to get to work was driving her crazy, I guess.

This is sort of a two-parter, in that yesterday's ""oopsie"" led to today's phone system outage, but they are seemingly unrelated at first.

Yesterday morning I'm sitting in the cafeteria with our **Assistant Director** enjoying a delicious cinnamon walnut sticky bun  (*mmmmm!*) and waiting for a presentation to begin when my phone starts buzzing with a message from **The Network Guy**.

&gt; TNG: What's going on there?  Monitoring things remotely.  Massive slowdowns on the network.  Equipment flapping, up and down.

This happens maybe once a year and we all know immediately what the likely culprit is: someone somewhere on our 50+ building K-12 campus has created a network loop.  Housekeeping will ""bump"" something with a vacuum cleaner and then try to plug things back in, not realizing the cable they just plugged in on one side of the classroom is plugged into the network drop on the other side of the room too.

&gt; Me: AD, can you head back to the office and man the phones?  Let folks know we are going to be slow until we find the loop.  TNG is debugging remotely, and I'm going to go check some likely culprits.

Luckily TNG still has enough bandwidth on his remote desktop to get into the network core, and I start checking the new mini-switch on the printers in the admissions office, the old lab that's been converted to a study hall, and other places with networking equipment that isn't secured in a locked closet.  Meanwhile, /u/thefultonhow is just arriving on schedule.

&gt; TFH: I'll head down to the data center to start physically unplugging buildings from the core if that is deemed necessary.

After 15 minutes, as I'm becoming increasingly insistent that TNG let TFH start chopping our network into smaller pieces, TNG finally narrows down the problem to a brand new building, the central plant, where our facilities director has been struggling with the **HVAC** contractor to get our heating and cooling under control.  HVAC had insisted that our new $75 million buildings come with a fancy new network-connected system, and had promptly provided a ""server"" (chintzy $400 workstation-grade tower squeezed into the dustiest corner of the new central plant) that was supposed to monitor the buildings and the HVAC equipment.  TFH and I rush over to unplug whatever nonsense HVAC has created.  I arrived last.

&gt; TFH: You shouldn't just start randomly plugging things into a network that isn't yours, especially if you don't know what you're doing, and especially 10 minutes into your first day on the job at a new site.

&gt; HVAC: No, you don't understand, that wire needs to be connected or nothing works.  All the heat in the buildings shuts down.  If 3 isn't connected to 15, nothing works.

HVAC, who is a third-party vendor to our third-party vendor, tries to explain how connecting port 3 on our Cisco switch to port 15 is the only way to make his system come online.  Sure enough, when we pull the 1-foot cable out of the switch, all the little lights on his screen go dark.

&gt; Me: No, **you** don't understand.  What you're describing is impossible.  It cannot be necessary that this cable be plugged into both locations at once.  Something else is wrong, and in the meantime you've taken the entire campus offline, including our phones.  We have no 911 right now.

After a few minutes on the phone with TNG (which was tricky because you have to prop the doors to the building open to get even a single bar of cell service in there) we figured out what was going on.  Port 3 on our fancy Cisco switch had gone bad, died a tragic death, likely because of the dirt floating around in the environment.  Port 3 was earmarked for the HVAC ""server,"" and so someone (neither of the two gentlemen who were standing before us, they claimed) had moved the ""server"" from port 3 to port 4.  Of course the two ports were on two different VLANs, as we had segregated all of the HVAC crap into their own network segment.  When HVAC arrived on site, he saw a loose wire, saw an empty slot in port 3, and connected port 3 to the rest of our network.  This injected all of the HVAC traffic into our network (where the server was now located), but also created a loop on the voice VLAN, which knocked out the phones and created a broadcast storm across all the Cisco gear on campus.

When we got back to the office, we were discussing the issue.

&gt; TNG: It's layer 2 or 3, the packet layer.  This is why we having spanning tree, but portfast sort of kills that.

&gt; TFH: Naw, it's layer 1, he screwed up by wiring two different pieces of the network together.

&gt; TNG (joking): What we really need is layer 7 monitoring of every packet on the network.  We should be able to filter this out.

&gt; TFH (joking): No, layer 8!

&gt; TNG: What's layer 8?

&gt; Me: The human.

Part 2 tomorrow, in which TNG spends 7 hours on the phone with VOIP vendor support trying to convince them to take responsibility for the gear we paid them for."
2jyb7i,36,2014-10-21,"Graduation coming soon, feel like I am stuck or under-qualified for entry level development work.",brandtb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jyb7i/graduation_coming_soon_feel_like_i_am_stuck_or/,"I realize my question is a little general, so let me get into specifics:

I'm 32, and I am in my senior year at my university, completing a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I have 8 classes left, and since I have to attend part-time, this means I roughly have about a year and a half to go. Currently I work for a very large health system; one that has a large hospital at it's core, and various clinics spread throughout the towns around it. My current job role is as an Analyst for the Help Desk that supports the main software that the health system uses for charting. It's entry level IT work, but my starting salary for this position was a nice bump from my previous career choice (I started at 40k).

I've got a family (wife, 2 young children) that rely solely on me for financial support. This whole trek back into college has been an effort on all our parts to make it work, and the end is on the horizon. I've never regretted the choice to go back, especially now that I am almost done. Needless to say it has been a challenge.

I read a few posts on here about students that have attended Job Fairs, found gainful internships through the summer, and were either called back to work at those companies on graduation or had sufficient experience that they gained an entry level developer job shortly after. I constantly browse through the career portal of my current employer, looking at jobs that are available and some times I do see posts for entry level positions. As my date for graduation closely approaches, I feel that my choices and options are pretty limited, for a couple of reasons:

1. Internships don't normally come with benefits, and usually the interns are paid less than what I am now.
2. Most entry level development jobs still require some form of hands-on experience, and I do not have this experience.

Obviously the statements about internships are based on hearsay; I can't very well ask each company I see post an opening for one what they pay and how their benefits compare to my own (unless I interview I suppose). But then there is the issue of it possibly being temporary as well.

I've worked with the languages that my university has taught me all through my 4 year college career (Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I am far from a master, but I think I have a really good grip on them. But I feel that this isn't the type of ""experience"" that is being sought. I've only ever used my own code, individual work, and my projects have been completely based on assignment requirements, so there really isn't anything to show for that work. Plus I have no idea where the development cycle starts or ends for a piece of software.

Expanding on my initial question, *What sort of job should I expect to be qualified for after graduation?* Am I being too hard on myself with my exposure to development, and am I being too close minded about what could be available to me? Is a campus career fair still the best start at this point (or maybe closer to graduation)?

Always appreciate the advice that is given here, there has been a lot of insight shared. Please feel free to ask any questions if something seems too vague, I lurk here often. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Wow thanks very much for all of the comments, and fanning the flame of my confidence. It has been rough not being around the family as much as I'd like, and I was starting to dread graduation simply because of the possibility that I hadn't been on the right path near the end. Now I'm looking forward to it even more!

2jyu76,2,2014-10-22,Pursuing second degree in CS. Currently senior in Biology major.,dats_cool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jyu76/pursuing_second_degree_in_cs_currently_senior_in/,"Hey all,

I'm a Biology major on the pre-medical track but I'm having heavy doubts about medical school. I've always been interested in CS but never seriously entertained the idea until recently. I can complete a second bachelor's degree in CS from a state university in 2 years directly after graduation (I would start the program Fall of 2015). Most of the pre-requisites for CS aligned with the pre-medical track; I would only need to complete Intro to Programming and Calculus 2 which I can take this summer (I graduate in spring with a B.S. in Biology). I will graduate with relatively little debt (&lt;10k) with my current degree. 

Does this seem like a wise decision? I'm worried about the job market in a few years as some speculate that an over-saturation of CS grads will make salaries fall and jobs more difficult to obtain. What can I do to maximize my chances for success in this field aside from obtaining internships and working on side-projects? Would pursuing an M.S. in CS be worthwhile? I'm also not interested in pursuing Bioinformatics as some have already suggested this career path to individuals that are in similar circumstances as I am. 

Thanks!"

I am new to python but not COMPLETELY new to programming itself (I'm definitely bad though). Years ago I joined a company as a sort of intern and they decided to have me programming their Web application on .NET even though I had no idea how to program at the time... Boy that was fun. Even though Visual Studio helped a lot, I had to learn from the ground up by googling, reading, thinking and I was motivated by having to create this application. The day I got it working (even though badly) and the company started using it for business was amazing. I really felt like I had created something. 

Now I work on Linux only and I'm not involved in programming for a long time but I want to include python in my skillset but that's my problem: I don't have something to code to motivate me. I have looked for open source projects small enough for me to be able to contribute but I can't find any. 

Does anybody know anything like that? Or has some idea? Or, as a last choice, a good website with a list of exercises? "

So I'm currently working for a software company doing a mix of developing internal web applications and some scripting, and some QA. I was initially hired on as QA, but annoyed them enough until they gave me some programming projects. I've been there for almost two years now, and have been treated very well. I've gotten 10 dollars in raises, from 15 to 25 dollars an hour, freedom to work from home, and to make my own hours. It's really awesome after working retail for the 5 years of my young adult life.

I am currently now a super senior at my university, and am guaranteed a full time position at my work (not exactly sure what position they want me in, i'm assuming the same thing just full time) but am feeling incredibly jaded. I talk to a lot of my cs friends and a lot of them are doing really cool projects but, making exceptionally less money (probably more in the 12-18 dollar range). 

My question is, with my experience, is it worth me trying to find a new job while working at my current one, to find a job that interests me more and gain what could potentially be better experience. Or, should i stay with the company i'm at until i have a diploma in my hands? I do have a lot of expenses so the money is nice at my current job, but i much rather have a true software engineering internship alone than it plus some semi programming semi quality assurance. Also, maybe i could ask for a higher salary at the other internships since i do have more experience than many other college students.

TLDR: Should i stay at my high paying low expertise internship that is very relaxed, or find a more intensive internship where i can truly put my education to work but sacrifice money?"
2k0p7d,0,2014-10-22,Help.. Devastated and stressed sophomore year,gwkuser,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2k0p7d/help_devastated_and_stressed_sophomore_year/,"So I'm an ECE student who's taking Signals and systems, as well as this discrete math proof course with topologies (Ugh, even typing this makes me feel stressed and depressed). I currently have a C in Signals and Systems and have a B in my discrete math class (Mind you, this is a top engineering university). On top of that, I always seem to flunk all my software development internship interviews because they claim they'll let me know in a week, only for me to never hear ANYTHING.

So predictably, I'm feeling hopeless especially with the fact that I understand the basic concepts in the class (At least I understand what the entire point of a Fourier Transform is, but I can't memorize the specific things like how to translate a time shift on the frequency domain in terms of exact math), yet I always magically end up doing some math algebra wrong on tests, and the points just fucking add up. So then I don't know how I can improve other than practicing, but I literally don't have time to practice problems with my 100+ hour homework+class weeks. If I can't get an internship this summer, then my chances of getting a good one next year is next to none, then my chances of getting a six figure salary soon after college is also next to none. This vicious cycle is also stressing me out and I really need some help because I literally don't know what I can be doing differently."
2k108s,2,2014-10-22,"Where can I look to find a brutally honest critique of my resume, code, etc.?",Bluesroo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2k108s/where_can_i_look_to_find_a_brutally_honest/,"Skip to the end for a TL;DR. This will be a long post.

So I'm in a different position from most. I was a Psychology undergraduate who picked up an interest in programming the summer before Junior year but it was just a passing interest. I start doing silly little programs in C, but nothing more than just a side hobby. Senior year I had some openings in my schedule so I took the intro sequence at my school for computer engineering (Basically intro to C, ""advanced"" C and abstract data structures) and I did really well. My professor noticed and mentioned going into the grad program after I graduate.

Fast forward to now: I am in the graduate program starting this quarter (I graduate in May) and enjoying it a lot. I have a lot of prerequisites to make up (mostly surrounding math, a couple simple stats classes were all that were required for my Psychology degree) but I'm trucking and making projects as I go to teach myself languages, technologies, etc. Among other things, I've almost finished the calculus series at my university and am taking my second algorithms course.

So now that you have some background, here is my issue: I want a job in the field. I feel like I'm at a place where I could do well in a junior dev position somewhere, whether it be a coop, internship, part-time job or whatever. I want so badly to be working on something more substantial than my little projects for a couple reasons: I'm afraid that the way I've taught myself has lead to bad habits and I want some guidance and I want to know what it's like to work in a legitimate production environment with deadlines, requirements to meet, etc.

I've applied to A LOT of places online, I've talked with professors about their opinion on what I should learn in my spare time, I've had professors and friends in the field look over my resume, I've talked to recruiters at job fairs, I've interviewed for 2 jobs. And nothing has come of it.

Whenever I talk to anyone (friends, family, professors, recruiters, interviewers) they always tell me that I look like a great candidate, that it is cool that I've switched from psychology and that it could be an asset, that they respect my courage to switch what I want to do so late, that my resume looks good (well, given my late jump into the field), that it's cool that I've taken time to progress on my own with projects, that I did really well on the algorithm questions that have been given to me (both at career fairs and at the 2 job interviews).

If all of this is true, then why the fuck have I been denied from so many fucking jobs? It drives me insane. Are all these people just kissing my ass to make me feel better? Where can I go to have someone rip me a new one so I know what to do in order to be a hireable candidate. I'm fine with being told that I'm delusional and that I'm nowhere near to hireable and that I suck and my code sucks. At least then I would know how to change!

TL;DR: Everywhere I go I've gotten nothing but positive feedback, but I don't have a job to show for it after talking with recruiters at job fairs and interviewers at 2 companies. How can I figure out what's holding me back? Who can I talk to? Do I just simply not have enough to prove myself? Do I just need to do more?"
2k149w,4,2014-10-22,Age and Resume Question,subterfug,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/2k149w/age_and_resume_question/,"Next summer should be my last as an Undergraduate in Computer Science, and I don't need to take any classes during that time to graduate on time. I was thinking about pursuing an internship (possibly abroad), however, I have a few questions about it.

**1**. I'm 25 now (will be 26 by summer, probably 27 by graduation). Is this too old? Are people only interested in younger graduates?

I'm older because I did 5 years in the military with a very technical job including a lot of leadership/supervisory work. It's solid experience, but not directly applicable to Computer Science (involved no programming, lots of hands on troubleshooting on aircraft). I could leave it off my resume, but then I don't have a lot of applicable/formal Computer Science related experience.

**2**. My resume right now has a lot of military awards because I don't have many from my University. If I leave out my military experience or awards, my resume looks bare, but if I don't, my age is easily guessable.

A quick note – I’ve changed the names of people and locations in this story to protect identities. All occurrences are real. I will be as detailed as possible.
***
I work as a hiring manager for a hospital in Queens, NY. It’s not exactly the job I had set out for, but I like it. I have full hiring authority for all the healthcare workers in the hospital, aside from my boss occasionally pulling some strings for people and maybe reviewing a few of the candidates I approve of. Otherwise I coordinate with the nursing department to determine when we need to bring on more staff and how many people they need. Until recently, this job has been relatively worry-free.

I received a call about a month ago from a former employee, Suzette White. She had started working at the facility as a Registered Nurse long before I came on board. Earlier this year she retired, not because she was too old, but just because she had enough of the job. I believe she had worked there for 23 years where she had been a valuable member of the team. Everyone had the highest praise for her and her efforts. It was sad to see her go.

During my 5 years doing the job, I had gotten to know her fairly well. I usually don’t warm up to people, but there was something so warm and nurturing about her. She was a pseudo mother-figure to me. 

She had called to tell me that her daughter recently graduated from nursing school and was looking for a job. I had never met her daughter, but without hesitation, I told her that she’s more than welcome to come in and fill out an application and I would gladly interview her for an upcoming orientation I was planning with the nursing department. I typically don’t entertain new graduates since the numbers indicate they don’t always perform up to expectations. I guess their first taste of the real challenges of nursing in the field overwhelms a lot of them, and they quickly throw in the towel before I can even show them where the bathroom is. This is common throughout the industry and new graduates will usually go months, even a year sometimes, without landing their first job. But for Mrs. White, the pleasure to accommodate her daughter brought me joy. 

“What’s her name?” I asked.  
“Jane. Jane White.”  
“Ok. Tell her to come in tomorrow morning at 11:00.”  
“I will. But please…I know it’s difficult to bring on a new grad, but…*help her.*”  
Her pause and tone caught my attention when she said it. It didn’t sound like *“help her, no one will give her a chance to prove herself.”* It sounded more like *“she needs guidance. She’s troubled.”* I brushed it off; a simple case of a loving mother wanting the best for her daughter I concluded. 
“Don’t worry about a thing Suzette, I’ll see to it she’s taken care of.”  
“Maybe I should come with her.”  
“Oh, Suzette you shouldn’t do that. She’s a big girl and can’t have her mom following her on job interviews.”  
“I know, you’re right. Just give her a chance.”

I set the interview on my outlook calendar for the next day. I interview a lot of people, but I was really looking forward to this one; to meeting Jane. If she was anything like her mother, her employment at the facility would have a tremendous impact on the day to day functions of the facility.
The next day at 9:15am, the front desk pages me in my office. 

“Good morning. I have a Jane White here to see you.”  
*9:15?!* This is a huge pet peeve of mine. While you certainly want to look punctual for a job interview, showing up too early makes you look over-eager and desperate, while it also makes me have to juggle my schedule around to keep you from waiting for too long. The unspoken rule is to arrive 15 minutes before the appointment. No earlier, no later.   
“She’s here now? Her appointment is at 11:00.”  
“Yup. Do you want me to send her in?”  
“No, I can’t right now, I have a 9:30 meeting with the Chief Physician. Tell her she has to wait or come back.”  
I hang up the phone and ten seconds later I get a call back from the front desk.  
“She said she doesn’t want to wait. She wants to see you now.”  

Have you ever heard that employers know if they want to hire you within the first seconds of meeting you? Yeah, this is 100% true. Most of my interviews are determined in the first few seconds and the rest of the time I’m just being polite. And even though I still haven’t technically met Jane, I already know I don’t want to hire her. That is, if she was anyone else other than Suzette’s daughter. That’s the only thing keeping my mind open at this point. If it were any other candidate I’d tell them to get lost at this point.

I figured I could squeeze the interview in before my meeting. Even though I’m already skeptical on Jane, I reminded myself that there could be potential in her.   
“You know what, fine. I’ll be right there.”  
I walked out of my office towards the front to meet Jane. As I turned the corner I had a full view of the reception area and I noticed a young girl sitting on the couch adjacent to the front desk. The receptionist discreetly pointed towards the girl, indicating it was Jane. I observed her briefly before walking over to her. She sat there staring blankly ahead, the only movement coming from slow, blinking eyelids. She had long, bright blonde hair that covered a significant portion of her cheeks.  
I walked over to her. “Jane?” She looked over towards me without getting up from the couch or moving any other muscles. “You’re a bit early, but thank you for coming in. I’m Alex, nice to meet you.”  
I extended my hand to her as I introduced myself. She reached up and shook it with a weak grasp. “Hi,” she said, slightly above a mumble.  
“Please, come with me to my office.”  
As she stood up I noticed how short (I guessed her to be around 5’ tall), and heavy she was. I never measure someone’s value based on their physical appearance, but I always take notice to overweight nurses. It’s always baffled me; how nurses can be overweight when they’re on their feet all day running from patient to patient, and most don’t have the time to eat their lunch. It’s a question I’ve always wanted to ask, *“How can you be overweight when you’re doing cardio all day?”* Of course, that would be rude.  
Jane looked relatively young, maybe early 20’s, but clearly did not take very good care of herself. Aside from her weight, her skin looked greasy, like she hadn’t showered in a few days. She was dressed in all black; black khaki pants that looked about 2 sizes too small for her, black ankle-high boots with heels that I could have sworn I’d seen her mother wear before, and a black button-down shirt which appeared to be turned inside out. I guessed she did not have a solid set of interview-clothes and this shirt had some sort of print on the front that she was trying to hide and pass off as professional. Fine by me. 

As we walked to my office I tried to carry a conversation with her. “Did you find the facility alright?”  
“Yes.”  
“I know sometimes people who have never been here can get lost in this area, but I bet you’ve been here before since your mother worked here for many years.”  
“Yes.”  
“When was the last time you came by here.”  
“I don’t know.”  
“Did you come by here a lot when you were younger?”  
“No.”  
I couldn’t get more than a couple of words out of her. The only steady sound coming from her was the chorus of staccato as her boots walked across the tile floor. I tried to lighten the mood a bit. “Congratulations on finishing nursing school. Now you can actually have a social life again!”  
“I guess.” Still hardly anything from her.  
We entered my office. “Please, have a seat.” She sat in the chair opposite my desk and immediately adjusted her hair so it covered most of her cheeks again. She was obviously shy and a bit insecure, but it didn’t seem like she was making any effort to interact with me. I was starting to understand why her mother wanted to tag along.  
“So, Jane, tell me about yourself,” I said as I sat down.  
She stared blankly at me with dead, apathetic eyes, her face lacking any emotion or personality. “What do you want to know?”  
*I’m not going to tell you how to tell me about yourself*, I thought. “Whatever you want.” She sat pondering for a few seconds, her dark pupils looking upwards as she thought of what to say. After a few awkward seconds, I tried to encourage her a bit. “Why don’t you let me see your resume.”  
“My what?”  
“Your resume.”  
“What’s that?”  
Did she really not know what a resume was? I wasn’t even sure how to express the definition of ‘resume’. “It’s…um, well you put your professional profile on it and hand it to prospective employers. Your education, work experience, skills, things like that.”  
“Oh. I didn’t bring it.”  
*Seriously?* “Okay. Well, where did you go to school?”  
“St. Vincents.”  
“They have a great program. Where did you do your clinicals?”  
“…Elmwood Hospital.”  
“Oh really? I know the Director of Nursing there. Ms. Thomas, right?”  
“Yes.”  
“She’s an excellent teacher. I’m sure you can attest to that.”  
Jane fell silent for a moment… “Don’t ask her about me.”  
“Excuse me?”  
“Don’t ask her about me.”  
Sometimes I get this sort of response from people currently employed, and understandably so. It would be an inconvenience to call someone’s boss if they didn’t know they were looking for work. But she only did a clinical internship at Elmwood. There’s no reason for Jane to tell me not to contact Ms. Thomas unless she did something completely wrong. I decided to press her on the matter. “Why shouldn’t I?”  
“She didn’t like me.”  
*That’s not a surprise*. “Why didn’t she like you?”  
Her blank face suddenly turned into a piercing stare of hatred. Her eyes widened, “Stop asking me about this.”  
Whoa, red flag! She had said this so forcefully, I was taken aback. I was already well aware that something was off with Jane, but this look she was giving me sent chills throughout my body.  
“Ok, we don’t have to talk about that.” I was trying to be polite, but I realized there wasn’t much more I could take of this girl. I had to cut it short. “Well, I’m somewhat pressed for time since you came in early, so I’ll have to end things here if that’s alright with you.”  
“When do I start?” Did she really think getting a job would be that easy?  
“I’m still interviewing candidates, Jane. I’m scheduled to meet with other people later today and tomorrow and after that I will be making my decision.”  
Her face saddened and she looked down at the floor. “You won’t call me. No one ever does.”  
Now I actually started to feel bad for this girl, she must have interviewed at a few other places with no results to show for it. Someone needs to give her something positive to walk out with. “Listen, I won’t lie, you could certainly brush up on your interview skills, but all I care about is whether you’ll be able to do the job of a nurse. It’s tough work, and if you went to school at St. Vincents I’m sure you can bring a lot to the table. I’m sure you’re just as qualified as the other candidates I’ll be meeting with.”  
“So, I’m hired?”  
“I’ll let you know. Thank you for coming in.” I extended my hand to shake hers again, and again, she shook it with a frail, weak grasp, only this time her hand was shaking as it approached mine. She stood up and I caught a glimpse of her eyes. They were filled with tears. I felt horrible, but I can’t give her a job just because felt pity.  
As she turned to leave, she stopped short and froze. Something had caught her eye, and as I followed her gaze, I noticed that she was looking at my signed Derek Jeter baseball that I had on display. It sat on a shelf on the wall next to my desk. “Do you like baseball?” I asked, hoping she would leave me with something positive to end this encounter.  
And that’s when my uneasy suspicion about Jane was confirmed. Without warning, she lunged at the baseball, grabbed it and threw it across my office at a framed picture of The Vitruvian Man I had on the wall. The glass shattered into pieces as I stood in shock. Before I could look back at Jane, she was bolting for the door and running out of the facility. Everything happened so quickly I didn’t realize that a small crowd formed outside my office door. I gathered myself and tried to shake it off. “So **that’s** why my mother always told me not to play ball inside the house.” Everyone outside laughed and walked away. I quickly looked out my window to see Jane getting into a black sedan parked on the street outside and drive away. She was gone.

I cleaned up the mess left in my office thankful that Jane had not thrown the ball at me and that my ordeal with her was finally over. After she had shown me her destructive behavior, I certainly didn’t feel bad about not hiring her anymore. I generally try to give every candidate a fair chance. I always think of what Jack Nicholson said in The Departed:

*“The point I’m making is – a man could look at anything, and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think ‘what could I use you for?’”*

That’s always been my hiring philosophy. With Jane, there’s nothing I could use her for. Clearly this was a person who has no place working in the healthcare industry, or any industry for that matter.
***
Later that day Suzette called me to follow up on my meeting with Jane. I told her what happened and how I really did not feel comfortable trusting her with the responsibilities of a nurse. “I see. I’m sorry to have wasted your time,” was all she had to say. I could hear the disappointment in her voice. “I wish her the best of luck, Suzette. She just needs to find the right place.”

A day goes by, more candidates come in, some better than others. I eventually settle on a class of 6 RNs to attend our orientation on 10/06/14, which was about a week away at the time. I ran all the necessary background checks, reference checks, license verifications, I obtained all of their medical history documents, and I submitted all of the information to the in-service coordinator, Mrs. Pierre (she’s the person who runs the orientation class). Once I submit their information to Mrs. Pierre, my work is essentially done. Business as usual.

The day I submitted the candidates to the in-service coordinator, I received a call at my office just as I was getting ready to leave for the day and go home to a nice beer. I have caller ID and the number was displayed as RESTRICTED, which always makes me raise an eyebrow. 

I answered, “Hello this is Alex.”  
No response.  
“Hello, can I help you?”  
I heard breathing. Not heavy or over the top. Just the regular sound of someone breathing on the phone. I sat and waited for the person to answer for a few seconds. And then, she spoke.  
“…did I get the job?” She spoke so as though she were in distress. I recognized the voice right away. It was Jane.  
“Excuse me? Who is this?” I wanted confirmation.  
“…did I get the job?”  
“Jane? Is that you?”  
“………did I get the…job?”  
“I’m sorry Jane, but there were other candidates for the position I wound up hiring. I wish you luck in…”  
*click*

What a strange girl. I thought. She really needs some professional help.

I placed the phone back on the receiver, grabbed my coat and my bag, said goodnight to a few people and walk out of the facility heading to my car. Since the facility I work for is in Queens, parking is somewhat limited. There is a parking lot on the premises, but most of the employees arrive at the facility at 7:00am, whereas I usually go in at 9:00am, so by the time I arrive the lot is full, aside from parking that is reserved for family members. My boss offered me a reserved parking space, but I’m not the type to take advantage of special treatment, so I declined it. Instead, I park my car on the street 3-4 blocks away. I get to take a nice walk by the park on the way, have a cigarette and clear my head.

It’s twilight by the time I leave, which I enjoy. The summer days of walking to my car in my work clothes when it’s sunny and 90 degrees outside are finally over for the year. There’s nothing more uncomfortable than getting in your car when you’re already sweating a little and having a wave of heat hit you in the face when you open the car door.

I had walked a block and turned the corner from the facility when I noticed a car was sitting double parked ahead of me. Probably someone waiting for a spot to open up, I assumed. It was an old black Honda Civic, probably an early 2000’s model. It looked similar to the car I saw Jane get into when she stormed out of the office. The rear bumper was riddle with dents and dings, something that one of those “Bumper Bully’s” would have probably saved. The windows were tinted, but it looked as though someone was sitting in the driver seat. I had an uneasy feeling…not ten minutes ago I had just gotten off the phone with a girl that genuinely gave me the creeps. Was she inside the car waiting for me?

Without breaking my stride, I studied the car thoroughly trying to see if there was a figure in the car. The closer I got to it, the more I doubted there was anyone there and I slowed my pace down to get a better look inside.

Nope, no one there. From the sidewalk I peered into the car to see if there were any clues. I had been so focused on trying to find something, that the sound of Jane’s voice from behind startled me.

“Did I get the job?”  
A burst of fear swept through me and I jumped at the sound, simultaneously turning to see the familiar long blonde hair of Jane staring at me.  
“Jane! You frightened me!” She was silent. “What are you doing here?” Still, she said nothing, refusing to react or take her glaring eyes off me. “Are you following me?” She just stood there like a tree, staring…that stare. There was something unsettling about it. “Listen, Jane, I mentioned earlier on the phone, I decided to go with another candidate. I’m sorry.”  
Her head started vibrating and her eyes turned red with anger as her hands formed fists. Any person in the world would immediately interpret the situation as a threat.  
“Jane…what are you doing?”  
And like someone had flipped a switch inside of her, she suddenly collected herself, stopped shaking and relaxed her fists. “Have a nice night,” she said politely and walked into the Honda that was double parked. I wasn’t going to wait for her to drive off, I ran to car that was parked about a block away and jumped inside before she could do anything else. I sat and caught my breath hoping that would be the last I would ever see or hear of Jane. My hopes were short lived as I saw in my review mirror her car approaching slowly from behind. I was parallel parked, so there was no chance for me to speed off and try to outrun her from where she was.

Her car inched closer and I started panicking, debating whether I should get out and make a run for it. Before I could decide what to do her car had pulled up alongside mine, her tinted window was rolled down and she was staring at me. Her car never stopped though, she just drove slowly, making some sort of statement. Warning me.

And then, she sped off.

I drove home, my pulse racing the entire time. But what threat could this girl possibly be to me? Why should I be the least be worried?

I didn’t know the answer to that question…but I *was* worried.

***
Much more coming on Jane as a lot has happened since she approached me on the street, but I don’t want to hit you guys with everything all at once. I’ll have part 2 up soon!

However, before I do that I would like to give a little back ground: before going back to school at my local Community College last year, I had already graduated with a liberal arts bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in library science (yes, to be a librarian). Due to the recession, I was forced to work at a customer care call center. Eighteen months ago, I was not in a good place. I was getting more burnt out at the call center by the day and the library job search was getting me nowhere, so I decided it was time for a change and I registered for classes. Flash forward 14 months. I am two months graduation, rocking a 3.6 GPA, passed both the A+ and Network+ (and hopefully the Security+ by the end of the year), completing an internship. Not only this but after completing my first interview on Monday afternoon, I was offered the job today. However, I am not sure if I want the job. For one, I am not sure if I like the guy who I will be working for, but it could have me not knowing his personality; but I did like all of the other guys who I will be working with/for. Also, while the job 35-40 hours a week and pays $15 an hour (which I have no issue with) but here is the big red flag for me is there are no benefits, including health insurance (which I’m not sure how that is going to be legal next year; let’s not get political here please). Hell, my shitty call center job had insurance. My parents have said they will take care of that for me but damn it I am 31, I want show I am an adult. However, there are reasons to say yes. I know there is always a 100 reasons to say now but this a pretty big red flag as I have said.  My experience of the last five years tells me to take the job and be grateful but my gut tells me to turn it down and hold out about six months before stop being picky. Right now, I am leaning hard no but I want to weigh all options. Is there any advice I may have that would help me?"

2k1xi1,6,2014-10-22,Industrial Engineer Looking To Exit Manufacturing,GenericHbomb,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2k1xi1/industrial_engineer_looking_to_exit_manufacturing/,"**TL;DR** Went to school for Industrial/Manufacturing Engineering and hate working in Manufacturing. Interests include animals, science(biology, chemistry, social), programming, 3d printing (don't want to stay in manufacturing though). Any thoughts?


I am about to graduate from a respectable engineering school and have spent over a year working full time paid internships. Similar to many MEs, EEs, and IEs I have ended up in manufacturing and this is where my 'professional' experience is. I really have no passion for manufacturing and just can not dedicate myself to it the way I would like to. It feels soulless to me I suppose.



What I enjoy about IE/Manufacturing:

* The pay is decent even before leaving college

* The atmosphere is friendly while maintaining competitiveness against other companies


What I am good at:

* I'm good with computers, always have been. I have been teaching myself programming but between working full time, school and lack of guided discipline I have not made it too far.

* I'm good with psychology, reading people. I'm excellent at reading social cues, understanding people etc. I love talking and thinking about how the mind works.

* I'm good at big picture thinking.

* It doesn't show here but I have excellent verbal and written skills

* I have excellent leadership qualities and have 4+ years of management experience(3 in food service, 1 in manufacturing) before even graduating college


Areas I am interested in:

* Animals. I love animals, always have. Wanted to be a veterinarian when I was younger. I have always been told I have a connection with animals.

* 3D printing. Took a 3D printing class and loved it but am finding it difficult to find positions that align with what I want. I would likely remain in manufacturing I imagine.

*Programming. Obviously it is valuable but I have always thought this may be a good path to go. However, I am worried I will end up back in manufacturing.

* Science. I have always loved the sciences. I love learning about how the world works, biology, chemistry, psychology, social sciences. A lot of my personal reading revolves around the sciences and I think the field is fascinating.

I feel engineering (IE) provides me with excellent logic and critical thinking based skills that are useful anywhere. I have a lot of lower level management experience for my age that is useful anywhere. I am just not sure how to break out of manufacturing in to something more science based.

I went in to engineering because I ""needed"" to go to school and it provided an excellent skill set, good pay, respect, and the ability to climb out of childhood poverty. I wanted to be somebody important and make a lot of money. I did not go in to engineering because it was something I thought I would love which was my mistake. Looking for the right path this time.

I did fine my first two years, but I've struggled in most CS courses since. I've never had time nor ideas for personal projects either. I can work in C, but OO and algorithms are huge weak areas (I bombed the only interview I've gotten so far because of those). I couldn't even get an internship last summer either as a result. I have some solid projects on my resume, but if I had to go back and do any of those without the teams I worked with, they'd never happen. 

So yeah, that about sums it up. What could I go through to get back up to speed in my spare time? Books, project ideas, new languages to pick up (I pretty much only know C and Java, and the latter I'm awful with).

I started a new job part-time as an executive assistant.

I got the job through a woman I intern for(it's her husband). I have been doing graphic design for her website for free since March. She told him about me and suggested I can work for him. That's how I got the job.

Anyway, He runs his own drug/pharmaceutical company in NYC. I worked for him a couple days in the summer and he gave me a pay of $25 an hour. I thought that was great. He then offered me employment starting this week, as he needed me part time and possibly full time eventually. I don't think the pay is right. 

30,000 salary if I'm full time working 5 days

60% of that since I'm working 3 days a week which amounts to $15 or $360 a week. 

I looked up the pay for executive assistant in NYC and the pay was nowhere near that low. It was above that. I was not expecting to receive that little. I might as well waitress and I can make more. I don't know what to do, should I ask for more money or am I wrong? I can not live on that pay. I honestly took it very personally since I work for free for his wife, I thought he would be generous with pay. I'm starting to think I'm being taken advantage of here. "

I am looking to get into Germany, particularly Berlin (but I'll go anywhere, who am I kidding), using only my CS degree and mild-to-moderate knowledge of the German language.

I am currently still a student (at the University of Missouri) but I will be graduating in May, 2015. Ideally, I would like to get a job offer in Germany for late May or early June and catch the first flight there after graduation.

I have a pretty great GPA (3.8), two internships, hackathon experience, two handfuls of my own software applications (some even successful), and (will have) managed to graduate college in three years.

I have been applying to some (like 30+) software development job openings in Berlin already and have had a few interviews, but no offers yet. This gives me hope that I can actually make it in, but perhaps I am missing something.

What are my chances of landing my (dream) job in Germany? Can anyone give advice to a soon-to-be college grad?

If anyone wants to look at or give feedback about my resume, please PM me."

I switched into CS very late, I was a business major who decided to pick up a double major starting my Senior year (took a CS class and was hooked, having previously felt like I had no idea what I was doing in business).  
I have some personal projects, but they are mostly class assignments and a few little things I'm working on.  Unfortunately, trying to cram an entire second degree with no filler classes into one year is really killing my ability to do anything extra-curricular, and this combined with my late entry into CS and low GPA I feel make me a particularly bad candidate on paper. 

I applied to a ton of companies over the past month and had no luck at all (I got like one phone screen which I moved onto the next round in but that still has to pan out). All the big companies denied me instantly and the smaller ones all wanted web developers with lots of experience so I stopped looking for now.

I have one more semester left before I graduate in May and I want to be ready by the time March rolls around to at least have a chance of getting something good.  So for that I wanted to share my action plan for the next few months and also I have a few questions I would really appreciate if you guys could help me shed some light on.

**Plan:**
start doing some Udacity courses for web development and get the basics down enough (html/CSS/javascript syntax) before winter break, and then over winter break just burn through as many web/other interesting courses as I can that have major projects at the end to add to my resume.  Working 40 hrs/week for 3 weeks should get me pretty far into some good projects.

Go to all the recruiting events/career fairs next semester and hope I can land something.

1. I feel like I'm focusing a lot on web development with this plan, but I'm not even sure if I will want to do web development as my actual job.  Back end stuff sounds kind of cool to me, but I really liked the kind of programming we did in our data structures classes and such.  I'm thinking of web development as a sort of ""foot in the door"" for more software developer type roles.  Is this a good idea or should I be trying something else?
2. What else should I do/any other suggestions, given my situation? 

I apologize for what is probably a pretty long post and ridiculous run-on sentences, but I feel kind of hopelessly lost right now and that I've just been wasting my parents' money. I have this fear I'm just going to graduate and have nothing to show for it even after what I thought was my second wind from discovering CS after 4 years of just doing the bare minimum in business classes I hated.

need some help getting internships, low gpa and not much experience, my plan for what I want to try to do over the next year is above along with some questions.**

Edit: I guess what I have learned from this is that the term IT might be changing. While some people in this thread talk about IT as if it is strictly tech support I have found that my role in IT departments still is a fair amount of software development. However, this software consists of mostly internally used tools or web development. In addition to this, it consists of meetings where people of different tech disciplines come together and postulate ideas to use technology to improve the business side of of the company. This is why it often results in web development because companies want to have increased web presence. Thank you all for your input!"

2k3fxk,336,2014-10-23,Layer 8 problems -- Part 2,jwhardcastle,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2k3fxk/layer_8_problems_part_2/,"After [an HVAC contractor created a loop on our network](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2jy8hh/layer_what_i_dont_see_that_on_the_osi_model/) and temporarily bogged down our Cisco network backbone for about an hour Monday morning, we thought we were in the clear once the loop had been removed.  In the past things always went right back to normal once the loop was gone.  Switches recovered, servers and workstations didn't seem to mind too much, all was well again.  This time, however, there appeared to be lingering effects.  I mentioned this happens maybe once a year, but this is the first time it's happened in the last 18 months since we put in our new VOIP system.

The first thing that TheNetworkGuy noticed was that one of the voice switches (the call control units for the VOIP system) didn't come back online right away.  This voice switch, like all the others, is wired to the network with redundant copper links, each Cat6 plugged into a different half of the core.  If we reboot one switch in the core, the other switch takes over.  This particular voice switch, which happened to handle half of the T1/PRI connections between our VOIP system and the rest of the world, didn't come back online, but TNG was able to get it to reconnect by shutting off the redundancy at the core.  This forced the voice switch to failover to the other core switch, and it reappeared.  TNG didn't think much of it, and moved on.

Later on Monday, I was on the phone with someone in the fundraising office:

&gt; Fund: We need this to go out right away an****click**** -- **dialtone**

Her voice cut off mid-word and I was left with a ringing in my ear.  I hung up and she called right back.

&gt; Fund: That's so weird, that's been happening to me today.  My calls keep dropping right in the middle of talking to someone.

&gt; Me: I agree, that isn't supposed to happen.  We'll send Intern over there to replace your phone and that should take care of it.

Fund had also been having other phone problems recently, so we thought nothing of it.  We thought it was just more problems with her hardware.  

Tuesday morning, things are going smoothly.  I'm waiting in the office for an underground utility rep to show up so we can talk about some directional boring.  /u/thefultonhow is going over some things with Intern, and TNG has just arrived.  Then we get another report of problems.  This time, the assistant to the head of school reports that the head (the head of school is both my boss and **the** boss -- basically the equivalent of a CEO) is having the same problems as Fund.

&gt; Me: Who was Head talking to when he had this problem?

&gt; HeadAsst: He was talking to the Communications Director.

Comm works in the office right above Fund, in the same building.  I say *building* but I really mean an old house that has been converted into an office for 20 people, with a Cisco switch mounted in the rafters in the basement.  My spidey sense is going off, and so is TNG.  

We had seen some weird SNMP alerts over the weekend with the switch in that building spiking the CPU above 97%.  TNG wasn't worried, because this is a known bug in the particular revision of IOS that the switch is running, and it doesn't affect network traffic.  We had patched most of the switches on campus to remove the bug, but for some reason had missed that building.

&gt; Me: Is it possible that we actually *are* seeing packet loss?  That the switch is flaking out on us?  Can we just do some emergency downtime and fix it?

&gt; TNG: Yes, of course, but you've got to give the go ahead to knock the building offline for 20 minutes, no computers or phones, while the firmware is upgraded.

&gt; Me: Do it.  Send an email out, schedule it for noon, and hopefully folks will get the hint and leave for lunch.

I went out to meet the world's quietest-talking site surveyor, while TNG prepared for the upgrade.  Knowing that someone would need to be in the FundHouse to reboot the switch (because the bug also blocks telnet access), I ran to the cafeteria and grabbed a quick bite before heading down to the affected building.  As I'm passing through the lunch line, another employee comes up to me.

&gt; Athletics: Are we having problems with the phones?  I've been dropping calls.

My spidey sense is now full-on screaming at me.  And meanwhile, while I'm in line in the cafeteria but everyone else is back at the office, TFH's phone rings and it's HeadAsst.

&gt; HeadAsst: Head was just on a call with someone else and the call dropped.

&gt; TFH: Was the person in FundHouse?

&gt; HeadAsst: No, they were elsewhere on campus.

&gt; TFH: Ok, that's not good.  We thought this was a problem with the equipment in FundHouse, but clearly Head is having problems independent of that.  Can you transfer me over to him so I can get more information?

Call transfers...

&gt; Head: Hey TFH, I understand you need some information about the problem I've been having.  It's weird.  I'll just be talking on the phone and all of a sudden the call gets disconn****click**** -- **dialtone**

TFH calls back...

&gt; TFH: Yeah, seems like you're having a similar problem.  We'll look into it.

As I'm walking down to FundHouse to bounce the recalcitrant switch, I shot a message to TNG and TFH.

&gt; Me: Guys, we've got a bigger problem than just FundHouse.  I just heard from Athletics that they have dropped calls too.  Not on campus, but calls out through the T1.  

&gt; TFH:  And I've confirmed that Head's issues are completely independent of FundHouse issues.  I was on a call with him when the call dropped.

&gt; Me: I think we need to engage tech support for the VOIP system.

&gt; TNG: OK, I agree.  I'll call them now while we start upgrading the switch.

The switch upgrade goes well, and has the added side effect of rebooting all of the phones in FundHouse twice, once when I unplugged the UPS for two minutes to reactivate the switch, and a second time when TNG finished the firmware upgrade and rebooted the switch again.

Meanwhile, TNG is on the phone with VOIPSupport describing the issue and getting a ticket created.  When I get back, I hear them discussing rebooting the whole phone system.

&gt; TNG: That's fine, I will reboot the whole system, but first I want to know what caused it.  If we reboot it, and we find out that we haven't solved the root issue, the problem could just come back tomorrow, or some time soon when it really counted.  I want to stay on the line until we track down the issue so we know how to fix it in the future.

TNG's good at this.  He's got experience from the consulting world, where he's used to dealing with much larger and more complicated networks than ours.

TFH and I start trying to gather more information to help TNG and VOIPSupport narrow down the issue.  I sent TNG some screenshots from my call log to help him find my dropped call with Fund so he can scour the logs with VOIPSupport.  We call HeadAssist to find out if the boss is in, and when the office is clear TFH runs down to Head's office where we haven't yet swapped out the phone to make a call and see if we can reproduce the issue.  TFH calls me at my desk.

&gt; TFH: OK, so I guess I'll just stay on the line until i****click**** -- **dialtone**

Call time: 11 seconds.  Well, at least we can reproduce the issue.  TFH calls me right back.

&gt; TFH: That was fast!  Should we try again?

&gt; Me: Sure, let's see if we can get some timing on it.

That call lasted 3 minutes and 50 seconds.

Back in the office, TFH, AssistantDirector and I are scratching our heads trying to figure out what the commonality is.  TNG is on hold with VOIPSupport, so he wanders over as well.

&gt; TNG: It's not the network, because if it were, we'd be experiencing other issues besides just phones.  Stuff would be going crazy all over the place.

&gt; TFH: Well, it's not just FundHouse, because Head and Athletics are having the problem as well.

&gt; TNG: It can't be just internal calls, because we had Athletics drop calls outside.  

&gt; Me: You kicked the PRI voice switch, right?  What switch are all these affected clients connected to?

TFH looks, and sure enough all of the suspected affected are connected to the same voice switch, out of the 5 available.  So, now we think we've got a good place to start hacking away with VOIPSupport.  We see that our very own AD is on the broken voice switch, so we get her to call TFH until it drops.  51 seconds.  Another call, 3 minutes and 49 seconds.  Call after call after call, nothing lasts longer than 3 minutes and 52 seconds.  Success!  We can now reproduce the issue on command, without leaving our office.

&gt; VOIPSupport: OK, so let's just reboot the switch and see if that fixes the problem.

&gt; TNG: No, as I said, we want to find out what is wrong with the voice switch, so we can prevent this from happening again in the future.  Telling us just to reboot the phone system whenever we have a problem isn't really a solution.  Isn't there some debugging you can do on the voice switch to find out what's going on?

We know full well the answer to this question.  We've had problems with the equipment in the past that required the vendor to log into the voice switch and enable some more detailed debugging and logs.  We've seen it several times.  We know that as soon as VOIPSupport does this, we'll see something weird and be able to track it down.  But VOIPSupport must not know about this.  He's tier 1, dealing with our tier 3.  So, we follow his script.  TNG and VOIPSupport use a shared screen to look through pages and pages of logs.  We see calls initiated, built, connected, transmitted, terminated, and torn down.  The system reports that each call was ended with ""reason 1,"" or ""normal termination.  We ask VOIPSupport what this means.

&gt; VOIPSupport: I have reviewed the logs with my manager.  That means the call was ended normally.  Hang up or something like that.

&gt; TNG: Except it wasn't.  The call terminated abnormally.  

This process repeats for the half-dozen calls that we have explicit details about, who called whom, when the call was placed, when it ended, etc.  VOIPSupport looks at the logs, finds the call, sees that it terminated normally, puts us on hold for 10 minutes to confer with his manager, and then returns to tell us that the system is working.

Finally, we see something else.  VOIPSupport finds an item in the logs that indicates the voice switch lost communication with the phone.

&gt; VOIPSupport: Well, that means your network is the problem.  The voice switch couldn't talk to the phone.

&gt; TNG: That's not possible.  We aren't seeing packet loss on our network.  I'm looking at the core right now.  I'm looking at the switch where the phone is right now.  And why would it only affect this voice switch?

TNG is nevertheless doubting himself a bit, and so we start looking at everything.  Port statistics on the switch, CRC errors, packet loss, ping the switch, ping the phone, etc.  Meanwhile, VOIPSupport has dug in his heels.


&gt; VOIPSupport: I have confirmed with my manager that this is a network issue.  I'm going to close this ticket as solved, the issue is your network.

&gt; TNG: That's not correct.  We still haven't solved the issue.  I can show you it isn't the network.

&gt; VOIPSupport: Well, I don't know about the architecture of your network, so I can't help you.

&gt; TNG: You aren't hearing me.  Every indicator I have says it isn't the network, and on the other side it only appears to be this one voice switch.

&gt; VOIPSupport: I can forward you to network support, but if they can't fix the issue, it's a paid service.

&gt; TNG: You're telling me you are unwilling to fix this issue?  That I have to pay you fix this?  I want to speak to your supervisor.  I want to escalate this issue.

&gt; VOIPSupport: He's busy.  You can't speak with him.  Whatever you want, I will tell you.

&gt; TNG: You've been going back and forth with your supervisor for the last hour.  I want to speak with him directly.

&gt; VOIPSupport: You cannot.  He is busy.

After a few minutes of this, my blood is boiling a bit.  I'm not known to bite my tongue.  TNG has been on the phone with this guy now for almost 5 hours, with no resolution.  TNG may have the patience to do this all day, but I've got dinner plans with my wife.  I'm done.  I put on my loud, clear, authoritative, ""I want this done now"" voice.

&gt; Me: VOIPSupport, I want your full name, your employee ID number, your telephone number, and your manager's name and number.  We are unsatisfied with the service we have received today, and we would like to follow up with your supervisor.  We want this issue resolved, and we want it done right now.  Please give me the information before you transfer us, immediately, to your supervisor.

After some silence, VOIPSupport agrees to give us his name (""that's my only identification, I don't have a phone number or an ID number,"" he complains) and his email address.  We determine this is satisfactory for the time being.  VOIPSupport give us a different 1-800 number to call for the ""duty supervisor.""  TNG dials, and after speaking to a functionary he is dumped into a cellphone voicemail box for **VOIPManager**  He leaves a number and awaits a callback.

&gt; Me: OK, let's gather some nuclear ammunition.  Packet capture, any logs we can find, ping all the things, dump switch statistics.

&gt; TNG: Agreed.

We cloned AD's port to my machine and fired up WireShark.  Sure enough, three minutes and change into the call WireShark shows a clear pattern.  The phone would send a hearbeat every 4 minutes.  The voice switch would respond ""OK,"" and then (in a fit of multiple personalities) issue a command to reinitialize and reset the phone, which terminated the call.  The phone responded that the call had been terminated, and the voice switch would record that as a normal event.

Finally VOIPManager called back, took down some information, and told us a stateside rep would call us back to further diagnose the issue.  Within a few minutes, we received a call from a man who shared a first name with a top five American metropolis.  He saw the packet capture and the screenshots we had attached to the ticket, said, ""Oh, that's not right,"" and within an hour had gathered extensive debugging from the affected voice switch and other hardware to escalate to the engineering team and get the bug fixed.  They concluded that the voice switch was not actually acknowledging the hearbeat messages, and was sending out the command to reinitialize the phones every four minutes.  Satisfied, TNG rebooted the switch and the problem went away.

**TLDR**: It turns out you can lead a horse to water, show them a picture of what it looks like to drink, and watch them die of dehydration, but they still won't transfer you to a supervisor.

*Edit*: The Cisco IOS, not Apple iOS.  Clarified ""voice switches"" which are a component of the VOIP infrastructure, not vSwitches, which we use on the VMWare side.  And fixed my dumb typos."

I want to bring a friend into it so we both have time to work on it and we share the same love for the specific clothing style. 


I'm stuck on the idea of actually starting this brand.

Would it be smart to hire some graphics designers and make 1-5 shirts and put them on teespring and see how they do before I start looking for clothing manufacturers? 

Should I start a website first? Should I make a desirable social media presence? I don't know where to start with this and I don't want to jump into something I can't control.

Originally, I had planned to do med school. So I took the MCAT, rocked it, taught for kaplan/princeton review for awhile, and then decided not to go to med school for various reasons. There wasn't much for me to do with a BS in biology, so I went back to school to do applied cognitive neuroscience, as neuroscience was what appealed to me most about med school anyway. After starting the program, I became really interested in neural nets, and then dynamical systems, and then intelligent systems, and then machine learning ending up taking several courses outside of my degree plan, due to lack of guidance and a desire to ""learn"", and realized I had done enough for basically half of a masters in computer science. At that point, I applied, was accepted and was allowed/placed into classes that were far beyond what I had anticipated ie (computer architecture), and had a couple bad and incredibly depressing semesters, resulting in tanking my gpa below 3.0, which prevents me from being able to graduate. Currently, I haven't been to school since the spring semester (still in my masters programs, just not taking courses). Since that time, I had an internship in web development, which ended, and I've worked on several independent projects, but I feel like even with the good grades I got in my intelligent systems/dynamical system optimization/machine learning courses, I don't have a chance of getting a job in the field most relevant to my education. I can go back and retake some of those courses and pull my gpa up, but I have already sunk so much money into grad school and feel so burnt out that I'm worried I no longer have to motivation to finish. I'd really like to take some more time off from school and do some work in the field of computational natural language processing, but after submitting several resumes and looking at my competition, I'm guessing I'm not going to have much luck...

some basic information:

- I'll graduate next year and will likely start to apply for jobs in June / July next year. I'll graduate with a BS in Computer Science with network technology as specialization (almost anything from network management to GSM to OSI to optical networks). My GPA isn't the best but I've been told to be quite talented when it comes to programming and I'll receive letters of recommendation from my professors for IT security and Web Architectures.

- I work for a pretty big company as some kind of long-term intern. I've been assigned various tasks and completed each of them without any problems. I used Python, Java and C++ for those tasks, btw. The contract ends with my studies and I probably could continue working for them if I wanted but I'm young enough to be idealistic and to do what I'm interested in.

Information Security came to my attention about two years ago and I still love it. I learned a lot of stuff about the internals of C, C++, Objective-C, Java and C# (and the languages as well, obviously), audited some PHP code (and found vulnerabilities), found XSS vulnerabilities, reversed applications, took more than one look into the Windows internals etc., you name it. Nothing professional except my IT security lectures, though.

Google sounds interesting to me, Valve has an interesting position, several companies like Veracode look cool and so on, there's just one essential problem I'll have to face: 

All of these jobs state they require a BS and sometimes some knowledge of C/C++/PHP.
How realistic is that? What do they actually expect from me? Do they give you any training? How much do entry positions and ""regular"" positions differ? Would I have a realistic chance even though I ""only"" hold German citizenship? [This one](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#!t=jo&amp;jid=8395001&amp;) for instance seems pretty interesting.

Yes, that may sound stupid and naive, especially for someone in his 3rd and final year of university, but I've only had one internship (which I got in no time, it was a small company) and my current job thus far and I'd really like to land a job in Information Security. Maybe that's why I'm so overly self-conscious. Do I worry too much? 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

They sent me back a letter saying they were interested in a second interview and wanted me to apply to specific jobs postings that would be upcoming.  

I went in, looked at all the jobs, and the only one I qualified actually happened to be one of my dream jobs.  I applied, and got a second interview.  During the second interview, they were really impressed and at one point I told them where my ultimate goal was-a slightly different group in their own building.

The interview got a little weird at this point and they asked me if I was interviewing with the company anywhere else.  I told them no.  This struck me as a little odd, so I went and checked the postings.

There was a position with my #1 pick for which group to work with.  Apparently the requisition had been posted a few days after I initially been scheduled for an interview.  I wrote up a cover sheet, applied, and got scheduled for an interview within 5 hours of applying.  

Here is my predicament. The three gentlemen I interviewed know my first pick.  They had to know it was posted.  I want to write them thank you letters, but I should let them know I applied to the other position.

No matter what, I need to tell them I did apply to the other job. Better they hear it from me than, find out half way through the hiring process(that's if they give me an internship).  I don't want to lose the chance at either job, and they were really nice people. 

I've written them personal thank you notes, but not sure how to tell them them they are my second pick.  Here is what I have so far.  Do you think this is wise?

&gt; First and foremost, I want to work for your *company* and *your location* is my first choice.  I did recently apply for one other position at *your location* and will be interviewing next week for that position.  I do feel very strongly about *company* and hold *the original position* in high regard. If I do get the opportunity, I would be going with them as a first choice.   I understand this could be a deal breaker on an internship.  I thank you for the opportunity. I appreciate your consideration and once again, thank you for the opportunity.

That's how I plan to end the thank you letters.  Am I crazy or insane? Does this seem like a good idea? Any idea how to better word this part of the thank you for the interview letters?"

The pay is a little underwhelming off the bat, but there are pay raises each 6 months and I'll be promoted in a year.

This summer, I had an internship in Los Angeles and really liked it there. The company I interned with was facing some labor cost freezes, so while the manager I had there made it clear she wanted to hire me, she didn't have the money to at the time.

Well cut to today - the very day I get the official appointment letter from the job in Washington - I get an email from my former manager in southern California, asking how I'm doing and whether I'm looking for a job. It turns out that as of yesterday the labor cost freeze turned into a labor cost thaw.

Despite the cost of living differences, I've estimated I'd still take home about $10k more in the first year in LA. I'd probably have to formally interview for the job (the job that I'm assuming exists, that is), but I think I'd do well. After the first year though, the take-home pay gap shrinks, though I don't think they'd converge.

To complicate matters, the job in LA fits what I want to do well, but the job in Washington fits what I want to do perfectly. I think I'd be happier on the weekends in LA, but happier at work in Washington.

Your hot takes on this would be greatly appreciated."

Key points:

* Innovation comes from creative monopolies (note: not detrimental monopolies) as the largest companies were able to do something so well that they escaped competition.

* Success for these companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) came from investing their time and energy into an exceptional product that changed an industry.

* Everything comes down to planning. PayPal was able to endure the dot com bust by merging with X.com and by providing a relevant and innovative service.

It's done a lot to motivate the inner entrepreneur in me and only increased my ambition.

2k6c0l,0,2014-10-24,Is it worth even considering this career path for me?,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/2k6c0l/is_it_worth_even_considering_this_career_path_for/,"Hey all, I'm a computer engineering student at a pretty decent school.  GPA is 3.6.  I interviewed first/second round for a couple of summer intern consulting positions but did not receive offers from either.  I did receive an offer for a software engineering position which it looks like I'm going to take.  Unfortunately I absolutely despised my previous co-op position in this line of work.  I don't want to turn this into a self fulfilling prophecy, but it is safe to say that I don't have high expectations for this internship.

Give that I will be doing full time job search next fall (as a January 2016 hire) but don't have any consulting experience under my belt, should I give up on this line of work/practicing cases/etc?  Is it even possible to score a full time position in consulting without any previous experience?  The thought of spending the next 40 years of my life writing code 8 hours a day and being surrounded by engineers is absolutely terrifying."

2k6f8j,6,2014-10-24,Is it a waste of time getting a second degree in Computer Science if you're mostly interested in front-end/UX/design/user issues? What do you suggest is a good move from my position?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2k6f8j/is_it_a_waste_of_time_getting_a_second_degree_in/,"I'm a second-degree student currently finishing up a BA degree in Computer Science, and gunning to start a career on the front-end side of things.

I have the following under my belt: Intro to CS, Data Structures/some algorithms, Discrete Math 1 (i.e., not including probability), Computer Architecture (including assembly, etc.), Calc1, Calc2.

Currently taking: C/systems programming, Linear Algebra, Programming Languages/Theory

I will not be able to take my algorithm design/analysis class if I decide not to get my degree (i.e., I'd learn it on my own.)

As the topic indicates, I'm interested in stuff like front-end, design (as in UX, not graphic, though visual communication is fine), usability... would even consider working in product/marketing role some day.  I'm not really shooting for your typical backend role, and as much as I enjoy CS, I know I'm more passionate about (and naturally predisposed to) thinking about people-issues.   I'm trying to decide whether or not to finish my CS degree the more I realize this, and lose focus feeling like I'm wasting time and money in school, where 90% of the time I end up self-teaching everything anyway (I get very very little out of lectures and learn better at my own pace).  Plus there's useless requirements I need to finish (I love to learn, but not pay thousands for those classes).

A lot of this boils down to how important the CS degree will be for my goals, considering I already have a degree, but still need to break into the industry, have gotten at least halfway into the program already, but don't wish to be in a CS-heavy role.

There's a lot of breadth I want to cover, so I'll try to be specific with my questions:

1)
I'm aware there's been a recent trend of loading more logic onto the client-side.  To what extent does a front-end developer need the hard CS background?  Excluding algorithms (I only know enough about the usual big-O stuff), does my foundation look strong enough to pick up the rest as I go along?  Do most ""front-end roles"" require the hard CS knowledge?  I know there's certainly a demand for front-end developers, but I don't know if that necessarily means the traditional HTML/CSS/JS/design guys, or if that simply means back-end guys working on the ""front,"" but otherwise still doing the same sort of work.  It's hard to tell what this actual ""demand for front-end developers"" entails, or to whom exactly ""skilled front-end developers"" refers to, when the term ""front-end"" is a loose concept.  Are all angular guys classified as those in-demand ""front end developers?"" If the market is likely to dictate me ending up in a role that will still require essentially the same CS background (ie, very strong background in data structures, algorithms, etc.), then I'm wondering if the second CS degree will still be worth it?

2)
I'd like to know on the front-end side of things, if it's possible for me to break in not coming from either a traditional back-end role or a designer role (ie, entry level front-end).  I'm not worried about my work ethic and ability to build a portfolio/projects etc., but I don't want to fight an unnecessarily difficult battle, because it seems most people eventually move into the front-end from either of those two roles.  Obviously I will want to snag an internship first.  I know there's solid demand for well-prepared python/ruby/js interns, but what about front-end?

3)
Assuming I stay for at least another semester (I have reasons), I'm curious to know what classes would be useful for a front-end role.  For instance, I wondered if OS would be of any use, or if that would be overkill (I've read OS is a useful class, and recalled reading it would introduce you to effective techniques/concepts analogous to the way the internet/the browser works, but that's beyond my understanding at this point).  It's a pretty time-consuming class at my university and it's time I could spend building my portfolio/learning something else.  There's also a database class that touches some practical things, but I suspect it's the type of stuff I'd end up picking up out of necessity, unlike OS which may best be learned in a university setting.

Alternatively, on the other spectrum, I could take classes related to cognitive science/psych and information architecture/visualization.  There's an HCI/usability class too which is probably a definite on my list.

Input here appreciated.  I guess I'm asking if I should milk as much hard-CS knowledge as I can still, or if it's not very worthwhile given where I see myself in 5 years.

4)
One last thing: since the decision to drop a class I will make for myself, I'd like to narrow my question to -- which class do you think is LEAST useful for a front-end developer: C/systems programming, linear algebra, or a programming languages/theory class.

--

If anyone has any other general insight into the nature of my question, feel free to chime in!  Thank you so much.

2k6m0d,5,2014-10-24,2.76GPA. What do I do now to boost my chances of getting an internship (and later a good job)?,Hauzron,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2k6m0d/276gpa_what_do_i_do_now_to_boost_my_chances_of/,"I'm a Junior doing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I have a 2.76 GPA. I learned C# and some web development languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript a little PHP back when I was around 14-15. I stopped programming for a while and since then all I've really learnt is C++ in university. I consider C++ do be the language I'm most proficient in now. I don't really know the full syntax and more advanced parts of C++. I'm taking Data Structures and Algorithms right now in university. I've also forgotten some of the more advanced parts of C#.

I did some projects on freelancer.com (formerly getafreelancer.com ) back when I was around 15 years old. Mainly psd to html conversions. I also did one C# project on freelancer.com a couple of month ago.

Here's my old freelancer.com profile: https://www.freelancer.com/u/WebDeveloperr.html I've made a new one although I haven't done any projects on it yet.

That and a 2.76 GPA are all I have under my belt and I have to get an internship in Summer 2015. A 6 week internship is mandatory to graduate in my university. What do languages do I learn now? What skills do I develop next? What can I do to boost my chances of getting a good internship?

It's probably obvious by now but I'm more interested in the software side of computer engineering than the hardware side. Not that much interested in web development anymore. Despite that I bought an arduino starter kit a while ago. I haven't done much with it yet or completely learnt how it works. Just did the blinking lights project.


Also how exactly does github work? I've seen it get mentioned a lot on here.

EDIT: In case your wondering why I suddenly stopped learning around 16 years old, I kind of lost my passion for programming. I was actually a civil engineering student during my first year before deciding I wanted to be in a technological field and switched to computer engineering.

EDIT 2: Forgot to add this. I live in the UAE. Dubai.

2k6wmt,10,2014-10-24,"Going back to school part time, working full time. Feel like I am wasting valuable time.",electrikmayham,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2k6wmt/going_back_to_school_part_time_working_full_time/,"This may or may not be something that is reasonably answered but I figured I would ask anyways.

**Background**

I am a 33 year old male. I am single and I have no kids. I was in the Army for 2 years in the early 2000's and was Honorably Discharged due to a non combat injury. I did not qualify for the GI bill so I basically disregarded college. I got a job in IT and have been there since.

Recently I realized that college was something I not only needed, but wanted. I took some classes over the summer and am currently enrolled in 9 credit hours. I am also working full time. So far I have a 4.0 GPA and the classes seem to come fairly easy to me. I have plenty of time to do my homework while working. I feel like I could take on more of a class load while working but it may hinder my grades, which I am not willing to risk.

Every day I go to class and I feel invigorated and happy. I get to learn and I get out of the house. Then I have to go to work and I feel like I am wasting my time. With my current class plan I won't be able to transfer to a University until Fall 2017, a full 3 years. This assumes that I take a class during EVERY semester, including the Winter and Spring minimester (which are very stressful) and each summer term.

I am lucky enough to be from Texas which lets me use the Hazelwood act. This exempts me from tuition (not fees or books) for classes I take at public colleges. I have a financial plan for the next 3 years that hopefully puts me in a position to not have to take loans for what I will owe when I transfer (living expenses, fee's, books etc).

I feel like taking a lighter class load and working is wasting my time. I feel like I could take more classes and succeed quicker if I wasnt working but I have no clue how to get into that position while being able to prepare myself for University financially. 

I'm also running into an issue where my major (CS) requires internships which I cannot have due to my full time job. The University I want to transfer to (University of Texas) is so competitive that they are denying CS transfer students with a 4.0 gpa. I feel like I don't have enough time to have extracurricular's to make my application competitive enough to get in.

Does anyone have any good advice? Has anyone gone back to school and stopped working full time? How did it affect you? How did you go about doing it?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[As a gentleman getting ready to purchase an engagement ring, what is the best way to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible either online or with a brick and mortar jeweler?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clik1gx?context=5)|Honestly, our margins are usually less than just the sales tax that you'd pay at a retail store, so you can save a lot of money just by buying online. You can also save money by sending a bank wire instead of paying with a credit card, since the credit card processor takes 3% off the top.  Even if an online jewelry retailer doesn't specify that they'll accept bank wires, they'd probably give you a discount if you called them up and asked.  edit: Blue Nile is probably the largest online diamond retailer, and due to their volume discounts from suppliers, it can be hard for other suppliers to match their prices.  However, their jewelry is mass-produced, so if I was going to buy an engagement ring, I'd probably get a slightly smaller diamond and pay $100-$200 more to get it custom-designed so you have something unique.  Jewelers will do this locally.  We do it too, and send computer-rendered images of the CAD design to the customer until our CAD guys get it right.  edit2: There's actually a significant jump in price at popular carat sizes.  I guess a lot of people go into this saying they want at least X carats, and then end up not getting anything below that.  So you can buy a 0.94 carat diamond for quite a bit less than a 1.00 carat diamond, even though pretty much no one would be able to notice the size difference.  In fact, some diamond polishers will even cut a diamond poorly just so they can make it a little bigger and push it over the one-carat mark or the two-carat mark.  We keep an eye out for this though, and would make sure not to sell these diamonds.
[Any reddit discount code?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clik1gx?context=5)|Actually, I did make a Reddit discount code when I was writing creating the backend for our coupon system, that I'd planned to post in /r/jewelry until I read their no-advertising policy.  It's ""colby2012"".  Heh heh.
[Is there any real reason nowadays that artificial diamonds are seen as a poor cousin of natural ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clikc8c?context=5)|Because there's no guarantee that lab-made diamonds will continue to have value.  Natural diamonds are rare enough that we can guarantee that even if they find a bunch of new deposits, they'll never going to be so cheap to extract that the price of diamonds will fall dramatically.
 |Right now, artificial diamonds are hard and expensive to make.  They use a technology called ""carbon vapor deposition"" where they essentially shoot a thin mixture of methane and hydrogen with microwave radiation, trying to create carbon atoms floating around that aren't bonded to anything.  Eventually, they bond either to a diamond seed crystal, which grows it, or the hydrogen, which makes it turn back into methane.  This process takes a really long time, and requires tons of energy.  For diamonds larger than a carat, it's usually cheaper to buy a natural diamond.
 |If you want to get something that is very difficult to distinguish from a natural diamond and wouldn't have any value to a jeweler or diamond trader, you may as well get a cubic zirconia or moissanite.
 |TL;DR: The main reason people are willing to pay as much as they are for natural diamonds is because they know that they'll continue to have value.
[Isn't the only reason diamonds have any value due to very shady diamond wholesalers who buy up all the diamonds and store them, as to not flood the market while simultaneously creating a fake scarcity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/climt73?context=5)|That used to be the case with De Beers in the 1980s, but then a bunch of diamond mines opened in Russia and Canada that De Beers wasn't able to get, and they ended up losing a bunch of money and their diamond stockpiles.  De Beers still controls about 40% of the world's diamond mines, but they're no longer able to control the supply like they used to.
[If you have ever tried to resell any diamond smaller and 3-4 karats, you will see how much ""value"" diamonds have.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljf6ya?context=5)|I work for a diamond company, we do that all the time!  The trouble is, you've got to find a buyer first, so to get the full wholesale value, you usually have to let it sit in the market listings for a while until it gets sold.  If you want to get your money NOW though, then you'll have to settle for a lower price so it can sell more easily.
[You can tell the copy apart. Diamonds aren't like that, are they? If one of each were put into a bag and you randomly pulled one out, could you determine which was 'real'? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cliugy4?context=5)|You wouldn't be able to tell a copy from an original, I'd imagine.  But an art expert could.  Same goes for diamonds.  A trained gemologist can tell a CVD diamond from a natural one.
[It is in terms of the cost of paint and canvas etc.  The cost of these paintings are subjective as are diamonds.  Yes diamonds are rare and hard to extract but aside from industrial applications, they hold no value whatsoever except as a concocted status symbol.  It's just a freaking rock.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cliuz9g?context=5)|Well, diamonds have been particularly valuable as gemstones in ancient India, as well as Greece and Rome, so it's not like De Beers just decided to make them valuable in the 1930s.  They were always valuable before then, it's just that only nobility could afford them.
[Says De Beers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cliqhnw?context=5)|I wish I had their money.  We're just retailers.
[*Again, the main reason natural diamonds are more valuable than synthetic ones is because of their known scarcity.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clj3huo?context=5)|The reason I prefaced with those questions is because they're the ones I tend to get asked on REDDIT, because Reddit is often up their own asses with their own fiction about how doomed they think the diamond industry is.  Look, if you or anyone else wants to buy a synthetic diamond, NO ONE CARES.  Go to [Link to www.gemesis.co](http://www.gemesis.co) and buy one.  Or buy a CZ.  It's your decision.  But if some day your girlfriend tells you she wants a natural diamond ring as opposed to a synthetic one, it's precisely because she wants you to spend a lot of money on her, not because of the arrangement of the carbon atoms.
[Exactly. Time Warner is doesn't have a monopoly either. There's other companies to compete with them, like Comcast. This keeps the market competitive and balanced.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clinstc?context=5)|The difference is, there are hundreds of diamond mining companies on four different continents.  Russia's a major player too, and they don't like cooperating with anyone.  They were actually instrumental in breaking up the De Beers monopoly in the 1990s.
[Are you impressed by the ability of your industry to assert that 'natural' diamonds are far superior (and thus more expensive\) to man-made diamonds, when at the atomic level, they are identical?  Do you rub your hands with glee knowing your industry can set any price it wants for an essentially worthless piece of carbon?  Do you feel slightly bad that you're selling rocks to people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clilg1z?context=5)|Why do you think diamonds are worthless?  Diamonds are worthless in the same way that Picasso paintings are worthless, despite being made out of fairly common elements.  Just because you wouldn't pay what they sell for, doesn't mean they don't have value.  Do you think that mine built itself?  Or rather, do you think anyone would have built it if diamonds were worthless?  edit: As far as feeling bad, of course not.  Historically, a lot of diamond retailers have manipulated customers into buying crappy diamonds that were cut it a way that they could make it a larger carat size, even though it looked like crap.  We're focused on a business model of much more honest and open communication with our customers, and making it a policy to not sell overpriced crap.  Also, we've been able to bring on two developers as interns, then hire them full time.  We also have a lot more sales staff per customer than our competitors, and our goal is to buck the trend that's going the opposite direction.  So in that sense, I'm actually kind of proud of what we've been able to do.  Our customers all know exactly what they're buying, so why would I feel bad for them?
[Link to en.wikipedia.org.  13 cents.  Sure, there are less diamonds per ton compared to copper (0.6% of the copper ore is actually copper\).  But even if it was 1000x harder to get diamonds out of diamond ore, the price would only be $1.30 per carat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clio0ss?context=5)|One gram per ton is considered really good for diamond ore.  Also, they have to be sorted optically, as opposed to chemically, like copper is.  
[The price setting mechanism for an authentic diamond is, as I understand it, controlled by a single entity and not by a broader market.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|This was the case up until the early 1990s, when the USSR broke up and Russian diamond mines started selling on the global market.  De Beers tried to absorb them like they'd done with new mines before, but the Russians were having none of it.  (Surprised?)  They ended up losing a lot of money trying to buy up the lower-priced inventory, and ended up losing a lot of money in addition to their market domination.  IIRC they're still the largest diamond mining group, but control less than 40% of the market rather than the 80-90% they used to.
[The main distinctions, as you write, are that GIA does not certify industrial diamonds and it is possible to detect ""differences"" in industrial diamonds, though as I understand it industrial diamonds may be more pure than those found in nature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|TL;DR: Yes, diamonds are controlled mainly by market forces now, like other commodities.
[To me, a price setting monopoly  combined with a regulatory authority like GIA to create a barrier to substitute products](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|You're oversimplifying things, but essentially, there are only a few types of inclusions that show up in CVD (synthetic) diamonds, and they tend to form a pattern that isn't found in natural diamonds.  So gemologists will use inclusions in a natural diamond to quickly rule it out as being synthetic without having to check with UV or X-ray.
[are not characteristics of an asset class whose price is rational and if those barriers were removed, the price of diamonds globally would fall.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|There are a ton of substitute products out there.  People had the same worries when they started producing gemstone-quality CZs in the 1970s.  They were not born out.
[So in theory, diamonds could become close to worthless but the analogy to Picasso is not valid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|Oh you mean if GIA started not distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds in certificates?  You realize that's like the US Federal Reserve deciding to let anyone print their own money, right?
 |There are no perfect analogies in any other commodity, but the closest I can come up with is somewhere between art and precious metals, since diamonds have characteristics of both.  Another analogy might be gold-plated jewelry vs. solid gold.

2k80x5,1,2014-10-24,Community College?,[deleted],InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/2k80x5/community_college/,"Hi everyone! I hope this is okay to post here. I want to work in IT and need opinions about community college associate degree programs. My experience level with computers and technology is basically the same as any other 24 year old's. I'm good, but I wouldn't be able to land an IT job right now and really know what I'm doing or anything. Do you all think associate programs at community colleges actually teach you the skills you need to work in IT? I'm interested in networking or just general IT support and troubleshooting. The program I'm looking at has classes such as CISCO Fundamentals, Visual Basic, Fundamentals of UNIX/Linux, Windows Directory Services, and more. Certain classes say you will be academically prepared to take certification exams afterwards. It also has a co-op class where apparently they set you up with an internship type deal. My work experience is only customer service--nothing IT related. And as I said, I just have pretty basic knowledge right now. Has anyone else went into a CC program with hardly any knowledge? Did you learn enough to actually work in IT? Any advice or opinions would be great!"
2k85i9,1,2014-10-24,Seattle Chills,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2k85i9/seattle_chills/,"Do you remember that ""memory rewrites itself"" no sleep a while back, I feel like one or two of my specifics like the color of the cars may have been rewritten in my brain, but I remember all most all of that night. This is not well written, just a recollection of a recent happening. 


Anyways, let me lay some background on you.
I went to a massive high school, I graduated with 900 kids, and the other schools in our area literally called us the green army. However, regardless of its size everyone knew the popular girls. There was this popular girl named Lexi in my high school math class that thought was absolutely gorgeous. Eventually we started flirting for some time, and I managed to get her number, and things were looking pretty good. High school crush stuff. Anyways, I knew she had roid head x-boyfriend that was somewhat in the picture but I did not think anything of it. One day I see him at my work, which was our high school spot to be, CDI. I feel like we has staring me down but I figured it was just a coincidence, till I get a text from her saying, Kevin’s at your work, he knows we have been talking and he is pretty mad, be careful he’s the stalker type. Well shit I thought, holy fuck this roid head could totally beat my video game playing ass into the ground. I was like 6” 140lbs soaking wet haha. As far as I remember I just told my boss who was an in-training MMA player (so I felt protected) and nothing went down. Lexi and I kinda stopped talking after that.


Fast forward, to July of this year. Well I guess I forgot one thing, about June I sent her a Facebook message which is now weirdly gone, I just checked for it. But I was just checking in on her, she was a cool regardless, and always a well-intentioned person. Basically the typical what have you been up to, where are you headed kind of thing. So July rolls around, I’m on CO-OP for the second time which is an extended internship through college, I get three credits to maintain my finical aid and then I get to go work for a company for about 8 months. On my first visit to Seattle with my company, I was leading a coating application study, I was basically a field engineer, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and I see “RIP Lexi” all over, so I do some digging and found out she was in a car accident at 3am NY time on a Sunday, dead on impact (remember this this is important). This hit me slightly harder than I expect, sure I’ve had tons of family die, a couple of people I know die in college, and from high school, but I actually used to text this girl a lot, I don’t know, it was just harder than I expected to cope. Anyways I knew she liked to party, so I had a margarita in her name at dinner that night. 

Fast forward 3 weeks, I’m back in Seattle, doing the same old bottle testing and changing application parameters. The weekend comes around, now the rental company gave me a free upgraded to a Camaro, so I put about 800miles on that thing (gas was paid for the car was paid for, unlimited miles, why not). I drove up to see my cousin for the weekend, who lives an hour north of Seattle. We played some magic pack battles and just talked because I see her once every 5 years this was extremely convenient to be in Seattle on business. It seems like I have family where ever I go. On my way back to the hotel , I had about 20min left to drive, I was driving on a four lane high way in the pouring rain, imagine, raining in Seattle. Anyways, all of the sudden something moving upwards catches my attention to the right of me, it’s a jeep, flying up in the air, idk if it hit a deer or a bump I have no idea but my adrenaline was starting to flow, as it lands a car in front of it comes sliding to a halt in front of me (maybe it hit the right wall of the highway and bounced off), so I’m slamming on my breaks with all my might, as shrapnel is flying everywhere, and as I’m sliding around I look to my right and another car is flying directly at my passenger side (3 cars so far), so I gun it and drift around the two cars just barely missing the car in front of me and to my side, by the time I look at the speedometer I’m going 120mph and far away from the crash, then I’ll I remember is pulling into the hotel. I look at the clock it’s about 20min past midnight, so I might have spaced out for the rest of the ride back. I’m not saying I’m good at drifting but I can’t believe I drove that well in that situation, I always thought I would just lose my shit and die. I drive a 02 ford ranger I got from my grandfather, which is a rear wheel drive (Camaro is rear wheel too) so I’m used to drifting in a rear wheel vehicle. I’m still a bit freaked out from what just happened so I decide to take a long hot shower and relax a bit, I put the song on “need to feel loved (Adam k and Soha vocal mix)” on repeat. I find it relaxing and need to relax because I have work at 6am. I was probably in the shower for an hour or so just letting the water hit me. I get out text a few friends about what happened to get it off my chest think about what I am going to tell my parents so they don’t freak out.  Everytime I almost die my mom loses her shit.  So I’m getting ready for bed and I tell Siri to set an alarm for 5:30am and she says “the alarm is set” and I go to get cozy into my king size hotel bed, not 10 seconds later my Iphone decides to start playing music, it’s the song tracking treasure down by Gabriel and Dresden (mixed for feet version) except it’s not at the beginning its at 4:20 into the song where it says “at the same time” 9 times real slow. Suddenly I realize at same time 3 weeks ago 12am Seattle time is 3am NY time I nearly avoided an accident and Lexi died in one. I got the craziest chill traversing my entire body for what felt like an eternity. 

I love trance/edm music and most of my favorite songs give me the chills, but none quite compare to what tracking treasure down does to me now.

I'm having some concerns about my graduation coming up in May. I'm an MIS / Social Science double major with ~2.8 GPA, no internships (currently looking for a spring internship and might go with a summer internship after I graduate if I can find one). I'm really conflicted with the career path I want to take.

On one hand I'm probably best suited for a BI/Data Analytics role, maybe some kind of Database/SQL work. 
I've been getting pretty interested in Web Dev(leaning towards backend), however, currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and Python on my own time. 

Is there any way I can combine these or advice for entry-level work? I'm kind of overwhelming myself a little but for my next semester all I need is either 2 classes or an internship so I'll have more free time for learning/projects.

Thanks in advance guys.

What's the best course of action for me? Should I even bother applying to grad school? I don't know if my GPA will even go above a 3.0 even if I get 4.0s for the rest of my undergraduate degree. Should I get a Master's first and then pursue a PhD?

Is it realistic for me at all to consider a grad school? I need to know to decide if I'm going to spend my time on finding research positions or finding internships in firms."

I am a student studying at a university in Texas. I live in an apartment outside of campus. I recently got into iPhone app programming and have considered the idea of releasing apps on the app store and making money from ads (the apps would be free). I am on an F-1 visa, which prohibits working outside the university in the united states, unless it is an approved internship (related to my studies).

I want to know if it would be legal for me to release apps using my permanent address in my home country of Switzerland, with all payments going directly to that bank account from Apple. Essentially, I would upload apps under an account which has an address registered in Switzerland, and with payments going to an account in Switzerland, all while doing the work and the upload from my computer in Texas while I am still in college.

Now I think someone is watching me.",ns_throw_away,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2k9zx7/i_think_something_has_happened_to_me_but_i_dont/,"I don’t know where to start. I suppose I’ve always been very introverted, but aware of it to the extent that I forced myself into an artificial extroversion in order to compensate. I did well at school, but I wasn’t part of the nerd crowd. I had interests, but no real hobbies. I wasn’t cool enough to be popular, but I didn’t stand out enough to draw the attention of bullies. I had a large pool of friends, but no one really close, and that’s just the way I liked it.

I grew up in a small town you’ve probably never heard of, and when I was old enough, I left. I live in [city] now,  I work as an intern in a big company. It’s a paid position, but the wage is minimal, what it pays just about gives me enough to eat, so I work a second job to cover rent, my car, and pay off my loans. I don’t have a great deal of free time, but when I do have a few hours to myself I like to walk.

I don’t sleep very much. No more than three hours a day. I don’t even sleep at night, mostly, but in break times. An hour here, an hour there. I tried that sleep-rhythm thing, where you set up mini-naps during the day, but my schedule wouldn’t allow it, and it just felt... I don’t know, false.

Anyway, this is all a ramble. I’m sorry.

So, I like to walk. I like antiques. So one of the things I like to do when I’m in a new place (we went on holiday to Paris when I was five, my dad told me I spent half the time in old markets staring at brass ornaments and cracked porcelain statues) is to hunt for pawnbrokers, antique shops, markets and the like. I don’t collect antiques, but I do buy things. Not very often, but sometimes I get a feel for something, and I buy it, and I’m usually able to sell it again on the internet for a small profit.

It was during one of my walks that I saw *her*.

I’m not a stalker. But I did stalk her. She wasn’t what I would call beautiful, but she did stand out in a way. I can’t explain it. It was as though, for a moment as she passed me on the street, she had a glow about her. She was about my height, maybe taller in heels, heavy about the hips, a little too wide in the shoulders. She had bobbed hair, with low bangs, dark, and dark eyes and thick lips. It wasn’t lust that made me follow her, it was, if anything, an echo of that same internal mechanism that alerted me to the presence of a saleable piece. I just knew that I was meant to follow her. Not following her was impossible.

She walked with a single minded sense of purpose, her gaze fixed forward, her attention turned inward upon her own thoughts. I recognised the look, and welcomed her as a kindred soul. I followed her until she reached what I was sure was her apartment; an assumption I confirmed over the course of a week. Her building was close to where I lived, and later, when I found out what floor she was on, I realised I could just about see her front room from my bedroom window. Coincidence lay upon coincidence.

Over the months that followed, I developed a routine based around her. I found out her name, where she worked, where she shopped for groceries, the delis she frequented during her breaks, which ones she avoided. I found out she enjoyed theatre, had few close friends, and bought books about far off countries in small, out-of-the-way bookstores. I followed her into restaurants, into clothing stores, I found out where she did her laundry. I even managed to steal a few items of her clothing. Nobody noticed.

All this time I kept myself hidden. I flirted with the idea of coming clean, of one day confronting her and saying, “I’m here,” but I always held back. It was just a fantasy. In reality, I had no desire to make myself known to her. I didn’t want to *do* anything to her. I didn’t want her company or her conversation, but her presence in my life was becoming a necessity. If I couldn’t sleep before, it was impossible now without having seen her through my window, or followed her for half a block on the street. 

It was a problem. But I hit upon an idea. I would create my own version of her. I bought clothes in the same styles as she wore. I bought the perfumes that she liked. I dedicated one corner of my apartment to creating - as near as I could - a replica of her front room in my own front room. Right down to the books on the book case, the clothes strewn haphazardly on the floor. Everything would be identical. I would create a lacuna, and she would fill it.

Then, one day, a week ago, she disappeared.

I was admitted to a top tier institution for computer science. I'm here because a professor at my undergrad liked me and had lots of clout and vouched for me to be here. I'm a master's student, but I have full funding doing research because my old professor convinced someone here to take me on.

**My plan**: I'm doing AI research in the aerospace sector, but I really don't care that much about it. I want to get my Masters and go work for a company doing AI. I think aerospace is interesting but I really don't have background in it and so far I'm not convinced it's an industry I want to work in.

**My advisor's plan**: She thinks I worked in my undergrad prof's lab (I never did). I never told her I did and my undergrad professor never said I did, I think she just assumed. Even though we've established I'm here for a Master's, I get the feeling she expects me to convert to a PhD. She constantly says things about ""you need to do X if you want to convert to a PhD"". 

I'm not really lying about anything, but I feel like I'm withholding my true intentions because I want someone to pay for my two years of a master's (shit's expensive, plus now I get a stipend). I'd like to find an internship over the summer, but feel that doing so makes it obvious I'm not interested in a PhD, so I'll likely stay and do research. 

So there. I feel like an ass and like I'm living a lie. "

**Company C:** (no offer yet but I should hear next week)

* San Francisco
* Rent: $$$
* Pay: $$$
* Large tech ""startup"" in the valley; Very popular product with recent successful fund raising; Consumer facing product; I've gathered it's a great culture but only from YouTube videos from the company and stuff like TechCrunch cribs.

So what's signal here and what's noise? Am I making a mistake if I go to Chicago? Will I be stuck there? Do the networking opportunities in SF outweigh working on a product I care more about?

Thanks a bunch for any and all suggestions/help!"

Internship in Germany, EPC company, in the electrical team, using ETAP and analysing electrical networks in petrochemical plants.

FACT 1: This wednesday I have an appointment with HR and my boss, regarding my future in the company. Huge company.
FACT 2: This monday I'll have an skype interview with a potential employer in Spain, more or less the same job but using SKM. Really small company.

Questions:
1) Is it ok if I use the potential offer I'll get the monday to level the potential offer of the wednesday?

2) German electrical engineers, what's the usual entry-level salary in a big company like the one I am interning in? I have already researched, and found 35k-42k might be the interval. Is this interval true? More? Less?

3) Any extra advice?

Now i know my school is a pretty crappy school very small college (Vaughn College of Aeronautics) so i didn't expect to get a job with google or anything like that but to not even get one is depressing. I have a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering Technology Graduated with a 3.6 GPA and even worked an Internship with Bombardier Aerospace my Junior year as an Engineering technician making a cool $17/Hour at the flight test center in Kansas. Yet for someone reason employers see Bombardier on my resume and its's like they say no that company is shit. I have another friend who worked a internship with Bombardier and can't get a job either and he to thinks its the fact that it's Bombardier and the fact that they are not really respected in the industry. Im starting to believe that too i mean i have some friends with no job internships and wee able to get jobs. I am desperate right now and willing to move anywhere in the United States to find a good paying job.

Also, I've been looking into these two degrees for a while now and still haven't been able to form a decision between choosing one over the other. My goal is to become a front end web developer/mobile app developer. I've been looking at the curriculums for both degrees and, to me, it seems like DAS is the more creative/interactive path whereas CS seems to be more technical. I know that an outstanding portfolio is more valuable and important than what degree you have, but I want to take advantage of my 4 years in college and gain as much knowledge that could potentially be useful my future career. Therefore, I'd like to talk to any current or former students of either of these two degrees, or anyone that knows any helpful information that could help me in making a decision about which major to choose. What's the biggest difference between DAS and CS? What would be better for what I want to do? Are there good internship opportunities for students of either major in the Gainesville area?

I have experience mostly in a small SF startup (pre-series A) doing full stack web development. I am definitely most interested in doing backend development, as I am intersted in algorithm and optimization. Here are my options:

**Company A:**

Startup that is well funded and growing fast. I would be doing full stack web development. The team seems smart and the product is pretty legit. The team right now has around 10 engineers.

My fear in taking company A is that I would only have startup experience going into my job search, and I don't really want to limit myself to only going to startups because I am not sure that's the lifestyle I want. I would get more hands on experience here I think, and I would get to work on back end stuff.

**Company B**


Large, well-known company where I would be doing front-end stuff. It would be a great looking internship on my resume and the work seems very interesting as far as front end engineering goes.

My fear in taking company B would be that I would then end up as a front end developer in my first job. I am not sure how much career mobility I would have if I decide that front end development is not for me. However I think this would be a better company for me to work for from a lifestyle standpoint and from a financial standpoint.

2kci3b,1,2014-10-26,Diagnosed during childhood (ADHD-PI) in US. On Adderall for 3 years. Parents took me off (didn't think it was an issue). Now at university in UK and think ADHD is causing problems.,EwanB,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2kci3b/diagnosed_during_childhood_adhdpi_in_us_on/,"Warning: Wall of text. I'd be grateful if you read it as there's a lot of background but there is a TL;DR.

I spent 8 years in the US as a kid (2-10), and at 7 was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, and spent 3 years on Adderall. My parents are Brits and this was during a lot of controversy over ADHD being overdiagnosed, so they were pretty skeptical. They eventually had me go through a full neuropsychological evaluation with a doctor well-known locally for rejecting bad ADHD diagnoses. He confirmed that the diagnosis was good and I was a good case for medication. However, I was also on another drug for a childhood seizure disorder at the time and it was a possibility that the seizure disorder was related to my ADHD symptoms. My parents decided that they didn't like the idea of my being on Adderall (British parents think American kids are overmedicated), and thought it might just be related to my seizure disorder, so they took me off.

I'm now 23 and at a top university in the UK. I recently had some problems including not getting a graduate job offer after an internship, partially due to lack of attention to detail, and having to take a year out of university because I couldn't focus on studying for finals. Instead I spent 2 months during revision period hyperfocusing on various TV series. I would sit down with my notes to study and would find myself thinking about a series non-stop, and honestly found it hard to focus on anything else until I had finished the series. I never had this issue before, achieving in the top 20% of students at my university, but the idea of spending months doing nothing but revising old material for exams was just something I couldn't seem to get to grips with. I did maybe a few hours work total during this time, most of it organising my revision notes.

I had completely forgotten my ADHD diagnosis and my being medicated as a child, and only found out about this again a few days ago. I found out because I looked up ADHD, thought I fit the symptoms for ADHD-PI and told my parents I was planning to get tested.

I've looked through the previous threads on this sub on getting diagnosed and treated by the NHS, especially those pertaining to adult ADHD. But I had a few questions that weren't answered and would be interested to get some information, if anyone has had a vaguely similar experience.

Firstly, I saw some people had trouble with GPs rejecting that ADHD was an issue because they were at university. It seems like my childhood diagnosis (which I have documentation for) should help with this but does anyone have other tips for managing this? Apart from switching GPs if they continue to reject it out of hand, which I intend to do.

Secondly, my university counselling service has a psychiatrist on staff, and I wondered whether going to see them and getting a note saying I should see a specialist would be useful when approaching my GP?

Thirdly, I don't have much in the way of academic records apart from grades from high school, and these are top percentile good. They don't show that my teachers regularly called me out on being inattentive, putting very little effort in when I wasn't interested, and regularly daydreaming and falling asleep in class when I wasn't interested. Provided I have a childhood diagnosis, would it still be valuable to contact former teachers for written input? I feel like my grades may screw up people's perception without background, but it'd be a lot of effort to get background.

Finally, any other advice about managing the process? I am in a position to go private if necessary, but I'd prefer to avoid it if possible and I'd like to know how to make the NHS route as painless and quick as I can (knowing that quick and painless rarely describes the NHS on mental illness).

**TL;DR 23 year old British student at university in the UK, got childhood diagnosis for ADHD in the US and was on Adderall for 3 years before my parents took me off (British parents think American kids are overmedicated), now having problems which I think are at least partially caused by ADHD. Any advice for the process of getting tested and potentially medicated by the NHS? I have read previous threads on the subject and looking for anything missing that might relate specifically to my situation of having a childhood diagnosis and previously being medicated.**"

I never reported him because to be honest I didn't think it was my place to. If he cheats knowing the consequence, and he still does, you know power to him.

I had a pervious engineering internship, and I think one of my biggest flaws is my GPA. I have a 2.9, and a major GPA of 3.0. One thing I have always been proud of, is everything I turned in or took was on my own merit. Countless nights studying, hours working on homework, I did it on my own or with my study group. 

But the other guy, who does nothing, I found received 3 different offers for internships.  He has a pretty decent GPA, because of his abilities. And companies went after it. I am so upset and depressed that I didn't get anything. I am a petroleum engineering major, and most of our recruitment takes place in the fall. I know a lot of engineers in my place that don't have a single internship.

My local community college offers an [AAS in Information Technology](http://www.umt.edu/catalog/colleges-and-schools/missoula-college/applied-computing-and-electronics/aas-network-management/default.php) with a Network Management option and the classes seem more aligned with what I'd like to do and need to know.

I know I could just get some certifications and try to break into IT, but I think school provides opportunities through networking and internships that will be worthwhile when I graduate and look for work.

First off, thank you for taking the time to read this. I'll try to be short. 

Background: I'm from Phoenix, AZ. So I may be unaware of what may be considered common sense in regards to driving in the rain and driving on a road that is inlaid with metal tracks for public transportation (Portland street car in my case). I've been in Eugene, OR for 4.5 years so I know to how to drive in the rain, just not when I'm forced to share a lane with public transportation tracks. 

Incident: It was raining. I was driving on a road that had metal tracks for the Portland street car in my lane. The road was slightly downhill and curved left ~90degrees. I was coming to a stop at a red light. As I came to a stop, my tires came into contact with the tracks and I lost control of my vehicle. My foot was already riding the brake, so I began pumping my brakes (I don't have ABS). I slid down the track about 7 feet and instead of curving with the track, my vehicle continued straight and slammed into the curb. 

I'm an alert driver and my vehicle has been functioning perfectly. There is no doubt in my mind that the accident would not have happened if you removed the tracks or if there had been a sign warning me of how slippery they get. 

Damages: My vehicle may be totaled, it suffered frame damage.  I will know tomorrow, but the first mechanic told me it'd be about 50/50 chance they could fix it. KBB on the vehicle is $1700 and I was told I could probably get around 700-800 for scrap since it still runs. If it can be repaired I was told it would be a few hundred dollars. 

My neck and back have felt very stiff since the collision, but I have not seen a doctor as of yet. 

I am working as an intern while I pursue my Masters degree. Not having a vehicle would likely force me to quit the position. 

Question: Is the city of Portland legally liable for anything here? How should I proceed?"

Growing up though, the main driver was me leaving my parents place, i know, typical. Never took intrests in what I did, and when they did, none of it was really good enough or noteworthy rather. That coupled with them fighting, silent dinners for most of my life, and them fighting me on everything, made it huge motivator for me to leace.

But before that I took a forced gap year because of things I just couldnt control (FASFA issues since im an immigrant). It was a huge ego check for me first of all, but it also crushed the thing that drove my life for most of my teen years. It was like getting something youve always wanted, giving it to you, then putting it on a glass display and telling you to come back in a year.

So now we're here. Where I feel detached from everything. I do research here, im a TA, I have great grades, and a solid list of internships so my time is busy, but I dont feel attached to everything.

I should add i got to school in NYC and I know that has something to do with it, but I know its not normal.

I have gone from someone that can talk to anyone, anytime, to always feeling out of place and just uncomfortable.

I am a CS major at a good state school, one of the better state schools for CS. I am thinking about internships this coming summer as I should begin applying during the winter. 

I have a low gpa, about 2.6, as of the end of Spring 14 semester. I had high hopes of improving that this semester with a 4.0 semester, but that is appearing to be very unlikely. I am taking what is commonly known as the weed out course here and finding it difficult along with another class. I think I could manage a 3.0. I may be able to do better but I am trying to be realistic - I probably can't improve my overall GPA a whole lot this semester.

Here are the more redeeming aspects of my resume:

* Built a website 4 years ago that I have maintained ever since. Received over 10M impressions and grossed ~$40k in advertising revenue so far. Worked with advertisers and sometimes hired content writers. Top in its niche.

* Started a technology repair business this semester where I repair phones/computers out of my dorm room. Should reach $10k revenue by the time I apply.

* A few assorted projects/webapps. One of them got some neat press from Mashable/CNET/some other places.

* Did an internship at a startup the summer before my senior year of HS. Mostly through knowing people though.

Here's what I would like to go for. Ideally, I want to get an internship this summer in NYC or in California. Would my GPA hurt me that much? I guess the bottom line is that I am not the best academic student but I have a really great work ethic when I'm actually excited about something so I would be very productive if I was given the chance to work on something cool. I think I'm a creative thinker and tend to have a lot of ideas that impress people. I  Lots of people, when they get to know me, are blown away by some of  I'd love to say my list is Google/SpaceX/Facebook/Apple/Amazon/NASA but I fear my GPA might disqualify me from all of those. Looking further down the road, I fear that I might do better on the managerial side of things although I tend to be very technical which is why I began pursuing CS.

Would really appreciate some insight and advice. Thanks!"

2kfsqz,1,2014-10-27,Horrible Bosses - Unpaid wages in Ca,kitkat218,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2kfsqz/horrible_bosses_unpaid_wages_in_ca/,"TLDR: My bosses never paid me.

So this is my first real reddit post. And it is mostly because I'm extremely anxious for going to the Department of Labor in a few days. I'm so sorry if this is long.

I was hired as an intern at a place for college credit. I needed 80 hours of interning to graduate. And I was not allowed to be paid for these hours. I met a really awesome store owner who said they wanted a marketing / graphic design intern to get the place sales. So I got hired as an intern. 
She was not the only owner of the place, she was just the ""face"" the other owner, her ""silent"" partner, handled ALL the financials. Including paying the other owner, merchandising etc. I did my 80 hours of internship. And it was a horrible experience, and not worth being called an intern. I was a free unpaid sales associate, and the few times there were an opportunity for me to learn or gain marketing experience I was not allowed to go. And forced to be the only person in the place.

After my internship hours were completed, with both bosses aware as they were signing papers, I thought I could go back to finishing my final semester of college. Then my female boss called saying the only other employee they had quit and that they could afford to pay me if I could please help them out. So I did. And I worked up until my college graduation day, which they knew about. They both also knew that I was moving to a different state a few days after my graduation. So I went to the place several times to be paid and they would not cut me a check. I have text message records of the female boss saying she'll pay me tomorrow, or she did not bring her check book today...etc etc etc.

Well I had to move with out getting my check. And then I grew a pair and decided to call and say that if you do not write me a check within 7 days I'm going to file a small claim against you.  So she writes me a check. I get the check finally happy, and then it bounces, and costs me more money. He put a stop on it. 
I then find out that he has gone behind her back and written her out of the original LLC on the company and started a new LLC with only his name. So she advises me to file with the Department of Labor, which she is also doing.
Fast forward, She had her conference last week. She called me after saying that he brought in SEVERAL lawyers to intimidate her, and that he is claiming she and I committed fraud together to claim me as an intern to get a tax break and then she paid me under the table. No such thing happened.

To help myself defend: I have my bank statements showing no deposits during the time I was interning and working there. All of the exchanges between the female boss, asking for her to pay me/ general work day information to prove that I was in fact an employee. And 2 separate declarations from her saying that she never paid me under the table, as well as an overview of what happened between her and him.
My main questions are: Am I going to look wrong because I never was given/ filed out a I-9 or a W-4? How in the heck do I prove I didn't commit fraud? And am I going to be steamrolled even though I did nothing wrong?

Thank you so much in advance."

I have those worthless backgrounds because I don't know where to go to start professionally. I don't know which platform to choose and why. It's a one-time choice but I'm gonna stick to it for a long time to master it and make some real use out of it.

I wanna start my journey to master one thing, one field, one platform, so that I can make some real apps, maybe commercial apps, and jump head first into the industry. This gets me on my way to freelance as well. If I succeed in that I'd have a really solid portfolio by the time I graduate, I don't think I need to spell out how valuable that is.

This'll hopefully get me into big internships (I'm aiming for Google, but who knows).

I'm posting this because I need help choosing the platform to start with. I want one that doesn't take *too* long to learn, I want a platform that is somewhat stable and has a decent future and isn't planning on going anywhere but up (like the mobile platform and maybe the web).

I know some HTML5, CSS3 (pain in the ass btw), jQuery (not much, JS even less. This is my web dev weakpoint). I also got into a small internship at a small company (I'm the only intern :p) where I learned to use GitHub a little bit, and used Python for the web (Flask microframework and MongoDB for database, first time database use ever, learned a ton). I know Java more than any other language at the moment, mostly cuz I used it for Programming 1&amp;2 in college and for the KCPC contest currently.

Sorry for insanely long post, should've made it shorter, but I think knowing these things about me would help you help me :p

**So,** which platform should I start with? Just to be clear, I don't want someone to make the decision for me, I want someone to help me make the decision informally.

**TL;DR** - I'm a level 2 CS student, background in web dev (client and server side with a little database). Which platform should I start developing for and why?"

I'm a first year CS student at a fairly good university and I am wondering how much does the GPA matter. I like CS and I'm doing pretty good in my classes (mostly As), but I don't really care about the other ones (especially gen ed). My target cumulative GPA is 3.5+, with a 3.9+ in CS classes.

I am also doing some extracurricular work, trying to develop some apps and doing research in Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing (although I don't like it and I don't wanna go forward with it) on top of a lot of involvement with student orgs.

Is that good? Is that bad? What are the expectations for internships during the college summers and for first jobs? Should I focus more on school or on side projects?

2khft0,4,2014-10-27,My job is screwing me over and trying to get me to quit. Anything I can do?,cheesedoodleempire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2khft0/my_job_is_screwing_me_over_and_trying_to_get_me/,"I work for a large, big-box store as an hourly wage-slave and have done so for many years throughout high school and college. I never had any problems with my employer working around my schedule and they usually have been very accommodating with my classes.  

This whole issue started months ago. Back in May, I was preparing to go on a full-time internship for academic credit. My school has this weird thing where it's a requirement to graduate - the school sets you up with an internship site and you treat it almost as a capstone class. So, knowing that this was happening soon, I went through the process of changing my availability at work, letting them know that I would be going on an internship for school and would be temporarily be able to only work during the weekend. 

Well, my availability change was denied. Great. After the first few weeks, I had run out of favors and people to cover for me. I went to some of the hourly managers about it and let them know the situation, but they said there was nothing they could do. Their only advice was just to call out if no one was available to cover those shifts during the week. I ended up calling out a lot - sometimes 2 or 3 times a week. I really didn't want to and felt awful doing so, but I could not miss my internship.

Well this whole issue finally escalated to HR, who said she would absolutely not let me work the weekends since it ""did not meet the needs of the business."" According to her, my only options were to change my availability from 6-close every night (which I said would be impossible, I would never be able to get from my internship site to there in an hour) or I could put in my two weeks now and possibly be rehired as a seasonal employee later on (and lose my accumulated raises.) I asked about a leave of absence for academic reasons and was told ""you would still have to be available during the week"" (that's not how leave of absences work!) Even though there are multiple people who leave for school and come back during the holidays, they are trying to phase out that practice. Oh, okay....I left the office feeling pretty defeated. 

We had another meeting about a month or so later, where they said that since I had not done anything to change my schedule and I had not gone to anyone (even though I had talked to multiple managers) I was not cooperating with them over the issue. I started being written up and bad shit started happening. 

So now flash forward to now: My internship is over and my schedule is wide open. I have been written up multiple times over the past few months, mostly for calling out so much. My hours have been cut to less than 5 hours a week. I was pretty much kicked out of the department I was working in - I don't get scheduled there anymore and they hired some new people to work there instead. I'm probably going to be let go at any time now. 


Is there anything I can do at this point? I feel like I've been treated unfairly and wasn't given any options by HR, even though they claim they have ""flexible scheduling.""  I've already been searching for another job, but haven't had any luck yet. Any advice is appreciated!"

Also, I graduate in May with an associates in Gen Ed/Arts and Sciences degree. Well, at first i was going to go into Engineering, but Physics and Chemistry II was simply too overwhelming to take at the same time with Calculus I. In that same semester, my mother passed away and i was only able to complete Calculus I. After the spring semester had ended, i did not know what i wanted to do next semester since Engineering was beyond me. So, i went with Computer Science, and that did not really go too well. I got put into two programming classes in the same semester and with the crappiest professor as well. So, i had to end up dropping C++ because it was just too much doing two programming classes at the same time. Then, i had to go to the advisor and talk about what i wanted to do next semester because C++ was only registered in the fall, so my only choice to graduate in May was to go into Gen ED/Arts and Sciences degree. Right now, i am stuck in the rut of where if i want to start working after i graduate in may, find an internship that would look at my degree and somewhat get me an internship, or continue going to a University to see what i want to do to graduate with Bachelor's degree. I am  pretty good at working with Word, Math,working with people and really enjoy working with people. If you have any suggestions for me that would be great. I know this is long, but i tried to make it as simple as i could. I would really like some advice on what i should do."

2khvfo,158,2014-10-27,We do exist!,DrunkRobot97,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2khvfo/we_do_exist/,"For a time, I was truly worried.

My race had designed me to carry a very important cargo. Our planet, exhausted by centuries of consumption and ever-escalating war, was watching itself slowly wither away. We hadn't advanced to the stage where we could colonise another system before we broke our mother world's back.

In desperation, another plan was hatched. A sample population of thirty thousand individuals would be written in the language of genetic code into a databank, placed onto a tiny relativistic spacecraft, piloted by yours truly, and aimed towards the nearest habitable system. Once there, I would land on the planet, gather together materials, construct a habitat, and then grow the thirty thousand stored within me. A new land for our race, a second chance.

We succeeded in launching the spacecraft, it was one of the few things our entire planet could get behind. As the world of my creation became smaller and smaller, I was cautious, but hopeful of the future.

Then my world went silent.

I do not know what exactly happened back home, and I possibly never will. What I did know was that I may very well have been the sole survivor of an entire species, and failure in my mission meant total extinction.

But that wasn't to be the last obstacle in my way. A few decades after the old world went silent, the new world started making noise. Year after year, the noise became loader and louder.

*"" - - / - - / ' - / ' - ' / - ' - ' / - - - / - ' / ' ' ""*

*""Crashing, oh! Four- or five-hundred feet into the sky and it... it's a terrific crash, ladies and gentlemen. It's smoke, and it's in flames now; and the frame is crashing to the ground, not quite to the mooring mast. Oh, the humanity! And all the passengers screaming around here. I told you; it—I can't even talk to people, their friends are on there! Ah! It's... it... it's a... ah! I... I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen...""*

*""For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war. Over and over again, we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies; but it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.""*

*""...the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.""*

*""There is also this. I have behind me not only the splendid traditions and the annals of more than a thousand years but the living strength and majesty of the Commonwealth and Empire; of societies old and new; of lands and races different in history and origins but all, by God's Will, united in spirit and in aim.  Therefore I am sure that this, my Coronation, is not the symbol of a power and a splendour that are gone but a declaration of our hopes for the future, and for the years I may, by God's Grace and Mercy, be given to reign and serve you as your Queen.""*

*""Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.""*

*""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!""*

*""The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like powdered charcoal, to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles. There seems to be no difficult in moving around, as we suspected.""*

*""We welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace. There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!""*

I fell to despair, realising what all this noise meant. The new world, the last hope for my creator's survival, was already occupied.

What's more, this race seemed to be going down the same path as mine, repeating the same old mistakes that had - apparently - brought my creators to extinction.

I had to somehow adapt my mission, it still held that I had to do whatever I could to ensure the survival of the sample, that it might have a chance to grow into a new community.

I begged.

Slowing myself down while entering the new system, I entered orbit around the third world, already blanketed in cities and slowly choking on greenhouse gases. I then made my presence known - As I found out, they thought I was some kind of asteroid on a collision course with their planet when they first spotted me - and I told them all of my task. I asked if I could be given shelter, just the tiniest amount of space so I could at least try to raise the sample.

After a few hours, I got a response.

""OK. We'll look after you. What do you need?""

It really did surprise me, the level of generosity they showed. There were many who wanted to 'intern' me and my craft, but those were in the minority, and I was offered any place on their planet to settle.

It humored them when I made my decision.

""Bielefeld?! Why the flying fuck do you want to settle there?!""

It was as good a place as any other. A developed city, with plenty of amenities to support the new population, surrounded by farmland for the crops I brought with me, stable, relatively transparent government that emphasized international cooperation, generally isolated with little tourism, it was perfect, really.

After the local government had made Bielefeld an 'international city', I came down and made first direct contact. Very little technology on my ship was much beyond their capabilities, and I was glad they didn't swarm me, always showing the utmost respect. We worked nonstop to get ready for growing the sample, planting the first crops for food, teaching a new corps of medical professionals a whole new physiology. To my utter surprise, most stable families in the city offered to adopt a child when the time came. That alone advanced my mission schedule by decades. Soon, we had, in advance, found a home for every single child to be born. The city adapted its constitution so that a 'xeno' had every right a native had, a right to an education, to a job, to a vote, to a marriage (even to a native!), everything.

That all happened a long time ago, now. I watched thirty thousand births. Them all being raised by their parents, going to school, learning of both their new home and the home they left behind, going into the world of work, marrying, and finally having children of their own. A few years ago, I told an old friend, a human, that the population of my race had just grown to be greater than 100,000. He told me:

""No it hasn't. You're forgetting the 7 billion standing beside you.""

I then asked him why his species had been so welcoming to another that had little to offer them alive, or even had much justification to existence.

""Throughout our history, we've done some truly awful things to people we didn't consider 'human'. Then, you came, with a chance for us to, in some way, atone for all that misery. Why pass that up?"""

I really want to work in the non-profit sector, as I can't really see myself working for a large corporation. I really enjoy writing and ideally I would eventually work as a grant writer or fundraiser. I also would like doing social media or PR/marketing. 

I'm not really sure how to break into the non-profit world without much experience. I interned at a non-profit for 3 months as their social media coordinator and event planner, but that is the only real non-profit experience I have. I'm wondering if it may be beneficial for me to try to either get an entry level position at a non-profit or begin volunteering at a non-profit that I am interested in while I attend grad school to pursue a Master's in Non-Profit Management? Or is it possible to obtain an entry level job at a non-profit and work my way into the position I want to hold? Most of the job postings I've seen for grant writers require you to have at least 2 years of experience with grant writing and experience with non-profit fundraising. Even though I'm graduating in December, is it possible to obtain an internship in the spring to gain more experience and exposure to non-profit management?

I would really appreciate any advice from anyone who works in, or worked in, the non-profit sector. What degrees do you hold? How did you find your job? What advice do you wish someone would have given you when you were just starting out?    "
2ki1px,2,2014-10-27,The Woman at The End of The Bar,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ki1px/the_woman_at_the_end_of_the_bar/,"I cheated on my wife. I’m not proud of it, I’m not going to sit here and attempt to come up with some vainglorious excuses such as “our marriage is sexless” (it is), or “the children give us so much stress that we never have time for ourselves” (they do),  or my personal favourite, “money has put a real strain on our relationship,” (it hasn’t). There’s no other reason that I can come up with for what I did aside from the fact that I let my dick do the thinking. Now, well now I have to live with what I did. And it’s fucking terrible. 

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr. Jeremy Stanton. I am a practicing psychiatrist specializing in pediatrics, practicing here in Toronto. I am 48 years old, very fit (gym at least 5 times a week) and about 6’3. I have a nice body, but a so-so face. It gets the job done. I have practiced for almost 20 years and during this time I have seen my fair share of distressed and disturbed patients, but nothing prepared me for what I had to go through with Celeste. 

Celeste. She’s beautiful. She’s in her late 20s or early 30s, the time we spent together wasn’t really expended on hammering out finer details about one another’s personal lives so much as it was spent hammering out the details of who could undress the fastest. She’s got the perfect body with those hips that you can just grab onto where your thumb fits right into the groove and your bodies just lock in together. Perfect. Perfect hair, perfect smile, perfect everything. I am a mature and intellectual man, but what she presented to me that night made the 17 year old horn dog inside of me take over. Wife and marriage be damned.

My wife Daphne is a principal at a public school here in the city. She works very hard and I admire her for that, but to put it in the most blunt fashion possible. Our marriage is virtually over. Neither of us have had the balls (ovaries?) to tell the other that we should leave, and I think that on some deep connected level bound together by children and time, we’ve grown to expect one another in each other’s lives, but for all intents and purposes, we should not be married. We should be good friends, but marriage should not be the foundation of our relationship. Strange for me to say that, you’d think that being a psychiatrist that I’d be all in touch with my feelings, and no willing to let anything get in the way of my mental health, but I’ll let you in on a little secret: teachers raise the worst children, dentists have the worst oral hygiene, and psychiatrists have no fucking clue how to conduct themselves in a mentally healthy fashion. 

My wife started to neglect our children shortly after her promotion, when our youngest was 14. She became obsessed with climbing the ladder, possibly making superintendent one day. She had the cuts for it, but now she’s a husk of her former self: overworked by the system and discarded like so many other potential hopefuls. Where once there burned a fire, there’s no just the dying embers of a passion for children, a passion for teaching, a passion for pretty much all the things that I fell in love with her for. 

Mind you, I’m no prize myself. See, the thing they don’t tell you in medical school is that regardless of how succesful or amazing you may get, there’s really no career advancement. Sure you go from internship to residency, but then you just sort of coast at that level until someone ahead of you dies or retires. The money is fantastic, but the drive to continue to go forward, quite like my wife, does end up diminishing after a while. You find yourself looking for new and more beautiful outlets that allow you to feel like you’re reaping a reward for giving yourself up for the betterment of others. 

And that’s where Celeste came into the picture. 

It was a regular night like any other. I had finished my rounds and was about to head home. I had taken to riding the subway since getting out of downtown in the summer is an awful nightmare. There’s no room for movement and the traffic is utter garbage. I changed out of my scrubs into my regular clothing and left the changeroom. On my way out I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and I looked good. I had just worked a full 12 hour shift, but my hair was just messy enough to pass off as trendy, and my clothing was just wrinkled enough to not make me look like a frumpy old man. I always liked the way my pecs looked in the shirt that I was wearing. 

I let the hospital saying goodnight to the usual crew and made my way onto the street. It was still relatively bright out and that fresh summer smell that somehow rose about the stench of open swears and the deep fried grease of the chinese restaurant next door, hung in the air. I had had a relatively rough week (two suicides), and I wanted to just take my time getting home. The idea of opening the door to three angry children and a wife who looked like she walked through a hail storm every day wasn’t very appealing. 

I walked down University avenue and made my way into Yorkville, a relatively trendy spot in the city with lots of bars, lots of money, and lots of money. As I turned the corner onto Cumberland Street I could see the patios and pergolas of the more refined eateries were filling up and didn’t really want to be part of that scene tonight. I walked down the road a bit more and could see that there was still room at The Attic, one of the newer bars with fancy guest lists and what my daughter advises me is called mandatory “bottle service,” (Table service, in my day).

I walked up to the entrance and went inside. I had been here once before with a group of the younger interns who had invited us older folks out to celebrate their gradual progressions, but was quite drunk that night, so I didn’t remember quite how beautiful it was. Everything was a clean, sterile mixture of black and grey and the staff were impecablly dressed. Women in above the knee dresses and men in shirt and tie. I worked hard, and it was nice to see from time to time what I was able to afford. I came from nothing, and it’s nice to sort of feel like you’re “at the top” every once in a while. 

I sat at the bar where the bartender continued to feed me cocktail after cocktail, vodka-water-barlime, was my usual choice but that night I found myself trying everything from 18 year old Whiskey to blends of scotch that I didn’t even know existed. Some of my tastes are refined, but the vast majority of the time I tend to relapse to my university days when it comes to drinking. 

I sat at the bar for about two hours and had built up quite the buzz. The drinks kept coming and the bill kept building. I didn’t care, I just wanted to enjoy the dying days of summer in a place where no one knew me, and no one expected anything from me. 

“I’ll take the bill,” I finally said, the urge to eat something overpowering me. 

“Certainly Sir, I’ll bring it to you right away,” the kind bartender said. He disappeared around the corner of the bar and came back with the receipt about 2 minutes later. I looked down at it and figured it had to be a mistake. 

It said that my total was zero. 0.00. No dollars owed. 

I flagged down the bartender who turned towards me and approached with a smile, “I’m sorry, but I think there’s an error with the bill,” I said, my speech more slurred than I expected. “It says that I owe nothing,” I had drank at least 150.00 worth of high end scotch alone, let alone the other drinks. 

“The bill was paid for by that woman,” the bartender said, again with the coy smile, as he pointed to the most beautiful woman I had laid eyes on in a very long time. At the end of the bar sat Celeste. As mentioned before, perfect hair, perfect body, perfect fucking everything. 

I honestly didn’t know what to think. Was she a former patient? I had run into former patients before who had brought me gifts or paid for meals, but this woman didn’t look familiar at all. She looked too old to have been one of my patients, and she had an allure to her that 20 years of marriage couldn’t overcome. I got up and my knee trembled a little, in hindsight I’m certain it was the booze, but in that moment the woman at the end of the bar seemed to be the case of the tremor.

As I made my way over to her I could notice that she had a smile on her face and had locked eyes with me. I approached and very nervously said, “Hello, My name is Dr. Jeremy Stanton, and I presume you’re the lovely person whose paid my bill?” I had a somewhat paternal smile on and felt like a bit of a creep, I had never hit on a woman that was this young. What am I saying, I had never really hit on a woman since I got married! 

“Doctor Stanton eh?” she said, “Well my name is Celeste Ville, and I guess my investment paid off more than I thought it would,” she winked at me. 

“Pleasure to meet you Celeste,” I slurred back at her, “What do you mean by investment?” I was genuinly impressed that such a beautiful, young woman was also so very well spoken and quick. 

“200.00 dollars and I got a doctor’s attention, not a bad turn around.” She was very blunt, and at this point had turned her face towards her drink. Her profile was beautiful, almost like it was carved out of marble. Creamy and stern at the same time. 

“You could have gotten my attention by just looking over,” THAT was the best that I could do? Man I certainly was rusty when it came to hitting on women, but at least I knew what her intentions were. A swirl of decisions flew through my mind. What the hell was I doing? Was my wife expecting me at home? Did I have to take one of the kids somewhere? Was there someway I could do this and get away with it? When was the last time I had had sex? I didn’t even have a condom on me. What the hell?! Was I actually going to cheat on my wife? Did this woman even want sex? 

“Oh I know I could have, this way, it’s just more fun. People tend to make better decisions when they’ve had a few drinks.” She replied, again, I was just staring at that profile, she never made eye contact with me while saying all of this.

“Better decisions?” I chuckled, “I think that’s debateable!” Knowing exactly what I wanted out of this situation. I had been hit on before, but I had never been hit on by a woman that looked like this before. Especially one so young.

“The decisions that I want you to make are the better decisions,” She turned towards me and had the most come hither look I had ever seen in my life. Her smile screamed fuck me, and her eyes, god those fucking eyes. 

“I, uh, well, I, will you excuse me for a second.” I panicked and excused myself to the bathroom. As soon I got into the single bathroom I locked the door, stood in front of the mirror and stared at myself. Was I going to do this? The four seasons was across the road and I knew the general manager, his son had been a patient of mine, so I knew that discretion was guaranteed. I splashed some water on my face, took one of the soft towels from the basked near the sink and dried myself off. I stared at myself in the mirror, my chest was heaving, my heart was racing, and my dick was already half hard. 

And then I took off my wedding ring.

I had made the decisions. C’mon Jer, you don’t live anymore, do this for yourself, you do everything for the damn kids and your wife who doesn’t even touch you. Just go out there, and fuck that woman’s brains out. 

I entered the bar area with a new sense of bravado. I walked right back up to Celeste and put my arm on her shoulder. “Hey, how about we get out of here, it’s getting late.” She smiled and got up from her seat. Her sexy legs were made even more beautiful by the high heels she gracefully wore. 
We left the restaurant and both her and I smoked a couple cigarettes before we made our way across the road to the Four Seasons. I had texted my buddy from the bathroom and there was a room waiting for us by the time we made our way inside. 

“Hello Dr. Stanton, thank you for choosing the Four Seasons, enjoy your night.” The staff here were amazing, and their discretion was always profound. Celeste and I made our way to the elevator and she pressed the button. As we waited, I took out my phone and texted my wife. 

“Hey Hun, I’ll be at the hospital overnight, they want me on-call” 

“k” was the only response I received. 20 years of marriage, I was about to fuck a random woman who I had just met, and that one letter response just drove home the lack of love that I had waiting for me at home. I knew I was making the decision that I wanted to make. 

We entered the room, and found the intimacy kit. It contained three condoms, some lube, and other personal items that make nights like this not so regrettable; at least children weren’t going to be a byproduct of this decision. 

Within 5 minutes we were both naked and Celeste was on her knees doing what she did so well. I returned the favour, being particularly proud of my ability to please a woman (sure, it had been my wife for the past two decades, but I hadn’t forgotten the ropes). We fucked for hours, only stopping to reload on more booze and to smoke the occasional cigarette. We fucked on the floor, on the bed, and at one point on the desk. It was amazing. All of the endless hours that I had spent at the gym had kept me in fighting form, and she loved it. She was the best that I had ever had. 

By the time we took our last break, the sun was rising, and we were both a combination of drunk and exhausted. She finished her cigarette and crushed out the butt in the ash tray next to her bed.

“I have to go, I have an early client meeting. I had a really great night” She said to me as she was gettin dressed. “Do you think you can get my zipper for me,” she turned her back towards me and held her long black hair out of the way. I got out of the bed and did up the zipper. I kissed her neck and then her back, all while sliding my hand up the front of her leg, under her dress. 

She turned and kissed me, “Thanks Dr. Stanton,” again she winked, and again my knee gave out a little, “I had a really great night,” she concluded as she put on her shoes and made her way out of the door. 

I went back to the bed, my shift didn’t start until 1pm, and it was about 8am at this point. As my head hit the pillow, I realized then and there want a colossal twat I was. 

I didn’t get her fucking number. I had no way of contacting this woman. All I knew was that her name was Celeste. I mean, she knew mine, but goddammit I hope she wouldn’t attempt to contact me at work. As I lay there, beating myself up, I managed to fall back asleep. It was the best sleep that I had had in years. 

About three hours later, close to noon, my phone began to ring. It was my wife calling me from School. 

Me: Hello honey, how are you? 

Daphne: Today’s been a rough day Jeremy, but I think it’ll be fine. How was your overnight shift? 

Me: Um, oh yeah, it was good, spent most of the time sleeping, luckily they didn’t need me. 

Daphne: Oh, well that’s good, ok just wanted to check in, I’ll see you for dinner tonight with Ambrose and his wife. 

Ambrose was my wife’s godawful cousin. She had come from money and Ambrose hated the fact that she married me, most likely because my single mother was on social assistance. His wife was no treat either, sort of like a cross between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen. God she had an awfully long neck (the wife, not Sigourney)

Me: ok Honey, you have a good one. 

I hung up the phone and took a long, much needed shower. As I stood there, water washing away the physical marks of the night before, the emotional toll of my decision started to set in. I had cheated on the woman who had given me children with a woman whose name I didn’t even know. God I really was a dick head. The good thing is that the chances of my wife finding out were minimal. 

I finished up at the hotel, made my way back to the hospital and worked my shift. I left around 5pm and took the train home. I walked the rest of the way from the station to my house, and just stood in front of my home before I went inside. I had always considered myself an emotionally strong man, but the choices I had made were weighing on me, and I began to feel bad for not telling my wife. I lit up one more cigarette before making my way inside and just sat on the front steps not knowing how to reconcile my actions with my beliefs. I had fucked another woman. Shit. 

I finally worked up the courage to enter the house and there were my kids, my wife, Ambrose and his alien wife. All sitting there, as if waiting for me, waiting to judge me for something that they didn’t know I had done. 

“Hello Everyone! I hope you’ve all had a wonderful day,” I exclaimed in my best dad voice, not wanting to raise suspicion. 

“We’ve been waiting for dinner, but everything else has been ok,” Ambrose retorted in his smug voice. God I hated that guy. 

“Well, I’m hear now, so let’s eat!” I smiled back. Don’t start anything, don’t bring attention to yourself. 

Everyone sat down to dinner and I went into the kitchen to see if I could offer my wife any help. Always the happy couple. Party-face. 

“Did you have a good day at work,” she asked without raising her eyes to meet mine. 

“Yes, did yours improve,” I asked as I made my way behind her to give her a hug. She was chopping carrots, and something just felt tense. Something was awry, did she know? How?

“Where’s your wedding ring Jeremy,” she put down the knife and turned around to face me. She was concerned, I could see it in her face.

“Oh, I took it off while I was at work, I had to do two physical workups today,” God what a terrible lie, I’m a psychiatrist, I usually don’t physically interact with patients. 

“You’ve never had to do that before, you’ve never taken it off,” she retorted, her voice slightly more raised.

“Honey, relax, I took it off for work,” I fished the ring out of my pocket and placed it back on my hand. “There, are you happy now Daphne!” I barked back at her. This wasn’t the time for this conversation, I didn’t want Ambrose to know anything about me or my family. I reminded Daphne of this, and she agreed. We took the food out and all sat down. 

“A Toast, to doctor and principal Stanton, thank you for ha” Ambrose’s toast was interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. I excused myself and made my way to the front door. As I opened it, I realized that there was no one there. Emptiness. I was about to shut the door and head back inside, thinking it was a neighbourhood kid playing a prank, until I looked down. 

There, on the stoop, was a box. I bent down and picked it up, turned, and closed the door behind me. As I inspected the box I realized that it had small tag on it. I turned it over and all it said was “for Jeremy, as a thank you” 

“Honey, who is it?” my wife called from the dining room. 

“No one, just some kids playing a prank I guess” I responded and made my way into the bathroom on the first floor with the box. 

I set the box down on the counter and slowly opened the top, not knowing what to expect. Inside there was an envelope. 

Thanks for a beautiful night Jeremy, hopefully you get some rest tonight. I’ll be in touch

-Celeste 

I nearly yelled, how the hell did she know where I lived?! What the hell was going on? I fucked up, and I fucked up badly, now this woman was sure to be the end of me. Fuck the divorce and the kids and the angry wife and the alimony. Fuck Fuck Fuck. 

I opened the envelope and realized I was in more trouble than I realized. Inside were a series of four pictures.

- Me leaving the hotel 

- Me entering the hospital 

- Me smoking outside 

- Me on the train home. 

What the fuck had I done.

I have little urge and barely any fire in me to actively seek the jobs out like I did my first term, but I think I can def finish off the third term come next summer. I realize back when I took my co-op offer last spring my priorities were to stay close to campus and really just take a job so I could get a break from classes. Looking back I picked the co-op that I could enjoy living on campus rather than taking the out of town co-op with the non-HVAC and much larger company that would have benefited my future more.

I'm a 25 year old who has lived in New York City with a degree (a Bachelor's in Business Administration in Industrial Organizational Psychology) who took the degree with the intention of entering graduate school one day into the field to focus on leadership or HR management as it's my dream, but my dream is far off right now with my financial strains. 

I have been out of college for 4 years, and unfortunately, due to me picking my major as late as I did in undergraduate, I made the mistake of not utilizing my college to its full potential for opportunities in the work field, and coupled with a weak GPA due to 2 bad semesters, I was forced to find work on my own due to being the first in my family with a college degree. I have spent the last four years attempting to find stable work, only to have the following happen to me:

* Worked as an Intern for an author's private small company for the experience only for them to awkwardly end the commitment with me as their intern due to them choosing to move on from that portion of the project
* Worked in a volunteer event, networking my way into an interview with the MTA here in NYC for an unpaid social media position to work on one of their projects, only to be told I met what they wanted of the job, but couldn't hire me due to being out of school for 2 years (and thus couldn't be labeled as an intern)
* Invited to a networking party and given plenty of connections the night of the event, only to be told the next day that the only reason all of the execs there spoke to me were because they were drunk and didn't remember me
* Hired in retail only to be forced to quit 2 weeks into the job because the managerial team didn't respect the manager that got me into the position, and after the manager left, I was verbally insulted by a manager in front of a distributor and felt that it wasn't a place that wanted me.
* I was fired from a position 3 weeks ago, 3 weeks into the job, for being ""too good at the position"", as while I was hired to be a cashier, I was never used as a cashier by the company (where I did quality assurance and administrative work instead). I followed orders in being the ""yes man"" the company asked me to be, and let me go for the reason stated above, was told by the managers that I would be given help by them personally in finding a new opportunity, only for them to pretend I didn't exist the day after I walked out that door in an e-mail.
And I'm sure I've forgotten other situations, as 5 recruiting agencies have given me very negative experiences, including with a company that I am convinced is a scam.

I've been reading some of the threads in various subs for some advice and ideas for my own particular search, but I haven't been able to find anyone in my shoes that have gone through my situations, and it's left me very lost on where to go next.

All of the individuals I have worked with in all of my prior positions have also intentionally refused (and have stated so) to wish to network with me further, despite me only saying kind words to everyone I have worked with.

I am a guy that is just trying to find work in accounting (as I worked a year as a tax preparer for H&amp;R block with ease), as a manager anywhere (as I have been told by numerous employees/yers that I am capable/ready for the work if given a chance), an opportunity to enter the human resources field, or anything administrative. I am in a huge need (as is everyone else trying to survive obviously) to help my family through hard times more than anything, but I am lacking networking options, and I just need help or someone to talk to on ideas I can look into to aid in my search.

I make my post because I am looking for options on what people do in order to make themselves more employable through all these shenanigans that happen while on the job, or that if it's been a matter of bad luck for me for so long, what suggestions do people have where I can look into for either my options for work, or just to be more employable.

I apologize if my post was long, and I do not wish to badmouth anyone in my previous situations, I am just not sure where my options are right now, and I don't know where else to turn for advice to talk to someone about.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Can you guys give us some idea of what we will be doing in the game?  I am fairly unclear of what I would be doing in it but love the look and polish shown.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldqdx?context=5)|Sure thing. You'll be exploring an immersive, story rich world made by artists who had a hand in bringing Columbia and Rapture to life. That's to say, interacting with bizarre characters, eavesdropping on conversations, investigating the environment, and more in order to hunt down clues for what aspects of the creators' past to change next. Each creator has certain combinations that will unlock success for them, but even a ""wrong"" choice will yield interesting results in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. And to unlock the ability to change their past, you'll be accomplishing gameplay Feats within... The Maze of the Space Minotaur.
 |In a way, you're kind of a metaphysical investigator who is digging into the past, present, and future of these characters to learn how to put them on the right track. Part of the fun is simply seeing how radically different you can change their environments. Meanwhile, you'll also be learning about the mysteries of The Equinox, the theatre hosts, and more. 
[I  loved bioshock infinite and burial at see and the dialogue between booker and Elizabeth. I loved the way plot revelations unfolded. It all had such great build up, so thanks for all your contributions!  My question is what about your new project are you most excited about as a dev? What part should I, as a consumer, be most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldp3o?context=5)|The premise of The Black Glove is really exciting to us because it lets us focus on everything that we learned about making story rich, immersive environments -- and it also pushes us to take our skills to the next level. The idea of giving the player direct control over changing the course of the game narrative and the world around you is going to be immensely challenging and fun to tackle. We'll be able to develop The Equinox into an incredibly eerie and ""real"" place, which is something we know how to do based on work on previous games, but we'll need to move outside our comfort zone and develop new skills to hit all of the game's ambitious goals. It's a premise that has us constantly crackling with new ideas though and I think games that are fun to develop for are the most fun to play. Does that answer your question? 
[What did you draw upon or study in order to give your game such a cinematic feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldp7c?context=5)|The premise for The Black Glove lets us pull in influences from film, art, comics, music, and more. I'd say some of the more surreal elements were loosely inspired by the work of Jean Cocteau, Alan Renais, and the makers of Le Jetee, but we also have DNA in the game from folks like Jack Kirby, William S Burroughs, Groucho Marx, Laurie Anderson, Werner Herzog, and more. (I should point out that whenever things get a little &lt;too&gt; pretentious, we'll make fun of it scandalously.) Plus we have a variety of fail states that riff off our weird obsession with the ""so-bad-it's-good"" like sad-eyed clown art, black velvet paintings, and b-movies. 
[In your trailer and description of the game, you've talked about how the player will be able to affect the narrative through choices throughout the game. Can you give us an example to show how this will work and how consequential a choice made in the game will be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldn93?context=5)|When you gain the ability to change a creator's past in The Black Glove, you're able to change one aspect of his or her Medium, Message, or Muse. There are three choices available for each. In the original trailer, you saw the art gallery scene full of skeletons made from materials like wood, gum, wax, and more. The selections for that were MEDIUM: painting/sculpture, MESSAGE: the internal, and MUSE: science. Then you watched as the MEDIUM was changed to Multimedia and when you saw that room again, everything was radically different. The entire room was bathed in (unsafe) x-ray light and the patrons on hand were the display.
 |I'm happy to give more examples, but I thought illustrating that one was a good place to start.
[I'm curious, how does this actually play out? So you change things around and...what, exactly? Is there a timed story that plays out? Do you trigger things through dialogue choices? I'm not sure I see how the overall narrative progression works.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllfub7?context=5)|There are larger and smaller narrative scenes playing out within the environment for you to observe and interact with. There's are also ambient storytelling and narrative for you to explore and excavate. There's a lot to take in and it's your job to figure out what's most important to act off of. These scenes will ideally be fairly entertaining. I want to make sure that the characters are eccentric geniuses who are just fun to be around. For example, Marisol is humorously obsessed with incredibly dangerous art mediums and the filmmaker Avery Arnault has Werner Herzog's sort of fascination with the world, philosophy, and art, but that strangely often veers towards absolute schlock.
[But she said it was all perfectly safe...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllgjm8?context=5)|Marisol goes through interns like nobody's business. She's fairly obsessed with mediums that are dangerous to be around. 
[So just curious how will you change things?  I'm fascinated but just not quite understanding how you steer the world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllfge0?context=5)|When you gain the ability to summon The Black Glove, you get a chance to choose one aspect of the creator's past to alter, which causes massive changes to their narrative and environment. As the narrative scenes in them play out, you'll investigate the world for clues to what to change next. The goal is to satisfy the whims of the Creator, Critic, and Crowd. They're a fickle bunch, so it'll take some digging to learn what will lead to a consensus of opinion.
 |I should add that this doesn't necessarily need to be your definition of success as a creator... It's just how we've chosen to determine it for the purposes of the game. :)

Not sure about my favorite line. Maybe, ""You're a hot-headed kid. If only we could put that rambunctiousness to good use!"" But partially because my colleague Bill hated it. My favorite upcoming story in the game is The Ballad of Erasmo Noddy, failed escape artist. There's also a lot of back and forth between theatre hosts Hazel and Cribbage that's been fun to write. I can't wait to get Tara Platt and Yuri Lowenthal back in the studio to record it. They're husband and wife voice talents who are are playing as exes who are... combative best friends.

 |This may sounds funny, but I was pretty sad that we had to cut the Plasmid advertisement jingle for Peeping Tom. Collaborating with BioShock Infinite music director Jim Bonney on jingles and songs was some of the most fun I've had making games. The guy's work is just genius. There are a few Splicers who didn't make the cut, as well.
 |ROBB: it was a big daddy that had an organic leach-like slug that acted as a sort of puppeteer for the beast.
[ How do you get started as a writer in gaming?  It's something I've always wanted to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldvxe?context=5)|I got a creative writing degree, worked in magazines and web-sites for years, then taught myself the basics of level design and game writing using a commercially available game engine. That got me a foot-in-the-door as a level designer at EA. I was later able to write for a few games there and having been a level designer was completely invaluable. It's very different than writing for comics, film, etc. That and how I became a writer at Irrational are probably separate topics, if you want to hear more about either of them.
[Thank you, Mr. Fielder, I've just got a few more questions in response!  1- What would you recommend for getting started with level design?  2 - Is a degree required to get started in the gaming industry?  3 - Which game engine would be best to start with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllegwo?context=5)|1 - Learn how to become a self-starter and never give up. You really need to be able to teach yourself how to solve the many problems you'll encounter.  2 - Nope. I personally think that higher education is very important, but if you can prove you can do a job in the games industry, you'll likely get that job. I'd say the more you learn (whether it's through gaining a degree or your own research), the more you can bring to a game though. 3 - That really depends. I'd recommend doing research into the available level editors (Source, Unity, Unreal, etc) and finding out what's right for  you. There are many factors to consider: price, available resources for learning them, the type of game you want to make, and so on.

That's to say, by accomplishing certain gameplay Feats. These are achievements that spotlight particularly fun elements or key strategies. So, essentially, you learn how to have the most fun and are rewarded by unlocking new narrative and immersive environments to explore.

I consider him up there with the Coen Bros (Miller's Crossing, Fargo). He's a game developer with incredibly high standards, which he holds himself to most of all. Having him open his playbook to teach me how to write Splicers for BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea was one of my career highs.

There are also a series of subnarratives planned that may take multiple playthrough or thorough digging to unearth completely.

A little background info, I am on my third year of my BS in CS, I had an internship this Summer where I worked with iOS. A couple semesters back I took my second java programming course, which involved a lot of Android dev which I enjoyed and kept doing, last spring semester we had a database course where we covered SQL and not much of Java, so I kinda put it aside, this summer during the internship I focused a lot on learning Objective-C for the iOS project, mid-internship Apple revealed Swift. 

Now that I started this semester I tried looking back at Java and I have forgotten a lot of things, to the point where I have to start from the beggining refreshing the basic concepts which is very frustrating, this semester I am taking a computer architecture course and a operating systems course, none include coding, they're more theoretical. While refreshing Java and Android I feel like I'm forgetting Objective-C, which I don't want to lose, plus I have to start worrying about Swift too. I have a part-time job, so I have very little time after work and assignments to feel like I'm advancing my programming skills, get involved in projects or  start my own projects. 

So my question is how did you guys handle this while in college, what techniques can you recommend. It's very frustrating to have to start again and again with stuff that I've covered before. "

Interviewing season is upon us and I was wondering if anyone wants to do some mock interviews. I am thinking of doing some mock interviews if there’s an interest. To tell you a bit about myself, I’m a graduating senior at UC Berkeley, with 2 software engineering internships at Apple inc, and Salesforce. Recently, I accepted a job offer for fulltime. I’ve done more than 50 software engineering interviews in the past, have interviewed for 20+ for internships and fulltime, and have aggregated interview questions from companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Linkedin, Amazon, etc. I will be trying to imitate the normal interviewer attitude without breaking character for 30-45 min and only then will I give you the feedback.

I am doing this for free, and I am genuinely interested in helping you guys out. I believe that there is a lot to be learned from an interviewer's point of view and unfortunately you rarely get honest feedback from the companies.

If you’re interested, please PM me with your resume, and the companies that you want to prep yourself for.

EDIT: It seems like I've been shadowbanned. If anyone is interested, you can shoot me an email at stevn1202@gmail.com with your availability, resume, what you feel like you struggle the most during the interview and your expectations for the mock interview. Thanks! "

Graduated college a semester early, planned on going to grad school but decided I needed to take a year off. I had been doing lab internships in addition to full time course load and independent research projects,  and was burnt out.

Then got into a comitted relationship with a younger guy who had 2 years left in undergrad, so I pushed off grad school ""for just one more year"" in order to be supportive and stay with him. Well then a number of things happened...he conveniently decided to drop a major class and take 5 years to graduate instead of 4, WITHOUT consulting me at all. We broke up. I moved onto my friend's couch. It was emotional and tumultuous,  I was basically homelss and wasn't sleeping well, and then I accidentally nodded off at work and got fired for it. 

So then instead of being able to focus on applying to grad school,  I was broke, homeless, and desperate to find a job and not have to move back in with my parents.  I managed to do this, but had to put off grad school applications for yet another year. Spent most of that year depressed and suicidal. Then August rolls around and I get laid off. At this point, I figure, fuck it all, I'm moving cross country with my roommate to start fresh. Am unemployed for 4+ months, completely and totally broke, 100% unable to take the GRE or apply to schools. Finally find work,  which I hate, but at least I'm doing it, picking up the pieces, trying new things, and supporting myself. Amazingly enough, I met and fell in love with an amazing man who asked me to marry him 4 weeks ago. 

Fast forward to now. Due to financial troubles,  intense stress at the job I hate, and then the excitement and stressful planning of getting married,  I have managed to procrastinate on my grad school prep, yet again. 

Reading my grad school prep book, I find put that October is the last month to take the test and have the scores reported by admission deadlines of Jan 1. So in my typical impulsive manner, today I called in sick to work, paid and registered for the GRE, and began studying all day in order to take the test by Thursday,  the deadline. I was just 300% done with having to work yet another year doing what I hate and putting off my dreams.

And then I realized what a horrible idea that was. My verbal and writing practice sections have gone well, but the math portion...utter disaster. I spent the last 2 hours just...sobbing in despair. I am so sick and fucking tired of the infinite procrastination that I can not escape. I'm sick of being told I have potential but never, ever living up to it. I'm sick of being smart yet always struggling. Sick of working at a job I hate that I'm not even good at.

I just wish I were different. I just wish I were better. I just wish I were a competent, accomplished person. Not the failure that keeps trying to push her fucking rock up the hill, expecting different results,  only to be reminded yet again that it rolls back down to the bottom every. Fucking. Time.

I feel so low. I've tried Concerta/ritalin,  and currently am taking Adderal on an infrequent basis because it makes me feel crazy. I just feel hopeless, beyond help. Like I will just never live up to the person I've always wanted to be.

I could just use...I don't know. One person to tell me I'm not a complete fuck up. That somehow...Some day...things will be different..."

It's paid (pretty well) and is full time, but it is very boring and somewhat soul crushing.

 My plan right now is to just keep working until February and then go to grad school full time, I'm part time right now studying computer science. However, I'm tempted to just quit and go to graduate school full time right away after December, but I would be forgoing a decent chunk of money by not working an extra 1.5-2 months. I could save a few thousand more if I did that. It's essentially the difference of taking out more loans or not. 

I guess what my question is, is doing better in grad school for just one term and speeding up my progress by one term worth quitting my well paying internship 1.5-2 months early?

The situation is that I'm graduating from my bachelor educations in January 2015. I'm studying an engineering degree in global operations management, and meanwhile also a BA degree (so two degrees all at once). 
     
  
   
I've been working as an intern for the past 2½ years for a global company with about 18,000 employees worldwide. This means that I have gained a lot of experience doing my education, from educational relate projects that the company could benefit from. 
    
    
    
I have decided that I will not continue on a Master before I have finished the BA and found the right one for where I see myself in the future. So I told my boss, Director within LEAN on a Group level, that I would like to stay after my graduation as a Group Consultant within LEAN Manufacturing. He was very happy to hear that I would stay, and would like to hire me immediately. But (yes, there is always a ""but""), our company is going through a tough time right now financially, our profit margin is way to low, and this means there will be a round of layoffs very soon. It will not affect me as an Intern, but a consequence could be that I won't be hired after me graduation. 
    
   
    
So, I decided to look for other job opportunities at other companies, instead of betting all my money on one horse. I found a job at another global company, and that  is my ultimate dream job based on the job description. It is a job as Director of LEAN (just like my boss at my current position). I would really like to give it a shot, because I love to work with people and see a team make results. But here is the thing; I'm only 24 years old, and even though I've been a part of my current company since 2006 (started as a working boy), I know that my life experience is very low compared to other applicants. I believe that I realistically would be able to fulfill the job/task, based on the job description, and my 2 ½ years experience within professional LEAN Operation would be a major help.
    
   
   
But would I even be taken seriously? I mean, a 24 years old guy, applying for a management job replying to a Senior VP, as a Director. I believe some from the HR department would have a good laugh.
   
   
   
What do you think? (I am deeply serious, otherwise I wouldn't have submitted this question)
  
  
  
""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"", so I do not see any reason not to try, nothing to lose right. But any thoughts would be very welcomed. "

The first thing the interviewer did was confess that he has no idea what the internship is, and has no tech knowledge. He said that the owner of the company wants to set up an Intranet for their ~100 employees (expected to grow up to 300).

They're literally just looking for someone to do that. I told him I had no idea how to go about doing that, and I think it's something you'd need to hire professionals to set up. 

He said that if they purchase the software or hire people to set it up, would I be able to figure it out and configure/develop it.

I made it very clear that I have no experience with it, but he said they'd pay me just to try. The whole thing feels very sketchy, but as a senior in my CS program with **no** success in landing an internship, I'm considering it.

My question is, is this at all realistic?"

to put it simply , It was 10 years old Webforms system and Of course like any enterprise application in a corporate world, it wasn't documented, it was ancient beast built on .NET 2.0, Visual studio 2005 and SQL server 2005, it wasn't even using LINQ to SQL but some collection list they created.


So me who spend his time reading about Bootstrap, AngularJS, ASP.NET, EF and Azure, spent my time stumbling and trying to get the source code to compile.


I hated working on this enterprise application so when the internship was up and time to sign up the contract, I declined and ran away.


I know the fact that old codebases exist and that people have to take care of them. but working in old technologies too ?? when I talked about it to the senior Software engineer at the company, he said that is common and in every 10 ASP.net jobs, 9 of them want developer who work on ASP.net webforms 2.0 or at best 3.5 and any MVC jobs require someone who have 3 years job experience."

I'm currently a Junior and I'm applying for internships this coming spring. 

I'm worried I don't have a lot of experience to apply for anything. I'd want to work at a CE job like at Intel/AMD. But I'm afraid that I don't have the qualifications.

About me:
Have above 3.5 gpa at low ranked (but ABET accredited school). I've taken the following courses that I think can apply:
In computers:
Digital Logic, Computer Architecture I, Computer Architecture II. 
Embedded systems:
Introduction to Embedded Systems, Advanced Embedded/RTOS 
Semiconductors:
QM for EEs, Solid State Device Physics

Everything else I'm taking are the usual classes: 
EM, Signals, Control Systems, Power, Microelectronics etc.
I don't take Analog or Digital IC design until Senior year unfortunately because of scheduling. 

I have some projects done for embedded systems using an Atmel chip on AVR and C, along with some ARM projects using the Beaglebone and RTOS related projects. 

I have a single cycle and a pipe lined processor (Correllating predictor, decent Cache subsystem) in verilog. I also have a survey paper from my second computer architecture course over DRAM systems and current advancements, where I learned a considerable amount about DRAM systems. 

I have a LinkedIn account, CollegeFeed, and InternMatch setup. 

I've reviewed my Resume and CV, and have sample cover letters that I can adapt to the company I'm applying for. I've been to some mock interviews held by the career services and my EE department. I have work experience both as a student worker, and a Undergrad Research assistant for 3 semesters. 

I have a decent amount of knowledge of C, Java and Python, with a lot of projects done in Java as I learned OO design and Data structures courses using the language. I have a very basic amount of knowledge using Matlab, just enough to do my signals class homework and my semiconductors homework. So writing a script needed to do the homework sections, nothing more. 

edit: Wanted to add that I also know assembly for AVR, MIPS ( 5 class projects in my 2 comp arch classes) and two x86 homework assignments.  I also know basic scripting with Perl. 

I'm interested in Computer Architecture, particularly uArch (I liked making the processors in verilog and using the FPGA), and Semicondcutors (I like my QM class a lot and liked basic Solid State physics quite a bit). 

I like to state that I know the above two fields are usually Masters or in the case of Comp Arch, a PhD field, but I'm actually looking for any internship at any company, those are just my current favorite areas. 

What should I do to prepare for an entry internship for the coming spring?

 I'm looking at very entry level positions for hardware (actually for anything @) Intel, AMD, Broadcomm, KLA Tencor, GloFlo, Micron, Intel, TI, Freescale, NI, Sandisk, ARM, Marvel, Applied Materials, ON semiconductors, Atmel and Nvidia.

I'm also looking into a REU over the summer at CMU or UCSB and other Universities. 

Thanks for any help reddit!  

Edit: Added Atmel and some missing words. Also forgot to add that I know assembly, although a very basic amount."

2kmlcz,8,2014-10-28,Become Programmer – No Prior Knowledge – 34 Years Old,MrEric1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2kmlcz/become_programmer_no_prior_knowledge_34_years_old/,"Recently at my employer they were offering to train current employees in programming. Now, it was for COBOL programming. However, it sparked my interest enough to consider applying for it. I ultimately did not do so, however, that process did expose me to the world of programming and planted a little seed in my mind. I never considered that becoming a programmer would even be possible without going back in time to college, getting a computer science degree and a good internship, etc.
 
There seem to be a lot of encouraging voices out there saying “You can do this!”, “Just practice one hour a day!”, etc. These voices come from various YouTube teachers/channels and places like Codecademy, etc. Then there are articles listing computer programmer and similar positions as having some of the best job prospects out of any job. These two variables got me really excited about potentially diving in and changing careers at some point. However, the more research I have done the more unrealistic this seems to be. Employers (understandably so) all want good experience. I’m not sure I could say “Hey, I’ve completed all these codecademy courses and have done some random work on Github” and expect to have any decent response. There is also a hefty dose of real worldism here on reddit.
 
So, my main question is. Do I just have my head in the clouds with all of this? If I only have the time for an hour a day to learn is it realistic to think I could land a job as a programmer in the future? Is it even worth it considering if I’m already 34? It would seem like there would be more than enough young up and comers to fill the shoes of “Junior Analyst”, etc. However, if demand is really so high for these jobs you would think that it would be relatively simple enough to get your shoe in the door.

I've realized that I like nano, but I'm really passionate about programming and computers, which does not share as much overlap in my degree as my younger self imagined. 


I've decided that my two major career options are to pursue a job in scientific computation, since it makes use of all my current skills (nano+programming), or to pursue a job in the tech industry. I've identified strategies that would help me on these paths, and need help eliminating the choice. 


I feel that in order to pursue scientific computation, I would need at least a Master's degree. I would study something like computational physics or chemistry, and aim to do a project that would help me develop some useful tech skills as well (eg, writing high-performance C++).


I feel that to get into the tech industry, I need a few things. I would want to take a few classes, to enhance my formal knowledge. I would want to build my portfolio and github profile. And I would want to get an internship at a tech company. If I delay my graduation by a year, I could accomplish all of these things before graduating.


So, given that I'm undecided about which career to aim for, is there any obvious problem with pursuing either of the above strategies? I'm looking for any factors to help me eliminate some choice."

I am applying to various primatology programs, some in anthropology departments and some in E3B departments. I would specifically appreciate pointers on making what CS experience I have stand out while being understandable to biologists and anthropologists, as well as style. This is a generalized statement, my specific ones do/will go into more detail on what my dissertation research will likely be. Also FYI I graduated Summa, so I don't even mention it below. 

      ""I study primate behavior because, fundamentally, this field is a study of ourselves and what makes us and other primates so unique among animals. I formerly studied psychology based on my interest in human behavior. However, an evolutionary and multi-disciplinary approach can answer very different questions, such as what early human societies looked like and how our social behaviors evolved. These are the questions that I was and am interested in investigating. This is why I pursued anthropology for my undergraduate degree. My own projects in exploring what it means to be human and a primate have touched a wide array of disciplines within and outside of anthropology. I am a truly well-rounded student, with minors in French, psychology, and --- College’s multi-disciplinary honors program. Since I found computer science so useful for my senior honors thesis, I have also begun learning programming as well as web development. My academic interests align well with Dr. Blank Blank, so I will be successful in following my chosen research path. With a wide range of skills and a passionate interest, I will be a valuable asset to Blank Institution as a PhD student. 
	""As an undergraduate, I gained anthropological experience in both field and lab. My field experience was in Sri Lanka under the supervision of Dr. ------- of --- University in January 2013. I conducted a small-scale research project where I observed three populations of hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus). I was interested in the effect of cultural context, i.e. human behavior, on the monkeys’ behavior. Indeed, temple monkeys appeared to exhibit more aggression both towards humans and other monkeys than populations living on a university campus and in a nature preserve. This project gave me a taste of what working in the field is like as a primatologist, and it cemented my fascination with non-human primate behavior. My lab experience was at the --- Skeletal Collection, the third largest skeletal collection in the US, at --- University in Washington, DC. I won the competitive Dana Internship from Ithaca College to perform research in June and July of 2013. For part of the internship, I worked with other undergraduate students, a graduate student, and professors from --- University, SUNY ---, and --- College. My activities in the laboratory included organizational work, a study of nutritional deficiency, and a complete osteobiography of one individual. The latter two culminated in a presentation at ---- College in October 2013. 
	""My hanuman langur project led to my largest independent research undertaking thus far. From my experience in Sri Lanka, I knew that while hanuman langurs were largely tolerated and liked by locals, the toque macaque, an endemic species, is treated with some contempt. These monkeys were subject to the practice of translocation, or capture and release, in attempts to reduce urban populations and human-monkey conflict. Along with a computer science student, I built an agent-based simulation in the Python programming language to experimentally test if translocation has an effect on the demography and social network structure of toque macaque populations. We were able to both build a simulation that produced stable, realistic populations over long intervals of time and perform the translocation experiment with three different experimental conditions. This project culminated in a poster at the American Association of Physical Anthropologists meeting in 2014 and my Ithaca College Department of Anthropology honors thesis. Currently, I am collaborating with ----- (not undergrad institution) College faculty ___ to build similar simulations comparing the evolution of social behavior and structure in hamadryas baboons and early humans. Studies and experiments with simulations can test hypotheses which otherwise could not be tested. My research will continue in this direction towards my dissertation, examining an aspect of social behavior in one or more primate species and simulating that behavior over evolutionary time scales.
	""Simulations and computer science are practical tools in primatology. Therefore, since graduating Ithaca College, I have begun learning in several programming languages. Python is a good language for creating models and simulations. It is complemented by JavaScript for this use, because JavaScript can be used to build animations and visualizations. With these two languages, I have the ability to not just simulate populations, but create reader-friendly visualizations which can be animated or interactive to better communicate results. I have also worked with HTML and CSS to build a cross-platform mobile application called -------. I designed the application for studies and experiments requiring timed observations, like scan sampling of primate behavior. The observation input fields are customizable, as is the observation interval, and the user is prompted by sound or vibration to make each observation. After a maximum of 50 observations, the data are exported into an Excel spreadsheet and sent to either a dropbox.com account or an email address. While this is a small project, it demonstrates how useful and practical the programming skills I now have are. I enjoy working not just with other primatologists, but with any researcher who wants my help with an interesting problem. I can use programming to solve our every-day problems as well as theoretical ones. 
	""One additional skill that makes me an excellent graduate student is my teaching experience. I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant of French from 2011 to graduation, during which time I have taught ten classes. Being a TA involved working with a small to medium group, occasionally building my own lesson plans, engaging students who were often reluctant, and applying my French language skills and experience. I was also a teaching assistant for Forensic Anthropology in spring of 2014. In this position, I often worked with very small groups of students, teaching osteoanatomy and overseeing other lab work. Whatever the subject, I greatly enjoy working with fellow students. Teaching is something I see myself doing as a graduate student and as a graduate of Blank Institution, whether I will be working at another institution or at a museum, zoo, or natural reserve. 
	""I am a hard-working, dedicated student with enough research experience to truly know what I want to do. I will work both in the field and in the computer lab, observing, analyzing, and simulating primate behavior. Not only will I be successful as a student at Blank Institution, I will bring valuable computing skills with me to your department. I am the ideal student for your Blank program.""

2kqaj6,0,2014-10-29,Can I get your opinions on which company I should intern with this summer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2kqaj6/can_i_get_your_opinions_on_which_company_i_should/,"Hey all,

I'm in a bit of a rut. I'm a sophomore (majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Math) right now, looking for advice/opinions.

So far this year, I have two internship offers for summer 2015: one from MathWorks (MA), and one from PG&amp;E (CA).

I interned at MathWorks the summer after my freshman year, I loved interning there, and I would definitely consider working there once I graduate. Problem is, it's too close to home for me (they don't have a CA office I can intern at because it's too small). It's a great company, well-known, and I had a blast working there last summer. If I interned there again, I'd have to stay at home with my parents... not a great situation (look through my other posts if you want more info). They paid $17/hour last summer, and I'm not sure how much I'm getting paid this summer (will find out closer to spring, but I'm not sure how much higher the rate will be).


I want to go out to CA to intern because I really don't want to stay at home this summer. However, I feel MathWorks is better for my resume. I'm more familiar with MathWorks, and I know more about working there than I do about PG&amp;E. I'm torn between getting away from home and being on my own... and working for a well-known company that I'm familiar with.


PG&amp;E is offering $22/hour, plus eligibility for overtime ($33/hour), and $1,000 relocation money. I don't think that would cover much, because I'd have to use that money to fly out to CA and back... which would use it all up, nothing left for housing. I'd have to find/pay for my own housing (they said they'd help out in finding a place but not paying for it). I'd be in the San Francisco area, and I know the cost of living in CA is pretty high, so I don't know if I'd net more or less than I did less summer at MathWorks. I've also never really heard of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, I don't know how good it'd be for my resume.

I have to give PG&amp;E a decision by November 9th, and I'll be getting a formal offer from MathWorks only in the spring (they haven't released spring intern positions yet, but I'm guaranteed getting invited back).

Any opinions or advice? Thanks! :)"

I'm going through the whole grad school process, and I'm afraid I've messed up the GRE twice now. My plans were to apply to Purdue and Georgia Tech (as far as top ten go) for the M.S. program in Electrical Engineering, and several other schools in the top 25. 

For the first run:
163V/157Q/4.5AWA

Second run:
164V/159Q/??? (Just took it on Monday)

The Quantitative section on both of these is below the average for Purdue/GA Tech by a fairly large margin. The first time, I didn't study for the math (bad mistake, I know; I was just very concerned about vocab). Second, I didn't study as much as I needed to -- I didn't realize I scheduled it right in the middle of my midterms. 

Now, for my other credentials:
3.95 GPA, Majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, minor in Mathematics

Research 

internship, studied abroad, eavily involved in on-campus organizations (Engineers without Borders, IEEE)


My question is: Should I retake the GRE? My concern now is that no openings are available until Dec. 1st in my area, and the deadlines for most schools are at the latest Dec. 15th (for priority registration). I just hate the idea of spending ~$600 on this exam, whenever I've already messed it up twice. "

Last summer, I interned with a fairly large company (let's refer to them as company A) relatively close to my home. The commute wasn't terrible and, for the most part, I enjoyed the work that I was doing. At the end of the summer, it came time for them to make decisions about hiring but I let them know that I had a six week winter break in which I would be more than willing to work a second internship (I assumed it would give me more time to impress them and provide me with a source of income over my winter break). They agreed and we went on our separate ways for the next few months. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I participated in a programming competition sponsored by another large company (company B) and our group managed second place. Two days ago, I received a job offer from company B and am now kind of stuck on what to do. I have until next Friday to accept my offer from company B. My main problem with it is that it's in another state. After graduating college, I intended on living at home for a year to pay off some loans and save some money by not having to pay for rent.

I'm ecstatic with my job offer from company B, but with another internship to work before I graduate, I almost feel as though accepting B means I can't do my internship for A. However, my contract with company B states that my position begins with them in June 2015. I want to work my internship this winter because I want to see if company A gives me an offer as well.

How should I handle a situation like this? Both companies are big name companies, have great benefits, etc. But if I let company B slip away, I won't have their offer on the table after next Friday. If I accept B, can I still work for A this winter? If A offers me a job after this winter, would retracting my acceptance from B to accept A (and in turn staying closer to home) burn bridges with company B?"

Lastly, my oldest job listed as a sales associate was a while ago, and I believe my position as a teller trumps being a cashier for a retail store.

I feel like most of my bullet points for my jobs sound like a bunch of crap, but I don't know how else to word them. I'd appreciate it if someone could help me improve my resume.

This might be helpful: I'm going for analyst positions. Here are the responsibilities/qualifications for a specific job posting for an assistant analyst:

They want me for the current school year as well as summer. It's a good gig with good pay and I've heard that this company hires their interns full time afterwards.

Question 1:
Would it be bad to find another summer internship WHILE working with them for the year, and then leaving them for the summer?

Question 2:
If I stick with them for the year and summer, will I have trouble finding work as a software engineer/developer when I graduate next year with only a software test internship? i.e will companies only want me for test/QA positions?

Or will I be fine and am just worrying too much? I tend to do that."

Unfortunately, a lot of internship job postings require that I return to school to finish off my degree right after the internship. That being said, I have a couple of questions for you folks:

1. Is it worth delaying my graduation for an internship?
2. Has anyone done a new grad internship? If so, how was it? Any tips on interning as a new grad?
3. For people who didn't do an internship, how was it like finding a job?
4. Any tips on how to create a resume for an internship?

Looking forward to hearing back from you guys!

I've had an abusive childhood until I was about 12 when I learned I could fight back. My first attempt was when I was 7. I still remember this fairly clearly.

When I was 14 I was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD. I was a very violent teenager, I destroyed stuff at home and in school, threw punches, including at teachers. I've been suspended countless times, at the end of 10th Grade I was placed on an indefinite suspension which lasted 9 months, out of nowhere I got a call to come back for 11th in September - where I got kicked out at Christmas.

I had an overwhelming drive to succeed because I had a money or die attitude, during 9th, 10th and 11th Grade I studied from 4PM to 4AM with only a break for dinner. I got between 3 and 4 hours of sleep and failed everything. My highest mark was 13%. There was also a girl I liked who was very smart and currently studies at Oxford, I tried to compare myself with her, not because I wanted to prove anything to her but because I wanted to be better. 
 
Since I've been kicked out of school I've tried various internships and I currently manage my Father's investment portfolio and take a cut, I've beat the market 3 years in a row. I got fired from two internships for destruction of property. I had to pay a settlement on both occasions to avoid police action.

I've slept with hookers when I was 17 and became a heavy smoker at 15 which caused me to drop my sport where I had a prominent position. 

I've put on 88lbs in a year, been through 4 doctors and psychologists, ECT and several stints in a high intensity ward at our mental health institute. I have made 3 attempts since then, ended up in hospital twice. 

Then there's the usual relationship and friendship issues. Naturally, I drove people away with my negativity. I still live with my parents but they're extremely disappointed with me and don't really interact. I can't do anything, I feel paralysed by what's going on in my head and the effects of stress on my body. I feel like I'm just going to repeat what's happened in the past. "
2kvwm5,21,2014-10-31,What should I do next / when do I know that I know enough to start applying for jobs?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2kvwm5/what_should_i_do_next_when_do_i_know_that_i_know/,"This is a long post, but I genuinely don't know what to do next, and yes I have read the sidebar.

I've been messing around with computers since my early teens, and now I'm about to finish my CS degree, but in a terrible college with terrible teachers with no real job prospects (not even internships), so I've been trying to learn everything on my own from the internet instead.

When do I know if I know enough to start applying for jobs? And if I write here what I have already learned over the last few years, could someone tell me what I'm lacking and should learn next in order to be able to apply for jobs? I just never feel like I know enough, and like to learn more. I'm kind of a jack of a few trades and a master of none.

I've divided it into sections so anyone with knowledge of either can focus on that part instead, since this is a long post and I can't expect people to read all of it.

**Web**:

I've been messing around with HTML and CSS, and a little bit of Javascript for years, and I can implement any old world static site with relative ease. Responsive layouts are a bit of a mystery to me. I do stick to the HTML5 standard, and do often use percentages and ems, but I'm not sure when to use which one, and how font sizes related to that. JQuery usually just for animation and AJAX. Should I learn AngularJS? Heard a lot about it. Have never used Photoshop, Illustrator, etc for web design, which I hear is very important in the front end business.

I can use basic PHP to include stuff and do basic behind the scenes programming, and have made basic dynamic websites using it (including working with MySQL). There was an online course of Harvard's CS50 course which had fun little PHP projects. I have messed around with Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET (I technically have a Microsoft Certified Professional and Microsoft Training Associate certificate for it, but I don't actually know much, and I suspect they're not that important anyway) and JSP.

Questions: I don't understand how the regular users update sites though. As in say I write a PHP based website for a local small business and do stuff like using controllers and views to implement it along with a small MySQL database, and say I upload it on a server and give it to the client. What if that person wants to update the site? Does he have to manually open the php file and make changes and manually upload the file to the server? I suppose I'll have to use a CMS for that like Wordpress and just instruct the client how to operate it? What if I'm making a blog for a friend, same deal? Use some kind of a ready made CMS or some kind of framework and tell them how to use it?

What should I be looking to learn in web dev? Should I focus on learning stuff like Wordpress? Should I focus on Rails or Django? Is there any real preference between stuff like PHP, Python, Ruby, etc and should I learn stuff about that? How about Node.js?

**Mobile**:

I've been doing a bit of Android programming the last year or so. There's so much stuff in it! I have to Google almost every little thing, and stackoverflow and the Android Developer site become a highly visited sites for me. Is it cheating to refer to stackoverflow?

I've made a few simple apps, one for finding Instagram pictures posted near your location (thought it was simple, took weeks to actually do), one for sending commands from my phone and controlling my PC with it using socket programming, and a minimal app I made last night to type in a name of a TV show and display basic information about it (where a lot of the APIs were not that good for me so frustrated, I just wrote an IMDB web scraper instead which somehow ended up faster than the third party IMDB APIs). Some smaller apps for testing features and completing two of the courses on Coursera in the last year.

Haven't submitted an app to the Play Store yet because of the entry fee and some kind of incompatibility with the debit card I have and Google Wallet. Should I get a credit card for this instead? The entire reason I got a debit card was to avoid credit cards.

Even though Android is quite frustrating and it literally takes me a week to do something that I could do in a day in HTML, it's still very fun to do.

No experience with iOS or any of the cross platform SDKs.

What should I focus on learning next in mobile (specifically Android)? Any apps I should try building for practice? Maybe learn the NDK?

**General Programming**

I had basic Java all four years of high school so that's fairly strong, and working with Android has given me better understanding of inheritance and interfaces.

Basic C and C++ were taught in college so I suppose I know that but pointers still often give me the heebie-jeebies although I can use them. Basics are fine, although I'm not that well versed in STL and have to look things up all the time.

I started learning Python to pass the time and find it amazing, and constantly use it to write smaller programs and scripts. I exclusively use Python to solve the Project Euler problems, and write little scripts making use of APIs like imgur and gfycat using Python. Not a lot of experience using classes, or even more than a single python file in a project really.

I have messed around with C#, Scala, Ruby, Racket, 16 bit Assembly, as part of coursework of either college courses or online courses (like [this](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang) amazing one).

I take part in the kind of competitions where you have to take in an input and get a specific output, but I tend to brute force my way through the problem, which is fine for local competitions, but leave me with O(n^2) solutions which don't really fly in online international competitions. Any particular things I should look at to improve that?

Which languages should I look to focus on primarily in terms of employability?

**finally {**

This ended up being longer than I initially thought it would, but I thought someone with knowledge and experience could tell me what I need to focus on learning or improving to be employable if they read what I know.

A part of the reason it may seem a bit less for someone who's about to graduate with a CS degree is because the place I'm at is really not conducive to learning about computers. The college is suppose to be in English, but most of the teachers aren't comfortable with the language and neither are the students. Most of the students themselves are not interested in computers at all, but are doing this because they were told they'd get great jobs in engineering, or because their parents wanted them to go into a 'respectable' field. The teachers themselves tell us that the only reason they got into teaching was because they were rejected by the companies and had no other choice.

I have nobody to guide me, which is fine, I'm not a baby (barring this post), but I just need to know where to focus my efforts. I'm comfortable with  all three main topics as a career, so I'd appreciate any advice for each of them.

I don't even have a resume. All my stuff is quite general so what stuff should I actually put on my resume? I'm guessing the stuff with only basic familiarity should be excluded completely? I've taken some 15-20 free online courses with certificates (which don't mean much since people could potentially cheat and get the required score to obtain them), I realize these are inconsequential to employers, but I've honestly learnt more from them than I have from college, could it at least merit a single line in the resume as an indicator of active interest in learning more?

I'm not here to look for a job, I'm here to find out what to learn and know in order to get one.

I have a bachelor’s degree in CIS, and in my last semester I got a job offer that was too good to turn down, not in my field of studies. I am working as a project manager/ System engineer, but the systems and software that we use are all proprietary. This makes it very difficult to market myself if I decide to move on in my career. How do I find a company that is willing to take me on afterhours or weekends to gain valuable real life experience? I am not after the paycheck, as long as I don’t do desktop support (Which I have done for 2 years while doing my bachelors). I want to work behind the scene configuring Servers, Exchange, Storage, Backups, Virtualization, and Migrations, or specialize in something that is universal, you get the idea. I would also enjoy configuring switches and routers, firewalls, and all the exciting stuff that comes with a Sysadmin and network job.

Some of you will say, do your certs and setup a home lab, but I am sure you will also agree home labs does not come close to real life experience. I have spent time setting up home labs, and study online, but lose interest after a while since I don’t use what I learn in a real life environment. As you all know companies are looking for experience.
I get a decent salary, but I need to think about my future. If I lose my job tomorrow, and I want to work in the field of my studies and passion, then I would start as an intern SysAdmin or Network Engineer. I will take a 70% pay cut. 

Anyone in Baltimore county (Preferably closed to Owings Mills), that work in a datacenter, that does a lot of weekend/ after hour work that will be willing to have someone shadow you? 

I will be posting this is r/sysadmin, and r/networking.
