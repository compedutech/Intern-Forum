I was thinking about internships earlier today. I'll probably want to start sending out applications in August 2022. Would knowledge of SQL and Python be enough to land an interview? Or should I just start out in web development? And do one of [these](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/)? [Also](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/). Which route seems more practical / a better use of my time?

background: i have an AAS in IT an experience working in IT support and an IT config summer, both were summer internships. i have a background of some programming with java, c++ and python. i understand basic networking concepts such as tcp/ip the osi layer, a bit of cabling, some windows server and active directory (been working on that in a homelab vm), im familiar with subnetting but not to strong with doing it by hand yet, (we are currently working on it). after i finished my AAS i moved to a private 4 year school for cyber security and it wasnt right for me and left, transferred to my local state school and it has been a mess ever since. this is the link to the [course curriculum](https://www.farmingdale.edu/curriculum/bs-cst.shtml). based of the courses i was excited but soon learned it was a bad mistake and to late to transfer again or it would add another year minimum to graduate and wasnt really an option. to be blunt, weve learned next to nothing in our program and its a discussion for another time. my fellow students and i work together a ton to help each other and self teach ourselves what we can to make up. i also have a website of [my portfolio](http://carminea.net/).

moving to my current plan:  since i am graduating this spring i plan to start applying to jobs around january. i have no idea job ideas with what is possible for me because no professor i have actually has security experience so i cant ask them for insight. i figure some sort of entry level job or a IT job is best  to look for. i plan to begin to work on certs this winter as well, id like to test for net+ this winter and move to sec+ next. i have no real experience in cyber security. i currently live in new york and have no issue with moving. 

if you read to this point i appreciate you. im a lost student that just needs some guidance and input."

I won't make this post long, but just wanted to say that the last 2 years had been (I wouldn't say horrible) but tough! I broke my leg, got into a car accident, basically had to spend a lot of money and was financially drained.

I had to work with a broken leg while going to university for a while. Had negative balances on my account frequently. (I pay for my own tuition, and live by myself)

I was thinking I wouldn't be able to afford continuing my education I was already a senior so it would suck if I couldn't graduate because of all of that.

For the past 4 years things haven't been working out properly, and the last 2 years were tough. But I have always got back on track and reminded myself that things will get better and finally I can see that they are.

I got an internship during the summer which allowed me to pay off some of my debt. And , things have been working out slowly. I still feel stuck from time to time but I've realized that the most important thing is not giving up.

I didn't do well with school ever since that accident. But, I am doing well now and I know I can do much better. I just got an email from my school basically saying I got some scholarship and now I feel go good. Now, I can at least finally continue my education. Things are not ""perfect"" yet but it's much better now.

I guess I just want to ask you guys to just hang in there if you feel like nothing is working out or something. I was in a bad place for too long, but somewhere I still believed that things would work out and it does!! I hope you all have a wonderful day! I just wanted to share this with someone."

For my internship, I worked as a software engineer. I managed to make a good impression at the company, and they offered me a full-time position after graduation.

The company is very small with a high staff turnover and frequent complaints about management etc

From talking to other employees, the pay is below average for similar IT positions in my country.

I myself was only making minimum wage as an intern, although this was still better than being unpaid, and I am grateful for the opportunity.

I currently work weekends at this company while I finish my degree, with the expectation I will continue to work there after graduation.

However, there are a lot of enticing options elsewhere. I've been messaged by a recruiter about another role, and I keep seeing dev jobs advertised that I'm interested in applying for.

Ideally, I would work somewhere else (preferably in a larger company with a better-defined way of doing things) 

I'm worried about applying for jobs in case my boss finds out.

He's very well connected within the local IT sphere, and I'm concerned he might hear about any other applications through the grapevine. For example, I'd love to apply to apple, but I'm afraid it would get back to him. We're based near apple, and the HR staff would presumably recognise the company name and give my boss a call.

The worst-case scenario is that I lose the opportunity with this company and have no job after I graduate.

However, I'm also worried about ""settling"".

I achieved the highest exam results in my school, but I let my parents convince me out of attending a higher-ranked college, and I've regretted it throughout my whole degree.

My dad seems to think that loyalty is most important with jobs, and I should stick to the position I've been offered.

But will this just mean settling for a mediocre option once again?

The interview is with a company is name/brand value is far stronger than all of the SWE postings I'm hearing back from.

All-in, I'm getting good bites on my applications, and I'm very prepared for Leetcode. My end-goal is big N, so these questions are geared towards hitting that.

*  Iis breaking into DE easier than SWE?
* if I had a DE position on my resume with a solid company, would my application for SWE postings get more bites with better companies? Enough for big N?
* when should I start to apply to big N companies once I've secured either a DE job or an entry-level SWE position? Should I wait a little or can I start applying right away?"

To be honest, I know what I want in a job and what I like, but im pretty clueless on what jobs would give me the lifestyle I want. So, here’s a list of things i’m good at, like, and don’t like, and i’m wondering if anyone could give me some direction! 

- currently, i’m in my college’s business school, which is a pretty good program with great internships and prospects (I live in New York) If I do stick with business, i’m NOT interested in the financial/accounting aspect,
i’m more interested in marketing and communications/ PR

- I don’t want a job that takes over my life and impacts me when i’m home. I want a job that i simply enjoy enough to keep doing it in order to live the life I want and be supported financially 

- I love psychology, but not the clinical or mental health aspect as I have mental health problems myself and can’t see myself in the field. I like the idea of applying psychology to work, like business, which is why I like marketing. I also like the idea of career counseling, guidance counseling, anything like that where I can use psychology skills but not have to deal with such strong and heavy problems mentally. 

- I love the idea of jobs that educate and inform people.. not necessarily a teacher, but like.. a midwife is something I wanted to be for a little while because I like the idea of having a client over a long period of time and helping them make informed decision, discussing various options, and educating them on something i’m interested in (pregnancy and birth, even early child development i’m especially interested in) I dont think I could become a midwife because of the nursing / medical aspect, and because of the work life balance.. on call 24/7 etc. 

- I like being my own boss, and leading others. since i was little my mom has always said I need to run my own business because I loved bossing my little sister and cousins around and teaching them things. 

- The one thing steering me away from marketing is that I don’t want such a corporate job. I wouldn’t want to sit at a desk and market for some big company. I love small businesses and being involved in my community, I would rather do marketing for something on a smaller scale where I can see the impact and be involved more. 

- I’m planning on minoring in health&amp;wellness or women’s studies because these are both things I care about a lot, and I would love to have a job related to these fields. For example, a marketing job for a health and wellness company, or something involving women’s wellness, anything like this. 

- I want to know my job is making the world a better place, or at least not making it worse. In my school a lot of people call business majors “capitalism majors” and i don’t like that aspect, I want to go in a field that would allow me to change things for the better. I’m taking an environmental science class and would love to be in a job where I am helping the environment in some way.

- I love media, I love journalism and this also goes hand in hand with my interest in health and wellness or women’s studies.. I don’t know, i love creating things that educate and inform on topics i’m interested in. 

- this is just for an idea on what I am like, but my dream job would be owning my own coffee/book shop or small boutique in a smaller town where I can focus on having the company being environmentally friendly and such, and focus on having a good impact in the community. doing fundraisers, just being involved. I worked at a small local business last year that was a  cute little shop, It was super tiny i worked alone and opened/ closed it.. my manager was a PR manager who opened the shop as a side passion..  We were in a small town, and often did fun events, get togethers, and I really loved that aspect of it. I got to see the impact it made, and also my boss being a PR manager showed me some aspects to what a job in that industry is like, and I enjoyed it. 

wow this is a lot more than i anticipated writing… As you can see I know my interests and I know what i’d like in a job but i’m just not sure the best way to go about achieving these goals… any tips? any job i should look into? thank you so much !!!!!"

I’m only in second year so idk what I need to learn for the devops question.

I have some experience using Linux, but nothing related to devops. 

If anyone knows what I should be learning I’ll be forever grateful."
pzd4eq,59,2021-10-01,Small victory lap and lessons I've learned as I managed to get a 57% raise,throw_out_and_burn,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/pzd4eq/small_victory_lap_and_lessons_ive_learned_as_i/,"Using my throwaway to stay anonymous but I wanted to share my accomplishment and maybe give some advice to others in this sub who may be looking for something.

I (28M) live in KY, have my undergrad in Finance and an MBA - both from the same school (non target).  I went straight into my MBA without any work experience due to scholarships from sports carrying over into grad school.  I didn't necessarily want to do this but it saved me \~$24k in MBA tuition.  Due to sports I didn't get to intern until I started my MBA - I think I was about 23 at this point.  Honestly, at this age and especially when I started college, my goal was to get in the NFL (I did get a tryout at an NFL team but didn't get signed) and a career was a second thought.  I didn't really get my head on straight until I started working.  I wasn't a slouch and my GPA was good but I don't think that means much.  My internship consisted of mostly supply chain/finance at a pretty prestigious local company (\~$3B annual rev) in my state but I didn't make much ($18/hr).  I had a lot of trouble finding a job because I didn't intern during undergrad so I technically got a pretty late start in the job market in relation to my age.  I literally landed that internship because I emailed the CEO directly and said that I wanted to work at that company.. I also attached the letter I wrote for my MBA admission thesis about why I wanted to get my MBA (so I could work at said company).  Got an interview and started within about 3 weeks of sending that email.

I spent about 1.5 years in that internship (yes, you read that correctly).  I had trouble finding a salaried job so they let me stay after my internship ended (still paid as an intern) to work in various groups that needed help. After that, I finally landed a job at another company where I was hired as a Senior FP&amp;A analyst... Still not sure how I managed to skip the 'analyst' stage.  I got hired on at $70k for this job and I was 25 at this point.  I was in that job for 1.5 years and worked my tail off and got promoted within the same company to a Manager, Corporate Finance role making $80k + 10% bonus potential. Based on my title, this was arguably a bit low in comp, but I didn't necessarily have the years of experience to justify much higher pay... And I definitely didn't have the knowledge. I got the job because I did good in my first job and I built some connections around the office.  To clarify, I was not a brown-noser by any means and I stayed out of office politics.  I was in this position for a little more than 1.5 years and ended up leaving to take my current role about a month ago.  

With my current role that I just took (Director of Corp Dev), I ended up negotiating $128.5k base + 20% bonus potential..  Which works out to \~57% bump in base pay ($48k).  It's been a unique, and often frustrating journey to get to this point but I feel like I finally have some breathing room now.  Coming out of school I honestly didn't think I'd reach this point until I was at least 35.  I honestly don't feel like I'm experienced enough or smart enough to be where I'm at in my career but I'm very thankful to be in this situation and I owe a lot of my good fortune to my wife, who is a prayer warrior - and ultimately God... I know a lot of people here don't believe in God (and I'm not here to debate that) but looking at where I'm at now versus where I started, there's no other logical explanation I can think of.

Anyways, here are a few things that I've learned so far throughout the journey that I thought may be useful to some of the younger people in the sub.  Probably some older ones too...

\- Relationships are important.  Learn to get along with everyone around you...  That doesn't mean you have to be friends with everyone.  People see through fake.  Step out of your comfort zone often.  Give credit to others, take no credit for yourself! Get involved as much as you can

\- Hard work normally beats knowledge..  I'm definitely not the smartest person in any room I step into

\- The only things you can control are your work ethic and attitude 

\- Say yes to every task that you are given and give it your best shot.  Be positive about it even if it sucks

\- Positivity is a choice

\- Ask for advice, learn to take criticism.  Learn to deliver criticism with love.  Don't let other people tell you that you aren't capable.  Prove them wrong with your work ethic and attitude

\- Be a good person.  Don't be a jerk.  Help others around you and don't act like you are above anyone

\- Having money is pointless if you don't have a life where you can use it

\- Don't sell yourself short.  Get better every day

 \-Lastly, the thing that I feel that took me a few years to really learn, and is probably the most practical lesson out of all is to show confidence with your body language!  This is especially true in interviews.    When you sit down, make yourself comfortable.  Take off your jacket, sit back, cross your legs, open your arms, and speak up!  Learn how to make small-talk.  Make the hiring manager feel like they can have confidence in you.  Interviewing is just like dating.  If you act scared or super nervous, people will pick up on it and ultimately dismiss you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope I gave you something to put to use.  I still have a long way to go in my career (hopefully) but I felt like I should share my journey up to this point while taking a small victory lap because it's always good to celebrate a win every now and then."

So I'm in CS non-coop, managed to find 2 internships previously and got great feedback at both of them, but I've only gotten a single interview this term (which didn't work out, though they might be interested in hiring me for full-time) and a bunch of hackerranks which I did well on, but no follow up (I passed most/all of the public test cases). What gives?    
  
Grades wise I'm also doing fine, I have an ~80% average, with a couple of 90's on 3rd year CS courses.
  
Alternatively, if you'd like to hire me for an internship, please reach out, I'm flexible with dates (perks of not being in co-op)."

pzgls7,1,2021-10-01,How do I tell if my workplace is toxic or I am just looking too much into things?,jenaritana,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pzgls7/how_do_i_tell_if_my_workplace_is_toxic_or_i_am/,"So I feel like the place where I am interning at right now is very toxic towards me. I have been feeling so much of anxiety and self depreciation. My self esteem has always been sorta bad (it was sorta improving at beginning of the internship) but now I feel so small and less than everyone.

I have been loaded with work both internship related and also school related. Sometimes I have to stay awake till 3 to complete everything on time. I still try my best to do stuff. The person in charge of my team bought up that I am not really good at communicating with them that I should communicate more with them. And I do agree with that and tried to rectify that. 

But when there was an issue that I bought up to them regarding another employee with who I collaborate with, was doing sub-par work and is not delivering their work on time and even yelled at me (which made me feel bad) when I brought that up (really vaguely and nicely) in a meeting. They said they will look into it. I don't know if they did. They never told me even when asked. 

And today I bought up to them that they might be giving me a little too much work and I am having issue doing everything (this is an internship I am allowed to say this right?). Again my superior didn't listen to me and told me she thought the amount of work I am doing is fine by her standards. But frankly I don't even know if she knows how many people I have collaborated with to do different sort of work that she is not involved in. There is another person in similar working position as me and when during a compulsory meeting we have to tell what work we have done. Her work always seems less than mine.

My superior didn't listen to me when I told her about this issue, she told me to communicate with her but when I bring something up she makes it sound like I am making a big deal out of nothing. I feel like I am making a big deal out of nothing. Cause one time she would be speaking nicely and other times I would feel like she is ridiculing me. I feel like I am being stupid, I have never doubted myself more. I won best intern award (with another intern as well) which made me think maybe I am just overreacting but I always feel like no one likes me there, someone even said the work I did was done by him and when I tried to tell the truth it felt like no one believed me.

They pay is so less but I still wanted to work here cause I was gaining experience, my friend says everywhere its the same. But I don't know. 

Am I getting gaslighted? What is happening? Can please anyone help? Am I being too stupid here and seeing things that are not there? I am literally feeling so depressed and small right now. I would like to hear some opinions of someone who has been in the workforce longer than me."
pzh19s,157,2021-10-01,Why is it a standard to form clubs / nonprofits or be in useless leadership positions for good colleges?,aidanisverycool_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pzh19s/why_is_it_a_standard_to_form_clubs_nonprofits_or/,"It's like a useless meta. We have four active volunteering clubs at my high school and a group of about 8 or so seniors just formed another one (all as co-founders). Obviously it's just to add it to the college application, but why is this the meta? I hear so often about the classic ""forming a non profit that does nothing"" strategy for the better schools in the country - don't colleges notice that these clubs and nonprofits aren't really doing anything? It's almost the same thing with leadership positions in clubs too. In every club with 20+ people there's always like 10 leadership positions available. In our NHS we have four positions that could be taken by one person - vice president &amp; president of in school operations, vice president &amp; president of out-of-school operations (awful lot of filler considering NHS barely does anything). Treasurer (makes sure everyone pays their $25 then does nothing). President of Technology (sends out a remind message once a month saying ""Meeting tomorrow!""). One of my friends is the ""Head of Mentoring"" or something that sounds really prestigious but all he does is show up daily to make sure that the two people who tutor kids are doing their jobs for like a minute then dips. I'm not trying to pull him down or nothing; he's the one duping the system like everyone else, and I'm just a little bit annoyed that I didn't pursue leadership positions harder. I was real stressed out with 4 AP tests in junior year and decided that I didn't have the time to take on a seemingly important job like the president of a club. I applied but I didn't push for it very hard. Now, two of my friends are literally the VP of four different clubs and I don't think it takes up like any of their time. It seems like the system is a little bit flawed in this sense. It only really angers me cause colleges seem to encourage it. On the CommonApp, one of the text boxes in Activities says ""Position in club"" which definitely makes me feel a little sad to just put ""member"" instead of ""Vice-President of Offshore Funding."" And, on my school's ""teacher recommendation submission form,"" one of the few text boxes says ""**Have you pursued any interests that relate to this subject outside of class? If yes, please explain (i.e. mentor, study group member, tutor, internship, started a related club).**"" Like, really? Intern (as a high schooler, which I looked into but I needed gas money to get to school so I just got a job instead), tutor (in a subject that you can't really tutor in because the one teacher in our school for it stays after every day), or form a club. There's not really a 'computer club' at my school, and putting ""I've built computers in my spare time for people as a small side-business"" feels a little bit dorky in comparison to ""Founder, CEO, vice-president, and member of the Peer Tutoring in Computer Subjects on Wednesdays Sometimes Club.""

Wait. Maybe I should have founded a computer club."

pzho5o,1,2021-10-01,'Settling' on your interests,lukajebeno,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/pzho5o/settling_on_your_interests/,"So I'm a mol bio undergrad student and I've been involved in a number of computational genomics/bioinformatics projects and i plan to go in that direction career-wise. However, vast majority of projects, internships, masters degrees, jobs etc. are in the area of human health. I get that directly helping people out is one of the main reasons why many people go into bioinformatics, but my dream is to just sequence the metagenomes from the puddles in some tundra, jungle etc. (I know it's wildly specific, but the heart wants what it wants). However, jobs that allow this are rare (from what the searches showed me), so I'm contemplating just going with the whatever life offers me, in the sphere of genomics. The advice I got from older students/researchers is to focus on what I'm doing, not necessarily on the ""model system"", and computational genomics is what I enjoy. Did you have to 'settle' on your research area, and do you recommend it? Is this area that flexible, as some people around me have suggested, that I could relatively easily transition into my dream area from whatever else branch of genomics?

GPA 9.45/10
GRE 308 (161Q 147 4.5 AWA) 
TOEFL 113
2 internships

I started applying to unis for MS CS in 2020. I wanted to start grad school this fall ('21). Due to some predicaments I couldn't go and will be re applying next fall (Fall '22). 


I did receive a few admits (USC MS CS, ASU MS SE and Northeastern MS SE) but as I said, I can't attend this intake. 

Updated profile (till date) 

GPA 9.5/10
Same GRE and TOEFL
3 internships
1 research paper on AI (Scopus Indexed if that matters)
And by Fall 22 I'll have an year of experience. 

What are my chances that I'll receive an admit once again from USC for MS CS? How do I increase my chances of being admitted?"

pzie2a,6,2021-10-01,28yo and becoming too self-conscious about my age,linkenski,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/pzie2a/28yo_and_becoming_too_selfconscious_about_my_age/,"I just don't feel that mature. My sister is two years older and had her first kid. I know I'm not becoming a dad when I'm 30. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 16, I know... but I have some big problems with social anxiety and I spend a lot of internet time on the r/socialanxiety sub, because frankly I've become a bit of a cripple.

Cripple aside, I still managed to get a degree when I was 26, I had an internship, and though I completely failed the jobhunting I signed on for a top-up degree and though I dropped out it went well the first year at least (covid lockdown #2 happened and things got too awkward for me socially, felt like I failed in groups etc.)

And this isn't to make this all about the anxiety, that's why I'm here, not there. It is a huge issue and at the centre of a lot of my problems, but honestly, what's holding me back lately is that I'm 28 and I know I'm making a way too big deal out of it. I lack lots of life experience like the fact that I don't go out on weekends and haven't since I was 20 years, I don't have outside hobbies and I have almost no work experience, and obviously at the core of that I lack social skills.

It has this huge stigma because I got another roommate recently who is 19 and I deliberately haven't bumped into them too often but in my impression they're still more mature than I am. A lot of people find a lot of natural responsibility and sense of what you have to do already around being 18-20 years old. I feel like I've been procrastinating and fumbling since I was that age and now 8 years later I just haven't learned a damn thing. I feel like I'm supposed to be ""up here"" in the next step of adulthood and I'm just not. It makes me afraid of talking to people who are younger than me because I kinda feel like I'm on their level but I'm obviously older.

When I entered the undergrad when I was 21 I remember going ""Woah?!"" when a guy I talked to told me he was 28. In fact, I didn't even think about it before that, but after he told me I did actually start thinking ""What has he been doing if he's just starting this up?"" so maybe it's just me. Gah, I don't know. How do you deal with feeling immature at a maturing age?"
pzinbn,2,2021-10-01,How to tell a boss/manager you can’t start early?,Mason7F,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/pzinbn/how_to_tell_a_bossmanager_you_cant_start_early/,"Hi everyone!

I’m a college student who just found out that I got the internship I need to graduate. Throughout the hiring process, I made it clear I was looking to start in January when I had less courses and had more time (this is a management internship). I found out today that I got the internship, and the internship coordinator asked me if I wanted to start early and be hired on as a regular co-worker for the few months up until then. I said it was a possibility and that I would get back to him. 

My questions - How do I, politely, tell him that I can’t start until the original date in January? Would it be okay to send an e-mail to him telling him this? 

Overall, I’m just worried it’s going to be a “negative view” that they might assume on me and I’m worried. Thank you!"

This happened right when my therapist's internship ended and I haven't been able to see her for the last month while she's getting her official license. 

My family and I have been in the process of moving for about a week now. My job gets practically busy at the end of the year, so much so that they can't do much to accommodate me, so now I have to try any prepare myself for that. My my best friend got a new job and won't be able to see me for a while now. My boyfriend hasn't seemed too understanding or supportive lately.

I just feel so alone right now. There's so much going on and it's making so hard to try and sort out my ADHD. I feel like no one understands me or what I'm going through and I have no one to talk to. It's so bad my thoughts of hurting myself are starting to come back.

Now I'm just sitting in my car, refusing to go home after work because I don't feel comfortable there right now."
pzjp4w,15,2021-10-01,My experience with CodeSignal - I hate it,sadStudentCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pzjp4w/my_experience_with_codesignal_i_hate_it/,"Hey Everyone!

This is my first ever post on Reddit. I have been thinking about this issue for a couple of days due to my frustration and I just really want to hear what others might think. 

My Issue is CodeSignal. I have been doing the general assessment for more than a year now. I can confidently say that I am usually really good at coding challenges from Hackerrank, Codility, etc, and most of the time I get called for the next rounds. However, the story with CodeSignal is completely different. 

I usually end up solving the first two questions in 15 minutes at most. Thus, I have 55 minutes left on questions 3 and 4. I have no idea what happens, but usually, I end up not solving neither 3 nor 4. Lately, I decided to focus on solving only 3 or 4. However, even that does not help. The problem is not that I cannot solve it at all but rather I am missing a single edge case that is tested by most of the test cases. 

For instance, today, I finished the first two in 12 minutes, being left with 58 minutes for the last two. I decided to focus on the third only and again, missed an edge case, which ended up failing most of my test cases. The question was medium-hard. 

Another inhumane part about the CodeSignal is that you cannot retake it for the next two weeks which I think is absurd since more and more companies use CodeSignal for hiring nowadays. 

Gladly, I already have an amazing offer from my internship company and that's why I am not that worried. But I am still super frustrated and disappointed. 

What do you think? How was your experience with CodeSignal? Any suggestions would be appreciated!"

I thought this new company would give me new work but it is the same type of work and the company I’ve worked at started giving me new projects so I just... asked if they still want me back and they’re like yes please! And I was like okie dokie then! 
I felt bad but yeah I mean I saved them time from the interview. 

I left because it used to be an internship and now they’re offered me a part time job before summer and I started working at a different place that’s overall like my dream work (once again another internship but paid)

Anyways this was just a rant and I felt bad.
But it’s okay and it’ll probably happen again.
I felt really indecisive but I made the decision."

I have graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of computer science, and I currently reside in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I was in the non co op stream so I graduated without any work experience whatsoever. Immediately after graduation I applied to a ton of jobs but didnt get any, it was crickets all over. So I quickly realized that my resume was crap, so I joined a startup for 6 months where I did front end React work(this was a small startup based out of velocity, which is a tech incubator in kitchener/waterloo area) and i didnt get paid. Currently I am working on a full stack project with node.js with express and REST Api for backend and React front end(it is my personal blog, it has CRUD ops and user authen, backend is done, currently working on front end now, I think I should be done by the end of this month). My brother(who is also a software eng, graduated from Univ of Waterloo soft eng with co op and has had numerous jobs now) is leaving the house in 6 months, and so I have to find a job before he leaves, otherwise I will be forced to work at Tim Hortons to make ends meet, and I would rather avoid that. My question is, what can I do within these 6 months that will maximize my chances of getting a CS job? My brother says dont waste time with personal project, My plan was to do one full stack project with REST and one full stack project with GraphQL, but I convinced him to let me do at least one REST, full stack project(which I am currently doing), instead he says I should contribute code to mattermost(a company he worked at before for 2 yrs and than left and is now working somewhere else, mattermost repo is on github with open issues for people to contribute), he says contributing to mattermost issues looks much better for my resume than working on personal projects. What do you guys think? (Note: if anyone wants me to send them my resume for review, I will be happy to do so, just dm me and I will send it). What are your thoughts? is there a way for me to get internship exp at big name companies even after I have graduated? if there is, please let me know. Any helpful suggestion/tips/constructive feedback that I can do for the next 6 months to maximize my chances of getting a CS job would be highly appreciated."

pzlh0c,3,2021-10-01,Parents’ dogs are causing me distress and I feel trapped,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pzlh0c/parents_dogs_are_causing_me_distress_and_i_feel/,"I  (20M) am living with my parents for the next few months while I’m  working a remote internship job from home. They have 2 small dogs, both  around 15 years old.

Dog 1 is  paralyzed from the waist down and has been this way nearly all its life.  Dog 1 cannot control its bowels and will urinate everywhere and jump in  its own feces if left alone for any amount of time from a few minutes  to a few hours. While my parents try their best to care for Dog 1, they  cannot keep up, and there are usually a few incidents per day of Dog 1  making all over the house. This does not seem to cause any distress to  Dog 1, but it’s beginning to drive me mad as I feel “trapped”. Having to  care for Dog 1 has also put a lot of strain on my family’s  relationship, due to the level of stress from having to constantly deal  with urine and feces from Dog 1. My family and I already have enough  tension in our relationship due to differing values, but I feel like the  stress from living with Dog 1 is exacerbating everything.

Dog  2 has a large cyst-like lump (unknown if cancerous) that has been  growing over the past year. One of my parents is a doctor and has been  routinely removing fluid from the growing cyst every few days over the  past few months because it causes discomfort to Dog 2 when it fills up,  and Dog 2 will bite the cyst if it is not drained, causing fluid to leak  all over the floor in the house. Dog 2 also does not like to go outside  to urinate if I call Dog 2 (that is to say, Dog 2 only really “listens”  to one of my parents), so Dog 2 often urinates “puddles” around the  house despite being somewhat potty trained since a young age.

For  years, I have always been shy and embarrassed to invite any friends  over due to the high possibility of an incident occurring – it is  extremely unpleasant, and it smells very bad when such incidents occur.  Additionally, I feel like I cannot vent to anyone about this because of  how horrifying and unusual it is, so I feel suffocated in a way. I don’t  think any of my friends would understand what I have been dealing with  for the past 10 to 15 years because, from their brief interactions with  my dogs, they have only seen the “good side” of them.

I  know that saying this might make me sound like a monster, but there are  times where I wish the dogs would just die already because I feel like  living around their constant filth is making me miserable and its  frankly traumatizing. Despite my current internship job being entirely  remote, I was going to sublet a place in a larger city nearby for a few  months. My family convinced me I shouldn’t waste my money when I can  simply live with them for free, but now I realize I’m stuck here until I  return to my studies in a different city in January. I don’t know how  I’m going to deal with the stress of living with my parents’ dogs  without losing my mind."

I feel like a lot of things are happening to me all at once and I have panic attacks every couple of days due to my realization of the life I'm living.

I graduated with a chemical engineering degree (took me 6.5 years) and I barely made it. I failed several classes, felt so lost with the theoretical explanations that my mind couldn't grasp no matter what I did and I was an extremely hyper and emotionally charged up individual and made a reputation or it during university. I managed to do an internship at an oil and gas company (pure luck and lots of embellishment) and somehow managed to get hyper-focused on the work there. I was 21-22 at the time and I would stay in the office some days till 2 AM working on projects. I managed to impress my managers with my work however my behavior was really weird. I would have a short temper, would be on the extreme end of the spectrum emotionally (sad or happy) with co-workers and I just gave off weird vibes that people could tell that I wasn't right in the head. I was actually offered a return offer based on my work but I was in emotional turmoil and didn't take it.

Fast forward, after graduation, I couldn't find a job at all in 2017. I also barely tried to apply for one. Like no matter what I did, I just couldn't care about getting a job or putting in the effort to land one. 1.5 years passed by and I literally just stayed at home unemployed with no work. Lived in my parent's house all alone and just got by. Thinking back at this I feel disgusted. 

One of my friends convinced me to start the 2nd degree in Computer Science because of all the job opportunities. I was reluctant at first but gave in. During the entire course of my degree, I barely learned anything nor did I have the strength or focus to want to learn. My programming skills are non-existent nor could I barely understand the theory. My will to learn was just not there no matter how many times I tried to focus. My friend would literally do all assignments and projects and would hook me up with old exams to memorize. I literally graduated with a degree in computer science this summer and I barely understood anything. I also got a couple of internships which this time around unlike the first, I completely sucked at. No hyper-focus or anything, I just sucked, did not have the mindset to learn, and would constantly get overwhelmed at work and my senior mentor would sometimes just complete the work for me. Working from home made it worst as I would not do a single thing. Whenever I tried to focus, it was in vain.

Now, fast-forward, I am 28 years old, I have never in my life worked a full-time job and have at this point only worked internship jobs. Fucking pathetic! I cannot apply to software engineering/ coding jobs because I am just not a good enough programmer and grinding leetcode is not what I am capable of doing in my current state. I tried self-learning this summer but I just can't sit still and focus. I looked into what's wrong with me and why am I such a lazy unmotivated failure and I found about ADHD. The more I looked into it, I realized that this is the reason why I have failed in life. Why I was a weird kid who stayed in class during recess writing a book, why I am so emotionally unbalanced, why I can't sit still and focus on a task, why I get so attached to a girl I'm speaking to and so focused on her. I literally wanted to cry. ADHD is the reason my life was hell all this time.

I am in a predicament as I have not been officially diagnosed (I am 99.99% sure I have ADHD). I have been visiting my doctor and constantly telling him I need a diagnosis ASAP as I am struggling in life. He referred me to several psychiatrists but here in Canada, the wait times are insane. It's been a month and no one has gotten back to him. I want to start getting treatment ASAP for this and want to get on ahead with my first real job. I might be waiting years before I get anything and it might be too late for me. My fucking career is in jeopardy and my life. No girl is interested in me when they find out I'm unemployed at my age. Literally, this job is holding me back from everything I want in life because of this fucked up mind I have. I want a stable job and want to find someone to get married to and have kids.

I cry every night what a useless man I came to be, close to my 30s with no job or future. My friends that I did school with are now senior engineers, software developers, and managers in training making a great income, and most of them are married and are having kids now and all I have to show for myself is a fucking internship and living in my parent's basement. I trained kids in my previous internship and they have full-time jobs and I'm here literally applying to maybe get another internship and hope they like me to give me a full-time job. Why the fuck am I born like this. I know I'm not dumb and I am such a hard worker but I just can't do it anymore. I just want a job man, I don't want to be a fucking failure. I feel like puking writing all this"

So I’ve been working at my job for about a month now and let’s just say it’s not the best. We’re severely understaffed, management is waiting to hire more ppl, etc. So here’s my problem: I’m a full time student and I decided to get a job to make extra money since I live on an on campus apartment. When orientation came, I filled out an availability sheet and said that I cannot work Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and nights before those days because I have 3 mornings/afternoon classes and then another class in the evenings. That alone is a lot of work to handle. My campus is also in the forest and filled with hills so every walk u make is like a hike but thankfully we have metro buses and loop buses to help take us around campus but they stop operating at 7pm and 9pm. Recently, my manager signed me up to work from 9:30pm-12:30am and I can’t do that. I’m not willing to make the scary 30min walk home,arrive at 1am and be in bed by 1:30 (cuz I gotta shower n stuff) and wake up at 7:30 for my morning class. I emailed the manager but she’s ignored it (I have actual proof of this) so my game plan is to call out 3hrs before the shift begins bc that’s protocol. We also have a point system where if u call out, u get points and eventually those points can lead to getting Zero Priority for school breaks or getting fired. So will I be fine or …? What should I do? 

I’ve heavily considered quitting and trying to get internships or remote jobs bc anything is better than the conditions they have us working at. 

Ps. This job is an on campus job. All the workers they’ve hired are students and they’re hiring more soon apparently. Management understands that we’re full time students."

I just finished my school, but I already have 2 years experience at the company.

So Team lead of the dev teams asked us to make an S2S VPN. Week later the guy from Canada responded with the question if I would do it or if he has to. I said that it's probably better if he do it because I have like no experience with VPN and just a little of Azure.

But it became urgent for the Team lead and he asked me if could try, because he thinks that it will take another week to it to happen.

He helped me a lot with my stuff so I thought I have to try. Quick Google search, first website - Microsoft Azure VPN documentation. I followed the tutorial and in like 2.5 hours we had a working S2S VPN.

Ive always been fascinated from reading people's stories and what drove them to this state, so fuck it I'll share mine. It's gonna be a long one so I apologize in advance...

I was a relatively happy and care free middle school kid who had a big friend circle. At the end of middle school though, my parents split up and moved into seperate homes. It was rough seeing my parents (especially my dad) being sad and upset, and so I put on a mask of being happy whenever around them to not make them feel worse. This resulted in me covering up my own sadness and I eventually stopped enjoying spending time with them because I didn't feel like myself. Highschool was pretty awkward but most kids at that age are awkward so I don't really care. I was some weird breed of confident in being awkward which is pretty cool thinking back on it. I focussed super hard on schoolwork and I got into a good university which I was half excited about. Deep down though, I was still sad and just generally nervous about life.

I moved out for university, and I made a bunch of friends in the first month. Most of the people were weird since it was engineering, but weird people are great friends. I was having a decent time, but one day I didn't have any classes and I just sad in my room and felt this hopelessness wash over me. I was terrified and I cried for hours. I thought it would go away, but I feared this feeling would come back. I completely lost my appetite and I became more nervous about literally everything. Like oh no I have nothing to do next Saturday, time to worry about this for the entire night. Over the next few years I learned how to push these feelings down but certain events would retrigger them. Meeting new people would bring up these scary feelings so I stopped making new friends and trying to date. Then this spread to talking with family members so stopper enjoying talking with them and saw it as a chore. I was in a negative spiral, and that brings me to my main life fuckup...

I wanted to fix my issues of being uncomfortable talking with new people (at this point, even talking to my friends was getting difficult). Some of my friends said that psychedelics can have immediate effects on these kind of things, so I ordered some and a few weeks later I had a bag. I did a few smallish doses and I liked the effects, so I ordered more and took a large dose. The fuck up though, is the site I ordered it sent me too much. The bag was labelled as 100mg (some synthetic shroom compound), but it was actually 500mg. So I took like half the bag thinking it would be 50mg, already a big dose. But it was 250mg. I knew something was off 5 minutes in since i was already feeling the effects which are supposed to happen after atleast 30. I knew I was going to die and it was the single scariest thing I've ever experienced. Of course I was alone too, and I had all these intense emotions of fear and guilt and embarrassment come over me. I was unconscious (ego death) for a few hours but when I came to I was like ""Phew that was dumb"" and thought nothing of it. Over the next few weeks, I started getting flashbacks to it. It started with listening to the music that was playing when it happened, but I could easily push that down by just changing the song. Around a month after it happened, I was hungover from a Christmas party and the negative emotions I felt washed over me. Ran over me would be more accurate. This was the first time there was no external trigger to cause it, and I struggled intensely with it that day. I went to sleep hoping that it would go away the next morning, but it only got worse. I remember looking in the mirror and just crying because I was so terrified that I broke myself irreparablily. I had to leave my internship early because I couldn't focus on anything, and when I got home for Christmas all hell broke loose. I couldn't eat without throwing up so I lost like 20 pounds, I slept maybe 30 minutes a night in between my cold sweats, and I became so hopeless of my condition. Thank god covid came around because it let me study from home, because no way I could have made it back to university in person. My doctor gave me antidepressants but they just made me feel unreal and confused. I was so terrified of the universe that I wanted to kill myself but I was even more afraid of death. I read atleast 10 self help books on anxiety/panic attack recovery, and none of them really made that big a difference.

After being tortured for the last year and a half from this incident, I've made a partial recovery. I don't feel terrified of the universe, but I have this underlying anxiety I can't seem to shake. It's manifested itself in all of my relationships as social anxiety, which makes sense since I don't enjoy socializing if I feel like poo. I've lost almost all my friends because I feel too nervous to message them, my new job is going poorly since it's hard to think straight when you're uncomfortable, and I just don't feel happy anymore. I haven't been happy for a single moment in the past year. Whenever I think of trying to better myself, like going out and meeting new people, the hopelessness comes back and I end up feeling terrible about myself. The only think that seems to work right now is staying in my room and not interacting with anyone, but this isnt any way to live life. I want to go out and live, but the feelings are too strong to ignore. I seriously don't see a way of getting through this. Ive tried therapy which worked temporarily but I always return to feeling terrible. Ive been thinking about killing myself since it is honestly the only way out I can see. 

If you reached this point, damn... Thanks for reading."
pzwgdf,134,2021-10-02,SETI success,Living-Complex-1368,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/pzwgdf/seti_success/,"""Dr Richardson! Dr Richardson!"" Sabrina was yelling at her from accross the room, which was unnecessary as the room only held 5 desks and only the two of them were here.

""Yes Sabrina?"" Marsha said as she took three steps to the other woman's desk.

""I think you should see this!""

The radio waves were near what Earth used for AM, but clearly not a distorted reflection.  The signals were regular, but not so regular as to be a natural phenomenon. Was it the holy grail?

""Send me what you have so far as an email, I need to go to the director!""

Marsha composed herself as she walked down the hallway.

""Director?""

""Ah, Marsha, come in, why so formal?""

""Sorry Morgan, but I think we may actually have something."" She tried to stay calm but was sure he could hear the excitement in her voice.  She explained what Sabrina had found, then heard a ping.  She pulled out her phone, checked that the email was from her assistant, and forwarded it to the director.  Then they looked at the signal together. 

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

""Today it gives me great pleasure to announce that we finally have an answer to a question we have asked since man first looked at the stars.  Are we alone?  Are there other beings like us on other planets?  Today we can definitively say we are not alone.  The investments by the United States, and the rest of the world, in the Search for Extraterrestrial Terrestrial Intelligence, have been successful!""  The president paused, but the reporters (no doubt already aware of what he would say because of leaks) launched into questions.

Questions that Martha's team were working on, even as they watched the President brag about their success.  

Data was pouring in.  Once they determined where the signal was coming from, radiotelescopes all over the world were re-tasked.  There were a few grumbles from physicists, but muted.  The discovery that we were not alone in the universe had captured the imagination of the world. 

New facilities were being proposed and funded at a breakneck pace, even satellites dedicated to the project.

But it was still ""garbage data.""  Regular, complex signals made by some sort of intelligent life (well they were 99% sure).  But without some sort of Rosetta stone they answered one question but created so many more.

Which was why Seti@home had been given a new task.  Thanks to the discovery approximately 31% of personal computers in the world were donating cycles to what was now the most powerful computer on Earth.  They also had computers like Watson processing particular signals, leads the general system had sorted.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

""Dr Richardson!""  Again, the junior researcher was shouting.  Granted, the room was larger, designed to hold 86, and currently almost full.  But Amir had run up to her before he started yelling.  ""We have sounds!""  With that her annoyance disappeared. 

After a brief fling with morse code, human radio was used to send sound waves.  But the sound waves had to be converted to signals to be sent over a radio, and then converted back.  Seventy nine scientists, researchers, and interns listened to the first intelligent alien sounds heard on Earth.  

And understood nothing.  But it was the first step.  Time passed.  Three dedicated satellites were launched, so that every scrap of radio waves from Tao Omicron 72 could be captured.

Someone had looked at the ""name a star"" services and found that someone had paid to name the star Jenny, which led to a lot of 867-5309 jokes.  There was some fear that the aliens would ""change their number,"" either stopping broadcasts for fear of discovery, or switching to a different form of communication. 

Time passed, and then another breakthrough. 

Sitting down at the conference room, the team went over the find.  ""They use a base 8, so they probably have a more intuitive understanding of computers than we do.  But their 'tens' numbers are weird.  They have a word for two eights and four eights, but for seven eights they basically say 'eights, two eights, and four eights.'  They have a word for 64 and use regular numbers for groups of 64, the way we would say three-hundred.  Same with 512.""

""There are at least 7 different ways they say numbers though, we think they are different languages. Fortunately the number sounds are mostly slightly similar.  Once we cracked them in one language, we quickly cracked the rest.  We now have broken the signals up by language and the AIs are working on each one.""

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  

""Um, Dr Richardson?"" Jamill was a quiet intern, but brilliant. Probably autistic too.  Marsha turned to him.  

""Yes Jamill?""

""You know those new signals we started getting?  With all the garbage?""

""Yeah?""

""What if it is TV?""

By the time we figured out the conversion from radio waves to picture, we mostly had three of the languages figured out.  The entire world, even the new outposts on Luna and Mars, watched the first translated 'TV' signal.  It was in black and white, which was good as we had no idea what frequencies their eyes used.

The creatures seemed to be hairless, with tall foreheads and large eyes, a short snout but strangely human teeth, the ears somewhat resembled the frills on some lizards.  Three fingers and a thumb on each hand.  Slightly scaly but wearing clothing, sort of a toga or gown.  What appeared to be street interviews showed more varied clothing, and that they were bipedal but had tails they could rest on the ground.

The text was less friendly. Discussions of the (undeciphered) alliance and how their political system was a threat to the (undeciphered) way of life.  A lot of the broadcast was spent discussing how following the dictates of the high leader and cleansing the population was needed to protect their economy and way of life.

Translating another broadcast included text about how the grand servant of the people would lead them to victory over the (scoffing sound?) High leader.  How everyone must make sacrifices and share resources as the 8 year plan commanded.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

The researchers, and humanity as a whole, gradually realized that at the time these broadcasts were made, the so called ""space lizards"" were at about the technology level of the Earth in 1940.  Their politics seemed similar, though apparently without Democracy.  The major states seemed to be either Communist or Fascist.  Still, we watched and learned.

Soon a war started, and every broadcast was about battlefields and trenches.  Video of primative aircraft dueling or dropping bombs.  Massive guns and light projection cannons-they seemed to have mastered some sort of laser weapon sooner than we did.  Rockets were used to launch bombs which fell on cities.

Then both sides began to brag about an ultimate weapon.  One that would end the enemy and the war for good.  Views of mushroom clouds from various cities became commonplace, even as the signals began to degrade.  We were not sure if the signals stopped because the atmosphere was so polluted by radiation that radio and TV signals couldn't get through, or if no one was around to send them.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

The first Alcubierre drive had been tested, and had made the great flight.  Sabrina and Ali sat together with Jamill, a picture of Dr Richardson at the table.  The ship should have traveled to the system where humanity's first contact had come from, and see what was there now.  

430 light years away, meaning that the events humanity had watched for twenty years, then thought about for forty more as we developed the means to visit them, had happened centuries before we watched.

Now it was time for it to return with news.  All three of the scientists, distinguished and respected in their fields now, cheered as the ship returned.  The camera came on, and everyone in the room, and nearly everyone on Earth, knew what the commander would say before he said it.

His face was drawn.  ""The planet Zchitnet"" (humanity had agreed to use a name the aliens had for their own planet), ""shows no signs of life.""

We had gotten the answer.  We had not been alone in the universe.  But now, once again, we were."

I’ve been increasingly worried about admission to such programs, as the way to get in is a lot less clear, in my experience. In high school, good grades, standardized test scores, diversity, and leadership could get you into most any undergraduate program; I am unsure of the graduate equivalent.

By the time I apply, I will have completed two summer internships at a major tech company, performed research (but maybe not published anything), and a ~3.7 from a highly prestigious college. My degree will be in statistics and data Science, but I’ll also have taken the entire CS core curriculum at my college. I’ve been told my current preparation looks “excellent,” but that’s hard to believe when everyone around me has done and is doing so much more. **What can be done to boost my chances and further stand out, and what are some facets of the most successful applications?** The tippy top programs at Stanford, CMU, and MIT don’t interest me, but I am still set on competitive programs at schools like Columbia, NYU, and Penn."

pzydi6,20,2021-10-02,I'm a third-year Mechanical Engineering undergrad at IIT Indore. I'm not sure about my career choices. After researching on the internet I narrowed them down to CAT/GATE CS. Which is a better option? Please give me some valuable suggestions.,The_Maverick_myth,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/pzydi6/im_a_thirdyear_mechanical_engineering_undergrad/,"**my\_qualifications**: BTech 3rd year, Mechanical Engineering, IIT Indore

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not interested in pursuing Masters in Mechanical engineering, so I've ruled it out. 

**Option1:**

I started studying Data Structures and algorithms, and I attempted some on-campus coding tests for an internship. I couldn't clear any of them mainly because I didn't practice enough. I'm not sure if I can master Data structures, algorithms, and other things required to clear an SDE interview in only a year for full-time roles next year. 

Then I thought about GATE CS, which gives me two years to pursue competitive programming after clearing GATE and getting into an old IIT for CS. I checked the syllabus for GATE CS, and I think I can clear it and get into a good IIT if I study dedicatedly. Through this route, I want to land in a Data Science or Machine Learning role.

**Option2:**

For a while, I was clear about pursuing option1, but then I talked to some of my peers and found that they are inclined towards MBA from IIMs. The job opportunities one gets after a PGP from an old IIM are excellent. I started having second thoughts. My CPI is just okay, and my 10th and 12th scores are really good. I also read that there are very few BTech IITians who opt for MTech at IITs. I can't afford Masters abroad. 

Should I aim for CAT or GATE CS? Which would be a better option considering my scenario and prospects? Would you please give me your valuable inputs?"

Luckily I managed to get a SWE job eventually at a F500 company, but I'm paid peanuts (sub 60k) so I'm preparing to job-hop soon. Because I have been told by recruiters that they refuse to hire me because of my major, I'm taking an online MSCS program in hopes of alleviating the DS stigma.

Soon I will hit the 2 YOE mark, so I believe that's when I should start applying. The best case scenario is I apply to a mid-level role and get an offer with that cushy 200k TC. But it's difficult to crack full-time interviews, so since I'm technically a college student I'm considering applying to internships which are usually easier to get into. For example, Amazon does 2 OAs + 1 45-min interview for internships whereas for industry hires need to do OAs + 4 interviews. The problem is I don't get to leverage my experience and will still be underpaid after full-time conversion compared to most SWEs with 2 YOE.

I believe most companies don't let you apply to both full-time and internship roles at the same time, so here's the problem: do you think I should apply to mid-level roles despite having to go through more difficult interview loops, or just apply to internships and convert full-time afterwards? Personally, I'm thinking about applying to mid-level roles for companies that have easier interviews and internships for companies that do 5 rounds of LC med/hards for industry hires. What do you think about this approach?"

q06hvu,0,2021-10-02,"Help. Living in downtown Toronto for 4 months. Budget/housing critique, help me see the reality.",Scared_Particular_87,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/q06hvu/help_living_in_downtown_toronto_for_4_months/,"Hi.

I have accepted an offer to move to Toronto next Summer 2022 for a 16 week internship (assuming all goes to plan and it doesn't change to remote/get cancelled due to COVID). I have never been to Toronto, yet alone lived there. So for that reason I am trying to get started on my housing/renting situation as I know it will be the hardest. I will be moving back home after this internship, so this poses a few challenges.

In my mind, there are a few viable option for short term month to month rent.

a) Rent an AirBnB for potentially the entire time. This could end up being very expensive (especially considering that AirBnB charges fees and whatnot). Another challenge is that I am pretty sure long-term AirBnB rentals are somewhat uncertain, considering that you are like a renter but without any renters protections it seems. The last thing I want would be for my host to sell the place I'm staying, me be out of a place to live on short-notice and having to move to a hotel while I find alternate accommodations. However, this type of housing is still attractive because it will be already furnished.

b) Find a room/apartment on Kijiji/Craigslist (potentially sublet). This seems like it could be cheaper (foregoing AirBnB cost), however it means that it could very likely come with no furnishings. Since I will live there short-term I do not want to have to buy a ton of stuff to live (I won't be able to take much/any back home). This will also be difficult because I will not be able to visit Toronto beforehand, and don't really know anyone who can look at apartments for me there. I am not sure, but it may be hard to find a month-to-month lease.

c) Extended stay hotel. This seems out of the question because it is far too expensive, might as well just do AirBnB at that point.

I have devised a preliminary budget for my time there (broken down per month).

I assume I will be paying about an 20% average tax rate for my time in Toronto, however I have not looked into this too much yet. I expect to gross 40k in Ontario, and 15-25k in Nova Scotia this year so putting me at about a 18% tax rate during my time in Ontario according to [this calculator](https://www.eytaxcalculators.com/en/2021-personal-tax-calculator.html) for 60k gross, but we'll round up to 20% to give some leeway for error.

|Salary|10,000|
|:-|:-|
|Type of expense|Cost (per month)|
|Taxes (20%)|2000|
|Housing (putting at high-end)|3000|
|Food|600|
|Eating out|400|
|Internet|100|
|Phone (public mobile plan hopefully will work)|40|
|Hygiene (haircut, soap, shampoo, etc...)|100|
|Clothes (not sure of work attire yet)|250|
|Entertainment (bar, weed, ...)|200|
|Transit|200|
|Total|6890|

Based off of this, I estimate that I can have 3000$ saved per month towards my future tuition. However, to me something seems off. Perhaps I am severely underestimating my housing cost. 3000$/month seems like it would be enough for me to get a nice place with kitchen/dryer close-ish to downtown core, but I have never lived in Toronto. Additionally, there are some one-time costs (luggage there and back, forgotten items, new laptop to game while away, ...) which I have not included. That is because I already have plenty of savings from my previous internship which I will use to cover these, and I expect they will be &lt;= 2000$. Also I don't expect to bring much there or back, and am already looking for a new laptop to replace my 4 year old one anyways, so that is a cost I was already looking to pay. Additionally, my flight there and back will be paid for by company so that is not a concern.

**My concerns**

Having never lived in a big city, I am not used to it. I know I will not have (and don't want a car) there. I do not want to commute a lot (eg preferrably less than 45min), because I think this will make my internship much more stressful. Additionally, doing well in my internship can perhaps get me a return offer, and for this reason I think living closer to downtown core (where I will work) is worth the extra cost.

I am concerned that I am forgetting some budget expenses (I have lived at home before this). I am also concerned that my Public Mobile plan will not work well downtown (perhaps I need to look into another carrier).

I am also concerned about location. I am pretty sure my office will be somewhere along King St W from David Pecaut Square to St. James Park. Ideally, I would like a &lt;= 30 minute commute and within walking distance would be a bonus (I think this is a stretch). I am unsure how good transit is in Toronto, and what locations I should be looking at to reach the downtown core fast."

Also I know this is the most over-asked question in the world but I figure I’ll add it on in case anyone cares to offer insight: If I’m aiming for top universities, what aspects of my application do I need to focus on the most, and how do I size up as a candidate?

• GPA: 3.88 (3.75 major)

• 1 year as a TA
• LOR: I could get one (or more) from a professor(s) I TA’d for, and one from my manager at work.

•haven’t taken the GRE, and I’m very curious what my score realistically needs to be at for me to be a competitive applicant at top universities, particularly my quant score.

I feel like I have made the biggest mistake of my life by saying yes to a few things during my internship.
I recently started an internship 2 month back and my boss used to talk with me very nicely and guide me which made me feel very nice. I though he looked at me like his daughter which is the reason he was being so nice to me.

After a couple of days he started video calling me on my number for small things. He started saying love you to me which I took very lightly in the start and didn’t really respond to it.

I’ve started feeling very uncomfortable around him as he now has started saying things ans doing things which clearly indicate that he doesn’t see me as a child but a woman.

I feel like I have made a huge mistake by saying in the start and taking everything so lightly. Now it’s just hard to say no to a lot of things.

Any advice? Need some serious help please"

I also would like to work outside academia since that is where I always worked and I'm looking for a change.

In particular, I enjoy nature and would like better access to a calmer way of life, feel safer and be able to easily go about camping, bicycle touring, trekking, etc. whenever I have time available. For similar reasons I prefer warmer weather. As I enjoy traveling and would like to have the freedom to resettle in a different EU country if I want, it would be great to have EU passport but I can't get it via descent. For this reason I'm also considering countries to acquire citizenship via residency.

Another point is that I'm worried about feeling very socially disconnected (something that can even be hard for me in normal circumstances here) so I'm thinking that a Spanish speaking country would be better. I speak english fluently aswell, but I've experienced the disconnection of not understanding what others around you are saying and not being able to read signs when I stayed in CZ before (several times in two-month periods, during research stays).

Note that I've stayed in Zaragoza for two months also doing a research internship and I liked the general feeling of understanding the language (although is not real my ideal city to live in). I stayed only briefly in Berlin (for a few days). I actually spoke german with my mother and even took clases when I was a kid but forgot all about it now. When in czech republic I caught a few words and I more or less understand how to pronounce a word by looking how it is written but I don't really understand anything at all.

So I'm trying to figure out if I should prioritize going into Spain (due to the two year residency requirement for citizenship) and then be able to resettle possibly in Czech Republic/Germany which I think are much more aligned with my quality-of-life expectations. Does that make sense? Or should I aim for CZ/Germany and simply confront the language/cultural barrier? (the 5 year residency in CZ for citizenship seems more daunting).

Final note: I don't have real work experience outside academia. I have a PhD though and a good academic resume. Would that make it hard to get a job in a software/hardware developing company?

The only problem is that I havent received a single interview out of the hundreds of applications I've sent. Yesterday, I woke up and checked my email to see if any recruiter emailed me back but no response, so I pretty much broke down and started crying which almost sent me into a panic attack because if I don't secure an internship it will decline my scholarship as it is a requirement for my program."

Greetings!

I posted this in r/AskElectronics before and got suggested to put it here.

I recently graduated and got my (what I think is equivalent, as there is not any solid response about how it is translated) Associate Degree/Higher National Diploma/High Level in Vocational Training in Electronics. Went through 3 month internship at a very small IoT company, helping design the PCBs for a gateway project, among some other stuff. Learned a lot about Eagle, Fusion 360, and making BOMs. They liked my designs and the way I did documentation and wanted to hire me too but the school set me up for another interview for a job with a freelance engineer that wanted to develop some CPU chips. The offer was good, and the interview went well even if there was a lot of new concepts and he asked me about programming which is a barrier I haven't been able to break yet. He seemed to understand learning this would take longer than normal for me and was willing to teach.

The initial job was developing a clone for a Toshiba CPU. Had to develop a code that could be checked using Verilog tools using C and scripts. The first few weeks I spent them reading a lot about C, about CPUs in general, about Assembly, taking looots of notes, trying to figure the documentation out with some help from the guy here and there when I had doubts, all this I was letting him know during our daily reviews. Developing the code was an uphill battle. I couldn't get anything done or functional except for some file reader. Couldn't keep the ""commit a bit of code each day even if its basic"" because I felt nothing was working and when he helped, he did 90% of the job so I felt pretty embarrassed about it but he agreed that there were a lot of concept to learn but that eventually I could learn it. After a month he said the project was no longer profitable at the current pace so he told me to stop working on it. He gave me a new project, which was reverse-engineering some old PCBs that needed to get new schematics in KiCad, using some scans of older PCBs as reference. The goal for it to be profitable was to do one or two a week but commented on how it being my first board would maybe take me a bit longer while getting used to it, but it certainly was a lot easier, just grabbing the multimeter, checking connections and making the schematic. I took day and a half to do the symbols for the custom components and the research. Then I started test the pins and following traces and vias,writing down the layout, what components I had already checked, starting from top to bottom. It was taking me a looong time. I don't know what it was but just flipping the board, checking connections, following 0.5mm traces that got under chips and went through vias to other 5 components made those 8 hours go fast but I was progressing very slowly. Eventually I was getting in a groove and found what I think was the right methodology for it, and as more components get in the schematic that share connections the faster you are already connecting the other ones too. Still, a week and a half had passed and we met to see how things went, I showed him my methodology, how I was doing it, how I was already going faster but that some things took me some more time. Then he asked me how much % I think I got done and I felt I had around 35-45% done, but that it would clear pretty fast. Then he decided to let me go on the spot, citing that I was too slow, that he expected minimum 85% of that board done, that it wasn't profitable either and that his expenses were too much for barely any results. He said that I took a day and half to do the symbols when he could do it in half a day, and that he had some other guy working for him that helps him on the side which did a more complex chip schematics with 15 pages in one night while saying that he didn't see me getting any better in 3 months or more so I was let go. I disagreed with him on that last part but you can't really argue with a guy comparing a fresh guy out of school to year-long professional and engineers. That was the end of that.

Now, currently jobless and looking for work, mid-september I got contacted by my former boss at the intership asking me if I wanted to help finish the PCB that I was working on all while working from home (he would bring the materials) as an aside thing no hiring, freelance job, only thing I had to do was name my price and how long would it take me. He explained me some of the stuff that he wanted to do and all the new changes. I said I could, and did some research on hourly prices for technicians and got set on a price similar to what I was getting paid previously and set a 60 hour timeframe. He agreed with the price I think? But said that he could do it in 20 hours. I said that it took me a month to do what was currently done by learning new things and also while handling other unrelated stuff so I thought 60 hours was fair. Anyway, he disagreed and said I know more now so I should be able to go faster so I agreed that it might be possible to do but that we would see how it went. Got the materials, and all the explanations of new things he wanted to be changed. Had to take measurements of the enclosure and components again, all the things that needed to be fixed were still there so I fixed them, had to be precise about those measurements, had to redesign a lot of things and so on, he kept asking me for other tasks that were not planned or changing things as I asked and confirmed design decisions. As I foretold, at the 20 hour mark, it wasn't done yet and I let him know if he wanted to continue and he said I needed to be faster and to keep going. This friday I managed to send him most of it done but because he wasn't available I had to wing some things that are still pending review, I did a lot of things on my own free time free too to accelerate the process. So here I am, hopeful that next week there won't be much left and that he will also pay all the hours of work done and not pull off some ""hey, you didn't deliver this in 20 hours like we said"".

So my questions are basically:

1. How are expectations handled with projects and jobs in this field of work? What's expected of you or your employees for this line of work?
2. How is speed and performance usually viewed in these jobs?
3. What are your personal opinions regarding this field of work and how to improve or find success in it? What are approaches you have taken or seen others take to get things done?

\---

The last job left me feeling very insecure about the way I do things, I tried to research a lot and tried to build things but it was a lot of concepts flying in my head with no clear connection, all while having the need to build those concepts in code, which by itself I still also needed to understand. Then got switched to an easier project and got canned because even though in both cases we were both clear it was gonna take more work while I learned the ropes, I wasn't profitable nor good enough in my first month, so bye. And now this guy that I worked with previsouly wants to finish a project I know how to handle, so I set a timeframe knowing how things went when I was back there, getting as a response that it can be done faster, and then as expected there was no way it was going to get done in 20 hours and I got told I needed to be faster because ""everything was already done you only had to put some things here and there"". I feel I don't know what some people expect anymore or if they even know how long some things take. Especially when learning things brand new.

I apologize, it ended up being a long rant, but I appreaciate anyone who reads it and replies."

I have been full time DevOps engineer in same company till date. 
   My working hours have been different in different times. In all this time, I have gained 2 AWS certifications(CCP and SAA-C02). I have experience with containerization using docker as a tool, kubernetes for orchestration. Experience with AWS as well. I am proficient in use of Terraform for IaC. I can write decent python scripts as well. I also have experience with CI/CD in AWS.

I know I am blaberring about tools, but these are what I worked with. 
Last but not the least, I know DevOps is not about tools, its about culture, and I get the big picture, design of resilient architectures, security, etc. And I am gaining experience with those as well.

The problem is here, I have a very small team where I work. So, in a way, I don't know if what I am learning is actually what is used in real world. Seems like I have way too less exposure. And all new job descriptions expect high level of experience in such roles. And I feel that maybe I haven't progressed at all, or maybe for my experience I should be doing something crazy.

q0ogss,472,2021-10-03,A year ago I ED'd to UPenn and luckily I didn't get in,HamachiObo,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/q0ogss/a_year_ago_i_edd_to_upenn_and_luckily_i_didnt_get/,"Hi everyone! I'm a first-year student at UMass Amherst and last year I was just like all of you. I applied to almost only top 20s, constantly checked A2C, and constantly spent all day stressing about my college application. Now if you guys are also like me, you probably spent the whole summer working on your common app and haven't even looked at the supplements and it's just hitting you that that's the bulk of the actual application. Well here are the things I wish I had been told by someone when I was in your shoes.  


**1) Apply to schools that you actually love.**   
I applied to like 10 schools which means I wrote so many essays. This killed me, it was so much of a force and also for schools that I claimed weren't as hard to get into, I put a lot less effort into my essays than I should have. I didn't really even care that much about some of the more prestigious schools I applied too, which made my entire application worse and interviews so awkward (I'm sorry my Cornell interviewer LOL). My friends who only applied to a couple of schools that they really loved and vibed with had a much better fall than me, and they are very happy with where they went. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Safety Schools!!!!!!!!**

So last year I kinda fucked up a bit. I applied to one safety school and it ended up being the only one I got into. You've definitely heard it like a million times that safety schools are important, but lowkey you don't even like your safety schools because you really have only put in effort into looking at reach schools because they are more fun to picture yourself at. Remember that **you're not guaranteed to get accepted anywhere**. I am so thankful to have been accepted to UMass because otherwise, I would literally just not be in college. And it also turns out UMass is such a good school to go to. Make sure you have safety schools that you would actually enjoy going to because statistically, those are the ones you are going to go to.  


**3) USNews does not mean the right fit**  
There's a really bad culture with college applications where the more difficult college that you get into is supposed to be the best fit for you. I applied to UPenn ED because it was an IVY league and had a good social scene. UPenn is also hard as fuck and attracts a bunch of Wharton kids who I don't think I would have vibed with. I ended up at UMass which turns out has everything I was looking for from UPenn, but isn't hard as fuck. There's still travel abroad, lots of good employers (one of my TAs works for Pepsi and gets 70K a year as an intern). I didn't really realize it until way too late, but when talking to my interviewer from UMichigan, he told me that all the research and community outreach stuff that the college is supposed to be really good for, isn't even unique to the school. The education is the same at most schools and as a student that's not even what really matters. **Find a school that's good for yourself, not your learning.** Find a school with amazing football games to watch, a really cool poetry troupe you want to join, a beautiful campus, an interesting extracurricular, a good esports team, a lot of gay people (this one is really fun). Literally, apply to Penn State just for the parties. You're not just going to a school, your choosing a new home.  


**4) You'll be alright sweetie &lt;3**  
It's really hard to work on your essays rn and it seems likes it's an impossible task. You might be stressed that you're doing everything wrong. I won't lie, this period of time is going to suck and all you can do is grind through it. But you will get through it and you'll be so glad to be done. Whatever happens, you'll find your people and you can always transfer if you don't like where you end up. Take it easy, you don't need to take on the whole world rn babe, just the next step :).  


That's just my 2 cents about college apps as someone who got rejected from every school but the one I said I would never go to and have loved it so much.  


Feel free to ask any questions and I will try my best to answer them! :)"

I'm an MIT junior studying math and computer science who is interested in doing quant trading (ideally in a role that would let me code and also do fun math things). My background is:

\-Did a full-stack software engineering internship this last summer at a not-well-known company

\-Have one math paper from an REU, not sure how much quant trading firms care about that but Five Rings did reach out because they saw it on my resume...?

\-Doing a master's in CS at MIT, so I have two summers left, not one. Am also willing to take a semester off to do an internship or co-op, I know some firms have those

Anyway, I'm also applying to more software engineering internships right now. I know it's pretty late in the summer 2022 recruiting process for quant and am pretty doubtful I'll land anywhere amazing. So my question is, given that my eventual goal is to be at a top quant firm, would it be better to try to snag a decent software engineering internship for next summer, do an REU, or intern at a quant firm that isn't so great? 

I'm wondering if, say, I intern at Akuna or Virtu or one of the other ""lower tier"" quant firms, it would ruin my chances at ever getting into somewhere better (I've heard that some companies don't like it if you've worked at another firm already?). But I'm also wondering if I do another SWE internship, it'll be too hard to transition into quant. An REU would be fun but I don't want to go to math grad school so it doesn't really align with my career interests.

1. Work at my internship part time until I graduate (25 hrs per week, $45/hr) and take 2 classes per semester - would take about 4-5 years to graduate 

2. Quit my internship and take 4 classes per semester, would take about 2.5-3 years to graduate 

3. Convert my internship into a full time position (unsure of what the pay would be, but my manager is willing to convert me if I want) but take 1 class per semester- would take way too long to graduate

4. Quit my internship and do school full time for a few semesters then get another internship before I graduate to “fill” the gap in my resume?

I’ve been considering quitting my internship altogether or dropping my hours to 10 hours per week so I could do 3 classes per semester while still having work experience.

q0thek,1,2021-10-03,Past internships during new grad SWE interviews,McDonald_DickMoanald,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q0thek/past_internships_during_new_grad_swe_interviews/,"So I think that most if not all of us here can agree that when applying for new grad/entry level SWE positions, having at least an internship on your resume can increase the number of callbacks/make it easier to land a job.

For the interviewers/recruiters, when you are interviewing a candidate with “software engineer intern” / “software development intern” or some variation of that on their resume, without knowing whether or not it was paid, what kinds of questions do you expect the candidate to be able to answer and what kinds of things do you expect them to be able talk through regarding that internship? Do you hold them to a different standard/look for different things than a candidate with no internships? What do you expect the candidate to have accomplished from the internship? Does their internship only help them get past the resume screen or does it help them pass your interview too? Do you approach the interview any differently than you would for a candidate with no internship? If so, how? Any specific or general things that needed to have happened during the internship for you to put this candidate ahead of one with no internships?"

Also didnt really realize all the stuff you need to do to get a SWE job until I started this year. So next year is my only time to really secure an internship or work experience or, from everything I've been told, I'm f\*cked when I graduate and try to find a job.

The big things that got me were the lack of projects (I have 3 now, 2 apps I made with my cs study group, and a website for searching student apartments I made myself), I had a poorly formatted resume that problably wasnt making it past screeners until I asked other people look at it, and the coding problems. I got a couple of OAs on HackerRant, CodeSignal, and CodeVue. Generally, I could solve the first problem pretty easily, but when it came to the others I could maybe get past some of the test cases for the others but never completely solving them. I only got to solving the second problem on code signal once after I comletely bombed the first test I took.

Still not done applying to places, but it's now the tail end of  intern hiring season in my state (can't afford to go outside it) and my chances are looking pretty slim rn.  But this was a good experience and I have a better idea of what I don't know.

The biggest thing I need to work on for next year are the coding assessments. Projects and my resume should be pretty solid by then. 

For the last month, I was banging my head against the wall on Leetcode trying to play catch up and be where I'm supposed to be but trying to cram learning data structures, algorithms, and Big O in a month while taking a full college schedule and a full time job wasn't really effective. I am trying to develop a study plan for next year and solving like 2 problems a day or study 1-2 concepts per day just so im not constantly cramming.

Ive seen things like ""the top 75 Leetdcode question that employeers ask"" or the HackerRant Prepare tracks. But i think that im only learning how to solve those problems but not how to apply problem solving skills and how to approach different problems. 

So I'm typing this while book out basically ask if any of you guys know any good resources to better prepare for coding assessments and better develop my problem solving skills or resources that help you learn how to better approach problems and identify what you should use given the type of problem?

Thanks for reading this if you made it this far and thanks for any help you give!"

The interview was split into a 25 min conceptual phase and a 30 minute coding activity. The conceptual phase was absolutely insane. It asked complex-ass concepts, everting from CPU/RAM utilization for processes to primitive synchronization techniques to designing RESTful APIs to ACID principles to low-coupling/high-cohesion, CPU-bottlenecks, processes for private IP communication, domain/IP interpretation, low-level data storage. Like bro I just turned 19 how I am I supposed to know all this. For the last like 5 questions or so it all had terms I’d never even seen before so I just had to say I had no idea what that was an move on. It got me super embarrassed and panicky and I hadn’t even started the coding assessment.

The coding activity was not too bad cuz I’ve been practicing handling JSON and similar questions and I was able to get through like 1.5 parts, but damn was that 1 hour interview insane, it has my stomach turning over rn. It felt like all the questions were meant for people with 5-10 years of experience, like I just want an internship pls now I’m so stressed, this is only my second interview ever idek what Karat is."

I am also finishing my last two classes and am going into tax; but curious if tax or audit makes more. I know audit has better exit opportunities when the time comes, but I'm not really sold on the pro's v. cons of tax and audit.

q102j5,25,2021-10-04,My Afterlife Has Been Rough,Jigen8206,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/q102j5/my_afterlife_has_been_rough/,"Hello there, dearest reader. Before we get started, allow me to introduce myself. My Earthly name was Marcus Wade. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of sharing my personal account with you is, but maybe I do it just because I can. You can make your own assumptions about me as you go. You can choose to believe what you want to. Still, I’d rather not go on a tangent for too long before the story. So, allow me to tell you about my experiences in the afterlife. I think they may interest you. Maybe things will change in the future, and if they do, I will continue to describe such experiences to you. For now, I present you with what I know and have seen.

I awoke, yet I did not remember falling asleep. Perhaps, that is death, if you can even call the process I experienced death. Can something which never was truly alive be deceased? I ask that as a man without a family or a legacy to call my own. There exists no language within the mortal world to describe where I found myself. It was in that instant, that I realized a piece of crucial information.

I realized that I only ever amounted to all that I had said, thought, and done. Furthermore, I understood that all I had said, thought, and done, revolved around my everlasting quest for knowledge. Yes, knowledge... it was knowledge that I wanted most of all. It was an object of desire people such as I would chase, so that we could achieve self-proclaimed superiority rather than become progressive members of society. Sound pretentious? That’s because that was who I was as a man. A pretentious fool. So there I sat, unmissed by anyone, and totally unfazed by the fact that I was in the afterlife.

Evidently, a state of clarity had washed over me once I found myself in this strange place. It was as if all my foolishness was exposed to me, and I was enlightened about the truth. Throughout my life, I was completely obsessed with learning as much as I could, so I could prove to those who doubted me that I was better than they had assumed I was.

Now that I was dead, I could only be surrounded by thoughts and memories. As my awareness expanded, I came to understand what I hadn't before. Fitting, wasn’t it? As a man whose sole purpose was discovery and intelligence, this newfound knowledge could only be described as a euphoric feeling to me. Heavenly, if you will. Yes, this was Heaven. It had to be, for what else could possibly be concluded based on the information at hand?

I found myself uncomfortable with the state of my being at first. The sensation of being sentient, yet disembodied was strange due to the amount of time I had previously spent as a living, breathing person, but I soon got used to my situation. I had all the time in the world to think, and so that is exactly what I did. I sat there for as long as I can remember, pondering over past events and actions. Some of them I took great pride in, whilst I kicked myself over my own stupidity when recalling others.

It felt like an eternity before I saw it. Some sort of bright light penetrated my vision, and I was finally able to see the world around me. A perfectly rectangular room, devoid of any furniture, was what I observed. I looked down and saw a hand. It was my own... I had seemingly regained my mortal body once more. The walls and floor of the room were in pristine condition, and everything appeared in a white coating of paint. In the center of the room sat a single white desk, where a large desktop computer sat mounted on top of it.

I slowly made my way over to the old-fashioned equipment and sat in the chair, pushing the power button. I heard the soft humming of the machinery as the screen faintly lit up, revealing a blue background screen and a single application in the center. I moved the mouse until the pointer hovered over the app, my curiosity at its peak. Then, I clicked twice and watched as a brand new page popped up in front of me, filling the screen entirely.

I watched as a plethora of dates and times appeared before my eyes, each accompanied by a video file. Unsure of what any of this meant, I clicked on the very first link. Upon doing so, a downloadable file appeared, which I opened. The file automatically started playing the video within it. I saw a woman in a hospital bed. The expression on her face was that of pain, and I heard her crying in agony as various doctors and nurses did their best to comfort her.

The woman was someone who I had recognized. She was... she was my own mother. After several minutes of her exasperated wailing, one of the doctors lifted up a small child, showing my mother as pride and joy filled her eyes. As soon as the video ended, the download file closed out and I was returned back to the original page. For a minute, I was left speechless. Upon looking at the file more closely, I recognized the date on it as my birthday. I glanced over the entire screen, my eyes scanning the various files it contained. Before me was every single important event in my life.

I took the time to watch a few of those videos, of course. Several birthdays of mine, my first girlfriend, my first few cars and homes. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of videos detailing some of the best times of my life. I sat in awe as I watched the early days of my childhood replaying right in front of me. It was truly one of the most fascinating moments I had ever experienced. This fascination, however, was short-lived. Soon, I felt a new, much less pleasant feeling. One of disappointment and regret. I am referring to the events which took place in my life after my childhood.

Now, I had been aware of the poor decisions I had made in life before I found the mysterious computer room. However, there is a large difference between recalling something and actually witnessing it again with your own eyes. For instance, when I had remembered my various arguments with my parents, as well the kids and teachers at school mocking me for my low intelligence and work ethic, the feelings associated with such events didn't shake me to my core as much as viewing my bullies and relatives berate me with insults, believing I would end up as a nobody.

Even more disheartening was that there were more download links involving the negative aspects of my life than there were positive ones. It is a sad fact of life that adulthood lasts far longer than childhood, and my adult years grew even more depressing as the slow, definite march of time continued. Still, there was nothing I could do within my afterlife except watch as my pathetic life devolved from the innocence of a child to the contempt of a grumpy man, so I continued.

When those closest to me had doubted my ability to progress at the rate of the other children, I personally took it upon myself to prove them wrong. As a young boy with very few friends or hobbies, such a task became my passion, and I spent nearly all my time with my nose stuck in any book I could get my hands on.

I completely ignored any other entertaining activity a boy my age would gladly partake in, even opting to study on my birthday. Thus, as my high school years started, I isolated myself from all distractions in order to prove myself capable of outsmarting anyone who dared doubt me. As you can imagine of someone like me, I considered people distractions as well, causing relationships with the few friends and family I had to shatter completely. These were the years that marked the beginning of my downfall.

After reviewing my teenage years, I decided to move on. I clicked on the scrollbar and dragged it downwards, waiting a bit before stopping once more and selecting a new date. I was an adult at that point in time, and my studying and hard work had paid off. Well, paid off as far as financial security was involved. Despite being socially inept and losing most of those I cared for, I carried on with my anti-social tendencies until I found myself in a good college and got into a well-paying job. I had moved up the ranks rather quickly in the workplace, soon becoming a top-ranking supervisor who enjoyed commanding my orderlies around like they were dogs.

I sat in my chair in disbelief as I watched the smug grin on my face while I barked out instructions to colleagues and interns alike. The nerve I had to treat others in such a way. Perhaps, it was the afterlife and the newfound clarity and sensibility I discovered upon entering it that allowed me to see the problems with my behavior. It also allowed me to see the scowls and rude remarks muttered under the breath of various employees who looked upon me in disgust. I had been blind to such things in my human state, but apparently, I wasn't anymore.

This behavior wasn't just common in the workplace, but outside of it as well. It wasn't long before the neighborhood came to realize my rather distasteful tendencies and steered clear of me altogether, to which I paid them no mind. It was my choice and mine alone to live a life of solitude, and for the longest time, I was known as the mean old man who lived at the end of the block.

I never smiled, nor did I ever laugh. The very few people who saw me outside of my house or outside of work only ever saw me with a scowl permanently sewn to my face. I didn't decorate for Christmas or Halloween. I didn't send or receive gifts or partake in the many activities within the community. If there was precious work to be done or information to be learned, I focused all of my attention on it.

Speaking of Halloween, I found a few video files around that holiday. I decided to watch some of them and found that even though I never had a single frightening prop out on my porch or yard, not one kid within the area would come near my residence. I actually found myself chuckling at this fact, figuring their parents must have warned them about the scary old fart who would surely throw a fit should he be disturbed, regardless of the circumstances.

My curiosity started withering away as I clicked on the scroll bar and continued downwards. It was at that moment that I realized I had almost reached the bottom of the page, and only a few downloads remained.

They were nothing special really. Just a few videos of me lashing out at some more people who dared commit the heinous crime of trying to socially interact with me. Yeah, I'm surprised I made it into Heaven again in the first place. Then again, it was never made apparent where I was. As far as I knew, it wasn't heaven, but some random phase of the afterlife I found myself in. Regardless, I don't make the rules, nor will I attempt to understand them in a vain attempt to know everything. After all, why make the same mistakes in the afterlife as I did in the mortal world? What do I have to prove anymore?

My fingers began to tremble as I neared the bottom of the page I swiftly wiped my forehead using the palm of my hand; Sweat coated my fingers. As you may have guessed, the final date was the date of my death. I didn't have a normal life, nor did I have a normal death. I have to share what happened to me with you all simply because I feel obligated to do so. Maybe it can serve as a warning, or perhaps I feel the need to share because some things are simply too insane not to spread. Regardless, I'm already this far, so I might as well continue.

It took me quite some time to muster up the courage to download the final video. Despite mentally preparing myself for what was to come numerous times, I was still hesitant. I found myself out of the chair and pacing the room at one point, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. It seemed like hours before I was ready to witness the most important, and most upsetting, day of my life. The day which transferred me from the land of the living to that of the dead.

Summoning each ounce of bravery within me, I clicked the link and watched as the download opened and the video automatically played. I frantically chewed at my fingernails as I watched myself in my living room, sitting comfortably in my recliner chair. I saw the coffee mug in one hand and newspaper in the other as I did what I had always done best, absorbing all the information I could. The night was black as tar and the wind sung its soft tune. I could notice all these details and more as my eyes closely watched, and my ears closely listened.

It felt as if I were experiencing the event in real-time, except this time, unlike my human counterpart, I knew what the outcome would be. I knew that living, breathing person who had been me would live their last day. My life would abruptly end and I would bear witness to my own demise. I could feel my skin crawl whilst my entire body trembled. This video was longer than the previous ones. While the others had been just thirty seconds to a minute or two at most, this one was several minutes longer in comparison. I watched myself take a quick swig of my coffee and stand up, making my way to the kitchen.

I... I knew the noise was coming, but I didn't realize it would come so soon in the video. The sound of glass shattering filled the house as the ""alive version of me"" turned quickly and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, slowly making his way back into the living room. I practically screamed at the monitor in front of me, begging myself not to do what I was about to. These efforts were fruitless, of course. If I could change the past I wouldn't be in my current predicament, now would I?

I saw myself flick on the light and stare at the broken glass window in confusion. There was nobody in sight. My mortal counterpart inhaled deeply, turning his head as the sound of footsteps rushed towards him. A large man in a mask pounced from behind the wall, tackling me to the floor.

I covered my eyes, not wanting to see the massacre that was destined to unfold, but morbid curiosity forced tiny creases in-between my fingers. I had to see... I just had to. This computer allowed me a new perspective on what had happened in my life, and I just couldn't help but watch as the man wrapped his arms around my throat, seemingly unbothered by my futile attempts to defend myself.

I leaned back in my chair and felt my body tense up as the man forced his knee into my ribs, trying to cease my efforts at escaping, his grip around my throat tight as ever. Finally, after an uncomfortable amount of silence, the man released his hold on me and got up, watching over my limp body. My face was pale and my eyes were bloodshot, an expression of surprise on my face. It was the first time I had seen any emotion besides contempt within me.

I let out a long sigh of relief as the video finally came to an end and the download closed out. I placed my hand on my throat and rubbed gently. It was almost as if I felt choked just by vicariously reliving my final moments on Earth. I got up once more, pacing the perimeter of the white room. I felt sick to my stomach at the prospect of the viewing the contents of computer. I had access to any moment in my life at the click of a button, including my own murder. I took a seat in a criss-cross position at one of the four corners of the room.

It could have been anyone who killed me in all honesty. I had lots of enemies. People who I showed disdain for, and would happily return such feelings. People in the workplace, people in the neighborhood. Hell, even what was left of my family at the time had felt deep resentment towards me. Funny enough, despite the heavy torment I faced at their hands in childhood, even when I did all that I could to prove them wrong, they didn't seem satisfied.

When I went back to the computer and turned the monitor on, I was immediately met by something curious. There, right next to the first app, stood another. It was a notepad with a title named after me. I spun my head around in a swivel-like motion, looking for any other entities within the room. There was nobody there except me. Not only that, but there were no entry points into the room either. No doors, no windows, and upon further inspection I found no sign of hidden hatches either. There was absolutely no way another person could have gotten in, leading me to believe that the app had appeared all by itself.

Realizing once more that I truly had nothing better to do, I clicked on the notepad and watched as the document opened. Several paragraphs of text sat before me. After reading the document, I realized that unlike the video files, it didn't detail the events which took place while I was alive. Rather, it was an article describing what happened after I died. I felt my eyebrows rise while my eyes scanned the screen, taking in the information presented to me. While I can't remember the exact words I read, I can paraphrase what they said.

In summary, after I died there were several suspects the police rounded up and interrogated. I recognized each of the names listed by the article as people I had come into contact with in life. My experiences with all of them were, needless to say, negative. In all fairness, there were plenty of people who would have the motive to murder me, but not a single one was found guilty. According to the article, all who were questioned were eventually released due to ""insufficient evidence"", although I found that rather hard to believe. Despite not wanting to believe it, a part of me felt as if the case wasn't taken as seriously due to my reputation around the community. Still, none of it mattered now. Not anymore.

When I moved past that part of the article, I found that the topic had shifted from the strange circumstances surrounding my death to the impact on my community. My house had been put on the market, but nobody would buy it. Big shock that nobody would buy a house where someone had been murdered. What had once been a dead zone during the holidays became a neighborhood attraction for some of the younger kids, especially during Halloween. It was at that moment during the reading that I froze, my face completely blank. My house had been an annual attraction for pesky teenagers, meaning...it had been years since I died. I placed my head in my hands and took several deep breaths.

I continued reading the article after calming down; I saw it expanding upon the previous point in the writing. Many teenagers would dare each other on the scariest day of the year, October 31st, to spend the night near my house or, in some cases, sneak in. Apparently, tales of my harsh attitude as well as my murder spread like wildfire upon my death, causing tons of ghost stories and rumors to be spread.

I found several more video files within the notepad, which I didn't even realize could be stored there, but then again, I had learned that I couldn't expect anything ordinary now. I downloaded the links and watched several videos of teens sneaking in and out of the house at Halloween. Some spent the night, while others got too scared to stay and ran home crying. I must admit, the house did look pretty creepy. It was unkempt and probably unsafe to stay in, with cobwebs covering the porch and the paint on the outside appearing to be peeled and chipped.

The inside of the house, from what I could tell, wasn't in much better condition. It was completely barren of furniture and the floor was coated in a thin layer of dust. There were very few places in the home where light could be found, mostly due to the windows being boarded up. I watched a video of a rather timid-looking kid make his way up the steps to the second story, the stairs creaking every couple of seconds.

He looked all around, taking in his surroundings. He allowed the flashlight in his right hand to illuminate the room. With that, he laid out a sleeping bag on the cold, hard floor. There were dozens of kids who had done the same. Eventually, the local authorities took notice and would often have a patrol car near my house during Halloween in order to make sure no kids were trespassing. Once again, I was taken back by the amount of time that had passed since my death. Perhaps, it had been longer than I thought.

Finally, the kids stopped showing up, and so did the police. I could feel my heart sink a little at that. Something about the fun the kids had, while juvenile, reminded me of the some of the fun I missed out on as a boy. I looked at the article and saw it come to an abrupt end, so I closed the notepad and returned my gaze to the monitor home screen. Rubbing my eyes in fatigue, I felt the incoming sensation of sleep. I found it odd how I could feel sleepy in the afterlife, but I suppose it's pretty tiring to see what I had. I felt myself drifting off, and without much thought, I allowed sleep to embrace me.

I woke up the day after... I think?. I had no concept of time within that white room, and I was disappointed upon waking up to find that nothing had changed. I was afraid that all the afterlife would provide me was contemplation in the form of this computer in front of me. Stretching my hand forward and gripping the mouse, I shook it a little to wake the monitor up. The background had changed from a purely blue screen to a black and white checkerboard style image.

Once again, I looked around the room for any place someone could enter and alter the computer, only to find nothing again.

Shifting my attention back to the screen, I noticed one more item that hadn't been there the previous day. It was a folder, and upon opening it I found a page titled ""Instructions"". It was in an application which I was unfamiliar with, but I proceeded in opening it anyways.

Inside was a single link. Figuring there was no harm in clicking one more, I hovered my mouse above it. However, I hesitated. Something about this link seemed odd to me. This wasn't like the others and I knew it, but I had no idea how. Still... there was only one way to find out where it led. Sighing, I tapped the mouse and opened the link. And once I did so, my vision went black.

For a single moment in time, I thought I had gone blind, and it terrified me. The white room surrounding me was gone and replaced with darkness, and for that split second I wanted to scream, yet couldn't. I would say my heart was pounding against my chest but I couldn't feel my heartbeat, nor was I sure if I had a chest or body at all for that matter.

I couldn't feel my own existence. It was like for a moment I stopped existing within reality, becoming an abstract being. I didn't exist, yet I did. That's as best as I could describe that odd, terrifying sensation. As soon as it started it stopped, and I was snapped back into reality. I stumbled a bit and fell to my knees, gasping for air as I felt beads of sweat running down my face. It was amazing how alive and human I felt even as a spirit. My blurred vision finally came into focus and fixated on the floor beneath me.

The first thing that I noticed was that the floor wasn't white, meaning I wasn't inside the room I had become so familiar with. Instead, the floor was wooden and cold, coated in a thin layer of dust. I stood to my knees and looked around, taking in various features around me. Recognizable features which allowed me to easily identify the place I was in. It was my home.

It looked the same as it had throughout the videos I saw while kids searched through it. I saw the same boarded windows, heard the same creaking floorboards... yes, it was mine alright. I was confused as to why I was there, and I felt my heart speed up as I noticed where I was standing. It was the exact same spot as where my murder had taken place.

Feeling uncomfortable with where I was, I moved to the front door and placed my hand on the cold doorknob. I tried turning it, but door wouldn't open. I looked down and saw that the door wasn't locked. I grasped the doorknob and frantically began turning, unable to exit the house. I rushed to the back door and tried to open it, but was met with the same result.

I attempted push open all the windows that weren't boarded up, but found that no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge. I was trapped inside my own house, with no way to escape. I pounded my fists on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs, despite knowing damn well that not a soul in the world could hear me.

My body found itself slumped over in front of the back door. I was twiddling my thumbs and tapping my foot lightly. I took several deep breaths in an attempt to distract myself from my situation and tried thinking of some sort of solution. Why had what happened, happened? Why view my entire life in rewind and study my legacy after death just to be trapped in the very house I was killed in?

It was madness.

I slammed my fist against the floor in a fit of rage and got up once more, clutching my head and violently pulling at strands of my hair. After several minutes spent in frustration, I allowed myself to settle down and explore my now abandoned home. I figured that there was no point in getting too worked up over that which i had no control over.

I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway. Despite the second story being completely enveloped in darkness, I found it quite easy to see and navigate, as if I had my own set of built-in night vision. At the end of the corridor was a door to my room. There was something odd about it.. A fluorescent glow emitted from within the room, shining brightly through the cracks. I made my way towards this glow and, much to my approval, I found I was able to open the door.

Upon entering, I realized that the glow was coming from a computer screen within the room. It was my computer, inexplicably clean and in the same spot it had always been, despite the rest of the house being disorganized. I lifted the computer and realized that a fine layer of dust sat underneath where the computer was, which should have been impossible had a solid object truly been on top of it. I had realized that this wasn't my computer, but something provided to me as a familiar  tool. It was my very own resource and I found that it came equipped with apps and an internet connection.

I couldn't explain this at all... but something was allowing me to communicate to the outside world. What seemed like a blessing in disguise, however, would turn out to be my only way to share to this story and with you. It wouldn't turn out to be a convenient device as a gift, but a way to retell the painful experience that is to follow.

The other thing I noticed about the computer was the date and time.

It was October 31st.

It was the morning of Halloween, and it was then that I realized my presence within my house was no coincidence. I was meant to be here, on this very night. I remembered my thoughts in the past. If you recall, the kids within the neighborhood would gather around my house at Halloween, each daring each other to enter the old abandoned house where a murder took place years ago. I wondered, however, about the police, until I then recalled their absence recently as the trespassing teenagers died down. I then realized that because of the lack of law enforcement specifically in front of my house, there was a possibility that they would be back and enter once more.

My face was plastered with a widened grin as the prospect of messing with any teens foolish enough to step foot into my home. The idea of such an entertaining experience excited, especially since I was too full of myself as a young lad to every truly have fun. I understood my purpose at that moment. I was to haunt the very house I was killed in. It was truly sick, but perhaps it could be considered poetic justice? Whatever the case may have been, I wanted to be prepared for the night that was to come.

I peered out into the brightly lit road and observed the houses in the distance. Many cheap Halloween decorations adorned the neighborhood houses, and I saw a few young kids board a bright yellow school bus.. I chuckled to myself. They had no idea what they were in for.

As the sun withdrew from the sky and fell below the horizon, I saw dozens of kids running out of their homes, candy bags gripped tightly within their hands. They skipped and galloped down the road with plastic masks portraying witches and ghouls and all sorts of creatures of darkness. To each house in view  they approached with glee, knocking on the doors. They laughed joyously as candy was emptied into their bags and they moved onto the next house. None of them stopped at mine, though.

The evening progressed, and the night grew darker. The moon stood high in the night sky and provided a comforting light in every direction. Many of the younger kids had gone home by that point, and only a few teenagers remained. My heart fell as a thought formed in the back of my mind. What if nobody tried staying the night? What if they were too afraid of police confrontation to take the risk?

I didn't want to believe it. This was my chance to make up for my failure in life and help those currently living. Yet, I wouldn't get that chance, would I? Figuring the night was a failure, I laid down on the floor and placed my arms under my head, resting my eyes. I allowed my body to relax and breathed out deeply.

Did you know spirits can dream? I didn't, but I know now. I found myself dreaming that night. Someone sat in my old recliner chair. I couldn't quite see who the person was because their face was hidden behind the newspaper they held. I approached them slowly, clearing my throat and tightening my fist. I placed my hand on the top of the paper and pulled it down, attempting to find out who the man was. Then, I jumped back, having been startled.

There, sitting in the recliner chair, sat a large man in a mask. He threw down the paper and leaped to his feet, approaching me with surprising speed. I fell backward and hit my head on the wall, and I watched in terror as his hand opened and wrapped around my throat, choking me.

I struggled for air as my face turned blue. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and I scraped and clawed at the man's arms and face, attempting to sink my nails into his skin and draw blood. I was desperately trying to do anything I could to free myself of his grip.

Despite my efforts, I failed. I was too weak to stop my assailant, and I sensed myself slipping away. I felt the veins bulging from underneath my skin as my eyes became bloodshot. It felt as if they would pop out from the sockets. It felt so real... as if I would die once more. I was reliving my worst moment. Every second of it, I experienced as if it were real. It was all so familiar to me. The furniture around the room within my dream had been knocked over in the struggle, and here I was, death slowly approaching me.

Of that entire ordeal, the most horrifying moment to me was when my entire body went limp, yet...I could still see, breathe, and feel everything around me. I was conscious and aware, trapped inside of a dead body. I was completely and utterly out of control, as if I were experiencing a session of sleep paralysis. I watched as the man released me from his grip and stood over me, admiring his work. I witnessed him slip his fingers underneath his mask, pulling upwards. What I saw underneath that black, foreboding mask will forever be ingrained into my mind for eternity.

It was me... it was my face. I saw it clear as day. My skin was pale and slightly blue. My eyes were as bloodshot as they had been upon my death, and worms wriggled around through open holes and wounds caused by the process of decay. A mixture of mud and grass filled the thing's mouth, leaving little to no room for the being to speak. I struggled to comprehend what was happening as the figure grabbed a black shovel, seemingly out of nowhere.

The monstrosity moved out of sight and I heard the sounds of wooden floorboards being removed. As soon as the thing was done with that task, I heard the sound of dirt being dug up from the ground. Within minutes the creature was done with its job and lifted me with superhuman strength, tossing me into the hole it had just made.

My screams were muffled by my inability to open my mouth as the thing shoveled dirt on top of me. As the earth filled my makeshift tomb, my sight was lost. The last thing I heard was the faint laughter coming from the creature that had reenacted my murder. A creature that appeared to be me, but wasn't... It was jeering me. Deep down, I knew what this all meant. Although I could not be certain who had killed me, I knew that I had been the root cause of my death. That somewhere along the line, I had crossed the wrong person, and I endured the repercussions of that that action. As I felt the soil flood my nose, and as the wretched stench of my own perspiration filled my lungs, I knew that I had truly buried myself alive as a result of my wrongdoings in life.

I sat up abruptly, drenched in my own sweat and tears. I shifted into a fetal position, rocking back and forth while a million thoughts rushed through my mind. What the hell just happened? Did I really see what I thought I had? There was no way in hell it was real... any of it! I shivered and shook and I just couldn't sit still. Nothing made sense. That nightmare had shaken me to my core. I hadn't felt that type of fear since that fateful day. I thought there would be nothing to fear after death, but I was wrong. Maybe nothing can hurt or kill me anymore, but the memories and nightmares which plague me will remain forever.

Not only would my murder dominate my dreams completely, but I wondered, and feared, whether my regrets in life would as well. I wondered if the loneliness I experienced at my own hand would eventually get to me. I felt tears well up within my eyes as I struggled to find a reason behind any of this. I hadn't a clue why and I may never have a clue. The afterlife is supposed to be eternal bliss. The sweet release of death was supposed to help liberate us from the problems of life, but such problems seem to follow us into death.

Perhaps, it is a blessing, or perhaps it is a curse. If feelings of regret and dismay had not followed me into the afterlife, would feelings of joy and satisfaction not follow either? This truth will likely elude me forever, but it is something I feel the need to ponder.

The computer provided me the means to write down notes such as these for further contemplation in the future, as well as reflect on ideas in the past. The Halloween night I described earlier happened about two years ago. After that night, I found myself trapped within my own house until the following Halloween. Luckily enough for me, time seemed to progress faster than it normally would ,until that Halloween. The house seemed to be pretty devoid of activity until that day though, so I had to find entertainment in other activities such as, well, writing.

I wrote about my experiences within the computer, this being one such story, and it keeps me sane. I suppose that's another reason why I was presented this hunk of junk replica of my past life laptop. It's a good way to be active and stay kept up-to-date while in the very confined world I live in.

I regret to inform you all that I am approaching the character limit for this forum post. I will conclude my story tomorrow, and as always, thank you for reading."

I am working in my current company, from January. Joined as an intern, converted to full-time in July.

During my internship, I was doing some webdev in the beginning and then started working on a niche project, in the middle of the internship. I got the same project with new objectives added, for my first major quarter (Aug-Oct).

Now, the thing is, the stack is really niche, my seniors only know it's basic concepts, and there are close to no implementations doing what we are trying to do. I didn't know much about the stack, nor is their a lot of documentation. So, it hasn't been easy. I've not seen newgrads working on something like this, it's usually experienced devs.

My manager set the objectives for the quarter in August. Three main objectives (O1, O2, O3), and their sub-objectives. He kept adding a lot of stuff to the objectives and had multiple stretch goals. I wasn't sure if all of these would be completed by the quarter. Also since, the downstream objectives depended on the first objective, which is huge. I also had a project partner in the beginning, who was going to contribute to a smaller degree, but he got busy in another project.

Throughout the last two months I've been trying to figure things on my own, I don't get much internal help as well (nobody knows the stack), and little guidance.

Now, coming to the quarterly goals, after evaluating the potential time the objectives will take, I let my manager know what I wasn't sure if all of these objectives would be completed by this quarter. (In August end, first month end of the quarter). He basically said no need to be concerned, these objectives are a way for us to work in the same direction, and it would be on the project manager, to scope these out well. (So not on me, is what he seemed to imply).

I was a little relieved after this.

Come October, I kept making more progress in September (for O1 and O2 objectives, with some hurdles). Not much in O3. So my manager asked, if we should mark O3 as  at risk, and basically pushing it to the next quarter.

Now, I'm starting to feel more pressured every week. I don't want to get termed as ""under-performing"",""not delivering"". I did try my best. It was not my fault that the project is hard. I didn't receive much guidance. I also let my manager know of the risks in the first month itself.

My manager did vaguely say that he went too ambitious and the team is still relatively new ish. I also asked my manager for any negative feedback throughout the quarter. I got positive feedback. The manager also said you've been doing tasks as you're supposed to etc, so you're doing good. BUT, the PM on this project, said that you've been making really great progress, and we value the process a lot but you need start thinking in terms of the impact, so start focusing more on the O2 so skip-level bosses see the value in the project.

After all of this, I'm starting to feel sad and like an idiot. I've been doing good work at school, uni, past internships etc. always doing more than expected and finishing on time, but in my first major quarter as an FTE, this :(, while my project partner easily finished his objectives of a different and nicer project.

I'm thinking of saying yes to marking O3 as at risk, since I'll have to focus more O1 and O2. But, I'm fearing if I'll get negative inputs/reviews etc. and be termed as a non-performer or something or fired in the worst case scenario?

It'll be great, if you guys could give any suggestions/advice on handling this."

q15ts6,1,2021-10-04,General help needed for career advice [Long Post],EtheroverEuros,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/q15ts6/general_help_needed_for_career_advice_long_post/,"Hello,

Currently there is a lot on my plate and a lot of open doors, however to maximize my later career progression I am in need of some advice. Let me tell you my story.

As of now, I am studying for a MSc. in mathematical finance from a reputable university in North-Western Europe; I have finished a BSc. in Econometrics with just above minimum requirement grades. Furthermore, this summer I have passed CFA lvl 1. Last year I have joined a startup within automated trading as a junior analyst, but the investors eventually shut the company down after 6 months. However, due to this position I got to know the directors.

Director 1 has roots in the automated trading world and talked me in the door in some renowned european market makers. However, I have had some experience with their interview processes and I detest the way they conduct interviews. I do pass for the math tests, but I do not like the fact that they want extreme whizzkids and push hard for this. Anyhow, I also feel like I'll be pigeon-holing myself if I'm going this way (especially the trader positions). According to my director, the job is holding a few parameters within bounds and it does not sound sexy at all. The career progression most likely would be Trader -&gt; MBA -&gt; Consultancy if you don't reach retirement by 32. Quant would be the most likely option, but I'm afraid that quant positions often require PhD, but if this is not the case; please let me know.

**Energy**

With the other director and another employee I've restarted the previous company (33% equity), mostly because I felt it would be a shame of all the work already put in. This company is focussed on trading energy, developing these platforms and the analysis of renewable assets (also consultancy). Currently, we have most platforms ready and it's just waiting for clients and needs pitching. This work is also paid (12 hrs per week). We have also partnered up with another energy services company in Denmark which provides very different b2b services, in which I obtain 2% (free) equity after 1 year of working (paid, 8 hrs per week).

However, thing is; I do not want to be in energy forever. A reason for me rejecting the automated trading positions was that I wish to focus on my own company for a while during my last two years in university and see where the gig lands. Thus, my shares would probably be sold off in the future.

**Finance**

Last gig I have is a corporate finance project for an acquaintance working his own high finance boutique. This consists of modeling 200 MIO projects around the world, also paid and due to the taxman constructed as an internship. I do really like this stuff as it pays good money and projects are short but complex, in contrast to the energy gigs. This acquaintance also has some connections, especially in finance I perhaps could make good use of.

**Summer Internship - Advice**

The only ´free´ time I still have left is in the summer, and I´m heavily interested in finding a good summer internship within either IB, Corporate Finance, Quant Research, Hedge Fund or Automated Trading. As said, I would like to maximize my career progression (but know IB probably is a bit too much to ask for). I know that if I'm going to do high finance I have the least amount of chance of pigeon-holing myself, something I really don't want happening. I also don't mind and perhaps prefer doing worldwide internships as this would set me up for global career paths. Any advice?

**Career progression - Advice**

As said, I would like to maximize career progression and thought about this a good deal. Currently, I would like to set myself up with a good entry position; move positions a couple times; finish CFA curriculum; eventually get an executive MBA from either LSE or INSEAD. This is already the 10 year plan, but I would like to know which career path would offer the highest chance of this succeeding.

**General questions:**

* How to put this experience/ 3 jobs at the same time on my cv?
* I recently got approached by a family investment firm in Dubai for a summer internship as analyst, does anyone have any experience with how much interns get paid in UAE? The firm has some INSEAD alumni and probably a lot of connections in the gulf.
* Any advice on what you would do in my position?
* Just what gives the best career progression, next to IB.
* Best category of summer internship for me to focus on? Fire 100 applications or 10 top applications? Also, would BB hire me based on my CV? I do need +1000 USD compensation a month for own apartment and apartment in Europe I will be keeping on.

Thanks in advance all. Really appreciate it.

Tldr; lots of jobs while studying, want to maximize my career progression. Need advice on how to structure."

I want a software development job abroad. There is negligible abroad placement from my college. Do software companies like Microsoft, American express, Goldman sachs, google, etc. can relocate employees abroad (not temporarily). I am an upcoming intern at one of these and there is a possibly of me getting a PPO (pre placement offer). Or should I proceed to do masters from abroad.

I do not want to study two more years for  masters but if there is no option, I am ready to do. 

Also my CGPA is not so great(but above 8 out of 10)  and I have no research experience.

What should I do to ultimately get a job abroad. 

Thanks a lot."
q17h8n,5,2021-10-04,Internship at Red Hat?,WookieChemist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q17h8n/internship_at_red_hat/,"So I am an undergrad sophomore majoring in CS. I have been learning linux on the side because I believe it will be my main OS in the future. I spent a solid amount of time reading about how linux works and I have developed a happy relationship, I even want to get a tablet I can install it on.

Anyways, when LinkedIn sent me an email that Red Hat is looking for Summer Interns, I got excited. I haven't made a resume before but I need to for this application. i just want to hear your guys opinions on this kind of internship. Does anyone have experience interning with Red Hat? Is it worthwhile? My 2 main goals are to learn more about linux and the workflow of open source app development, and also to gain experience to make me a more appealing candidate for future jobs. Is this the best place to intern at? This is a remote position but happens to be nearby them too."
q17lb8,3,2021-10-04,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/4/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/q17lb8/weekly_job_qa_thread_1042021/,"Hi all,

Here is the ninety-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I'm from India. I am unable to get a full-time job. My gpa is low (3.13) but I have not mentioned it on my resume. I have worked in a couple of contract roles since graduating but I have had no luck in surviving there.

I spent my time at university in drinking and smoking while everyone else was studying hard and struggling to get a job. I did not even get an internship whereas everyone else got one. I somehow did not feel the urgency to get a job. Even when I was working in contract roles, I spent my time drinking and could not deliver performance which is why I got terminated. I even got a coding test invite from a company a couple of months back but I procrastinated on it and even though I ultimately interviewed there, I was informed before that most of the offers had been given out. If I could've taken the coding test before, I might've got the job. 

Right now, I wish to do something better but I don't know how. I don't have the community of students around me like I had in university. I try to apply to jobs but I don't know how to fulfill all the skills requirements, how much time it would take, etc. I don't have a clear plan. I deeply regret all of my past decisions. I regret wasting the peak years of my life in drinking alone, and it forms a lump in my throat. Sometimes it feels like it's all meaningless. I wish someone would let me know what it really takes to get a full-time job. I don't know what to expect in my search."
q18r4c,1,2021-10-04,"As an upcoming graduate with a strong React.js background, is it worth seeking React-specific jobs (and how should I go about that)?",Epicular,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q18r4c/as_an_upcoming_graduate_with_a_strong_reactjs/,"I'm seeking full time jobs starting next May, and I've been applying for all the typical SWE new grad positions. I have several years of internships and projects that all happen to be based in React.js or React Native. By applying for the standard SWE jobs that rarely call for a strong web development background of any kind, I feel like I'm not fully leveraging the strengths of my resume (especially since I'm pretty bad at hard-leetcode-type questions, which I assume a lot of SWE roles are going to test me thoroughly on in the later rounds).

That being said, I'm not sure how to look for React jobs specifically (or whether it's even a good idea, given the lack of stability in web technologies in general). A quick search for ""react developer new grad"" turns up with basically nothing. I can apply for, say, junior-level roles - but I assume they wouldn't be very happy to hear that I can't start until May?"
q18xir,470,2021-10-04,The student employee with the (alleged) power to change your online banking password,RHess19,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/q18xir/the_student_employee_with_the_alleged_power_to/,"Finally, a story for this subreddit!

Cast:

$Me: Uh... me

$Co-worker: Another student employee

$User: Older gentleman, self proclaimed ""technology virgin""

&amp;#x200B;

So, for a bit of background, I'm a college student who works at our on-campus IT Help Desk. One of the things we directly interact with users for is password resets. On this particular day, a faculty member (not teaching staff, just a university employee) comes in to the desk in person looking for help filling out the campus conflict of interest form. As a project for his internship with the IT department of our campus, one of our other student employees created an online web app for submitting COI forms, and this is the first semester it is being used.

Anyways, this user apparently doesn't know his password because he almost never uses his university account. So, naturally, we go through the process of a password reset. Being student employees, our policy is that we can only do student password resets; staff password reset tickets can be created by us, but must be completed by Network Services. So, we create a password reset ticket for $user.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's how our first exchange went (paraphrasing, btw).

$Co-worker: We'll get a ticket sent off to Network Services. We'll give you a call once your password is ready. What's your phone number?

\*user immediately rattles of two phone numbers like he's an auctioneer. My coworker had to ask for him to repeat it about 5 times just so he could pick out the numbers bit by bit as the user says his numbers as fast as possible each time.\*

$Co-worker: Perfect, someone will give you a call as soon as Network Services has reset your password.

$User: Well, I'll just come back in an hour, how's that.

\*leaves\*

&amp;#x200B;

So, an hour later, our user comes back, this time with me as the only employee currently at the IT desk.

$Me: Here's your new password, I'll write it down on a sticky note for you

$User: So this won't change my password, right? Cause as it is, my phone when I log in shows those little stars and enters my password for me (\*is describing autofill)

$Me: Well, yes, this does change your password, but . . .

$User: Well, shoot!! I don't want it to change my password!

$Me, internally: \*if you don't know your password, how do you expect to log in if we don't give you a new password?...\*

$Me: . . .you can always change your password once you're logged in to be anything you choose.

$User: So this changed my phone password, like for my bank and everything else??

$Me: . . . . . No, this only changed your password for university services. (\*wondering how a person could possible think a student employee at their university's help desk has the power to change their BANKING password\*)

$User: Oh, okay, that's good. If it changed my other passwords I'd have to go talk to {person} to have them fix my phone again. They do all of my technology stuff for me. So now how do I do the conflict of interest form?

$Me: Well, I don't have the link to the form handy, but when my co-worker who made the form is at work later today, I'll get the link from him and email it to you so you can fill it out.

$User: Don't bother, I'm a technology virgin, I don't know what I'm doing. When does your co-worker come in?

$Me: 11am

$User: Great, I'll see you at 11 so you can walk me through it.

&amp;#x200B;

For a bit of context, this COI form is ridiculously easy to use. As long as you're logged in, it auto-fills your name and department. All you have to do is enter your birthday and phone number (i believe, don't quote me on that) and either check or un-check boxes of different kinds of conflicts of interests you may or may not have. That's it. It's a perfect replica of the physical form that used to be used, but yet we've gotten tons of complaints that ""the new form is more complicated"" because apparently online = complicated, no exceptions. There have also been users who claim the form is broken because they ignore the note in the form that shows the exact format they need to have their phone number in for the form to be accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The user came back later, and in true ""technology virgin"" style... didn't know what my coworker meant when he asked him to ""scroll down"" on the page, and had to be shown the scroll wheel on the mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Employee needs a password reset, thinks I (a student employee at my college's IT desk) reset his password for all of his accounts, including his bank account."

I am among the top 100 competitive programmers(algorithmic programming) in India currently and probably among the top 15-20 out of the ones graduating in my year conservatively. 

I don't have a lot of knowledge about this industry, I only came to know about this as a career option when HFT firms came to our campus for recruiting interns. I got an offer from most of them. Since then, I have started reading up on markets and trading and I am sure this is my calling in life. I want to make a career in finance.  

Networking and applying to jobs are not my strong suit. I am confident that I will do well if I can get an interview but the path till there is not at all clear to me. From what I have read and heard, cold applying is pretty much useless. I am pretty clueless as to how I can go about looking for an opportunity outside India. What are the chances of actually landing an intern/job with my profile? Is it too late to apply for summer analyst interns 2022? Is there someone here who had a similar background and made the journey successfully who can share their experience?"

I just don't really know what cloud is or what I will be doing or what questions they may ask. I understand the models of IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS, but that's really as far as my cloud knowledge goes. I am in over my head here for this internship? They mention in the posting having classroom or work experience coding in either AWS, Azure, M365, AD, Python, etc. I am taking my first coding class right now in C# and to be honest, I am not very good at it. I struggle with the basics, a lot. Is a large part of cloud coding? What can I do within the next couple days to be prepared for the interview(s)? I know there are going to be 2 interviews with 2 teams since it is my friend's parent who will be conducting the first one.

q1erqv,8,2021-10-04,"DS vs SWE, knowing what’s right for me?",PolyMatt98,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/q1erqv/ds_vs_swe_knowing_whats_right_for_me/,"Hi Everyone,

I recently finished undergrad with a Math degree, and I specifically concentrated in Actuarial Science, which led to me taking 4 upper level Stats courses.

After finishing an Actuarial Science internship last Fall, I realized that a lot of Actuary roles were pretty boring to me, similar to Accounting roles. The roles that did interest me were the modeling teams, but those roles don’t make up the majority of Actuarial work. So, during my last semester of college, I realized that I was mostly indifferent or even bored by Actuarial work, and that I shouldn’t pursue a career in it, especially with having to study for several difficult exams.

This led to my decision of going back to get a CSMS, which the goal of going into DS or Software. So far I love it, I think I would enjoy being a SWE for sure, but I like the idea of working in DS more because I love Math and modeling. 

That said, I have heard some conflicting things about being a Data Scientist, and that roles can vary widely with the good DS jobs being very competitive for EL, even more competitive than top SWE jobs.

I’d like to commit to one over the other as soon as I can so I can tailor my resume for a specific job. Any advice on how I can know what’s right for me?"
q1ey4a,1,2021-10-04,Intellectual rights,Impossible_Soft_2902,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/q1ey4a/intellectual_rights/,"Hi i am new to reddit, i have heard there are some good legals advice from this subsection. I just have a few legal point hopefully someone can give me some advices to move forward.

Background
In June 2020, i did an internship for a denture clinic ( as a Denturist) in Victoria, BC, Canada.
However when i got there, the clinic is almost dead, very few patients referred from dentists as same as walk-in patients. As part of my internship i have to complete a set number of required patient cases such as complete denture and partial denture, in order to be qualified for a licensure exam.

Because of lacking of patients, i promote the ideals to him to create a clinic website as well as social media pages in order to promote the clinic and to generate more patients. He agreed. And i did created the website and facebook and google business profile which have been tremendous success for the clinic. However, i did not ask him for a financial share of the successful patient as my main objective was to generate as much patients as possible in order to fulfil my internship requirement. The website and the social media pages are purely my goodwill toward the clinic

As time goes by i have experienced that the clinic owner was not an honest man nor he is a trustworthy guy as he has been in dispute with several companies related to social media and website marketing just because he didnt like them, including yellowpage the company which sued him for breaking their contract. Not to mention the way he treated patients with the lowest respect and standard and he does the same to his employee as well ( at the same time it was only myself).

So the legal question here is. At the end of my internship i was able to complete the requirement mostly from my website and social media creation.
I decided to leave the clinic for good and i have told the owner of not continue to use my intellectual property anymore for his own gain. However he is still using it and has made tremendous gain from it. So, in Canada particularly in BC, is there any law that protect my intellectual property like website and social media pages and could i start a lawsuit against to him and his clinic for using intellectual property without my permission and will there be and financial benefits for doing so

Thanks you"

Hey everyone, as the title says I was a pre-med student who decided to switch from medical school to a career in CS. I have some background in CS I took the two introductory courses for the major in my university which was Boston university, and I learned about python and Java. I also did a senior thesis using Matlab to model neuron electrical activities. So I know I have some background on the topic but I also I am not as good as the people who majored in the topic. I would appreciate any advice geared towards formulating a plan. My current idea of what to do is as follows:

- look for an internship
- apply for a master’s of CS this coming Winter. (This step is shaky given my background)
- complete any certificates and courses I can get my hands on pre-application 
- speak to some of my old advisors.

I would appreciate any advice, and if anyone would be kind enough to have a conversation through pm that would be much appreciated."

My undergrad degree is in German so nothing remotely tech related. I had to work full time to afford my masters so I wasn't able to get an internship or anything. I already knew I was going to struggle to find a job after graduating with no relivant work experience but then that glorious pandemic hit. Major yikes. I did coding challenges all the time to keep my skills up. I read skill books. I worked on my portfolio. I kept an excel spreadsheet of every job I applied for. I revamped my resume 4 times in the last year and finally found one that seemed to get more ""responses"" back....I've had a few interviews in the past year that I just totally bombed but I took notes on what I failed at and made sure I knew it for the next time.

q1h8eb,1,2021-10-04,Are some technologies more common than others in remote jobs? Which ones should I learn?,This-Routine-4582,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q1h8eb/are_some_technologies_more_common_than_others_in/,"I'm in a pretty difficult situation. I'm a CS student, and I live in a very small town with almost no programming jobs.  I don't own a car so I can't commute to the city. I'll be staying in this town for the next \~3 years while my wife finishes her master's degree.

I'll probably graduate next year, and due to personal circumstances I'm only now starting to apply to internships. From what I've heard, it's not as easy to get a remote job as a junior, especially in domains that mostly use C++, Rust or C, which coincidentally, are the jobs that interest me the most. They tend to be more specialized and seem to have a higher barrier of entry, something I wouldn't mind if I wasn't stuck in this little town where my only hope is remote jobs. I'm interested in systems programming, performance monitoring, low level code, stuff like that. I don't really like webdev, but at this point beggars can't be choosers. 

I feel a bit lost. It was only recently that I discovered the areas of software dev that I really like, and now I can't pursue them. What languages and technologies should I get good at for better remote job prospects? Preferably anything that isn't frontend web. I've played around with iOS dev but never published anything on the App Store cause it's too expensive ($99 per year!). I know how to build a boring old generic CRUD web app and hook it up to a database or an ORM. I know a bit of frontend (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and old school server side template rendering... No client side rendering. I hate it.). I know git, and I'm already fairly proficient in JS, Go and Java (love it, although I hate Spring Boot...). I recently started re-learning Python for leetcode, but am not very familiar with ecosystem nor its job prospects. I once wrote an API in Flask that took data from Goodreads public API, but it was [retired](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/20/12/17/1522242/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy) literally days later so I never bothered to deploy it."
q1h98m,3,2021-10-04,"I have been at my first job for almost three months. It pays okay, people there are friendly, the hours are flexible, and it is near home. But I ABSOLUTELY HATE it. Let me explain.",ajv1993,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q1h98m/i_have_been_at_my_first_job_for_almost_three/," I originally posted this on /TrueOffMyChest but edited and updated few things: 

I am currently a student worker working outside of my university. It is mostly office-based, where you are tasked with scan prepping and scanning old files to be upload into the computer system. Sometimes I am assigned to attend to incoming and outgoing mail.

It's a pretty easy job - a little TOO easy and very monotonous. Scan prepping (which is something student workers will do from time to time) just involves removing staples and post-it notes from files, and then alphabetizing them back into warehouse boxes. Everytime I am tasked with doing that, I feel like my brain has melted and is about to fall out of my skull.

And since I am not the only student worker there, we often have to work as a team. Which is cool but a sometimes I work better alone, and a lot of the work that needs to be done can easily be done by one person. But my supervisor insist that another student worker needs to be there if I need help.

I am the type of person that hates to be watched when doing anything or at least treated like everyday is my first day. I catch on to things pretty easily and only want help when asked for it. Thankfully when they see that I got it, they leave to do what they got to do. But my supervisor still finds ways to nitpick and explain how the task needs be done. Even though I already know and that it was the other student worker that decided to leave after seeing I did not need any help.

Like I mentioned earlier, there are other student workers employed there. But because of that, I feel like it makes my tasks pointless and something that could be done even if I wasn't there. I feel interchangable, unvaluable, and replaceable. My supervisor has told me that I am a hardworker but that's easy to be when my projects are menial and could be done by another student worker. Plus it seems like they get new ones every few weeks, like how many does one office need?

Before this, it was incredibly difficult getting a job (I live in an area where it is either hard to find work or many have to work two jobs, or work two jobs while also going to school). It was incredibly discouraging since I already have two Associates (currently working on my Bachelors and Masters). During that time I mostly did volunteer work and an internship.

But I found myself enjoy those more - even if I wasn't getting paid. I even took pride in what I was putting out. Now that have an actual job where I actually get paid - I am incredibly unhappy and find myself very angry all the time (and I am the type of person that rarely gets angry and is still uncomfortable to show my anger). I don't care about the work I put out and that has also made me dislike the type of person I have become.

I also feel terrible and guilty for how I feel, since others say ""hey it's just a job"", ""it's only your first job, you're not gonna stay in it forever,"" or ""a job is a job, at least you are getting paid."" Like, yeah I know but while I am currently employed I at least want to be have some contentment and earned pride when the paycheck comes in. Dream job or not. But the stuff other people have told me still rings in my head when I just tell myself to ""stuck it up"" or ""get a grip"".

Also I sometimes get so lonely while at work. I've already met some really nice people there that I have gotten along with but not enough to really be friends with inside or outside of work. Plus some of already have formed established cliques. 

I have started applying at other places while still there but I am afraid. I am afraid that I will go back to square one and will not be able to find anything else and will have no choice but to stay there. Plus I live with my mom and I feel like I am letting her down feeling this way, especially since my new income can help with whatever needs to be paid off (and she hardly ever asks for money). I worry more about her than if I have any money of my own to be honest. Even though I need to start making money as I can only stretch my last FAFSA check for so long.

I sometimes think, maybe I am just overreacting and can grow to enjoy this job? Maybe not? I don't know and that makes me even sadder. 

TL;DR version: My new-ish job is making me miserable and I am afraid I will find nothing else in the meantime."

Pets being stolen, teachers being assaulted, admin being delusional (which seems to be a trend). To be honest, it's intimidating to read as a student teacher entering the profession (PA). I've worked as a para in a different state (VT), an environmental educator over a couple summers during undergrad, a tutor, guitar teacher, and a roving education intern, but this is my first time leading my own lessons in a secondary setting.

Honestly, I am so comfortable and I haven't felt this great in months. I feel like the students are enjoying our time together, my highly improvisational style is landing (though the dad jokes aren't), and I'm actually communicating effectively in another language with our EL students. The other Spanish-speaking students often help translate so s/o to them!

I want to push the students academically because, quite frankly, I think they are bored. Is anyone else seeing this? Societally, we are pretty soft on the youths in many ways, and I'm not going to disrespect anybody in the classroom or anything but this batch of students wants to work hard and do well so I'm going to ask more of them. It is so refreshing, especially after my last experience with 6th graders! *That* was an absolute **clusterfuck** nearly every single day from mouthing off to teachers, eloping constantly, endless drama, disrespectful language to peers, physical violence, and a defiant attitude toward most assignments. It wasn't every student but there was enough to make some days really, really hard. But this? It feels like what I've been born to do.

I know that I only face some parts of the job right now and haven't really had to deal with communicating with and meeting the expectations of parents and admin. I know I'm new and have lots to learn. I understand that not every student, class, school, and district is the same. I don't really need reminders about how much ""worse"" it's going to get and I'm sorry that some of you are having an overall terrible experience with teaching right now. I sincerely wish you the best through the rest of the school year, in your next teaching position, or the next career move!

At one point today, I was walking around the hallways and I heard all of the teachers through their doors. The ambience of academia all meshed together and it felt like I was home. I hope we can share some of this energy and keep the train rolling! I'm excited for this career and really doing the thing!

What do you wish you knew as a student teacher that you know now? How did your perspective change with time? Is there anything I should know as a rising secondary classroom educator?"

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 4.0/4.25 I think? My school has this thing where weighted GPA is capped at 4.5 to prevent people from taking 20+ AP classes. Rank is 2/500ish.

**Coursework:**

Currently have taken/am taking 8 AP classes (Bio - 5, Stats - 5, Calc BC - 5, World - 5, Lang, Chem, E Science, and Physics).

Dual Enrollment: I took US History over this summer, and I will be taking Calc 3 this year in the spring semester.

Note: I'm planning to take 5 AP classes senior year. However, one of them is a weird combo class thing between Econ and Gov (one semester of each), so I'll basically be taking 4 APs. I will also be taking Linear Algebra and potentially another science/math DE class.

**Awards:**

1. State + National Qualifier in Congressional Debate - Basically the only meaningful award I care about lol
2. State Qualifier in Policy Debate
3. 3rd place regional Science Fair Award (also last place lmao)
4. AP Scholar with Honor
5. 3rd place regional Science Bowl

**Extracurriculars (Big Ones):**

1. Nonprofit Marketing Agency - Manage $700k+ in advertising for nonprofits, run a nonprofit marketing blog, built my website, etc.
2. Nonprofit Marketing Guide - Made a short e-book on nonprofit marketing, distributed to 1060 nonprofits
3. Independent Data Projects - Did a few independent data projects, won award #3 from one of them

**Future Extracurriculars**:

Nonprofit marketing internship program, statistics research at local CC

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I made a meme essay last year, which people thought was pretty good. I know I'm thinking a little ahead of myself right now, but I expect my essays and LORs to be decent but not incredible. My uncle was an admissions assistant at a state school in a very competitive area, and one of my LORs will be from a teacher who I've had since freshman year and is the advisor for the math club.

I have one on ones with my manager every friday. I went to grace hopper conference last week (biggest women in computer conference in US) so my manager asked me on friday how it went and I was like yeah it was okay.

Then he proceeds to ask me, ""So why do you think women usually are bad programmers? I don't see any good women programmers in tech. Were there any women in higher positions in this conference?"" 

That completely threw me off. What do I even say to that? I was literally silent for a whole 30 second before asking ""What do you mean women usually are bad programmers?"" 

He proceeds to say things like ""No no I think YOU'RE a good FEMALE programmer. I think you're the second one I know that's good.""

He proceeds to make similar comments and at this point I'm pretty uncomfortable and feel very undermined (more so after his half ass ""compliment"" that basically called me a good programmer FOR A GIRL). I start to explain why women don't feel comfortable joining the tech field bc of stereotypes like this and he changed the topic shortly without really saying anything in response to what I said.

Today, I was reached out by the only other female SWE in the company for an update on my work and answers to  emails/messages (about work) that I sent to my manager. He hasn't contacted me or replied to them.

The situation is as follows. 

I am 23. I am from Spain, where juniors/young people barely have any future. Most of us are unemployed or eternally working for free as interns. 

The ""lucky"" ones who get a job do so after having spent long months as interns. And if that was not enough, the salaries of this priviledged class are usually something around 1300€/month (namely, crap). 

I want to move out from my parents' (I don't care if it is to a tiny room in a 6-bedroom apartment) and build my own life and future. 

I also have a girlfriend abroad (in Poland) and I need the flexibility of a remote job in order to be able to be travelling constantly. 

What would the best decision be in terms of.... 

-&gt; Maximizing my present and future income/ savings per month while being able to move out

-&gt; Speeding up the time required to save enough money to purchase my first property (through debt). 
(I might actually even purchase it in Poland) 
? 

The costs of life here (in Spain), even when living very humbly, range between 600-700€/month for a student. That means that with a 'priviledged' 1300€/month job, I would only be saving 500-600€/month (and thus it would take me at least 8-12 years to be eligible to receive a mortgage to buy my first flat). 

A flat of an average size in most cities, in an area not too far away from the centre, could be something around 200-250k€, (and even more in Madrid and Barcelona), and these prices are expected to grow over the upcoming years. 


As for my career, I studied psychology, I could've  gotten into IT but I declined in favour of the latter (big mistake now I regret). I have just graduated from a master's degree in digital marketing &amp; big data. 
I have self-taught programming skills and I am working on 2-3 ""business"" projects of mine (which will surely fail, but must try). 
I'd say I have a 'good' CV for my age and I know I could easily get a 1300€/month job here. (Most if not all of the other junior DM graduates suck at english and/or don't have any technical skills at all, which are a must in DM). 

I don't know if it would be a good idea to go for a drastic career change into IT, or if I should put all my eggs in the digital marketing basket. 

All I know is I don't wanna work for a Spanish salary. I'd rather move to Germany, France, the UK, etc.. (even if I don't have the flexibility of a remote job).

What would you do in my situation? 
What career do you think I should bet on within the DM realm? (PPC, SEO..?) 
Or maybe should I start a career in IT? 
Where/how would you do the remote job seeking part?"

I hate to be that guy, but does anyone have a guide/roadmap that would be feasible for a noob such as myself to get started with. 

Specifically, what curriculum should I follow to 

1. Learn the basics of finance &amp; trading
2. Learn c++ from the very basics 
3. Familiarize myself with the type of programming at trading firms



Browsing through this subreddit I’m getting overwhelmed by the number of resources provided many of which I wouldn’t be able to comprehend anyway. I’m willing to put in the work, but given my heavy course load what is a feasible gameplan. 

Thanks in advance!"

1. Second year PhD Comp and Theoretical Bio
2. I do protein bioinfo research + a math modeling project on intrinsically disordered proteins.
3. Have some comp genomics experience from undergrad, I was in a RNAseq lab (PCAs, tSNEs, GSEAs etc)
4. Git, Docker, Python, C++, MATLAB experience.

My point of posting is that I would like to apply to industry internships because 1) I have never been in industry and 2) I want to know where in industry is right for me. I am aware I need to get some cloud computing and R programming in for some places which is something I can handle on my own time learning. 

My question mainly is how and where should one look for grad level internships and also whether I should also apply to ones intended to undergrads. I have been digging around on LinkedIn and Glassdoor and websites of biotech companies and i have not found much. I do not have much connections (only stem major in the family), but i do want to find a way to put at least one foot in the door. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I also have been looking at internships at national labs."

I'm a new grad (Dec 2021) that studies at a top 10 university with a very low income background. I am on (mostly) full financial aid. For some unrelated reasons, I fell into some severe depression over the summer and most of last spring semester. During this time, I succumbed to a lot of the financial pressures and frankly stupid decisions. I have racked up around $4000 of credit card debt. I expected to be paid through an internship I did over the summer, but I ended up not being paid and received some small equity and course credit for my work (it was a professor's startup, I know I got done dirty since I was promised some minimum comp). This really derailed my payment plan ideas and long story short, I missed a payment in August.

Around late August, I pulled myself up out of my hole and started grinding LeetCode very vigorously in hopes of having a good new grad application cycle. Fast forward to now, I have received a few offers including one at a pretty reputable tech company with TC exceeding $130k. During the time I was grinding, I kinda became too focused on my interviews and studying and opted to not have a part-time job as I always do, to sustain myself.  Recently, I picked up a tutoring job and have been making a decent amount (enough to meet minimum payments and such)  as my recruiting season (Jan start) comes to a close. Although I am making money, some of these paychecks have been delayed due to setting up direct deposit and such with another company (I currently have enough on the books to make payments for the rest of the year till my start date but I don't have the money yet).

I plan to accept my offer to the reputable tech company on the latest possible date of 10/20 to prolong the time before my background check as I fear my credit might cause me to have my offer rescinded. I have read mixed posts about whether tech company background checks even have credit checks or not. The company in question is NOT a financially oriented company and focuses on a lot of cloud computing technology. I even asked my recruiter/hiring manager about the background check including a credit check and I told him about some of my missed payments. He told me he didn't think they had credit checks for new grads but was not sure. Now I am in a very bad situation where I am happy to get offers but am terrified of having them rescinded due to my stupidity. I can't sleep for most nights of the week or even concentrate on my upcoming Big N on-sites. My simple question is, am I screwed and what can I do to mitigate losing my offers. I know the natural solution is to come ""current"" with my two credit cards (one is current, one I expect to make current tomorrow, granted I get my $90 paycheck for tutoring). 

Any advice is appreciated and shoutout to this subreddit for inspiring me to chase my dream jobs and turn my life around, you guys are the real MVPs."

I have heard not so good things about the Data Science field. The pay, I have heard is usually lower than what software people get.

I want to apologize before hand for posting this here but the subject was so broad I didn't know where to post it and r/mentalhealth seemed the most appropriate subreddit for this.

# Why Post This

In the below sections I have ""tried"" to explain my ""complex"" problem and circumstances of it. And I have done so in the hope that somebody can help. Help meaning a solution, a suggestion, a criticism, an offer, something, anything!! If you do, please say so; if not, thanks in advance for your time. I am open to anything considering my situation. (that's what she said).

Also, excuse my english, I did not learn it properly and just watched movies. Also I use a lot of the word ""I"", specially at the beginning of sentences. I don't know why. :)

# Introduction

I'm 24M and I live in an unfortunately very religous muslim family in a 3rd world country. And I'm what an honest person would call a loser. As the title suggests I suffer from various (:)) things and I'm practically desperate. So I'm going to explain what's up and I really hope that somebody has something to say.

# Education

The only time I was good at school was elementary school and I got all straight A's. I'm not sure about the reason but after elementary school my education started to decline, each grade worse than the previous one. I really am not sure about the reason why. Maybe it's because it was not expected of me to be good at it. My middle school and high school were very cheap schools and the norm was low grades. The only thing in education I was really pushed to do was to be at least in the norm range. Not above, not below. Also children differed too much culturally when comparing elementary with middle and high school. I started to get depressed around middle school and I was pretty lonely in those 6 years. Then because of my dad who was previously in war, I was able to get to a good university in my home city very easily; as in I tried 1/1000 compared to the people that got there in the regular way. I ""studied"" Software Engineering there; and by study I mean I just got the passing grade by reading at the night of exams. If you're familiar with CS, you'd know that to be able to get a job, the CS syllabus is not enough and throughout the whole uni years you have to learn a lot on your own. So, throughout 5 years (yeah, it took me 5 \*sad noises\*), I barely graduated; meaning I'm not even good at DS&amp;ALGO (most important thing to practice in CS). And I learned un-continuously python and django and a bit of linux.

# Profession

Since I was a kid, I always loved computers. Because at the end of the day it was the only real friend I had (\*sad Alan Turing noises\*). Although I didn't know programming and these stuff back then, I played a lot of video games and watched tons of movies which differed drastically from the culture around me. So you could say I'm comparatively progressive (in spite of being traditional) in my city.

That's why I got into CS. But I was a kid and knew nothing of the world around since I lived only in my computer. I didn't work hard because of that and lost many many opportunities. In uni when I met my very few friends and looked up to them, I tried to study hard to compensate for all the knowledge and experience that I lacked. BUT, that's when Adult ADHD hit me. I didn't know what it was. After a year or two I was diagnosed but due to my very depressive situations and addictions I didn't pay attention to it. Also I could hardly afford therapy.

Anyhow, during uni years, I learned python and a bit of DS, and a bit of django. So in my 4th year, I got into an internship at a company that my classmate was the CTO of. I sucked at that. I did learn a bit more django, but overall everybody rated it at a below average level. Then during my 5th year, I owed some people money and I needed a job since my parents couldn't afford that money (it wasn't much; we're barely surviving). So I looked for a job; ANY job. Therefore my priorities were python and django and beginner level \*sad stupid noises\*. I got the job. DID NOT LIKE IT ONE BIT. But tried to get through it. When I smelled the money, I got carried away. I got addicted again for a period. And after 9 months of work, got fired (two months ago).

So naturally after a period of depressive sadness, I tried to analyze what was it that led me to this situation. First of all, I did not like the job at all; specially the Business. I despised the end-users because of how boring it is. It was a sort of delivery company with 150 people on board, thousands on bikes, and 7 people in the tech team. I lacked enough CS knowledge and barely did the tasks. But the hard part for me personally was learning the codebase; as an ADHD sufferer would say, ""I just couldn't!"". I learned one part as I forgot another. I tried using notes, small notes, big notes. Nothing did the job. I always forgot the data flow. The different parts of the system. And felt hurt every god-f-damn time they mentioned it to me. Also, another problem was my code reviews. Many, many repetetive mistakes were made. Usually, I had too many questions as to why should I do \*that\*, but barely understood the reasons and since there were too many questions I tried to just do what the code reviewer says; so without understanding the reasons, naturally I did not learn from my mistakes.

# ADHD

At first I self diagnosed this about 3 years ago. I analyzed my behaviour during classes, study sessions and also doing things that were interesting. The first pattern that conformed to ADHD was that of doing interesting things vs un-interesting ones. I got distracted whenever I did something un-interesting and un-engaging. e.g. studying, paying attention to classes, paying attention while reading, etc. And on the other hand, interesting things were like playing video games, watching movies I loved, programming (because of super fast response), etc.

Whatever I do that is not interesting, my mind wanders off without me knowing it. I can binge-read 10 pages in a short time and not understand one sentence of it. It's like multitasking. The reading part is done automatically, but the comprehension cannot be done due to the fact that my mind is not here. And I have an addiction that in spite of the times my mind wanders on its own, I have special times I dedicate to just wandering around. Let it be thinking about the past and over-analyzing things, or things about the future, or, mostly, having made up conversations.

I also have difficulty planning and organizing and cleaning my thoughts.

After my self diagnosis I have visited 3 psychiatrists. The first was awful and couldn't help. The 2nd prescribed Ritalin and some other things, but those were not helpful at all. And I didn't continue that until 2 years ago (I couldn't afford it). I'll talk about the 3rd one in OCD.

# OCD

2 years ago, I went to a great doctor, one of the best actually, and talked about having ADHD. But he diagnosed me with having ADHD+OCD. Then he prescribed me with ""anti-obsessive"" pills (I really don't know anything about pills). But after 2 sessions, I couldn't afford to go there again.

So up until recently, after 2 years of not paying attention to these illnesses, they got cought up with me. TBH, I didn't know what OCD was until now. I can now see how I get caught up in mental loops, big ones and small ones, frequenlty. I'm so tired of having the same problems I had when I was kid.

# Emotional Neglect

6 months ago, I got addicted to weed for the 2nd time and I was not feeling well at-fing-all. By the time, I had a job and I could afford going to therapy. So I started going. I went to the best one I could find, because I did not have a good experience with therapy before and was pretty skeptical about them. But this one was really good. In the two sessions I had with him, he found out about my emotional neglect and tried to CBT me from there. But he didn't talk with technical terms.

What I stated as my main problem was loneliness. Because I had a job, I was ignorant about the fact that I'm failing at it and I'm inadequate due to my inattention, learning disabbilities and my lack discipline. My uni friends had all got a life. Around the time that covid-19 first appeared (2 years ago), I had a bearable life; at least I liked it (I was desperate then, but I liked what I had compared to now). I met a girl, and spent a lot of time with her. But since covid-19 appeared my friends went to their cities, and because I'm awful at social media and online chatting and etc, we lost touch. Flash forward a year later, I broke up with the girl, and tried to seek my friends. They didn't let me in, or even treat me nicely. They didn't care, and I did not understand that friendships work that way, etc, etc.

So I told him my main problem is loneliness and I cannot bare to live alone, etc, etc. The first things he said, was that why can you not be alone? Flash forward conversations, I understand now that I'm holding my feelings inside. I was not emotionally connected with my friends. I only ""used"" them to be amused (in my defence I didn't understand that). And now I understand why when I was around my friends too much (6 months living in a dorm), I couldn't stand it; because it became so normal for me that my repressed feelings tried to bottle up so I looked for a change again. After the two sessions I had with my therapist, I understood so many things. Another thing was that I can see that I'm very sad and angry and dissapointed but I cannot shed a tear for myself. I tried to battle this, but I just can't shed a tear for myself. I can cry when I'm watching movies and something sad happens to someone. But I cannot basically process my own sadness. And he told me everything starts there. ""You have to let go and cry so that you can start healing; without that step, there's nothing that can be done."" But unfortunately, not only I could not cry, also I couldn't afford the therapy because I got fired. So reverse engineered the things I learned and got to understand that I'm unconsciously repressing my emotions. From here, after a bit of research I found out the term Emotional Neglect. I started reading the book Running on Empty by Dr. Jonice Webb around two weeks ago.

# Problem

After I was fired, I became super duper sad. I glanced at my own life and became even more sad. So many many problems left unnoticed and untreated. After a while, I tried to come up with a plan. I decided to give myself a break and instead of finding another job which I'm gonna suck at, I'll set up a learning path and force myself to go through with it and finally get a job. After I started, it failed immediately. I remembered my learning disabbilities during my uni, I could not remember a thing after I learned it, and I was super duper slow at learning. I still am. So naturally another sad phase hit. I got up again, thought to myself, ""I'm gonna give myself 3 months to start treating my metnal illnesses."" I thought I could spend one month on each of them (except social anxiety because that doesn't matter right now). I thought I could get it up and running with one month each, and then continue analyzing and treating problems as I faced with learning challenges and mental breakdowns.

BUT, it's been two weeks after I started reading Running on Empty, and I've only gotten to 70% of this 300 page book. I can barely do anything productive. I'm usually feeling empty-ish (kinda sad, not sure). It's taking me 3 hours to write this post :|. My deep rooted response for feeling empty is to distract myself. Right now my distractions are drinking tea and smoking, surfing social media (twitter, 9gag, yt, reddit), and watching One Piece (anime). I cannot stop these! I tried man, donno what to do anymore. I also cannot sit through reading a book for 3 hours. I even tried reading 2 \* 2 hours a day and still couldn't. I thought maybe the ""healing"" part of the book would give me something to battle the cause of feeling empty so I wouldn't feel empty so I could stop doing un-productive things so I could read and tend to the real problems at hand. But no progress whatsoever.

# Etcetera

I'm a very addictive person. Currently I'm addicted to tea&amp;ciggaretes (golden virginia), porn, masturbation, social media, movies (+anime), talking to myself, day-dreaming (I donno what else). I was previously addicted to sugar (can't afford it now), fast-food (can't afford it), medium quality weed (3rd world country), and low quality magic mushrooms.

I found the books Brain Lock by Jeffery Schwartz for OCD and Delivered from Distraction by Edward Hallowell for ADHD. But still haven't read them."

q1xs3m,21,2021-10-05,I had a full on breakdown in my car after work yesterday and here’s why… ps kinda lengthy,Lady-MonAnarcy,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q1xs3m/i_had_a_full_on_breakdown_in_my_car_after_work/,"I’ll start off by saying that this job is my first real “career” out of college but still, fuck this place, Man.

I was an intern that got paid $1250 a month… while I was there, I got micromanaged, had grunt work pushed onto me without warning, got told that I need to pay for classes and travel far/out of state to them to know how to do my job, each costing $1000 each, and there are 3 of those fucking things and I wasn’t going to get paid for the time that I missed, I got talked down to a lot, and there was a racist text message that went out telling all the black employees (which includes me) to go home since we’re an embarrassment to our office and the nation. I was an intern for 4 months while working a full time job an making $1400 a month from there, then I was placed into the management position, had to quit my old job, and somehow it got worse?!

Still getting micromanaged to the point where I honestly believe that some of these people don't think I can do my job. My computer tower seems to be running like it’s from the Cold War. I’m left out of my own program meetings because they are being set up by someone else and they don’t include me in the time and decision making. Still getting told that I need to take those classes because back then I couldn’t afford them, and now COVID is a thing and some aren’t being offered but apparently that’s not a good enough reason to get off my back about it. I still have that fat fuck of a coworker tossing his work at me telling me to do it while also making everything I do harder by withholding info that I need and telling me to figure it out, and then when I go to tell someone about this he’s “oh she never asked for help, I would’ve helped her!” FUCK YOU!!

Ever since COVID started, I didn’t really have a choice. I was living paycheck to paycheck to make sure bills were paid and groceries were good and my cats were healthy. It helped that my husband was also working but I still took the internship for some spending money and additional savings. Unfortunately, he had to medically retire due to PTSD. I had to step up to be the bread winner while he goes through that process. Making $2650 a month with the bills we have wasn’t an option.   So when the management position was open and they told me they would give it to me, I had to say yes. It never got better, and this is wasn’t even an industry I want to work in to begin with! I just really needed the money. Yesterday I had 3 people trying to talk to me at once telling me this needs to be done and this needs to be done and where’s this and where’s that. It was just never ending. I asked fat fuck for help and again blew me off and was super condescending. I told someone else to ask him for me and he was more than happy to. I WASN’T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE THERE THAT DAY!! We have telework options but I have to be on call legit 24/7. If I leave the state to visit friends or family, I have to notify them that I won’t be on call and then everyone seems to get pissy about with me. It’s the weekend, I want to be with people I care about. But no, I get called in because… get this… a red light was blinking. I wasted a few hours of my Saturday traveling back to my office, to turn on a valve that they could have turned themselves. Hell, there’s a whole procedure on the wall that explains how to do it if you see the red light!!

“It’s a white collar job.” I work with hazardous waste and chemical, I move Cylinders 3 times my weight in an out of buildings, I’m the one that has to run the trash out and do/provide most of the cleaning stuff. I’m a glorified maid that is told that she isn’t, but is treat like the trash that I toss out everyday. 

Obviously there are going to be people there that are kind, but they’ve been leaving and moving on and… I just can’t.  It just breaks me so much. I want to leave, I want to get out but it’s like I’m in so deep that I’m drowning! Ive been applying and I keep getting ghosted. I’ve had to learn this job as I go because training stopped after 4 months when it was supposed to be a year. I know my predecessor said that he wouldn’t let me fail, but with the way I’m treated, I feel like I have. I went to college, I got my MS degree by the time I was 24. I thought I did everything right. 

What I really want to do is be in sustainability, I love renewable energy and helping build up communities. I want do my hobbies like soap making, or comics/ digital art and crocheting baby hats for the local NICU and keep learning to make stuffed animals for kids. I made a yellow stingray, kind a wonky but I’ve loved it ever since. I’m for a Universal Base Income because what you chose to do with your time, is now a choice! Not an obligation to a work place in order to not be homeless and starve. 

After yesterday, I just sat and screamed… it’s been building up and building up and I just screamed and kept screaming. I can’t quit. Unless I want us to lose our way of life… I can’t. I feel so battered and broken and small here. I fucking hate it so much.

q1y1ij,13,2021-10-05,Space Science with Python - A YouTube tutorial journey,MrAstroThomas,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/q1y1ij/space_science_with_python_a_youtube_tutorial/,"Hey everyone,

last year, during some lockdown phases, I had an idea: I wanted to start working on programming tutorials that would combine my two passions: Python and Space. Why this niche combination?

Before I started working in industry (2 years ago) I worked in academia, focusing on my science passion: astronomy. During my bachelor-, master- and doctorate times I was quite lucky. I started with Python back in 2012 when I worked as an intern at the European Space Agency (for 6 months). My topics: asteroids and Near-Earth Objects. Afterwards, during my master's I was part of the Rosetta/Philae mission, working on calibration tasks for a dust instrument on-board the lander Philae. I extended the time between by Master and doctorate thesis, since the landing on the comet was in November 2014. From 2015 to 2019 I then worked on the Cosmic Dust Analyzer on-board the Saturn mission Cassini. I worked on numerical simulations and used Machine Learning algorithms to e.g., classify mass spectra of these dust particles (of course using Python).

Beside that... well... astronomy is also my hobby. So yeah that's where the combination Python + Space comes from!

Now working in industry I miss one thing: education, giving seminars and exchanging with others on ideas and projects. I started with Medium articles, but somehow it was not ""interactive"" enough for me. There was little interaction with others and thus I started now to move to YouTube. And before you judge: yes, I need to improve my audio quality (my pre-amp causes noise...), I need a banner and stuff to be more professional. I am not a big influencer or something, since Python + Space is... again... quite niche. But I believe that this niche is real, considering how many machine learning, data science, web dev etc. tutorials are out there and basically none for space topics.

So what's the plan? Well I started with some first setup tutorials, a first basic introduction to a library called SPICE and in the next couple of videos I would like to show more basics to build up a solid fundament for further complex space scientific projects!

The Open Source and Citizen Science community is really strong and enthusiastic. Some astronomy amateurs create devices and have science projects that go beyond the skill-set of professionals. And I think that the coding and ML community can have a strong digital impact in space science, too. And to make space science more accessible (with Python) I would like to create a proper tutorial series.

If you have ideas or would like to provide feedback, please write a comment, send me a DM here, on YouTube or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrAstroThomas). I am really looking forward to more people that are eager to dive into this topic. And it is a lot of fun to do education stuff in my free time :).

Best,

Thomas

P.S.: I am also thinking about creating a Space and Python related sub here on Reddit. Please let me know whether this may be of interest or not."

Depending on the situation with COVID, its likely sa second semester na yung internship namin as part of our curriculum, and nagpaisip ako bigla on the many projects I've worked on as part of course requirements.

Some of these projects kasi are just what I would consider as basic lang and others are projects that I wasn't able to fully finish for the course requirements (few missing features here and there). And with the internships possibly coming up next semester, medyo anxious ako on whether having a lot of ***finished*** projects on my resume/CV is important or a must have.

I'm a bit conflicted if I should either:

1. go back to these projects and finish them as I should have, or
2. come up with a new project that encompasses the topics and knowledge of those past projects

On top of that, I'm not sure rin if the projects that I worked on for course requirements were able to extensively cover everything that an interviewer for an internship application expects me to know for a good chance at acceptance. Any advice?"

My record is decent on paper; the school is very highly ranked, I published a paper in a reputable venue, I did well in all courses I took. I have /almost/ all the requirements to leave with a Masters, but ultimately I left without it and it's unlikely I'll return to complete it.

My undergrad was in Math/CS and my now-terminated PhD was in CS. I haven't had an internship before, only research experiences. My question is: how should I frame/talk about my time in graduate school? I'm assuming I should avoid mentioning any mental health issues that caused me to leave. Is it a red flag to have been doing a PhD for two years and then leave without a Masters degree? Or would it be fine to give some generic ""I decided it wasn't for me and I wanted to apply my talents to the real world, blah blah""?"

I'm currently a fourth year uni student at a prestigious university majoring in CS. I've interned at a few companies before and most recently I finished my internship at Google. I have one internship left before I graduate and I've been very lucky to get an offer from Facebook for an internship.

The Facebook offer was terrible in my opinion as the monthly compensation is $5000. On the other hand, the startup which I have an internship offer from is providing the monthly comp as $11000.

My question is that is taking up Facebook a good choice? Everyone has been telling me to go ahead with Facebook as adding a second FANG on my resume will really strengthen my resume. Apart from the name, I don't really see Facebook adding any other value to my career.

I do feel that in the future, mentioning I've interned at Facebook AND Google will set up a reputation for me but I'm not sure if it's worth the tradeoff of the salary. Am I being too money oriented? Is 2 internships at Google enough? Could anyone provide me with any other perspective?

On the other hand, I work 60 hours a week or more, the environment is competitive and there are a lot of office politics I don't like.

So a friend let me know about a Junior web dev job posting outside of the company she works for, for when I'm done with my web technology certificate this semester that would seem like a good place to be.

These things started to appear when I became lonely, I moved places twice and now I have no friends whatsoever. 

This landed me in a ditch, my school won't take me back until I meet a psychiatrist. My parents have suspicions that I'm lying while some other ones believe that I'm faking it. 

I feel betrayed, all the school staff was trying to was keep me in one spot, squeezing information out, and try to ""help"" But it didn't. Those bastards poked my heart and took advantage of me. I hate them.

My family know owes over 3,000$ to a behavioral health service (outside of our insurance, that school called and made us choose), which is putting us all in a tough financial situation. Everyone is anxious and those who aren't are only calm around me because they think I'm bullshitting. 

My sister is making remarks, calling me ""pretend Ted Bundy"" and ""fake psycho"" My aunt thinks I'm being extra and trying to get attention. My mom is going to send me away from home whenever, by getting me a internship and sending me away for summer to my uncle (I love him and his family, just upset as for the reason for why) My father wants to always keep an eye on me, monitoring me constantly and won't let me close my door, even halfway.

They keep telling me that if I get a diagnosis or seen as ""unfit"" and a threat to society my life will become hell (which I don't doubt) at the cost for treatment I will be stunned for the rest of time. I don't know what to do. 

My life is already hell, and it seems either way I go it will be even more hell. One side is living my life without treatment and praying that it'll go away and the other is becoming a drug addict who dies on a bench because the system dropped me. 

If I'm honest, the best option seems to be suicide. I don't give a fuck anymore."

q2cakz,1,2021-10-05,Work At a unicorn company or pursue masters degree,andraz2012,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/q2cakz/work_at_a_unicorn_company_or_pursue_masters_degree/,"I am 23 year old guy with a bachelor's degree in computer science. The master's degree is free in my country, so it doesn't cost me anything to get it (besides busting my ass for two years).

BUT, I just got a job (more like a summer internship) in a unicorn company. That comes with all the benefits you'd expect. The best equipment, free lunches, masaages, amazing team buildings, great mentourship and so on. I am thoroughy enjoying myself and they're very impressed by my work ethic and my experience. My boss asked me to actually get emplyed there because I'm doing so well. I declined, saying that I'll pursue my masters degree. They said that I could work as much or little as I wanted during my masters, but it would not count as being employed, but continue only this internship status.

The problem here is that they're ""fine"" with with me working 20 hours per week, but I believe they are not thrilled. I will also not get any stock options in this time, and I am quite sure that the company will IPO within the next year to year and a half, which completely eliminates that. 

The thing is that I don't think I want to get my master's. I feel like I should get it, but I am not too thrilled. The thing is also that this is a unique opportunity because this is not silicon valley, it's a small country in eastern Europe and companies like this one don't just pop up every year. 

I don't know how to figure out what to do. I don't know what extra benefits will masters degree bring me or really how to quantify it. I know a few people that went back to school after a few years of working to get their masters just because they couldn't advance into positions without it. But I also know that I will get a sizable chunk of cash which I will invest and grow over time if I actually get emplyed here. I want to get into product management within at most 10 years."
q2d0d2,8,2021-10-06,"So, I'm pretty sure I took a step in the wrong direction after one month at a new job.",butcanitlinux,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/q2d0d2/so_im_pretty_sure_i_took_a_step_in_the_wrong/,"I got my Bachelor's in IT last year right at the start of Big Rona going around. Since there was no way of telling where the job market would go, I picked the first job that became available which was an offer from an internship that I had been working for a year at that point.

It was fine, a little low paying (40k) but covered base necessities. It took some badgering, but I managed to get some experience with some Dell SonicWalls, Active Directory user management, and Office 365 Administration. Unfortunately this was all done roughly one day every other week when you add the time up and I'd spend most of my days working on a mass production side project for the company or setting up new computers for clients (I gotta keep details light cause it'd be pretty easy to out me if I go further into it).

I found out once that side project was done this August there was nothing else lined up for me and they were wanting to downsize me, so I went to look for other jobs. I found a privacy company in the area that offered an elevated support role for 60k so I took it. I had about six months in help desk experience from another internship prior to the one that gave me a full time offer. Come to find out its an L1 help desk position where I'm answering emails 10 hours a day Monday through Friday (plus time on weekends) with weak product documentation and a non-collaborative product team. One example is I got scolded for not knowing about some unrelated company only software when I asked about a client need for something they can use to prevent unnecessary support requests. They just heard a key word and shooed me off.

I'm having a hard time deciding if I need to get out while I can because I'm already a month into this and it'll be hard to convince whoever is interviewing me about why I'm leaving after a month or with a month gap if I decide to leave this current job off my resume. So this leaves me asking those here with more experience in the industry is there any advice on where I should go from here? I'm happy to answer any questions in comments and DMs.

TLDR, I got rushed into finding another job and may have accidentally went a step backwards in my career path. Any advice on how to unscrew this pig?"

q2dgnu,1,2021-10-06,Would completely sacrificing my personal life temporarily for this first full-time job be worth it?,BakedNuggetsx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q2dgnu/would_completely_sacrificing_my_personal_life/,"  

A few months ago, I was blessed with being given an offer to work for a large, well-known tech company which I gladly accepted as my first full-time job straight out of college. Before I started working this job, my only past “professional” work experience has only been working in one shitty short-lived internship back when I was a freshman in college. I never would have thought that this kind of luck was ever going to come my way, but now that it has, everything about my life has dramatically changed. New location, new people, financial freedom, and the confidence that this new company name on my resume being the ticket to experience higher career paths. 

I’m slowly inching towards the six month mark on the job and while my work performance (as dictated by internal performance metrics) has been good, I feel like I’ve been doing terrible for the past few weeks which is fueling my worst anxieties about the path ahead. 

I’d like to mention that this specific position I’m in is, while technical, is still within the realm of customer service where I directly interact and provide support to many different customers across the board. Organizational-wise, I’m a grunt on the front lines taking the full brunt of customer conundrums. Given how unique essentially every problem I deal with is, I feel like I can’t hardly make any progress when it comes to improving my work skills and I still feel like my current skills are crappy compared to my colleagues hired at the same time I was. 

I’m absolutely afraid of the possibility of being let go too soon due to low performance. Should this happen I don’t know what the hell I’d honestly do, but it would be beyond devastating given everything I have now. I need to survive a year. At least one year to show for to ensure the security of my career ahead. Otherwise, I will practically wind up in square one again with yet a larger empty chasm in my career timeline. 

The cross-road I feel ahead of me is that I either choose to be better which would entail forfeiting virtually all my personal time studying up on everything relevant to my job function and materials supportive of such, or choose to just continue doing the same jam as usually. (Essentially twiddle my thumbs and just hope odd and ends meet). 

If I was someone who already had a few jobs behind me, things would be completely different. Given that this is the only thing that can make or break everything however, I have a creeping feeling that taking such a sacrifice my well be warranted."

Essays: I tried to talk about my most important hooks/dedications in my essays, which were about my identity as a firstgen Cuban American, my passion for Music and Latin American History, and indirectly mentioned my most important ECs (i care about them a lot; theyre really a huge part of who i am). i think i told a pretty solid story through my writing. i tried to incorporate as many unique perspectives as i can without sounding plastic or self absorbed. (i dont think i did). i think i was genuine, and didnt try to act like someone i wasnt. 

LORs: AP Research Teacher (known them for 2 years), AP Lit Teacher (known for 2 years as well). I love these teachers so much, and I think they know me very well. As for the counselor, they met me fairly recently but i think that they know me well enough now.

Additional Information
I had a major surgery, which affected my 2018-2020 school years very significantly, since I developed mental health issues as well as a result. I spoke about this in my Additional Info to point out why there was a disparity my sophomore year in comparison to my junior year in the quality of my work. If anything, I am worried that my math will bring me down for some reason. I am also super proud of my research paper; I wrote about democratic deliberation in the U.S., more specifically about reasons why people might change their minds regarding who to vote for in the 2020 presidential election, so i submitted that too. i dont think it will hurt me.

Intended Major: Latin American Studies or History and a minor in some sort of Music degree

For the Questbridge Match, I would only rank Stanford University, but am planning to apply to Columbia, Yale, UPenn, USC, and some other schools through Questbridge regular decision.

On common app im applying to UF, FSU, UCF,  FIU, etc. (and harvard LOL)

I’m applying to UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and another UC i forgot i just had a fee waiver for 4 schools

Im worried about my SAT, and everyone tells me not to worry but I can’t help but worry. The rest of my scores aren’t exceptional; they simply pass a certain alleged “threshold” that these schools look for. I like my reading score, its smack in the middle of the 50th percentile of accepted students at Stanford, but my math is way below that. ive seen regular non legacy title 1 high school students get in with lower SAT scores than me and similar backgrounds, but i dont want to risk it. im just open to hear different perspectives!"

I was put on a team with really cool people and had great managers during my internship. I received a return offer to join the team I was on before. The pay is really good for an entry-level position, but not FAANG level or anything crazy.

However, I'm really nervous about getting pigeonholed and working on older systems that won't help me advance as an engineer. I've heard the stories from this sub that you get locked into defense and can't escape.

So I guess my question goes out to the people, that got out of defense contracting. How did you do it? What were key things you did that helped you market yourself for private-sector jobs?

The other will pay me less, it's farther from home, but will be a lot more stimulating and in line with my studies. 



So, in June I started a 6 month internship in a pretry big company. The plan was to do it and then, after completing it, around first week of December, concentrate on my studies.

It is a nice environment and I can manage my time how I want, meaning that I can dedicate some time to studying. I have a good paycheck (700€ a mont) and it takes me only 20/25 minutes to get to work. The downside is that I don't really like the job here, it's a constant mess and it would take me a couple of years to completely understand everything. But more importantly it's not what I want to do in my life and I really don't feel stimulated.

Some week ago I did two interviews for another internship and they decided to take me, so I accepted the offer and I should start in December. The work should be more interesting and in line with what I'm studying, and I think it could give me great growth opportunities. The ""problem"" is that it will be much more challenging. They will also pay less (500€ a month) and it will take me 40/45 minutes to get there.

Today I was going to ask my current employer to end the internship some week in advance, but before I was able to do it, they offered me to extend my internship of other 6 months, with a litte pay increase.

In both cases if I work well they will keep me also after the internship.

Now I really don't know what to do, a part of me wants to try a new adventure. I'm 24 and, since I havo no clue of what I want from life, I want to try as many things as I can. The other part tells me that I should stay here since it's more comfortable, but I don't know if I will be able to grow much.

Please I need help."

Hi, I am in a non-target European school (so I don't even bother applying to bulge brackets companies if you wanted to ask). I had previous experiences in a Finance department at the Headquarter of a big retail company and an experience as a Credit Analyst for the National Investment Bank of my homecountry during COVID-19, but recruiters don't deem those experiences as ""valuable enough"".

Furthermore, as a middle-class, straight, (unattractive) white male, I would never benefit from ""diversity hiring"" or any form of sympathy.

I am into the 3rd year of my 5-year course and right about now, students in my batch will already be doing or looking for internships, while I am struggling to push my relatively average GPA higher than what it is without the 'distractions' of an internship.

Now from my understanding, a person would need a decent amount of knowledge in his/her field (In my case: Comp Science, Coding) to be able to pass interviews and to contribute towards the company/ organization that hires you. I can't really grasp coding at all. I have no hope in hell for back-end coding, but front-end is manageable (HTML and JavaScript to a **certain** extent)

When I go onto my friends' LinkedIn pages, their profile is littered with experience from various companies or clubs due to which I feel the peer pressure of seeing people doing meaningful things to sort out their futures, while I'm heading towards the mentality of, ""I'll decide when I get my degree"" and that has caused panic in me. 

I have no interest in coding, the only reason I learn computer languages at all are to pass my subjects and get a degree, no matter the GPA. What I am interested in is Graphic Designing, Video Editing, Marketing, Media Reach etc. but I feel it is too late to switch fields learn more about these until after I get settled with a job pertaining to my current Comp Science field due to the cost of getting a media degree.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting in the comments here. Just needed a place to vent my frustrations. Is there anyone else who is/has been in this situation before? If so what did you do/ plan to do to get out of this 'slump' (for lack of a better word)?"

q2mtpw,3,2021-10-06,Stanford REA?,CollegeCM324324,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/q2mtpw/stanford_rea/,"**Demographics**

Gender: Male

Race/Ethnicity: Black/African American

Residence: California

Income Bracket: 170k+

Public Feeder School; sends 1-2 kids to Stanford every year.

Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM

**Intended Major(s)**: Computer Engineering

**Academics:**

    GPA (UW/W): 3.96/4.76  
    Rank (or percentile): School does not rank.  
    # of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 5 Honors + 9 APs (This is the most my school allows me to take).  
    Senior Year Course Load: 6 APs 

**Standardized Testing (my main weakness):**

SAT: 1480, right in the 50th percentile; however I think I can superscore it to 1500.

AP/IB: I have two 5s, four 3s, and three 4s. How much of a hindrance is this to my overall chances?

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

**1) Vice President of Health-Based Coalition**

This was a club “founded” by 8 of in conjunction with an actual  non-profit that services health-related issues in my local area (run by  actual adults with full-time employees). In essence, our job was part of  the advocacy campaign for this group and we conducted studies as well  as built personal relationships with 6 city mayors and their council  members.

Of those 6 cities, one of them has passed a health-related ordinance  to our advocacy, while another is currently drafting the language to  implement the restrictions. My job was communication/helping on the  technical side to push the club forward. Can expand more if needed.

**2) Intern at a Defense Company**

Thorugh our school we were given the opportunity to intern at a major  defense company and shadow various engineers in their work. Can’t  elaborate too much on this because of reasons, but it was enjoyable and I  learned a lot about the day-to-day work of an engineer.

Got some group positions that were highly sought after and was the editor for the company’s internal magazine.

**3) Intern at a Chemical Refrigeration/Oil Refinery Company**

Essentially I shadowed and helped engineers on the ground to install  screw compressors at major refineries as well as design them in the  shop.

The internship ended a little early due to the slow down of oil  production with COVID-19, but it was a lot of fun even if it was manual  labor.

**4) Advocacy Foundation/Lobbying**

This also has to be very vague because this could be easily searched  up. However, I was part of a team that went to the state government to  argue (unsuccessfully) for changes to be made to how California’s public  school system is funded, specifically our district.

We met with state senators and state house members as well as  participated in committee hearings to change certain statutes in CA that  were unfairly excluding certain communities for increased funds.

**6) Spoke at State Education’s Association Event (Again Vague)**

I got the opportunity to speak to and connect with several hundred  teachers/students at a conference. Spoke about the related health  advocacy I wrote about in 1) and was awarded an award for the  presentation and work we have been doing.

Answered several hundred questions as well as talked to teacher union  heads, parents as well as was invited to be in another seminar with  other like-minded students who were advocating for certain ideas (didn’t  attend).

**7) MS Banking Internship (No Connections)**

Not going to go too much into this, but really just helping with data analytics.

**8) Science Olympiad Captain - 5 years**

Earned a few medals in my division for regionals. I could list them,  but they are just 1st and 2nd place medals in 10 events (most of them  repeated throughout the 5 years). Never went to state, but it was a fun  thing I never really competed for.

**9) CSF Board Member + NHS Treasuer**

Our school is weird in which the California Scholarship Federation  Board and NHS essentially run all the Honor Societies within the school  (as you can see I am on both). We get more funding and more “power”  essentially than even the ASB and Student President.

**10) Secretary of Junior Classical League/Certamen Events**

Won top 5 in our state at certamen, and got first at regionals. Won  5-7 events 1st places in Latin literature and Classical history. I have  two gold medals for the NLE, but can’t get the scholarship because of  one silver medal in freshman year.

Set up events with historians like Mary Beard and other classical historians.

My job was to log all books and manage finances for the club.

**11) CyberPatriot/CTF Tournaments**

I was put as a CISCO head for our team, we were top 100 nationally three times in a row, and we were top 20 our state once in the past.  Never could get past platinum into the top 12 but it was a bunch of fun.

**12) European Neighbourhood Policy And Enlargement Volunteer**

Some humanitarian volunteering in my parent’s home country. Still  devastated from the war 30 years later . Helped with building  homes/roads, food distribution, etc.

**Awards/Honors**

List all awards and honors submitted on your application.

    NLE, 2 gold medals, one silver.  
    CIF for Cross Country/Won school award/multiple top 5s at meets.  
    State Seal of Biliteracy in Latin
    Defense Company Best Innovative Idea Award (Again, very vague.)  
    National English Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, National Science Honor Society  
    One statewide one relating to 1). 

**Letters of Recommendation**

    AP Physics 1, 2, and maybe C Teacher - Known for two, and probably three years.  
    AP Biology Teacher - Known for 4 years (also Science Olympiad Mentor).  
    Latin Teacher - Known for 4 years. 
    Defense Company Mentor - Known for 1 Summer.  
    Counselor, our school mandates him to write one. 

Not going to rate these considering they haven’t even been written yet and no one, not even I, will be able to see how they turn out.

I just started my internship ... And I am a little bit disappointed. Work mates are nice to me, but I expected much more about the job itself (Support Specialist).

I thought I would be learning cloud, managing new technologys, practicing Scripting skills... And I'm not touching anything tech related so far... 

I worked really hard to make personal proyects, a good LinkedIn and gaining far more knowledge than just the associate degree, and I feel that all I did is just worthless becouse I don't have the opportunity to show off what I learnt.

Right now, I'm worried about my career, becouse despite only having 22 I feel like I wasted so much time and efforts, I am thinking about learning about backend and try to find a development job since all system/operations jobs are either Support/Helpdesk or DevOps with a lot of years of experience.

I am also thinking on saving some money and get a CS Bachelors Degree but I need money to pay the bills

q2rlko,14,2021-10-06,Microsoft Internship vs. Amazon Internship,MrRubberDucky,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q2rlko/microsoft_internship_vs_amazon_internship/," Just received offer from Microsoft:  
$6,226 per month + $7000 housing stipend

Amazon Return Offer:  
$8,550 a month + $ 1,500 a month housing stipend

I interned at Amazon last Summer, but I really didnt have a great experience on my team and would have to stay with that team again for this internship so I'm heavily leaning towards Microsoft even though the pay is lower.

But, is this pay normal for Microsoft interns? Other offer I've read online is $7k+ per month. What's up with my offer and why does it seem lower?"
q2rqo6,7,2021-10-06,About to graduate with no above support or CS internships. Is it too late now for me?,nikeybellic12,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/q2rqo6/about_to_graduate_with_no_above_support_or_cs/," 

As  some of you may know, I'm currently in my final year of uni as a CS  major. I declared it during my junior year(last year) so right now, I'm  just taking the required CS courses. I don't have any crazy projects  other than my VirtualBox homelab and a budget app I made in Java. I  realized that I want to work in IT because it is more hands-on as  opposed to just mindlessly coding.

I'm  currently interning at IPG as a desktop analyst(basically desktop  support). My tasks are mostly doing tech support remotely, imaging and  configuring laptops for new hires, backing up laptops onto the server,  and using AD to manage users, computers, and updating group policies. I  also manage an outlook backup project where I'm tasked with updating a  list of users' outlook PST files onto the online archive. I've  incorporated some scripting to make my job easier by using PowerShell to  automate Windows updates as well as the programs the company requires  to be on user machines.  I like it but I don't see myself staying here  forever. My plan is to move into sys admin or network positions so I can  build a solid foundation to eventually go into cybersecurity. I'm also  currently studying for my security+ if that helps.

I'm  in the process of applying for other internships that I can possibly do  during the summer after graduation but I noticed that many  IT  internships are either help desk or desktop support. And for some  reason, a lot of cybersecurity internships I see require experience  which boggles my mind. Also, because I declared my major as CS late, I  haven't taken the time to understand a lot of development  infrastructures like git, github, or react.

I  wanted to know how fucked am I? Should I spend another couple of years  in desktop support positions to ""pay my dues"" or should I just give up  IT all together and go into software development?"

Hi, I'm currently in the proccess of finding a good uni to study computer science, my two options are Saarland university in Germany or University of Cairo in Egypt, each with its pros and cons.

for Egypt, i can start in one year, which means I'll finish early, and be able to find a job faster, but its also not that good of a university (around 550 in world rankings), as well as internships are non-existent in Egypt. It is also cheaper, and more guaranteed than germany.

for germany, it's obviously one of the best economies in the world, and I think I'll be able to find internships there easily, but its more expensive, and I'll have to start in 2 years, and i'll have to talk much more subjects (I study IGCSEs) than egypt.

what do you think I should do?

I have 0 internship experience becuase my summers were spent at the same job I am at right now as it was the only way for me to afford my schooling.

I feel as if being at the same job (Chick-fil-A) for 9 years is detrimental to my image. The job also has inconsistent hours so it is hard for me to utilize my free time to better myself at home. I have a hard time staying focused and finding inspiration. 

It is extremely demoralizing applying over and over again to jobs only to never hear back or be rejected."

I am currently a third year undergraduate studying Data Science. I plan to apply to the program right before my graduation (June 2023), hence I can start the semester on Fall 2023.

I was wondering if I can get any insights/advices on how to prepare for the application. Most of my undergraduate courses are centered around Computer Science, and I have done few personal project as well as class group projects. In addition, I am currently applying for my first SWE internship for Summer 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in possibly pursuing a career in either the tech field, human resources, or public relations.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for reference, I'll give you a little background info on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have both an associate's and a bachelor's degree in English (one in writing &amp; literature, the other in creative writing).

&amp;#x200B;

I have also taken basic coding classes in HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript at my local public library.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done an internship (from April-July of this year, 2021) as an Administrative Assistant for hospital Operations for the housekeeping department of my local hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite interested in all three as a possible career choice, but the one that strikes me the most is a career in the tech field. The only problem is that I have no experience in this particular field outside of the classes I took. And its been a year since I took the 2nd class in JavaScript and I feel like I never grasp the concept of coding w/ JavaScript as a whole, which then made me feel how would I ever land a job in the tech field if I felt I couldn't learn and retain information on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I just feel like I need help finding a career path that I'm interested in and want to pursue."

q2t70w,1,2021-10-06,"Went to college, haven't been able to use my degrees, but tired of being a server. What should I do now?",peachtartx,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/q2t70w/went_to_college_havent_been_able_to_use_my/,"Hi there! So I (25F) graduated with two Bachelors' degrees- one in Communication Studies, with a concentration in Public Relations, and one in Media Arts &amp; Design, with a concentration in Digital Video &amp; Cinema. I graduated cum laude, had an internship in publicity in Los Angeles, and I was a founding member of a student-run PR firm on campus, that was incredibly competitive to join.

I graduated back in December of 2018, was stuck living with my parents in a very rural area with no real job opportunities, and moved to my current city in November of 2019 to get back my independence and start my career. Of course, in the process of looking for work outside of being a waitress, COVID hit- which has still majorly caused problems for me. I don't make as much money as a server now, because people are still scared of going out to eat, and the people who do go out to eat usually don't tip me or treat me as well as I was used to. I've consistently had to ask my parents for help financially since I left my old restaurant. I cannot go back there, however, because the GM was very abusive to the staff, and my former roommate (who I do not get along with anymore) still works there. I really don't want to just go to yet another restaurant though. I'm getting tired of cleaning up after people and making basically no money. Last week, I had to clean maggots out of a men's room trash can, and it was honestly a little humiliating. I'm no spoiled brat- my parents made me do chores and I had to work my way through college. But it was literally foul, and made me question what the hell I even went to school for, when it didn't protect me from having to do nasty shit like that for like $3/hr.

Despite COVID, I've spent a good amount of time applying for PR jobs, whether they be internships or entry-level things. I've tried local jobs, I've tried remote jobs- you name it. I've gotten very close to getting some of these positions, being told I'm very talented, but then I end up losing out to someone just a \*little\* more qualified in some way or other.

At this point I know I don't want to keep serving, I've done it on and off since I was 19, and I just don't have the patience to deal with people in that capacity for much longer. I've considered maybe being a receptionist- as some of the positions around me are about $14-15/hr, full time, and have benefits. I don't know if it's literally too late for me to do PR at this point, because I'm too far out of school. I liked the idea of doing PR well enough, but it's not like it was my dream. If it's too late, I guess that's fine. 

What I honestly want to do is start a gaming channel on YouTube and see how that goes, but I need to clearly have some sort of stable income before I can consider investing time and energy into that. I do have the knowledge necessary to promote myself and I have the video and graphic skills necessary to do it- it's just that I know it's very competitive. It seems like literally everything I try to do is super competitive though.

What can I really do to improve my situation?"

I am above above average student in above good textbook college in developing nation(India). I have had 2 internships and couple more interview lined up. I will most certainly get above average job through college placement itself. Or I will get good enough job on my own. I started studying this year only(Just had fun last 2 years). I kid you not I learned what is a debugger in my 5th semester. I am good enough programmer now. But I dont want to be good enough I want to be exellent.
I want to start my first job with exellent position. I don't care about position or tech or role or company. What I care about is I dont want to be average anymore. 
I can't tell my self the correct path. Only future me can somewhat correctly guide me. So assume you are talking to your past where you were like me. Please dont give generic answer like do LC, do DS&amp;A, I am tired of these answers. 
So what do I know.
C, C++, JS (I use these in LC).
Python(Just learned and made project with.)
Java(college course: I don't remeber anything).
Othere tech like genric college graduate skill set.
Now you have at least base idea of my current state. So what's next?
What should I do that don't make me regret later in life. I want to look back and think..""man this was exellent path you took in you last semester.""."

More details:  
One of the main problems is that I'm in Central America (Guatemala), so I'm a little limited.   
I was searching for something where I could experiment and and solve problems.   
My knowledge is mostly focused on data science, but I feel like its too boring.   
I also know a lot of web development, mostly using python as backend.  
My experience on other things is not much.

I am final year cs graduate student.
I made a post https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q2tjha/the_way_i_should_have_done_that/ and @_atomfinger_  suggested that if I have a question list I make it another post.
Here are my questions.

1. Which CS Job pays highest?
2. Is the devs at FAANG which get literally thriple pay then average dev are thrice better then average dev?
3. Why do a c++ SWE intern role requires me to have understanding of database?
4. Why do these job posting have gazillion requirements for minimum pay when obiously a single dev will never do that much alone.
5. Why do senior dev make fun of students when they ask stupid question like which role pays best, as if they themselves didn't join this profession because by how much the dev market pays.
6. When will I be considered good at DSA? Every company and persons seems to have different threshold. For a profession so absolute as 10, people give very vague answers.
7. How can my teachers who never joined any major company can help hundered of student to land a job at good company.
8. In this subreddit people say most job profile post are irrelevent and job task matter as many job overlap. But please can somebody experienced, point me to a resource where everyting is compiled so inexperienced student like me get to know about different jobs.
9. Why do people say don't get tangled in hyped buzz words, how do I am expected to learn new thing?
10. Why do senior dev say time and again that master 1 language or tech and thats good enough, but most companies require to know some couple languages and tech to even begin applying.
11. Isn't intern means someone who company is going to be teaching, so why the heck are these intern process so so hard for unpaid internships. Since when being good enough is not good enough?
12. Why is there no guide titled ""the guide to getting in FAANG"".
13. Why does my interviewer ask if I have ever organized any events for a lower than minimum pay job?
14. Why do dev who complain about how broken the interview system is implement the same interview process/format when intervieing new grads.
Please answer these question if you can.
Most of my questions might sound hilariously abovious to you or very easy to understand. I genuinely want to know."

q2w9yv,70,2021-10-06,Finally got an internship thanks to you guys,5yearpastdue-alt,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q2w9yv/finally_got_an_internship_thanks_to_you_guys/,"I got an offer yesterday from Amazon for summer 2022 SDE intern with no prior internship experience, albeit I had a few research experiences and was a Google SPS participant this past summer. This subreddit made navigating the entire process so much easier and gave me the tools to the best that I absolutely could in both of my OAs and my technical interview.

I spent 6 months trying to get internships (about 200 applications) for this previous summer and had nothing to show for it except for one interview which I failed. After doing some research over the summer I found this subreddit and used all of the resources available here to try and fix the issues I had at the beginning of the year. At the end of July I updated my resume and applied to around 150 places. Of these I got about 20 OAs resulting in interviews with Toyota, Asana, and Amazon with interviews in the future with Okta and Walmart.

I don't go to a fancy school by any means. It is barely in the top 200 colleges in the US and has a CS department of less than 500 students. I transferred here from a community college just over a year ago and it blows my mind to think how quickly things accelerated from there. I actually started as a chemistry major at my prior college and changed majors only knowing basic C++.

The leetcode grind actually wasn't all that bad for me. I did 6 mock interviews during SPS (that was the most we were allowed to do) and combined with help from my mentor I felt very prepared in all areas except for actually solving problems. I did a few leetcode problems a day for fun and I slowly started to develop the skills required to regularly pass all OA test cases. After 2 weeks something just clicked in my head and I was able to do most mediums without any help. I focused more on understanding the underlying concepts than solving a ton of problems mindlessly which helped me a lot when my Amazon interviewer asked me for different ways to solve the given problem (ended up solving it 4 different ways).

So thank you all for your help. The openness of everyone on this subreddit to discuss the interview process and various other aspects makes this place a great resource for both myself and tons of others."

Two 4-month internships at a medium big-name company, recently IPO'd in very lame roles (QA, and SDET). Currently in a 4-month internship as a developer at a no-name systems company doing very interesting work absolutely loving it. (GPA-3.75)

Looking forward, I must find internship work to cover both the spring and summer sessions. I recently signed an offer with a large bank in Canada for an 8-month developer position. (Remote, $26/hour)

The question on my mind is should I be pushing myself to secure a better offer? My strategy at the moment is to apply with minimal effort, but I can tell I have almost no heart in it. 

Pros to continuing applying with vigour: 
* Recently got an 846 on CodeSignal. This might be helpful when applying. 
* This is my last opportunity to do internships before I apply for new-grad roles after graduation. 
* I'm desperate to optimize my salary when I exit university. I also would prefer to work for a software company than a bank. 

Cons to continuing applying withing:
* I feel burnt out and my monkey brain says to stop worrying about it. 
* I would have to renege my agreed-upon offer. I haven't signed a contract yet, but I am expecting it to arrive in a couple of days. I have not and have no plan to update my internship coordinator until I am forced to. 
* If I interviewed and accepted a role for either summer or spring; I would be gambling on my ability to secure another internship that would fill the remaining semester. A potential workaround would be to hold on to my 8-month offer and a hypothetical 4-month offer and renege whichever I am required to drop."

q31lnt,1,2021-10-07,triggering dr. visit?,kirkemp,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/q31lnt/triggering_dr_visit/,"
I (23F) want to start by saying I have been through some traumatic things. There are things I do not remember from the ages 12-18ish. I went to therapy during those ages, saw psychiatrists, took medication, and stayed in an inpatient behavioral hospital. I remember there being a pattern with these treatments. I would be diagnosed, put on medication, and one day - I would simply just stop. The therapy would make me remember awful things and the medication never helped I think. I got a diagnosis once at 17 and my mom refused to believe the diagnosis. The discharge employee told my mom that the diagnosis was used so it could be billed to my insurance. I always figured that was the truth, that at my diagnoses was a less serious mental illness. 

At 19, I experienced an all around abusive relationship that really changed me. I self medicated for about a year or two. Made awful decisions, didn’t take care of myself, and nothing at that point felt real. Somehow I managed to graduate college with a pretty good GPA, an internship, managed a business, and all the things. I knew I was fucking sad. I knew it deep down, I just could not let myself be that 16 year old again. I received praise from my parents and family because I could handle everything in life. I was always told I couldn’t have a certain diagnosis because of how well put together I seemed, the good grades, the work ethic. 

I continued to make pretty poor decisions during 21-22. Decisions I really look back on and see as some kind of cry for help, trauma response, self harm, etc. I met my boyfriend about 8 months before my 23 and stopped making those decisions. I love my boyfriend, but being with him fully is really hard. We talk, he knows about things, and is supportive. It’s just.. sometimes our situations &amp; things we talk about force me to accept and face my trauma head on. Only problem is that he is not a doctor, he is not a mental health professional. I know this so I spare him the details about how I really feel and what I am thinking, these fucked up thoughts. 

So at 23, I have just graduated college, got a new job, working on moving closer to said job, and in a loving relationship. A week after I graduated, my dog was diagnosed with cancer. 1-4 months to live. I’ve had her for 4 years and she genuinely made getting through working/college possible. I had to take care of her, she was my reason to get things done. I have not felt the same since I found out. I had recently gotten a cat as well, who loves my dog. My heart is breaking for her, my boyfriend, myself, and my sweet dog.

About a week ago, I began getting these migraines &amp; neck pains. Throwing up i was so nauseous from the pain. My muscles were so tight and sore, I could hardly move. My coworkers convinced me to go to more than an urgent care, because the urgent care doctor didn’t do much for me. So I went. For the first time. In a very long time, i went to the doctor. I regularly see gynecologist for endometriosis &amp; pcos. Other than that, I am a frequent flyer at the urgent area. Doctors makes me pretty anxious.

So I go to my appointment for neck pain and migraines. I answer the routine questions about depression and anxiety diagnosis. Yes to both. I did not linger, i did not tell him anything about my past or my current situation. He came to the conclusion that my migraines and pain were from depression. Ofcourse he is doing blood work and he checked me out, xrayed my back. But still depression was the diagnosis.
I felt 17 again, stuck in this doctor’s office. He kept asking my is I wanted to “go to the hospital” without me even mentioning having been in an inpatient behavioral hospital. I cried and cried throughout the appointment. Has this ever happened to anyone? I’ve fought this for so long and I feel like the universe is giving me the weirdest push. He prescribed me medication I haven’t touched since I got it. I have a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow. I am so nervous. But at the same time, I feel calmly ready. I want to get better, I know I’ve been putting this off for too long. I need real help &amp; I deserve/owe myself to put in the effort also. 
I am so emotional since the doctors appointment, I have been picking fights, crying, not eating well. I feel fucking insane. 

I am hopeful about tomorrow and terrified at the same time. I hope something starts to make sense. Part of me wishes that the blood work would say i have hyperthyroidism &amp; the psychiatrist find nothing wrong with me - I just feel like that is not the case here.

Thank you for letting me vent. I’m a shit show over here. I feel so alone. I tried to describe it to my boyfriend - the “girlfriend” me is happy &amp; the “individual human” me is not. I love my life. But it is hard to live right now.

If any of this sounds familiar, please don’t hesitate to reach out. The doctors visit was fucking traumatic and I’m still trying to wrap my brain around it. If not, thanks for reading my rant."

I have a low GPA of 1.99 in game design. Reason why i got this “cui max” GPA is because of my immaturity during my poly days and i do not have much interest in programming and also very bad at presentation and communication. (RP)

During my time in NS, i realised that i do not have much choices after ORD. I would had sign on if i am physically fit. 

Right now, i am considering taking programming related courses like computer science in SIT. I feel like if i put in much effort in my studies unlike during my poly days, i would actually be able to do well in programming. I kinda like maths too during my sec school days. 

Another reason, why i chose to take programming related courses is because i feel that it is easier to enter the course as i have a bit of programming background in poly although i mostly do art and i only did well in that part. But as time passes, i started to loose interest in drawing, and also felt that my drawings and designs were not good for the industry level. I am a graphic designer during my intern btw.

I just want to enter a private uni instead of searching for a job. It is almost impossible to get a job without a decent portfolio or resume. 

I am afraid that if i’m shortlisted for the uni, how am i going to answer their interview questions, like what am i going to show them if i have nothing to show?
Am i going to just tell them that i want to join this course because i felt that i have a higher chance at entering this course due to my poly course? Like i’m so confuse right now. 

I would really appreciate it if you guys can give my some advice. Thank you very much."

BTech in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay (Indias premier engineering college)

CGPA: 8.87/10

Multiple projects in Computer Architecture with a paper to be submitted in a conference

1 internship at Qualcomm as a Hardware Engineer and currently working at another company as an Embedded Systems Engineer


Description:

I would like to pursue a Masters degree with specialization in Computer Architecture. However, this field has a confusing parent department: it comes under both EE and CSE and ECE(If this dept exists)

I am not sure which department to apply to

1. If I apply in EE, there chances of being rejected if the dept does not have Computer Arch as a specialization category

2. If I apply in CSE, I am unsure if my application would stand any chance competiting with those with an ML background


I wanted to know if any of you have been in a similar situation or if you know how I can go about with making this decision. I am wishing to apply to reputed institutes like Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, etc which have EE and CSE depts. In moderate categories, like Wisconsin, the choice of ECE is easy"

q39zym,22,2021-10-07,This is how I personally became antiwork,throwaway31096,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q39zym/this_is_how_i_personally_became_antiwork/,"This is primarily gonna be a personal rant but I just felt the need to get this off my chest this morning, so I apologize if this isn't exactly the right place to post this.

I am a 25 year old male born in the US, child of Korean immigrants. Like most Asian parents, my parents were very hard on me about academics, to an extreme I would say. I would get hit and yelled at if my grades were anything below a B, and even when I got Bs I was told that I had to do better. I had constant anxiety and depression as a child over my grades, worried that I was gonna get punished when I got home. My mom would always tell me that if my grades were good enough that I could go to Korea over the summer and visit my extended family, keep in mind I literally haven't been back since I was 5. The one and only time I got straights As, my mom said ""Oh good, now you can start SAT prep! What? No you're not going to Korea, you have to study for the SAT."" This has really stuck with me all these years because it showed me that my best no matter what, even when I literally got the best possibly outcome, still did not matter. All it got me was more work and stress.

Flash forward to college, I'm pursuing a degree in communications &amp; marketing, thinking that it was a relevant degree and that there were plenty of jobs in the field. I worked hard and got good grades. Meanwhile I had classmates who were student athletes and couldn't be bothered to show up to class half the time, and I had to carry a group project. I got an internship at a marketing company and worked hard, I even got paid a wage and gained leadership experience. Meanwhile I had a friend who bragged about watching anime on his laptop most of the time during his unpaid internship. What stuck with me was how these people I mentioned were basically rewarded for their laziness. The student athletes got scholarships to pay for their education that put little to no effort into. My friend who's only internship was an unpaid unproductive one somehow managed to get a good job at a big name company less than a year after graduation.

Meanwhile, I couldn't even get another internship my senior year despite already having internship experience. I got told ""we wanted to give someone without any internship experience a chance"" and ""with your experience I have no doubt you won't have any trouble finding something"". Well guess what, in the two years since graduation I haven't been able to get anything more than a handful of interviews, all of which ended with a ghosting. I tried everything, I got my resume and cover letter professionally looked over, networked with people I know, everything. I even worked with a third party recruiter who told me I should focus on getting another internship instead. Too bad every internship in my area doesn't consider you unless you're currently enrolled in school. Said recruiter than promptly ghosted me. Apparently the already strong internship experience I have doesn't mean squat to any of the employers I've applied to.

On a brighter note, I am currently in a job that I actually do love. It has nothing to do with my education, nor does it pay a whole lot, but I can survive fine and at least I enjoy the job. Here's the thing though, I only got the job because I lied. I said I had way more experience in the job than I actually did, but this is what ultimately made them hire me on the spot after the interview.

I was in a really deep depression when I was job hunting, and thankfully I'm in a better place now and doing much better. Still though, I can't help but look back and feel bitter about all the things I went through as described. Bitter about how hard work often doesn't matter. Bitter about how bullshit and unfair the job market is. And bitter how I'm only in the position I am now through luck and lying. This is how I personally became antiwork.

Edit: Also, when I graduated I went back to my old internship seeing if they were hiring. They told me they outsourced my old responsibilities and are currently downsizing, but they said they'd keep recommending me. So much that's done for me."

So I have been applying to interviews and studying. I started full time a year and a half ago and had an internship that lasted ~6 months before that. I’ve been applying to a lot of junior positions at different companies (startups/“big N”/mid-sized, etc.) 

A little background about my experience: I’ve done infrastructure work (working with aws, terraform, containers all that good stuff) for about a year and back end work (primarily Java/spring framework) for the ongoing duration. I am relatively happy with my current job as workload isn’t too bad. But it can get inconsistent very easily and pay wise is below average (according to what I researched online).

When applying to jobs it feels like I am under qualified for jr positions requiring 2+ years of experience. I also don’t seem to fit into the category of entry level anymore as I’ve been more working for more than a year. However given that I did receive a few phone interviews.

I’ve had a few phone interviews with a mix of companies (startups/corporations) but they majority seem to shy away after learning about my experience. Could I be doing something wrong?

Overall is it still too early for me to pursue a different job elsewhere? Do I lack experience to be fully classified as a junior? Or am I just overthinking things and some things are unlucky?"

So I was privileged enough to keep going to college and take summer classes through Covid, and join a computational chemistry lab for my online year. I also took everything for a grade, and did good enough for my standards.

I would simply not mention any of this, except I do want to show that because of my efforts (lots of stress from online classes, lots of self teaching, and had classmates who messed up curves by cheating.....ugh), I managed to free up my senior fall semester for full time research, so I applied for coops. In the end, my summer internship simply hired me on as a temporary full time lab worker, and I'm continuing my research project. I feel that because of this extended full time experience, I'm really learning a lot, and I want to show that in my application. Like I own my project, I plan and run my experiments, I do analysis, I propose ideas...this are all things I could not do before.

I really have strong feelings against my undergrad at this point, because I've never really been supported there despite how much I tried to get research experience, since there was no undergrad chem research support really. I've worked with two PIs at my school, and both were nice and have written good letters for me, which is a blessing, but my school itself is a mess for chemistry. I really just have a lot of weird emotions looking back. I really dislike my undergrad peers after this online semester. I burnt myself out pretty badly (also I'm ASD lol). I still have to return to finish two classes and graduate. I really don't want to. I'm really much happier at my internship. It made me really love research (and that's definitely not because things went well always lmao).

But I digress really. All I want right now is to be able to acknowledge my efforts during Covid on my applications. I don't know how to show my coursework rigor (gpa isn't enough since everyone else simply pass/no passed their classes) nor my research experience right now. I'll sound like an asshole in my application if I tell them ""You see I didn't pass no pass anything? I'm a ""good"" student.

I'm a freshman and came into college with no idea what I wanted to do. Now, I'm considering pursuing CS. Is it possible to do so with no prior experience if I start to take prereqs my second semester. I'd be starting with Calc 1 but I have 30ish credits that might help with distribution requirements from APs in high school. This semester I took econ, intro to public health, bio lab, eng 125 (fywr). Would it be possible for me to pursue this major and be competitive for internships or am I already too far behind? It seems like everyone doing CS has been coding since the 5th grade. Also, does LSA vs. COE matter for recruiting and job prospects?

I'm also considering attempting a transfer to Ross so if you have any advice there too it'd be super helpful.

q3h43e,3,2021-10-07,Should I go for becoming a vet?,AnySet1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/q3h43e/should_i_go_for_becoming_a_vet/,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear some opinions from you guys on a matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I  am 24 years old male from germany and always wanted to become a vet.  After working something else for a while, I finally took some courage and am now having an internship this week at a veterinarian office. So far I really enjoyed staying there, but I am not sure if I should really go for it.

So the first half of the day I am outside with a vet treating farm animals and I am really happy with it. I enjoy being outside, I love being able  to meet many different people at their homes and I also like when I can  do some physical work. I am also really surprised that I am not  disgusted by animals peeing or shitting and I had no problems with  things like putting my arm into a cow's butt, so therefore I think I  would fit really well. We also had to put a cow to sleep who couldn't  stand up anymore and was injured and sick, but I took that one  relatively well I guess.

The second half of the day I am inside and watch the treatment of pets. There are mostly cats and dogs there (which I love) but I don't see as  much ""action"" as outside with the farm animals. Sometimes the people  really feel hard for their pets and I kinda feel with them. Today  something happened which made me cry at home: we had to put down a  really really small kitten (which was only 4 weeks old) which was not  only blind but couldn't relieve itself on its own. So the only options were to  put it down or to operate (which would have been really risky). The vet  was really sure it was the best for the kitten since it already  suffered from not being able to relieve itself. Afterwards he told me  that those are the hard things of the job, but the he is also happy  since in a way he ""helped"". Also he said that his medical side would  have been interested in dissecting the kitten since that was not  something you saw everyday.

On  one hand I knew that the kitten probably wouldn't have a nice life with  being blind and sick already at that age and that it was the most  ""human"" thing to put it down. I kinda thought that to myself before. But  on the other hand it broke my heart when I heared he wants to put it to  sleep and I really had to hold back my tears as the little thing cried  the last few times before drifting away, while the owner went outside  and also had to fight his tears. Now I am kinda doubting myself if I am  not too sentimental for being a vet. I think I can deal with the whole  farm animal stuff, since I kinda can look at the situation more  objectively but seeing a little cat or dog suffer just breaks my heart.

So I just wanted to ask, do you guys think I should still go for becoming a vet (since most of the  work was fun for me so far) or do you think that as a person with really  strong empathy I will just break myself seeing things like death and injury?"

• Must have at least one additional quarter/semester of school remaining following the completion of the internship*
• One year of programming experience in an object-oriented language.
• Ability to demonstrate an understanding of computer science fundamentals, including data structures and algorithms.

I have been doing leetcode for 3 months now and I'm working on a game as a side project and yet I couldn't pass the first stage also.

Now comes the consequences, she is on a really specific field that she does not like that much (and the company she is working for her last internship could hire her when she is done) but she feels void, she feels like she is not in the right place. We could discuss hours about why and how she came up in this mess but that's not the subject.

So, since alot of people say that experience is far more important in this field than where you got your degree, my question is: Is it better to go to UTS and do an internship and gain experience, or go to UNSW but miss out on the internship experience.

I’d like to say I’m an overachiever, I just have this sick idea that I strive to be an all rounder and the top of most if not all things. I just need to be the head. Currently I am an editor for the university newspaper and I represent POC for the parliament in my university. Now my issue is that I have no motivation and don’t do anything towards it…unless I see other people doing things and I get a pang of jealousy and then start taking on loads of projects, finishing them, adding them to my CV then the cycle repeats. 

For example, my flatmate comes to me today and asks for my application that helped me win the election for parliament. And I just felt irritated, not because I don’t want to help her but I think I have something wrong with me where I don’t want anyone to do better than me, which is so wrong, like I get happy for other peoples achievements as long as it is not in my category. I obviously did send it to her but after she left, I just started planning frantically about internships and applying for jobs (something I was meant to do months ago I just had no motivation and kept putting it off). 

I sometimes think it stems from childhood, being ethnic I always got told I have to work twice as hard to get half as far, and ethnic parents are prideful and I just always got told to be the best. So I think I have a superiority complex in that sense where I have to be the best in every category, whether that be looks, friends, academics, all sorts. I’m trying to become more mindful so I can be more even paced but I don’t know.


But it is not healthy! Sure it gets the job done and I have a cool ish resume, but I don’t want to be bitters, burn myself out and do well that way, I just want to be steady paced. I think I may be insecure deep down, but I don’t know.

Any advice ?


Summary: I only do well when I’m jealous of other people who are in my category, then I overload and burn myself out. I think it stems from childhood being told as an ethnic person I have to be the best and in general my parents want me to be the best (I don’t do it for them) how do I stop this?"

So I have two internship offers as a junior in university:

\- Charles Schwab, $34/hour, Westlake, TX with $2000 sign on bonus (virtual)

\- USAA, $25/hour, San Antonio, TX with $2250 housing stipend (in person)

In my heart, I really, REALLY want to take Schwab for various reasons(pay, learning opportunities, more prestigious, etc.). It's the offer that truly excites me, especially as my first internship. However, after graduation I plan on moving to San Antonio for around 3 years (more context behind that in a previous post in my history), and taking the USAA offer would allow me to potentially be able to pipeline into a fulltime role.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind, what would you all advise me do? Of course, if I take the Schwab offer, I can apply again to USAA for full time, but I don't want to bank on that being successful. San Antonio doesn't have the best market for software engineers from what I've heard, and USAA is one of the biggest software engineer employers in that area, which makes this decision difficult for me since I have an internship offer from them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the overarching question is, would it be wiser to take USAA and hope to pipeline into fulltime, or should I take what my heart desires in Schwab and start applying again in San Antonio senior year?

When I told this to my parents, although my dad was slightly supportive, they are not letting me take the job. First of all they said because I don’t drive I’d have to waste a lot of money on taxis and ubers to drop me off in the evening (other public transport isn’t really available close to where I live) (my friend who works there offered to drop me home because we would work the same shift, and even if I were to spend money on taxis monthly I’d still be making a good profit out of the salary!) , second of all because the shift ends at 12 AM, they are against the idea of me coming home late when they go to sleep at 10 pm (they are strict when it comes to curfews especially in my culture), and third of all they said that this will affect my studies and that my grades will go down, even though I know myself and I know that I can manage this. They told me to just wait until next summer to start driving and get my moms old car since she would be getting a new one, and they offered to increase my weekly allowance too if this was “about the money”. They are telling me to look for an internship where my campus is, also because they believe that me working as a sales assistant won’t really add on to my work experience. I just feel so stuck because I really want to take this job but I don’t want to disappoint them (because they feel like I have already disappointed them enough in the past) they say they want the best for me however i really am unsure about this situation so I’m asking you to give me advice."

I'm planning for MS CS in Fall '22. I interned for five weeks at a firm in Summer 2020, in a domain relevant to my masters area. But I received a PPO and I'm currently working with them as a full time employee (Since Jul 2021). 

Is it fine if I ask my intern manager for a LOR? Would it cause any trouble during my stay in the organization? My intern manager and I are not in the same team right now, and I doubt if we would be in the near future. 

I'd appreciate some help in this."

I was told I was rejected from the regular SDE application because they chose to advance with my QA application. I am a computer science sophomore at UCLA who has been told my resume could land big tech companies. I haven't heard back from any other company yet but Palantir (a recruiter reached out to me but said they were only hiring juniors but would expedite my application process next year). The deadline for me Amazon offer is in about 3 weeks. I've heard horrible things about QA and only want to go into SDE in the future. I am hopeful for more offers this recruiting season but it is very competitive and I can't be sure. 

I'm wondering if it's a good idea to turn down the Amazon offer in hope for something else not QA related. 

I am an international student so it's hard for me to land jobs at a lot of companies. I considered taking QA and reneging but I'm afraid of being blacklisted since I would love to work for Amazon as a regular SDE in the future.

Finally, the money for the QA position is pretty good and not something I would like to waste.

I'd really appreciate if someone else took a look at my resume to tell me if I should take the offer or wait for other companies to reply back."

I’m at an internship with an AMZING company and they make me want to work really hard and strive to add value to their company as an undergraduate intern. 

With that said. I have late stage interviews with Amazon and Google as Early Career Software Engineering roles. To be honest Google was my dream company—my current company is making me rethink everything.

I was thinking about leveraging offers from Google/Amazon, if I get them, to ask for a larger salary from my current job. If someone has tips for this can you please let me know?

If I don’t get any offers (which is likely), can someone let me know their early career offer so I can leverage my own salary/stock. I am hesitant to use the salaries from Glassdoor and Indeed because I feel like they are outdated with the market increases in salary due to demand. 

Thanks so much!"
q48go3,36,2021-10-08,"Nearing the end of my 4 months intership, what I learnt and what I could've done better",rawrsee,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/q48go3/nearing_the_end_of_my_4_months_intership_what_i/,"This is just going to be story time and not a question or anything, apology first if it does not fit the sub, I just want to tell others how my internship went so far. For the record, I'm currently still a student right now.

So a few months back I received an invitation for my first ever interview for an internship relating to CS. The internship was for a back end developer position with focus on Java and PHP as language. I was really struggling to find an internship or similar position back then, so having an opportunity to go to interview stage really made me happy.

The interview itself was not hard, they just asked me what kind of language I used in my uni, whether I have a personal project that I can show, and some kind of Leetcode-style question which I find much more easier than most of Leetcode easy. Interview went great and I had a great feeling, and around 2 weeks later I was told that I got the position, and I decided to sign a contract for a 4 month internship program.

Then the internship started. It was your usual onboarding process during the first week, and on the second week I received my first ever task. It was nothing big, I think it was just renaming parameters to conform to their new format or something, but still, I was excited to start my CS journey on a real company. The next few tasks were also not something complicated, and I was having no real problem finishing the task given.

But during my third week I was told to join a meeting with the other back end developers. There were currently 3 others, 4 including me. The meeting was mainly about implementing ES into our system. Now, I'm sure most of you guys think this is nothing, but for me it was something huge. I was basically assigned to do this task along with one of the other developers, and I was struggling really hard to keep up with the task. Language barrier can sometimes become an issue (I'm not a native speaker of the country I'm studying in), and with home office it was really hard to ask for help, since all you can do is wait for them on Slack.

And it seems they realize I was struggling, and I was let off from this project, instead given another project to do by my manager. At that point, I realized how much knowledge I lack. I never thought myself as a good programmer or anything, but it hit me hard that there's still so much to learn. But alas, I was not discouraged. I know why I'm doing the internship , and that is to earn experience.

The rest of my internship went pretty smoothly. Of course there were hiccups here and there, but I always told myself mistakes are not a problem as long as you learn something from it.

Now, it is almost the end of my internship, and today I just had a discussion with my manager about my performance during the internship, and the possibility of continuing there as a working student. He told me that my performance was not bad, but he also told me that I asked too much when performing a task, which I also honestly feel. He said he'd like to keep me around as a working student for 6 months, and he wants to see me changing, in that I try to solve the problems alone first instead of going straight into asking colleague. I was honestly happy that he was really honest with me, and it made me realize what I'm lacking and what I can improve.

So yeah, that is my story so far. I'll be finishing my internship in a few weeks and continue working there as a working student. I would like to thank you guys for reading until this part, and once again sorry if it does not fit into the sub.

Tldr; got internship, learnt a lot."

I was pressured to enroll on them by my brother that was the only person that was able to help me out financially. As I was expecting I am not very good at it and also I have huge social anxiety which makes my networking game weak. Now I am struggling to get into any kind of internship, because I moved to another country (which I was pressured to do as well). 

All my family members are calling me constantly screaming and whining about what should I do and they contradict themselves as well. I feel like I am being ripped apart by a pack of wolves. 

Yesterday I had the worst migraine of my life because of my stress and my tenant told me that she was very worried because I was pale as hell and seemed like I was going to pass out (thats exactly how I felt).

I feel like I can't handle it anymore. No matter what I do it seems like it's not enough. Helplessness starts to be unbearable and I feel like I might just drop it all and kill myself. It will break my family apart, because they will all blame each other for my death. I cant fucking sleep at night, I have nobody to talk to and currently I have 0 self confidence. I don't think it's going to get better."

q4d32k,4,2021-10-08,Tips for Technical Interviews,MindOfAnEngineer,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q4d32k/tips_for_technical_interviews/,"Hello all. I know there are tons of threads on this topic, but I wanted to have a bit more a higher level discussion on this topic. I just had my final interview with Amazon a couple days ago and sadly, I recieved my rejection notice today. This is my second time failing the final interview with them (first was for an internship), and needless to say I'm a bit frustrated. I'm sure many are familiar with their interviewing format, but for those that aren't, it consists of three 45 minute interviews with technical coding questions and some behavioral questions.

My first interviewer was fantastic and genuinely cared about my accomplishments on my resume, which is a rarity in technical interviews. My other two interviewers were not at all interested in me as a person and went straight to the coding question and at the end asked if I had any questions for them. Interestingly, I flawlessly answered the first interviewers question and struggled with the other two. The question I was asked by the second interviewer was a permutation of a topic covered in one lecture from a course I took two and a half years ago. Needless to say, I wasn't quick to recall a detail like that.

Now I know I could have practiced more because you can always do more Leetcode problems, but there are two things that bother me. One, I feel like these interviewers at so many of these places just don't care about you as a person and the behavioral questions are asked so they don't get sued. I could be a serial killer, but if I can code they'll hire me. The other being, there are so many topics to master for these interviews and to know that not being proficient in one can wreck your chances at these places is very tough. I will recognize that I am not someone that can recall all of the info from my undergraduate courses, but I have had jobs, performed well in class, yet none of that seems to matter at the big companies.

I know these are harsh truths and that it is the way it is, but I was curious if anyone could offer insight as to how I could improve and if maybe I've just gotten unlucky with interviewers, questions, etc?"

In my head an internship is entry level. Like very entry level. Especially if it is being advertised to college students. Isn’t the whole point of an internship to learn? Every company I’ve interviewed with so far has been ridiculous. One company had me do FOUR remote interviews and wanted a fifth one. I finally had to tell them I wasn’t going to pursue the internship. 

Another company interviewed me for an undergraduate IT “internship”. They told me they were looking for someone who could do 35 hours a week as the sole IT person on duty for part of a hospital. At minimum wage. That’s literally not an internship? They rejected me because I lacked experience even though the internship was listed as entry level. 

It’s not like I’m trying to get an internship with google or something. These are local companies. I feel like these businesses are using the word internship to get away with low pay but they have such high expectations. Most of the “entry level” internships I’ve applied for aren’t actually entry level."

Landed a summer internship afterwards but they only hired people within a year from their bachelor's and I wasn't planning on going for it (at the time).

Took 2 years break to work in an unrelated job. Realized IT probably is going to be the best way to make a good living without killing myself or working crazy overtime. 

I am not *passionate* about IT. However, I don't think I am about anything. Still I like tech, always been handy with PCs, want to learn and be a great employee that can grow and acquire more responsibilities within the tech/IT field.

That being said, I want to get serious about my studying (for real this time), gets some certs, go back into online school, get my bachelor's, etc. 

Always had a hard time studying while working in something completely different, hope working in the field will make studying a lot easier and actually able to retain the info.

Seen some lucky guys and gals online that got help desk jobs with zero experience. But I've been looking at entry level IT help desk jobs and seems like they are looking for a LOT. I'm sure most of it is learned on the job, but how is someone fresh going to get any experience in VoIP, ticketing systems, SLAs, etc.

Any advice on how to get a help desk job? I know I have a lot to learn/relearn so if I can't get a help desk job now what would be a different job that translates well into IT or help desk? 
Which certs do hiring managers actually want/care about? 
Does college/uni matter in terms of bachelors? I'm looking into WGU now. 
Are hotdogs a sandwich or a taco? 
Please help, thank you."

Even though I feel like I need to get my life together I recognise I am still a young person (all of my coworkers who are 30+ see me as a baby).

I think im stuck in that “succeed by 25” mentality, I have friends my age who are junior doctors/nurses, have engineering internships AND others getting married. Then there’s me who is an aspiring videographer who currently works behind a bar.

I know of over filmmakers like Edgar wright and Sam raimi who made there first feature film in there early 20’s and I’ve only made a handful of short films and promotional videos for friends start up businesses so im feeling like im behind starting my career.

Also seeing friends get married is amazing and im so happy for them but I’ve caught myself wishing I could find love soon. I’ve only been in one relationship in the past and learnt from that relationship that you can’t force love if you’re not ready. I want to love myself fully before I start loving someone else but it’s hard to ignore these feelings of wanting love. (I guess I’m just starved of physical affection, and words of affection and just affection in general)

Anyway these are my unfiltered feeling, I know I will be fine in the long run and I’m still doing what I can to pursue my passion of videography whilst trying to balance work. 

Hope everyone is doing good ☺️"

I'm sorry for the long post.

I am a high school student, and I have co-op this semester. I want to work in the healthcare field when I'm older, so I searched for a co-op placement in that field. I was lucky to find a nice clinic that would take me.

I went in on my first day (yesterday) and trained with the receptionist and a nurse intern to do admin work. The place was pretty busy throughout, and both the receptionist (Jen) and the nurse (Emma) were very friendly. I didn't get to try out the administrative duties firsthand because if I did, I would be blocking the flow of work. I figured since it was only my first day, I could take it slow and learn it as I went on. As we are about to leave, Jen, the receptionist, tells us that she will not be there the next day and that the manager (Sam) would be doing reception work instead. A few moments later, Sam texts her and lets her know he will not be coming in the next day either. so the reception work is now under my and Emma's hands. Emma has trained for 3 days prior to this, so we expect some confusion, but mostly think we will be able to manage. The system for entering in patients information is quite complicated, so I was a bit worried.

Emma, the nurse, is told to come half an hour early to open up and get things set up. I show up the next day 5 minutes early and find no one there and the office locked. No worries, I call the manager and get the passcode and unlock the door, set everything up and tell the few patients who arrived to please wait patiently as I was waiting on someone to help with reception. They were understanding, but Emma showed up a little late and I could tell the patients were getting antsy. Immediately, we try to get things moving but we are both confused and stressed and are fumbling around trying to figure things out. Meanwhile, the patients are sighing and I can tell they are annoyed. The doctor shows up soon after Emma does and tries to teach us how to use the system quickly before he heads off the the rooms to see patients.

I had to leave my placement early for picture day as instructed by my co-op teacher, and let Jen, the receptionist know yesterday.

Around half an hour before I left, I was very stressed as patients were openly showing their annoyance and I did not know what to do. I tried my best to help Emma. The time rolls around and I had to leave, so I said good luck to Emma and run to catch the bus. While I was in the bus, Sam called me and asked me how it's going. I reminded him that it's picture day and that I'm actually on my way back to school. I said that it was quite hectic and that the both of us really didn't know what we were doing for the most part. This was a mistake. In my stress I think I blurted out things I shouldn't have said. Sam said this is unfortunate, as Emma had 3 days training. I laughed nervously and said she was doing great, but I felt bad for leaving her behind as there was work piling up and lots of patients. The phone was ringing a lot (for appointments) when I was there but we never picked it up because there was too much other work. He asked about the phone and I said we didn't pick up. I told him I was worried people would leave bad reviews. He sounded a bit stressed and was laughing a lot (because he was nervous?). We end the call.

Now, I am worried about whether what I said could have been overdramatic, or if I said something that could get Emma in trouble. I don't know what to do. I think I could have been inflating the situation because everything seemed so busy to me but maybe that was just because I was in reception.

Note: I am doing an unpaid position, if that counts."
q4oftg,1,2021-10-09,Workers' Rights and Financial Compensation from Employer,I_AM_ASA,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/q4oftg/workers_rights_and_financial_compensation_from/,"Good afternoon,

I have a legal question about my employment status and if I am entitled to backpay and a state and federally mandated pay raise.

I am a brewer in Pennsylvania and I acquired this job due to an internship that was sponsored by an accredited brewing science school. I was initially offered a salary of $32,000, but successfully countered with $34,000. There was no formal contract, written or signed, but rather just an email with the original salary and a verbal confirmation of my new salary. My gross pay reflects the $34,000 salary, so there are no issues there.

Recently, the brewers had a meeting where we were told by our Director of Operations that we had to start working an owner-mandated 45 hours per week and that we would have to start clocking in to prove our hours worked. Aside from the fact that the employee handbook designates the standard workweek as 40 hours, we were obviously upset that we had to work an additional five hours per week to do... well, nothing extra. We have routinely completed our work in roughly 40 hours and that had never been an issue before. However, now we are expected to be at the brewery for an additional five hours for no additional compensation, which, because we are salaried, is still not the problem.

Naturally, we began to rifle through our employee handbook for any information regarding our job responsibilities and employee status and the rights we are entitled to. There is brief mention that non-exempt employees are entitled to a lunch break, which we don't get, so we assumed that we were exempt. Not only because of the lack of a lunch break, but because we are salaried and are working 45 hour weeks without additional compensation, we continued to assume that we were exempt. I also just emailed our CFO about our status, who got written confirmation from one of the co-owners, that we were, in fact, exempt workers.

Over the last day or two, I've been reading on the Department of Labor's website regarding exempt classifications and qualifications and the salary requirements for those classifications. According to the DoL, an exempt worker must earn at least $684/week, or $35,568. My gross pay equates to roughly $654/week. However, just this past Monday, October 3, 2021, Pennsylvania's Minimum Wage Act dictated that salaried exempt workers must be paid a minimum of $780/week, or a salary of $40,560, which I, and I know for a fact one other brewer, obviously do not earn.

Further, if the brewers do qualify for exempt status, it is due to a loose interpretation of the duties test. Our work is largely manual, but requires training in operations and chemical and biological knowledge of the brewing process. So, if we actually qualify for non-exempt status, my employer is not compensating me or the other brewers for overtime pay.

The only caveat that I do not fully understand is the ""blue-collar"" classification and whether or not we qualify for that. Regardless, I feel that we are being financially abused by our employer and I'm not sure what steps I should take before taking legal action. Even then, I fear that, because margins in beer and brewing are razor thin, if I raise an issue about my salary that I'll be fired, since my employment is ""at-will.""

If anyone can offer any help at all, I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you"
q4qdix,30,2021-10-09,Need some insights,PossessedSonyDiscman,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/q4qdix/need_some_insights/,"Hey, how are you guys? 

I'm 24 and currently I work at a company and I'm kinda of a jack of all trades. I am the sole responsible for CI(Jenkins), release, deploy, database structures and I'm also having to code some tools(not the tools that we use to automate our process, but actual portfolio tools that goes to the clients) since the guy who was with me took another offer. The entire company relies on Windows. The devs only do the dev stuff, so I have to guarantee that what they do is delivered to production. Most of the time I hear ""not my problem, it works on my machine!!!"". If something happens, it is implied that the problem came from me, the Infraestructure guy. 

I'm kinda stressed with all this. I started in 03/2020 as a intern, got hired in 08/20, and became this main guy for everything since the other fella left in March this year. Don't get me wrong, I loved and took this opportunity with the most enthusiasm you could even imagine. My bosses probably think that if I can take care of everything, than there is no need to hire another guy to help. They gave me two raises and all that talk of me deserving it, but actually it's because I'm doing two people's jobs by myself. I know that. And the pay is not even that good. And the overtimes, Jesus Christ, sprint every week, people calling me late night because the bosses need something delivered by the end of the day. Its things on top of things that need attention at the same time. I can't say no. Give multiple stuff to me and I will deliver in the next hour. Probably that was my mistake, showing what I can actually do.

I'm trying to learn new things. Got in love with the DevOps culture. But I need to learn so much. I'm a fast learner. I can adapt really well. I started with Linux and Docker, and I know the basics of it. Can I start applying for other jobs that requires it? What are my chances? Are companies willing to get a guy who is ready to learn, with passion and hungry, or to they need those skillsets asap?

I feel like I'm stuck. Knowing a bit of everything won't get me far."
q4qh7g,1,2021-10-09,I Graduated From College Less then 6 Months Ago and Already I want to Give Up on Everything.,FanOfFictionFifty5,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/q4qh7g/i_graduated_from_college_less_then_6_months_ago/,"So I graduated from high school in 2017, and I decided I wanted to get into television and be a screenwriter. To achieve this, I decided to go for two degrees; one in English and one in Broadcast. I got great grades in almost all my classes, only getting two grades under B my entire career, and both of those in the high C’s. I did some volunteer work, tried some clubs. But when I finally decided it was time for me to get serious, to talk with my professors about internships or get serious about the clubs I was in that could help me, my school shut down due to COVID, destroying all my motivation and ability to really do anything I’d wanted to do. I spent half 
 my last semester of junior year forced to stay at home, then I went back and felt miserable with no one and nothing it work and school so I spent my final semester at home by choice. It barely even feels like I graduated, since I haven’t even walked yet.

During all this time, I had an on/off job as a janitor, working at schools during the summer to prepare them for the new year. But with no school, I just started doing that full time. I’d look for jobs in my spare time, but I was mostly looking for anything that paid better then the 12 dollars I made (and I was lucky I made that much). It involved sending my application to a lot of random places, none of them in anything I wanted to do, and most of them never getting back to me. Finally, I got one job interview; customer service for a company that sold art glass. It paid better, the boss seemed nice, and I thought I could keep looking for better jobs after work.

But it didn’t work. After less then 90 days, they let me go. No warning, no real attempt beforehand of saying “if you don’t stop x or do y you’re fired.” Just waited until an hour before I was supposed to leave last Thursday, gave me a couple reasons why they let me go, and then a robotic speech about how it’ll all be good in the future or something. I was too shocked and miserable to remember the specifics.

So now I’m unemployed and still living with my parents. They’re kind enough to let me live rent free, but I don’t even know what to do. My parents suggest and want me to try and get an internship at local production companies that may lead to a job, but idek if any of them would take a random college graduate, or if they’re even looking for interns. My folks just want me to walk into these studios in a suite, hand them my resumes, and talk about how covid cost me internship time so will you please exploit me for free for a few months so I may possibly get a job here that may possibly pay me just enough to rent an apartment with 2 other roommates?

I just… I don’t know what I want. I don’t want to be like this. I don’t ant to be miserable, i don’t want to just spend my whole life doing a job I don’t want anymore so I can barely survive. I want to enjoy myself, be happy, but I don’t even know what that would look like for me anymore…

Sorry, I don’t even know how to end this. Just wanted to say some random shit in the open might help me somehow."

I had to go through advanced Angular training after just a week of joining, and a month later, they've started assigning me work. I still haven't had time to practise Javascript, I spent whatever time I had mostly following Angular tutorials. It's taking me quite long to understand and figure out even basic stuff, and I don't feel confident at all working with a large code base with scanty knowledge of the language that I'm supposed to be using daily at work.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I've managed to duplicate and somehow piece together some code to get stuff to work. I feel stupid spending lots of time on something that is ""easy"" according to my manager, and a couple of times he has told me (with a hint of impatience) to just ask when I'm stuck. And while he has answered my questions when I've asked him, it has happened a few times that I felt like I understood what was to be done, but when I started working on it, I got confused again. At which point I feel embarrassed and afraid to ask again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really struggling to understand if the problem is with me for not fully comprehending things, or with them for expecting me to jump in and contribute with the work after just a month of starting to learn all this. I'm feeling really stressed all the time, and tired too after working for 10 hours or more sometimes. I can't help but feel that all of this trouble is because I'm not familiar with Javascript or Angular, and that I should've been given more time to study during the training period.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I deal with this? Has any one of you faced such a situation before? Desperately need perspectives, advice and opinions from you guys."

college coursework (taken since summer before 11th grade at my STATE UNIVERSITY (not a community college)) - Logic, Multivariable Calculus with Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Advanced Linear Algebra (crosslisted as a graduate course), Complex Analysis (I was hoping to take Abstract Algebra this semester but they only offered morning classes and I had school then). I have also received college credit for my 11th and 12th grade Spanish classes. I am receiving/have received all As (no A+s are offered at this university), except the graduate-level Linear Algebra, which I got an A- in.

The above college is ranked #26 for colleges for mathematics (among all institutions) in the United States. Its applied mathematics program is also ranked #3, although I'm more fond of pure math.

I've overall been at the maximum course levels for every subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Awards/Recognitions:

I've been published in a district/news article because of how much advanced math work I've done - I've completed the most anyone has in my district. I have been designated by my principal (who himself is qualified as he was a math teacher/adjunct professor at the university since 1997) as 'truly gifted and extraordinary among high schoolers and undergraduates alike' - more on this below

General Extracurriculars (not in order of importance):

Summer Research Mentor (a camp cofounded with some kids from RSI) - in 10 days from scratch, I produced with my students a machine learning paper that was accepted to arXiv - which has been academically reviewed (and extensively revised, of course) since and is being submitted to a journal

Teacher Assistant, Math Circles Summer Mathematics Camp at UC Berkeley: Supervised competitions among middle-school students as well as formulated and constructed competitive puzzle problems remotely

Vice President of the school Computer Science Club - primarily plans the general schedule of daily meetings, and more small-scale details. I am co-mentoring the Data Science and Machine Learning programming class.

Assistant Inventory Manager for a newly-founded computer repair club - we ship out used computers to those in need, it's pretty cool. The club has gained 50+ members since its founding in April.

Hospital Volunteer (on hiatus since March 2020) - gained over 400 hours with this. I've worked in the transport department, and with some employees with special needs/mental disabilities in my later months on the job. The nature of this activity, while it can be seen as a 'dime in a dozen' type of thing, is actually really important to me in terms of the friendships I formed with the special needs over our common interests.

Information Technologist for an astronomy education nonprofit - we've made presentations to inner-city elementary schools, explaining things like general relativity in a very simple way and it's been pretty fun until COVID hit.

Treasurer of the school Computer Science Club - Taught Introductory Programming and Intermediate Video Game Production class in weekly meetings and take on the responsibility of general financial oversight as Treasurer.

Fundraiser - what began as a simple lemonade stand has transformed into a multitude of summer events/fairs that has raised over $100,000 for the children's hospital near us. I also co-supervised monetized Twitch charity streams online from June to August 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic.

Treasurer of my high school's research program

&amp;#x200B;

Clubs: DECA, Math Team, National Honor Society, Science Olympiad, Computer Science Club, Board Game Club

&amp;#x200B;

Research/Upper-level work (the first three I did because I am able to be treated as an undergraduate at my university):

1. Proving that the operations of Neural Regulatory Networks (or Liquid Time Constant RNNs) are able to capture in a much more succinct fashion than those of NeuralODEs can.
2. Implemented Reynolds model in the WebGL-based 3-D simulation environment for flocking behavior in multi-agent systems.
3. SPAA '21 Conference - Fast Fourier Transforms and Implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Method with Stencil Transformations. Worked on and implemented a new algorithm with record-breaking speed (thousands of times faster than state-of-the-art electromagnetic grid projectors).
4. Research Intern at a National Laboratory (Cosmology) - Linear derivations of self-similar parameterizations to the matter-dominated era of the universe. It's very heavy on mathematical fluency and I really like it.
5. Topological properties of images of Geodesic circles in S\^3 projected to knots in L(3,1). This was done with my Logic professor. After performing well in my class, I decided to reach out to him for a research mentorship and he was impressed with what I've done as a high schooler.
6. !! IMPORTANT !! - I have been mentored in graduate-level real/Fourier analysis under a postdoctoral researcher who I met at Princeton University (I was visiting it in December 2019) at an Indian restaurant in the adjacent town of Princeton, NJ. He recently moved to London, though. He has described me as 'truly gifted' and is writing a supplemental letter of recommendation for my application. We are currently working through *Principles of Mathematics Analysis* by Walter Rudin and *Fourier Analysis* by Elias M. Stein (who himself is a late, renowned mathematician from Princeton University)

&amp;#x200B;

Paid Employment:

1. Teacher Assistant/Director-Head of Technology Support of a weekend university mathematics enrichment program - Collect and grade students' homeworks, co-manage and supervise in-class competitions. Maintain upkeep of Discord, virtual equipment, and digital traffic in our servers. During second year in this position, oversaw much of the institution's transition from in-person to digital education because of COVID-19. Assessed and troubleshot software concerns brought by students and faculty.
2. Teacher Assistant, UC Berkeley Math Circle Camp (remote): Supervised competitions among middle-school students as well as formulated and constructed competitive puzzle problems remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

Athletics:

I was doing school tennis in 2020 (and also played soccer for eight years) until COVID. However, outside of that, I am not able to participate in sports due to whatever some back stuff

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping I have a somewhat decent shot. I see that for the class of 2024, Princeton accepted about 13% of its REA applicants. I'd put my chances around 20-25% for the school, because I'm hoping the letter of recommendation from someone at Princeton will help. However, I want to stay modest with my choices but Princeton would a dream for me.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think? Thank you for any help in advance!"

What do I do?,Al_Palll,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q4vuux/company_making_it_exceedingly_difficult_to_give/,"I was a SWE intern working remotely at Walmart last summer. After the end of my internship, I was instructed to send my equipment back with the shipping label they provided. When I went to do so, I noticed that the label only covered one of my items, and I had been sent several. I was told to email someone about this, and did so. I received no response, so I followed up two weeks later. After another week with no response, I emailed someone from my internship leadership. They told me that the person I was trying to email had just got back from vacation, and should be getting back to me soon. Another month goes by, no response. I email my internship contact again, and she verifies my email and says she'll have the guy email me. Another week and nothing. I email my contact yet again, and she says that I should be looking out for an email from fedex, not the guy I had been trying to reach. It has been yet another month with no response and I have received no emails from FedEx or anybody at Walmart about this.

I have been trying my hardest to get these stupid boxes out of my garage and back to Walmart. They gave me a MacBook pro, keyboard, mouse, and multiple monitors. At what point do I just say to hell with it and stop trying? I have plenty of emails and slack logs with proof that I have been trying to get this stuff back to them. I'm sure as hell not paying out of my own pocket to ship this equipment. Obviously I don't want to get in trouble but this is going nowhere and I feel like Walmart doesn't care."
q4wjii,1,2021-10-09,I’m struggling bad.,spacerexic,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q4wjii/im_struggling_bad/,"In 2020 is when this all really started. I think initially it had a lot to do with the pandemic. My first two years of college were great. I was focused and made excellent grades. The semester of fall 2020 went okay, but I started struggling with my mental health really bad. I was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar in December. Spring semester rolls around and I was taking harder classes. I want to go to medical school and I’m a psychology major, so I was beginning to take pre-med prerequisites including college algebra and general chemistry, all while doing an internship and upper-level psychology classes that demanded a lot of attention. After the first week I withdrew from the algebra and chemistry classes. I never felt so low in my life. I didn’t want to have a W on my transcript, let alone two. I managed to make it through the semester and I retook the algebra class in the summer. It was awful, I never got a break from school. Then this fall semester comes. My sister had an accident four days after classes began so I took the following week off to be with her in the hospital. Unfortunately she was pronounced brain dead during that week. I completely failed my first anatomy and physiology’s first exam and I’m struggling to catch up. We have our second exam in a few days but I feel like I know nothing. I’m behind and frustrated with my statistics class. Trying to work on the take home exam for that class is what has inspired this post. I have learned nothing in all of my other classes. I feel like I’m not able to retain any information. I am on adhd medication and it helps some but I can’t stay focused. All I want to do is lay in bed all day. I feel drained. I want to be a doctor so bad but at the same time, I’m so done with school. I feel like I can’t handle anything anymore. If I withdraw it will look bad to med schools. If I stay I’m only able to do enough to barely get by and that’s not ideal for me considering how hard it is to get into med school. I’m starting to lose hair from stress. I’ve lost 14 pounds in the span of 3 weeks. I don’t want to do anything anymore. The biggest stressor in my life right now is school. My university is a joke. We are known to have some pretty shitty professors and the president/various offices  are really shitty people. Everyone is transferring from the school because of how bad it’s gotten in the past two years. I got a good scholarship and the tuition is the cheapest in my state and closer to my home. I’ve been nominated as the new president for the psychology honor society but I hate school so bad. I used to not be this way. I’m conflicted. What should I do? How can I get back on track?"

Im not really friends with any of the boys in my grade, and she thinks I need to have more boys around me so i can make more male friends. Im a junior in high school and i like going to school everyday. My grandma wants me to change schools to our town public school, which offers greater academic variety and much larger class sizes (most of my classes have about 8 kids in them, although one has 20 and one has four). When I was in Middle school and went to the middle school which is in the same building as the high school, I hated it and most of the people in my class but that could be courtesy of puberty. Id have greater educational oppurtunity in the high school with dual enrollment and an internship program for seniors, but at the same time I dont mind where i go to school now. Will not being around that many boys be harmful to my development, and will having so few kids in my class be negative for my development?

Hello, I am a 18 year old teenager who for my entire high school life has encountered immense bullying. In 2017 when I was 15 i moved in with my Dad and went to an entirely new state to start high school. 

There I didn’t fit in at all. I was incredibly lonely but make friends.
However I was bullied for practically 3 years. People used to make fun of my dark skin, body composition( I used to have male boobs and one time a girl noticed them and laughed at me in front of the whole class). 

I was called Mr.PoPo from dragon ball Z, I was called ugly multiple times. Last year through it was the worst it had ever been. One of my”friends” invited me to a party and when I got there I was immediately called ugly.

It was so bad, almost everyone in that damn party roasted the fuck outta me and called me the ugliest guy alive. It didn’t stop from there either throughout the first half of my junior year multiple people called me ugly. One time a random person in the bathroom looked at me and called me ugly. 

This one dude called me ugly in front of a bunch of girls too. Practically almost everyone in my classes roasted me and called me ugly. The made fun of my durag all the time and joked about how I never took it off. It was practically a personality trait that I was ugly. It got so bad one time one person told me I’d never find love. Girls even rejected me and called me ugly as well. I remember this one time I joked and kinda flirted with a girl and she said “get away from me”, not only did she say that two people behind me laughed at me for what I did.


I told myself that enough was enough. I got sick and tired of having assholes say things about me so I started working out at the gym and at home. I lose weight, learned about nofap, raised my GPA, learned about cold showers, meditation, and learned about computer programming. I ever got a new haircut and felt really good about myself.
The day after I got a haircut and returned to school it was like I was a different person. 

Everyone and I mean everyone noticed and gave me compliments. Some people I didn’t even know noticed me. Random girls also found me attractive for the first time in my life.Those bullies were actually nice to be now, but I knew they were all jerks.

During the first few months of quarantine I decided to become better at life than those who bullied me. I confined to learn about programming and math and now am working toward a career in software engineering. I workout 5 days a week and feel almost amazing about myself. I graduated back in June and during senior year people treated me so better and acted like none of the shit they put me through happened. Instead of calling me ugly they know were jealous that I was good at school and working out.

I now have 4 scholarships, 2 computer science internships and building progress on a great body in the gym. I’m doing all of this because I want to crush those who made fun of me. I want to be so successful that when I go back to high school reunion everyone will see how great and strong I am and will hate themselves for bullying me, especially this girl I broke up with 


However I’ve developed this insane drive and motivation to prove them wrong. Everyday I wake up I remind myself of what they did to me, and use that as fuel to crush everything in my way. I’m motivated my a huge anger and resentment to become a better individual than those who make fun of me. I think I’m losing myself being this disciplined and motivated but I can’t stop. I honestly want to crush them and be so great in life and career that I can make fun of them the way they did me. Is this bad motivation?"
q51c3q,56,2021-10-10,Why is Going to College Frowned Upon in This Subreddit?,MissionCattle,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/q51c3q/why_is_going_to_college_frowned_upon_in_this/,"I'm obviously biased by going down the college route, but I think going to community college and transferring to a reasonably priced university has a lot of perks. Sure a lot of what you learn tend to be very basic fundamentals and/or topics that were relevant maybe 5 years ago, but if you have the time and $25,000, I don't think it's a bad option.

I will first start by saying IT education from community college is actually a really good investment. A lot of IT professors in community college are people currently or have experience in the field that are looking to pay it forward (seriously, they don't make much). They have more time to spend teaching as they don't have the same duties as a university professor (administration, research, etc). Homework and tests are definitely not everyone's thing, but the learning experience you get from doing your assigned labs are certainly things you can share with future employers. A lot of curriculums are based around CompTIA and Cisco textbooks and learning academies to provide a smooth roadmap to getting certified. Many community colleges even partner with companies for IT apprenticeships to train you for a spot out of graduation, I accepted one before transferring to a university and it helped me in many ways understanding the process.

University I understand many are skeptical of (for good reason). I'd say simply don't go all four years; transfer from a community college. You don't need to go to that fancy University program charging you $40,000 a year. All you need is a $9,000 state school that will accept your credits and offer co-ops and recruiter attention. Join your universities Cyber Defense team (if that's your route you want to go), and make friends with the other IT and CS majors. Spend some time at your universities' networking lab. Hell, even get work-study approval to work in your Uni's IT department (doing all of this landed me multiple internship offers). Making use of these resources will make you not regret it.  

I believe that experience always reigns supreme, and certifications speak louder than a degree. I understand a lot of people trying to get into IT are people that are switching mid career and don't have the time or resources. There is nothing wrong with not going the college route, but there are many advantages you wouldn't otherwise have. I am mostly speaking to those that are young and considering their path."

I've had my behavioral interview, which seemed to go very well. My interviewer told me that she wanted to make sure she gave me all of the information I may be curious about so I would choose PwC instead of other big 4 firms, because she asked me if I was interviewing with other firms. 

Once our interview ended, she told me that I am very sharp and she hopes to hear from me again, and also that I should be hearing back from HR in a few days (this was on Friday so I assume next week). Only issue is that I also have a case interview that I scheduled a week out from the behavioral one, so I won't complete the interview process until the 15th of October. 

I guess my question is, even though I scheduled my case interview a week later than my behavioral interview, is what the interviewer said to me during my behavioral interview a good sign that I should get the position, or should I hold back my excitement pending the case interview?"

The second one is a full time job in a Vodafone as a strategy designer (business analysis team)(seems to have potential and vague borders).

If there’s anything else I should add, please let me know.**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me clarify quickly: I (24 AFAB) am using he/him pronouns because when my brother (20 AMAB) told me he was questioning his gender, ***I asked if he would like me to use different pronouns or a different name and he said no***\*\*.\*\* ***The idea of changing his name or pronouns made him uncomfortable as of that moment.*** This is in no way an attack against trans women.

PS if there's a better place to post this where I can get help please let me know. I'm scared and desperate.

&amp;#x200B;

Also this is going to be all over the place because I’ve been drinking and smoking weed as a shitty coping mechaism, this is a subject that’s been haunting me for nearly a year, and I’m so uncomfortable to be around my brother I’m afraid to come visit my parents house for the holidays. I need to get it off my chest. I need someone to listen. I need reassurance that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable and what he’s doing is disrespecting the boundaries I’ve tried to put up with no care of my emotional wellbeing. And if I could get some advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I don’t want to be scared visiting my parents knowing my brother is in the same vicinity. I don’t feel safe around him. I don’t think he’d ever attack me, but I feel objectified and fetishized along with how he refuses to respect any boundaries I put up about things he does that make me uncomfortable. I’m at the end of my rope and need help from other lesbians even if it’s just a shoulder to cry on. My therapist and psychiatrist are straight so they can’t fully understand. I don’t know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The sexually implied uncomfortable situations began sometime last year. Last year he started trying to write a book. Good for him! He asked me, his lesbian sister who has been out since I was 11 and he was 6, for insight on how sapphic relationships work for his writing. I thought this was an innocent enough question. I was glad he was attempting to add some kind of diversity to his story. He later made me read part of his story (with pressure from our parents for me to read it just to cheer him up) that talked about a succubus thief, who is bisexual leaning more sapphic, and apparently resented the fact she was born a succubus, that was after some kind of treasure. When she needed to incapacitate any guards she’d pass she’d give them a sultry glance and the guards would ejaculate so hard they’d pass out. I was incredibly uncomfortable with this and left my parents house early that day. He would further go on to take the old yuri manga I collected in middle school (oh, early puberty) and did god knows what with them. All I know is some of the pages are stuck together now with something crusty and it’s really upsetting… I threw them out and cried a little because I was so scared about what that crusty sticky shit was. I didn't want to tell my parents or friends, let alone confront my brother, because I was so disgusted and embarrassed.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier in the year I was doing an internship for my degree. I worked 9 – 5. At 10AM my brother texts me to tell me that he thinks he may be transgender and he wants to kill himself. Even though my brother an I have never been close, that’s still my little brother. Despite the fact I tried to call him immediately I was immediately sent to voicemail multiple times. I freak the fuck out and try to find a number to his out-of-state university that will send someone to do a welfare check on him, fearing that he had hurt himself, or worse. I shut myself in an office that wasn’t being used and played telephone tag all the time feeling like I was about to pass out. I got to the point of desperation where I even called my mom to try to get the number and struggled because I couldn’t tell her what was wrong with him in case he really was trans, because that would be outing. When I finally got a welfare check arranged, I burst into tears of relief that someone was going to make sure my little brother was okay. One of my supervisors came in, looked at me for a moment, and asked me “Hun, do you wanna go home for the day?” God bless that woman, but I just recently started my internship and it was so embarrassing. Later in the day I got a call back from the social worker informing me that my brother was just fine, but he had apparently turned off his phone for his calculus class. He thought it was a smart idea to send this terrifying “I think I want to kill myself” message at the beginning of my work day and then just cut off all communication. He was pissed I called the school to check up on him after he left me with the impression he was about to fucking kill himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I did talk to him about the ghosting incident for a bit. He talked about how he felt like he couldn’t relate to women as a straight guy and thought he’d have better chances with lesbians as a woman. He also said things such as he likes how women have softer skin and shave their legs. He then told me he had shaved his ENTIRE BODY with an old razor he’d been using for several weeks. Knowing that his skin was about to go through hell I told him he needed to get some body scrub and lotion or he was gonna have hella ingrown hair. He ended up going back to our parent’s house for a while and took my willingness to give advice on how to prevent hella painful ingrown hairs as permission for him to help himself to all the nice products I keep for whenever I’m staying over with my folks. This included my Venus razors (those razor heads are fucking EXPENSIVE), my nice bodywash and lotions, my epilator (which he asked for advice on how to use and got pissed when I asked him not to use my bodily grooming device). He also purchased a skater mini skirt and sent me several photos posing somewhat suggestively in the mini skirt and a video of him twirling around in it with the text “skirt go spinny”. When I told him I was uncomfortable with him telling me about his bodily grooming adventures and him using my (again, expensive) grooming products without my permission, he proceeded to try to guilt trip me and tell me what a horrible person I was for “leading \[him\] on” by giving him advice on the ingrown hairs. If it does turn out that he is actually trans and this is just a really weird start with hella internalized misogyny or whatever, I could cope with that better. But with the way he’s been handling it I just don’t feel comfortable with how much he shares with me and how much he expects from me in return. He’s even asked for me to explain to him how “good” lesbian sex works.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s also been fetishizing lesbians long before the text-and-ghost fiasco happened. There was an incident when I was in high school. I was home alone with my brother and my girlfriend. My gf and I, being frisky teenagers, made out for a bit in my bedroom. She heard a noise and we looked at the door to see the shadow of footsteps from the light illuminatig under the door. When I got up to unlock and open the door to my brother’s room slammed and locked. My gf and I were fucking mortified to reach the realization that he had been pressed against the door listening to us trying to quietly make out in my bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

He started trying to engage in conversations with me about how lesbian relationships are “cute”. It bothered me that he uses the words “cute” and “pure” to describe lesbian relationships. He’d tell me how much he wanted a bisexual girlfriend so they could “gush over girls together” and maybe even get a threesome out of it. This, coming from my socially stunted sibling who has never once had a romantic relationship. He would tell me that he wanted to be in a lesbian relationship because lesbians were “so cute”. I can’t put my finger on it but him constantly describing lesbians as “cute” like it’s something to gawk at or romanticize made me uncomfortable. Seeing as I was out of the closet at a young age for both of us and have been an open lesbian active in the LGBT community ever since then, over a decade, I feel like I of ALL people would have noticed some sort of gender incongruity there. But I haven’t. I’ve seen the growth of a little boy who has grown into a young man and is utterly incapable of making and maintaining friendship. He thrives from toxic masculinity and has expressed extreme disgust for anything “girly” all through his life. This recent gender questioning only began after he went to uni out of state, freshman year being during COVID in 2020, and apparently got increasingly invested in consuming cartoon lesbian porn on a regular basis. Again: He has expressed he has zero desire to change pronouns, his name, and expressed disgust at the idea of undergoing any physical transition.

&amp;#x200B;

I did later try to help him out by recommending some subs for potentially trans people questioning gender. I made the mistake of snooping through his reddit subs to add other subs I thought may be helpful. There were absolutely no subs to any trans help or trans meme subreddits. There were, however, well over a dozen different subs about lesbian porn and lesbian cartoon porn. I couldn’t look much further before I exited and deeply regretted my attempt to help him find resources. I know normally you shouldn’t snoop on someone elses reddit when they leave their computer out, but I thought I was helping by subbing him to trans communities. I wouldn’t have even looked at what he was subscribed to if the first 10 images on his front page weren’t hentai of disturbingly young looking girls and cartoon lesbians. I really did try to be a supportive big sister at the beginning. I tried to help him find sources by trans people for trans people that could help him, because just because I’m a lesbian doesn’t mean I’m an expert on all things LGBT. Instead what he really wanted to know what how women groom themselves to look sexy, what lesbians were like, and asked for yuri or other lesbian media recommendations from things I already liked. It’s gotten to the point I can’t talk to him and feel like I’m about to have a panic attack when I’m alone in a room with him. He does have a therapist, but I have absolutely no idea what they’ve been talking about and knowing my brother I severely doubt he’s bringing this up in an attempt to avoid addressing it. I hate to say this because I know it’s something that I know has been used against genuine trans women in the past, but I genuinely believe he has a sissy fetish and, according to numerous licensed therapists I’ve talked to about this, possibly a sister fetish.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so dirty. I feel fetishized and objectified. The same guy that accused me of faking my rape to try to get a guy I “didn’t like” in trouble with other MRA bullshit as recently as last year. His interest in potentially being a woman is entirely sexual and based on the false idea that women have easier lives. He’s using me to gather sexual information and refuses to use any of the trans resources I’ve found for him. The holidays are coming up soon and I don’t know what to do. I’m in tears writing this. Again, I’m sorry it’s so long and disorganized. I don’t know who to talk to about this. I’m scared. I feel violated.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel the urge to reiterate that I don’t believe this represents how trans women are. I don’t think my brother is a trans women. I’m not bashing trans women AT ALL here. I’m just a terrified big sister that’s becoming more and more afraid of my younger sibling every week.

&amp;#x200B;

All advice appreciated. Please help me."
q54h3k,1,2021-10-10,What advice will you guys have for a 2nd year CS student?,cstudent0147,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q54h3k/what_advice_will_you_guys_have_for_a_2nd_year_cs/,"Hello everyone,   
I am a CS student currently pursuing my bachelor's degree. I am in 2nd year of my 4-year degree tenure. I am excellent at pretty much all the academic subjects. I have excelled in every theory and math-related subject so far. By this point, I have a good grip on OS, Compilers, Automata, Assembly, Object-Oriented Programming, and Algorithms. So from an academic point of view, everything seems to be working out well for me.   One big issue that I am seeing with this is that while learning all this, I have paid very little attention to the actual ""industry-standard"" stuff. A lot of my classmates, despite not being good at academics, have spent a significant portion of their time learning skills like ""Web development"", ""App Development"", ""Flutter"", ""React"" and all the crazy modern frameworks and technologies that you hear nowadays. Some of these classmates have even landed jobs and internships. 

I feel inferior in the sense that I don't have experience with any of these (except for knowing just HTML and CSS). I feel that by the time I graduate, I will have to struggle in finding and landing good jobs that will not only help put food on the table but also help me with future studies as well.   
Although, last year I did get some freelance work for a Java-related project (that doesn't pay off regularly) and this has been the only commercial project that I have been involved with (but my work was mainly on the frontend side of java -- which no one really wants these days).   


What kind of advice would you have for someone like me?

 I am not interested in Web Development (since it's very less algorithmic. I prefer algorithmic areas), but I understand a large portion of the industry works with the web all the time.  I have the basic gist of many CS sub-fields, but I lack technical expertise and experience. I will mention, though, that I am a really fast learner. 

Anyways, really hoping to hear what you guys have to add to this."
q57pgw,4,2021-10-10,How can I let my manager know that I’d like to keep working with them after my internship?,uramichii,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/q57pgw/how_can_i_let_my_manager_know_that_id_like_to/,"Hello! This is my first time posting here and I think this post follows the sub’s rules but please forgive me/delete it if I’m mistaken.  

As the title says I’d like to know how can I approach my head manager to tell her that I’d like to keep working with them after my internship ends in November. 

I’m 25 (F), living in the EU and currently interning at a multinational publishing company in the Digital and Costumer Support Department after getting a master’s degree in Publishing and Communications.

I get along with my whole team (they are super nice) and both the head manager and my project manager seem to be very happy with my work, as they have been giving me more and more responsibilities in the last month (example: I’m currently collaborating with the UK/US team in a project related to a new product the company is trying to implement here and that, if everything goes well, will result in huge profits for us).

The HM asked me recently if I’m planning to stay in the country after the internship (I’m a non-EU citizen) and if I’d be interested in maintaining my rapport with them. I said that I’d love to but we haven’t talked about it after that (it was an informal conversation on our way out of the office).

The thing is, this is a pretty hectic period for the team (everyone’s incredibly busy all the time) and there will be some big structural changes in the company following next year (aka there’s a lot of uncertainty about the future) so:  

- I don’t know **when is the best time** to bring it out.  
- I don’t know **what would be the best way** to ask it about it.  

Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated!"
q58x16,218,2021-10-10,Friendly reminder to not do drugs depending on your career interests,BoBigBed,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/q58x16/friendly_reminder_to_not_do_drugs_depending_on/,"I’ve posted this before but figured newer students might need a heads up. 

If you plan on having a career in the federal government (DoD, State Dept., FBI, Energy, etc.) or in the defense/aerospace field (Booz, Lockheed, GD, SpaceX), you need to abstain from doing drugs until it is legalized at the federal level. It being legal in your state (NY, CA, etc.) does not matter.

If you have done any drugs, including marijuana, within a year before your conditional offer of employment, you have a much lower chance of getting cleared for the job. You may either get a suitability denial or clearance denial. Both take you out of the job offer, and the latter leaves a black stain on your record for future cleared jobs. Frequent habitual use is usually mitigated by at least 1-2 years of abstinence.

I know several people who had to forfeit internships and job offers do to recent drug use. It sucks and I don’t want people to find themselves in those positions due to ignorance."
q59aio,269,2021-10-10,My tips on how to get a programming position | From 0 to paid internship,jerrykapa,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/q59aio/my_tips_on_how_to_get_a_programming_position_from/,"Hey everyone,

Tomorrow I will be starting my paid internship as a Front End dev with Angular and I thought I would share what I did well and what I didn't do so well throughout my journey (I am currently in my last year of Bachelor in Linguistics and I live in Europe). Instead of telling you my life story, I will try to offer advice on what I think would have made everything better.

**Don't ""learn"" a programming language, start by finding out what you would like to do.**

Even with my super limited experience I realized how important this is. In 2019 I figured that it would be cool to be a software dev and I started to learn Python with no clear goal in mind. Obviously after 3 months or so I gave up, knowing more than I did before but still clueless about what the process is. One year ago I started getting into Web Development by doing Freecodecamp, and I've been sticking to it until now.

**Don't spend a lot of time of what resources you should use.**

A lot of people spend so much time asking for pointers on where should they learn from. While it is important to have a good learning source, you're going to gain most of your knowledge by googling and struggling through stuff, and no amount of tutorials is going to replace that. Freecodecamp, The Odin Project or youtube courses are all valid sources to learn from if you want to do Web Dev. I did Freecodecamp until I finished the javascript libraries course, then watched John Smilga's React course, but ultimately ended up getting an Angular position. (I've just barely started learning Angular).

**Do manage your time.**

This one caused me a lot of trouble. Without time management, I was sometimes skipping days or just being overall lazy or ""not feeling like it"". What's important, I think, is that you set a realistic daily goal for yourself and stick to it no matter what. I started with 1 hour a day, then moved on to 2, and lately I've been programming around 2-5 hours a day. It's more about setting a goal and keeping at it than setting yourself up for failure by making unrealistic expectations.

**Learn how to apply to jobs properly**

This might depend on your location, but I found out that while just hitting apply on LinkedIn on hundreds of positions might eventually land you something, it is definitely not the best approach, especially if you're like me and have a completely unrelated Bachelor. Instead, what I did was either to go to the company's website and apply from there, or to E-mail one of the hiring staff directly with a message about your interest in a certain position at their company, your skills, and your CV. It goes without saying that having projects on your CV is a huge help. This is how I ended up getting 3 interviews, and I went with the company that I liked best. After your interview, an excellent thing to do is to write an E-mail to your interviewer thanking them for their time and that you're looking forward to your potential collaboration. What you could do to absolutely stand out is to call them and relay the message you would have sent in the E-mail. I know two friends that have gotten positions this way, and I regret not doing the same.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not easy, but it's definitely not impossible. I don't consider myself to be a good programmer in any way, but I'm trying to improve every day, and if I could do it, so could you. You can DM me if you need help with the application process, and I'll try to help you to the best of my very limited ability haha.

Lastly, if anyone has pointers on working with Angular, do leave a comment :)  I'm absolutely not prepared to work with a new framework after spending so much time learning React, but damn if I'll not try my best.

Good luck everyone, we'll all make it!"
q59mua,1,2021-10-10,Graduated 5 years ago and want to possibly get back into programming now what?,cardinalsfan4529,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q59mua/graduated_5_years_ago_and_want_to_possibly_get/," I graduated in 2016 with a degree in computer science from a pretty small school. I moved back to my hometown and couldn’t find a job. I did not have any internships while in school but in my final semester I worked on two different projects for companies that the school had partnered with. In school I mainly used C++ with some Java, PHP, and SQL. I had a few interviews for software engineer positions and felt I did well on the technical portion but did not receive any offers. I honestly became discouraged and needed to find something to pay my bills so then I found a job at a retail and kept looking for a couple more months but did not find anything. About a year after that I found a job with a pretty major service provider where I have my own route it is heavy in customer service with a bit of sales mixed in. In the last few months due to staffing issues with the company I work for it has become less enjoyable which has led me to wanting to possibly make a move to a different role. Anyways this has led me back to my schooling because I always enjoyed and felt I was performed well in all my classes. My question is what should I focus on to get back into programming? Should I do bootcamp or focus on online resources? I am worried that 5 years may be to much time after completely school."

q5d146,4,2021-10-10,Just want to share the story of my suicidal attempt,Key_Priority_4453,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5d146/just_want_to_share_the_story_of_my_suicidal/,"I never shared my story to anyone, but hopefully sharing it at here will makes me feel better. Here goes the story of my suicidal attempt 

During my childhood, I used to be physically abused by my mother because of my grade. My mom will beat me up whenever I get less than 80. When I was in high school, i isolated myself from everyone else and focus on my study. It's not that everyone around me is mean to me, they are nice, I just don't feel like open up to anyone. But after high school, I start to be more socialize and it went great (I still very shy though). Surprisingly, up until high school, I didn't felt suicide at all, despite terrible childhood and without any friend. 

I had a passion of becoming an artist or writer since I was little, but my mom told me that becoming an artist or writer doesn't give me income and dismiss my dream. So I studied engineering course during my university (doctor was my first choice for university but I didn't get it). It was not my ideal course but I still do pretty well. I managed to become the top student in the course. However, when it comes to the third year of my university, there is one subject that become my nemesis. I didn't perform well in this subject compared to my other subjects and this subject will impact a lot on my cgpa. This make me felt really depressed to the point where I felt suicidal for the first time. The thought of me being a complete loser drove me to the balcony to end my life, but at the end I didn't have the gut to do it.

I soon felt better and bounce back from my depression because my friends was there for me. When it was the start of my internship, I met my supervisor, which was attractive (in my pov) and really nice to me. I had a little crush on him because of his looks and personality. But that didn't last long since he was really busy and didn't have time to teach me some skill during my internship. I soon become depressed again, and this is the second times I feel suicidal, partly because of him, but also I fear that I won't be able to do well in my future because of the internship. This times I had tried to end my life by ingesting a bottle of pills, but I end up throwing up. I also tried to find a way to kill myself but I still didn't have the gut to do so. 

Because of him, I start to sign up on dating website, in which previously I never even imagined myself dating someone else since I was too focus on my study. I tried on tinder first then grindr. I soon realized that nobody on those apps want to date. Most of them just want to have one night stand. From the beginning thought of dating someone, I soon just want to have someone in my life and go along with the idea of one night stand. In the meantime, I was offer to become a project engineer in a company. Even though it was not the same as what I had studied, I still took the job. The job was overwhelming, mostly because I have social anxiety and the job required tons of social skill. But my coworkers were nice so I was fine at that moment. Then covid-19 hit, which force me to work from home.

Those period became the worst months of my life. Since I have a lot of spare time during covid-19, I started to have negative thought. I started to think about my life choices, especially regarding my job. I felt that I made a mistake to start at a job that I didn't even like solely because of the friendly environment. I started to feel suicidal again and that time, I tried to hang myself. I attempted multiple times but I failed to do so. There is one time it was really close. During that time, my vision went black, but when I woke up, I was on the floor. It turns out the belt I used was snapped and I fell to the floor. 

After quarantine, one of my boss offered me to become a programmer to help the company to design the website and perform testing on iot devices, in which I accepted since it seems like it didn't required any social skill. I started to feel better and my negative thought had slowly declined. The job was headache sometimes but still really fun, and my boss was really nice to me. Me, as a person who easily attached to someone, started to have feeling for him despite the fact that I didn't really know him that well. But lately, I started to read the news about terrible stuff that men have committed and I started to have the negative thought again. I started to question everything about myself, why am I attracted to men, why am I choose the job, why am I choose the course, and why am I even born. The self-hatred inside me grew stronger everyday. I hate the fact that I am gay, I hate the fact that I have emotions, I hate the fact that I am a terrible person, and I hate the fact that I was born in this world.

Just before typing this, I tried to end my life by hanging myself again but still failed. I will try again this week and hopefully this will be the last moment of my life."
q5dfbb,256,2021-10-10,Amazon/Lyft/Unicorn offers 7 internships completed or offers signed AMA,Im-Always-Lost,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q5dfbb/amazonlyftunicorn_offers_7_internships_completed/,"**TLDR** I just recently signed a part-time internship with a Unicorn for my winter semester, a summer internship with Amazon and an off-season full time internship with Lyft for Fall of 2022. Once I complete these internships I will have completed 7 internships while in college. All while attending a school with that is barely top 100 for CS. AMA

**Timeline:**

My first programming job was at my schools IT department where I started at $12 an hour and worked on an internal mobile app. I started this job in the middle of first semester.

Summer after freshman year I was lucky enough and got an internship with a F100 Bank. I worked in a backend capacity working a lot with AWS.

After summer, I returned to my part-time IT programming job where it turned into more of a data entry job. I immediately started looking for work elsewhere and found a part-time internship with a webhosting company. I started there my second semester of my sophomore year and again worked in a backend capacity writing endpoints and refactoring a lot of unit tests.

I returned to F100 Bank for the summer. Again working in a backend capacity.

When this fall semester started I had lined up a part-time internship with a small health tech company. Here I am working on the AI team.

In the past month I have signed offers for a part-time internship with a Unicorn for next semester, Summer internship with Amazon, and a Fall internship with Lyft.

I have seen posts about people talking about how they did these kinds of things or how they got all their internships in general so I wanted to make a post to try and help anyone struggling.

My story and advice has worked for me but may not work for everyone. I also have had the goal of  having offers from unicorns/Fang type of companies so my advice is geared towards that. However, I do firmly believe that good Swe jobs exist in every state and at non-tech companies too.

Some non-tech companies follow processes that are different than what I will talk about below, but again my goal was Unicorn/FANG not non-tech. If your goal is different plan towards that instead.

The steps I followed were really simple:

1. Get interviews
2. Pass interviews

I know this may be obvious but these are the only steps you need to pass to get a job.

**How to get an interview**

The following are the most important to prioritize getting on your resume to get as many interviews/OAs as possible (in my experience of course):

* Experience you are paid for like jobs
* Experience you aren’t paid for like side projects/class projects etc
* Referrals
* Leadership Experience
* Misc

It is important to format your resume in a way that shows impact too.

Don't just say I wrote code to create new screens in an app.

Instead say, Saved 3 hours a week by creating screens in an app that did X.

Front load your bullet points with these kinds of metrics and just estimate them as best as you can. Be able to answer the question: How did your work save those hours? or How did your work save that money? etc.

Fact of the matter is the recruiter or engineer isn't going to be able to know for sure if what you are saying is true, so as long as you believe that the cause of your work is what you say it is and can defend that belief you are good.

Below I talk about unpaid experience and referrals because I believe the rest are rather self explanatory but feel free to ask more questions about it if it is unclear.

**Experience you are not paid for**

Personally, I despise unpaid internships unless you need more accountability to create a side project which unpaid internships can provide. However, I have found success with this by finding a friend and just setting goals together and some deadlines and working on a project both of y'all think is cool.

Hackathons were also a great way for me to have accountability.

Hackathons were a great way for me to have weekends set aside to create something I thought was cool and on things that aren't touched on in classes. Working with apis is something that has only been touched on in one of my classes but has been used in all my side projects and was the key for me getting my first job with my schools IT department. My manager later told me that he was only holding onto resumes where the person had experience using or writing apis.

While I was working on getting side projects on my resume I was also applying to everything I could find even when the roles mentioned they were only looking for juniors. I was able to get a few interviews with no name companies and local companies that I practiced with and was super lucky to get the interview with the F100 Bank.

**Referrals**

LinkedIN is huge.

Message people you have a connection with, people who have graduated from your school in the past and are now working at the company you wanna work for, people who have an achievement you have, people who worked at a place you used to work at, etc.

A solid template I have used is:

Hi \[name\], I saw you graduated from \[school\] and are currently working at \[company\]. I am a current CS student at \[school\] and \[comapny\] is one of my dreams places to work. I would love to talk to you more about what I can do now to be as prepared as possible for interviews/working there. Would you have 10 minutes to chat about this or we could even message on here if that works best for you?

Thanks, \[name\]

From here take their advice and when it comes time to apply follow up with them. Tell them your progress and ask if they would be willing to refer you.

Blind is also huge.

I have gotten referrals to several Big tech companies simply by searching on blind for the company name + referral and then DMing the person asking if they could refer interns.

Getting to know upper classmen is also huge.

Join clubs, talk to people get to know them, then if they have worked somewhere where you want to work, talk with them about it. This has led to a few referrals but has also given me insight into some smaller companies in my area and how to best prepare for them.

**How to pass an interview**

This part does have a lot to do with practicing Leetcode but also Luck.

My routine has been to spend at least one hour a week but aiming for 4-5 hours a week studying/practicing problems. It is really hard to get started but after doing it for a month or so in my freshman year it became a habit and wasn't too hard to practice.

Of course I am by no means perfect and have missed several weeks but the important thing is to keep trying.

Some topics took longer than others but I am now confident I can solve or get close to an answer for most medium problems in a 30 minute time frame.

Even still, I have bad days where I completely bomb interviews, I get interviewers who don't appear to care, or I get asked rare obscure problems.

This is a part of the process.

It is important to not tie your self-worth to passing interviews, these problems are not reflective of your skills as a SWE but are instead a way for companies to prioritize not getting false positives even if that means getting false negatives.

By this I mean companies are more concerned with making sure no one gets through the process who doesn't have the skills than they are with making sure those who do have the skills do get through.

Leetcode is by no means a perfect system but it is the best these companies have at the moment.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk, hopefully this can be of some kind of use to someone out there.

q5gep7,5,2021-10-10,Did I make a mistake turning down an interview? Advice for a new grad :(,Global_Abrocoma_2798,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q5gep7/did_i_make_a_mistake_turning_down_an_interview/,"I (22 recent college grad) turned down a final round interview with an organization I interned at 2 years ago. This organization is very well known internationally and WAS my dream place to work at. Although my internship with them was unpaid, I was working full time (40+ hours a week) and creating national campaigns, virtual events, and marketing strategies from the ground up. I became burnt out with this internship and was relieved when it ended (staff didn't treat me that well, called me the wrong name on purpose, never said thank you for my work and took credit for it, etc.)

Recently, they had a position open up that was a good fit (with a different team) and I applied. Got all the way to the final interview and had to create a project and present it to them. I worked incredibly hard to impress the interviewers just to get ghosted after the interview. Weeks later, another staff member reaches out to me about another position. I go through with the interviews and make it to the final interview, and once again, I'm asked to create a project and to present. At this point, I'm overwhelmed and decide to cancel the final interview. The interviewer was really nice and asked if I'd be willing to interview in the future, as I was a strong candidate. I still declined.

Now, I can't help feeling like I made a mistake. I guess I was so overwhelmed with having to create a whole project just for a job interview and potentially not to even get the job. 

Did I make a mistake? Is it too late to say I am available for the interview? I think I'm just feeling regret because this would be my first job out of college and getting a job at this organization is very competitive. On the flip side, I have a part-time job that I enjoy and it pays well hourly (just wish it was full-time). I just started and it would look bad for me to quit after a week. 

I'm faced with a lot of different thoughts and I'm someone who wants to always figure something out and get the ""best"" opportunities because of my high expectations. Any advice would be great or reassurance that I'll be okay (lol) would be great!!"

I'm in HS and will start looking for internships pretty soon. I wanted to know what they were actually like though. To my understanding interns basically do the easy, boring stuff the real employees don't have time for. 

Stuff like making spreadsheets, organizing filing cabinets, taking calls, making coffee, etc. And that as long as you do a good job, treat others with respect and have a good attitude about the internship. You're good. Depending on the company you may get a full time offer. However this mainly comes from movies so it may be different in reality. So Reddit, what are tech internships actually like?"

For example, we are taught that a standard CV should have:

* **First and last name**
* **Date of birth -&gt; illegal question in USA -&gt; can deduct age-&gt; age discrimination**
* **Nationality -&gt; illegal question in USA -&gt; ethnicity discrimination**
* **Marital status -&gt; illegal question in USA -&gt; discrimination against people with children**
* **Contact information**
* **Passport-size photo -&gt; illegal in USA -&gt; ethnicity/gender/looks discrimination**

Also in USA you don't put the dates of your university and jobs as an employer could deduct your age. For an internship one of my university colleagues even put the profession of his parents.

Do you think we need to implement the same measure as in USA? or do you think that our society is more tolerant and it doesn't have the same crony capitalism problems as in USA (for example firing a pregnant woman) and such measures are unnecessary."

Currently I am a senior in high school working towards to applying to college as a CS major. I've actually gotten acceptances at my safety schools and ASU.

Naturally, from those acceptances, I started browsing the usual CS subreddits. As even though I have to apply to my other colleges and finish my senior year strong, I want to get an idea what I need to do next year, whichever college I end up picking.

But every single fking time, the top posts are always people being complete assholes to each other. Whether or not they an URM and they got the internship based on affirmative action. Making fun of colleges people go to, not doing enough leetcode, etc. I even had people say that I'm trash for having ASU as a target school.

Like, listen i completely get that. ASU isn't my first choice either but can't I least be happy that regardless of how my other college applications go, I'll be going to college to study CS? That it takes a big pressure off my back knowing that, I can go there and work hard and learn everything I can about this field? I know that I won't have the same advantages of someone who goes to MIT or other tech schools and I'm going to have to work harder to get my name out there in internships and leetcode but I'm prepared to do that.

Is all of CS like this? I mean, we had assholes during high school but everyone just knew they were assholes

I'm just not sure. I wanted to rant and get them out there."

I love my job, am good at it and my employer has made it very clear that they respect my work and value added to the company. I like the people I work with very much and everyone is pretty down to earth. They have already made it clear that should I become dissatisfied with my position, they will work to help create a position for me that keeps me engaged and satisfied. The compensation, benefits and comments I get from people I work with show that they definitely care about me and want to help me do what I can.

Here's the rub, it is in rural western Ohio, I grew up in suburban NE Ohio so I kinda knew what to expect. I only have three real options of towns to live in nearby. One I think I will move to at some point b/c it is the best of the three options (people debate if the city I live in now or the third city is the lesser of them). My problem is though that all three towns would be fine if I had a wife, kids, and a house but I don't have any of those things. They all remind me where I grew up where my friends and I would literally drive around for fun b/c there was so little to do. I still do the same now, either on my motorcycle when the weather is nice, or car when raining. There are maybe 3 people my age at the company either - are are engaged/married and the rest are older and with kids/their own lives. Many people commute extremely long distances (1+ hours one way) to work at this company. That is a great reflection of the company, but I think the reverse is true in that it shows the people that work there don't want to live there unless they happen to live there before joining the company. None of my friends from high school or college are close either, at least and hour and a half drive away. I tried those meetup type websites, and there weren't any groups within a 30 min drive, at all- not just groups I wasn't interested in and am not sure how to meet other people since there aren't many places around here that aren't chain stores/restaurants.

One of the local interns this summer told me that she could tell within 5 seconds I wasn't from around there, despite growing up in the same state, and asking around, it seems that most people can tell I am not a local (small town problems I guess). I now spend time in town (at the grocery store, barbershop, parks, etc. feeling that I am an outsider here).

I do not want to move to a ""big city"" and would prefer having a house and something more scenic than flat cornfields around me. I especially don't want to live in a city with all the general craziness in politics and what not at the moment.

Any advice on how I should handle this situation? Should I stay living in a place I don't like with a great job or wait a while, save up some money and move to a place where I'd rather be but leave I job and people I enjoy?

I decided to become a software engineer by enrolling in a 2nd bachelors' program for CS online and try my luck at school while I taught.

Let me tell you, every month was a struggle as I struggled to balance my teaching workload (as a CS teacher) while digesting stuff from engineering school while preparing for interviews... But that finally paid off. I finally got an offer for a summer internship at a tech company near the place I live (i.e. not the West Coast/NY/Chicago/Austin or any of the traditional tech centers) for $50/hr (with overtime paid at 1.5) with corporate housing provided free of charge and free H/D/V. I will also be guaranteed a return offer of 120k/yr after the internship.

I was told that my offer was way different from other interns since I have been with them for such a long time, but I found out that others that have no experience were offered the same or almost the same as me.. another thing that made me a bit upset is that the intern that I am training is making the same as me.

1 supplemental from Princeton University postdoctoral researcher (9/10? more on this below)

1 from counselor (9/10? unlike a lot of students who don't really talk about themselves much with their counselor, I've said some pretty important stuff regarding my home situation over the last few years.

Coursework: I skipped two levels of math classes between 9th grade and 10th grade, so I went from Geometry to AP Calculus BC (which I got a 98% in as well as a 5 on the AP exam), and skipped two levels of Spanish because I moved in from a district that started foreign language later. My guidance counselor will explain all this skipping in his recommendation letter.

college coursework (taken since summer before 11th grade at my STATE UNIVERSITY (not a community college)) - Logic, Multivariable Calculus with Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Advanced Linear Algebra (crosslisted as a graduate course), Complex Analysis (I was hoping to take Abstract Algebra this semester but they only offered morning classes and I had school then). I have also received college credit for my 11th and 12th grade Spanish classes. I am receiving/have received all As (no A+s are offered at this university), except the graduate-level Linear Algebra, which I got an A- in.

The above college is ranked #26 for colleges for mathematics (among all institutions) in the United States. Its applied mathematics program is also ranked #3, although I'm more fond of pure math.

I've overall been at the maximum course levels for every subject.

Awards/Recognitions:

I've been published in a district/news article because of how much advanced math work I've done - I've completed the most anyone has in my district.

Teacher Assistant, Math Circles Summer Mathematics Camp at UC Berkeley: Supervised competitions among middle-school students as well as formulated and constructed competitive puzzle problems remotely

Vice President of the school Computer Science Club - primarily plans the general schedule of daily meetings, and more small-scale details. I am co-mentoring the Data Science and Machine Learning programming class.

Assistant Inventory Manager for a newly-founded computer repair club - we ship out used computers to those in need, it's pretty cool. The club has gained 50+ members since its founding in April.

Hospital Volunteer (on hiatus since March 2020) - gained over 400 hours with this. I've worked in the transport department, and with some employees with special needs/mental disabilities. The nature of this activity, while it can be seen as a 'dime in a dozen' type of thing, is actually really important to me in terms of the friendships I formed with the special needs over our common interests.

Information Technologist for an astronomy education nonprofit - we've made presentations to inner-city elementary schools, explaining things like general relativity in a very simple way and it's been pretty fun until COVID hit.

Treasurer of the school Computer Science Club - Taught Introductory Programming and Intermediate Video Game Production class in weekly meetings and take on the responsibility of general financial oversight as Treasurer.

Treasurer of my high school's research program

Clubs: DECA, Math Team, National Honor Society, Science Olympiad, Computer Science Club, Board Game Club

Research/Upper-level work (the first three I did because I am able to be treated as an undergraduate at my university):

1. Proving that the operations of Neural Regulatory Networks (or Liquid Time Constant RNNs) are able to capture in a much more succinct fashion than those of NeuralODEs can.
2. Implemented Reynolds model in the WebGL-based 3-D simulation environment for flocking behavior in multi-agent systems.
3. SPAA '21 Conference - Fast Fourier Transforms and Implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Method with Stencil Transformations. Worked on and implemented a new algorithm with record-breaking speed (thousands of times faster than state-of-the-art electromagnetic grid projectors).
4. Research Intern at a National Laboratory (Cosmology) - Linear derivations of self-similar parameterizations to the matter-dominated era of the universe. It's very heavy on mathematical fluency and I really like it.
5. Topological properties of images of Geodesic circles in S\^3 projected to knots in L(3,1). This was done with my Logic professor. After performing well in my class, I decided to reach out to him for a research mentorship and he was impressed with what I've done as a high schooler.
6. !! IMPORTANT !! - I have been mentored in graduate-level real/Fourier analysis under a postdoctoral researcher who I met at Princeton University (I was visiting it in December 2019) at an Indian restaurant in the adjacent town of Princeton, NJ. He recently moved to London, though. He has described me as 'truly gifted' and is writing a supplemental letter of recommendation for my application. We are currently working through *Principles of Mathematics Analysis* by Walter Rudin and *Fourier Analysis* by Elias M. Stein (who himself is a late, renowned mathematician from Princeton University)

Paid Employment:

Pros: big name, don’t need relocate, higher pay, intern can extend to 4 months 

Cons: not know team and manager, just depends on luck



Salesforce 

Pros: relocation fee, already know team and manager, better benefits and return rate

I want to know beforehand what I am lacking in and try to improve it within the next year.

1.   I graduated from Community College with a 3.8 and transferred to UCSD in Electrical Engineering.
2.   I graduated from UCSD with a 3.8 specializing in Machine Learning and System Controls (though I enjoyed taking DSP courses so I don't mind doing an intersection of ML/DSP)
3. I am now currently enrolled in UCSD's BS/MS program specializing in ML and DS
4. I have minimal research experience. I did a brief summer internship with my school for about six months (we started in March), I am currently working with a CogSci research group and may publish a paper in the next few months, and I am interviewing with a few new groups (some have offered to bring me on board but I want to wait until I finish my current project). These new groups are more aligned with my interest in ML/DSP/CV.
5. I don't have any work experience outside of the  summer internship I did with my school (though I have been applying looking for an internship for this summer)
6. I have not taken the GRE yet but I have been studying and reviewing the material. 

The schools I am interested in are Stanford, MIT, CMU, Cornell, UCB, and while I want to attend UCSD (people have advised me to go out and spread my wings somewhere else). What do you think I am lacking it? Strengths?

I'm currently in my third year in undergrad majoring in Cell and Molecular Biology at a huge state school and can't help but feel super lost when it comes to grad applications. I was basically at a standstill during the summer after my freshman year, as there were no available internships and I was unable to go into labs or do any networking. I've slowly been able to return to normal, with now accumulating some basic experience as a research assistant, currently working on a review paper, and as a director in my sorority.

However, I worry this isn't enough to make up for my lackluster grades. I did really poorly my first semester (2.45 GPA)  my freshman year, due to severe mental health issues. While this was a documented medical emergency, I'm well aware of how taboo it is, and therefore it is difficult to justify on my applications. I have since been able to raise my CGPA to a 3.56 and STEM GPA of 3.54, and my departmental GPA overall has been a 4.0. But these stats are still, as I mentioned, lackluster.

I have professors I'm currently working with who are willing to write LoR, which I know cause they have mentioned it in passing multiple times. However, I wondering if it works asking them considering how many people will differ to the next application cycle and my chances against them.

What my question is now is what do I do? Do I have a shot at the next admissions cycle? Do I plan on a gap year and attempt to get more experience so my ug GPA has some support in my application?"

I'm a CS senior graduating in Spring 2022. I applied for the Software Engineer, University Grad role at Facebook and a recruiter just contacted me asking some questions about my graduation date, eligibility for intern or full time, and some projects I would be interested in working for.

Recruiter asking my eligibility for intern or full-time seems like I can at least ask if I could be considered for the internship role instead (I'd tell him I want go to get my masters).

I heard Facebook's new grad SWE interview process is grueling (\~7 rounds) whereas the internship is 2 rounds with obviously a lower bar. I'm super excited they're trying to move forward with interviews but at the same time I really don't want to screw up this opportunity of potentially working at Facebook either as intern or full time.

Should I ask my recruiter to consider me for SWE intern instead? Obviously, getting a full-time offer at Facebook would be the best, but it wouldn't be too bad going to grad school for another year if I can at least have that chance to get that return offer if I manage to get the internship next summer.

Can anyone share their experience going through intern/full-time interview process at Facebook and recommend which route to take?

Thanks!"

This year, I got my first internship as .NET developer. After months, I landed my very first Software Engineer job in a start-up! It was pretty cool while it lasted. However my imposter syndrome kicks in. I had a lot of unrealistic assumption in my head and got me into a mental health problem. Yes, my supervisor asked me to catch up with the workload or to do at least one pull request a day. But my learning curve towards new framework like ReactJS and Ruby on Rails was so slow I couldn't keep myself up.

Eventually I quit my Software Engineer job to get myself a ""mental break"". I been seeing therapist myself too and trying to regain my confidence and accept my past failures. 

  
Recently I found a freelance job as a Java Backend Engineer. I only have basic Java knowledge took it in 2014 and 2016 for OOP (which I did pretty bad in D-).

I took a gap year in-between undergrad and my MFA program to ensure it was what I really wanted to do, apply for programs, work, etc. I don’t have any regrets about it and I love what I study, the work I do, and the internships I participate in. I currently teach college courses at my university as part of a scholarship so I will graduate with 0 student debt from undergrad and my masters (I got academic scholarships in undergrad). 

However, for the last few years I’ve been struggling with near constant health issues, immense life-stress (my sister struggled with an eating disorder, married an addict, had an unplanned pregnancy, developed alcoholism, and attempted suicide). I love my sister and while she has done so much to improve her circumstances, it was a series of really traumatic experiences that have really impacted me. 

I’ve also been coming to terms with the extent of an abusive relationship I was in that resulted in a sexual assault. Prior to all of this, I have had my own struggles with mental health, having had severe anxiety, depression, and some OCD tendencies related to my anxiety, and at the beginning of this academic year I came down with a terrible bout of shingles over my face; my doctors believe it’s due to extreme stress.

I love the work I do but I feel extremely worn down. A lot of the plans I had after graduation are things I’m not even sure I want to do anymore/will be capable of doing during a pandemic. I’m normally a very diligent worker, but I’m wrestling with constantly feeling exhausted, frustrated by the work I put out, and unable to keep up with all my responsibilities. I’m getting my degree in creative writing and I believe I’ll be able to find work, but right now I feel like im trapped in a cycle of constant anxiety, sickness, reliving old trauma, incurring new trauma, and despair over whether or not i’ll be able to find happiness at all if my life continues this way. 

I know this is temporary feeling, but I’m not sure what the best steps to take post graduation are. I wanted to teach abroad or travel but I’m not sure if that will be an option. I could immediately begin job hunting but I’m fearful of entering another environment that causes so much stress. I’ve been wondering if what I’m experiencing is burnout or just laziness. Part of me wants to take a break after school but I feel like that isn’t a responsible choice and I should find a job and start earning some money. I feel torn on what to do. 

Do you guys think it’s better to take a break or immediately look for work?"
q5vt4g,2,2021-10-11,Life circumnstances affected my early career and life - how do I get back on track?,boredmanonthemoon,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/q5vt4g/life_circumnstances_affected_my_early_career_and/,"Hi Everyone,

I'd really appreciate your advice on how to get my life back on track after a bumpy few years. Sorry in advance for the long post and vent - I wrote on this subreddit before but I really feel like a big failure, both personally and professionally.

My situation is the following: I am a 31 years old EU citizen living in the UK, I have a BSc and MSc in Managerial Engineering (a sort of mix of basic Engineering and Economics) from Italy and a MRes in Machine Learning from the UK, all 3 degrees obtained with highest honours and Dean's List. I co-authored 8 papers on ML algorithms (h-index 5).

For 6 years I have worked in London in the Tech industry as a Data Scientist / Business Analyst, and I detested it. In London, 99% of jobs in Data are about Social Media, Marketing, Product Analytics and Financial Services, problems I don't really care about. The culture of the companies in Tech is very oppressive and in general I hate the social climbing culture of the city. I had very bad luck with housing and flatmates and ended up having to move house (mostly against my will) 11 times in 6 years. I felt unsettled, unbelonging, unable to find a hobby or a friend or an escape from work, I have lived with mental fog unable to understand why my life was so miserable. I burned out several times and changed 7 jobs in the same time span (working mostly in ""cool"" companies but never feeling motivated). I got so depressed that in June my fiancee of 4 years left me, because she coudn't handle me anymore.

For long time I was scared to take a hiatus and rethink my life but because of Brexit, because staying in the UK without a salary and a safety net is not really an option and because my fiancee was British and I wanted to stay with her I continued on autopilot, ignoring all the red flags I encountered everyday. Now I live alone in a flat that is too expensive for me, without furnitures because my ex took them all, working from home in a small town outside of London without a single friend - I was diagnosed with mood disorder and I barely manage to get up and work everyday. I want to go back home to stay with my family for some time, but I don't even have a room or a bed to stay in either of my parents' flats.

Now I feel really down but I want to capitalise on my experience and use what I've learned in order to have a better life. I know the following:

* I am motivated by challenging technical problems that require concentration, continuous learning,  structured thinking and hard work, but I'm not much career driven in the classical sense.
* Being an Engineer, I miss working on something ""tangible"" or that pertains to physical systems, like industrial processes, IoT, sensors, renewable energy, agritech, etc... Working in Digital, convincing customers to buy more stuff, or working on abstract business problems don't really work for me.
* I am fluent in Python and SQL, and a tiny bit in Matlab, Java and R, but don't know other programming languages or technologies.
* I am not suited for large cities. Both London and my hometown (millions of people) are too big for me. I love being close to the countryside and live a less stressful life with more approachable and genuine people. Country of living is not a big deal, as long as it's in Europe.
* My current company (Fintech in London) would not help me to make any progress in that sense.
* I am open to start again from the bottom of the ladder.

I essentially feel that my career should be in Electronic / Automation / Software Engineering or Robotics but I completely lack almost any technical skill in that sense. My supposedly good academic background seems useless to get an Internship or a Junior role in the field, useless even to grant me admission to a third Masters in the field.

I am well aware that I'm a job hopper and that my profile as it is is completely unattractive to any employer. What can I do to fix this and explain my situation to them? I have thought about two options:

* Take time off, go back home, sleep in a sofa bed and learn everything technical I can (e.g. C++, IoT, some concepts of Electronics and Robotics). I will be jobless but at least I can dedicate 100% of my time to this change and to recover from my depression. If within a year I have found nothing I will try go back to uni to study Electronic / Automation Engineering. This is choice I am leaning towards.
* Stay in my company and in the UK, and try to make the change from here. I will have more financial independence, but I could dedicate maybe less than 10% of my time to this change, because of my work and life commitments and my depression.

I know that there's no black or white answer, but what kind of advice can you give me (apart from seeing a mental health therapist) on what should I do to fix my situation and on how I can convey the above in a job application / cover letter? I'd be so sad if all my efforts and good academic results are wasted because of these unfortunate circumnstances.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long and boring post 😅"

As far as I know right now, the odds seem equal, so here are my other reasons for McLean:

* Pay is basically the same, albeit I'll lose $3K from not taking the housing stipend
* There seems to be more outdoor activities + near other big cities
* Supposedly there are more technical positions available there and more opportunities to network
   * Not sure if McLean is more formal than Plano though
* I'd like to try a different city

1. Get ML experience

Though I do have previous military work experience in a technical job, if that counts for anything.

So, I guess I'm wondering:

 1) Is it the norm for student interns to be lacking in experience. Should I even apply if I don't already have an array of impressive projects to put on my resume?

2) If I do apply, what skills of mine should I emphasize? Does my military experience matter? Should I list all of the languages that I know? Does GPA, etc matter? Should I focus on specific companies, or do a shotgun approach and apply to everything?

3) What skills I work on to improve my chances between now and the interview? Leetcode, personal projects, etc?

Always told me she didn’t like the only reason I’m here in the US ( I’m from another country) was because of her. I’m going to school for chemical engineering. She always wanted me to have friends and be social and just be an adult but I couldn’t do that cuz I was too afraid. She’s so successful, she’s really out of my league. She asked me for time a month ago but I knew the ending already but kept lying to myself, I texted her yesterday to feel the waters and she said she doesn’t want to talk and she wishes me all the best. I know I have my issues, I’m jealous, insecure, and put all the weight of my happiness on her and I shouldn’t have done that. I was selfish and an idiot. I just don’t want to be here anymore, I feel like most of my college career has been a fluke, literally having people that hooked me up w homework or quizzes etc. I can’t find an internship, and now I lost her, I lost my best friend. This has been the worst year of my life because, my dad passed away because of covid too. I just don’t want to be here anymore, I can feel my depression creeping up again, something she helped me so much with… but i can feel it peeking. I can feel the cold, I can feel the emptiness around me."

Is the coding assessment basically like leetcode? What should I do to prepare for it?"
q653fl,1,2021-10-11,Am I overthinking this?,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q653fl/am_i_overthinking_this/,"Hey everyone,   
So I'm entering my second year of my CS degree (expected graduation in December 2023) and haven't been landing any experiential learning opportunities. I've had one internship offer at a local company but they required a very long commute so I turned them down. I've reached the final rounds of some very lucrative opportunities to be turned down in the end.

I was wondering if this might be from my general lack of experience or time away from graduation or if there is something I should be doing differently. I'm not super into the personal projects thing but I have a couple GUIs from my classes and a few small scripts I have on github for fun. I'm quite personable as far as the actual interviews and most go well over the expected time allotted. I don't think I'm an incompetent programmer or bad worker and I can provide my resume if anyone would do me a favor and skim it. 

Thank you!

q65k9x,1,2021-10-11,Student Developer - Career Help!,RileyGrotenhuis,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/q65k9x/student_developer_career_help/,"I'm currently a third year computer science student and am starting to think about internships/jobs and whatnot and I've come across a bit of a predicament.

I currently work for the university I attend as a Student Full Stack Developer. The work is good experience but the work is typically slow and I often find myself not working on many tasks during the day. It's a student employment position technically so I don't blame them too much for I'm not the top priority.

I've also been in the process of applying for internships all across the country (US) for this upcoming summer in hopes to get a wide range of experience before my college days are over. A few weeks ago, however; a recruiter from a local software company reached out and asked if I was interested in a part-time position with their company.

I would be working part-time at this new position (the same exact hours I am working now with classes) and I would then transition to full-time this summer when I am not enrolled in courses. The pay is exponentially better than what I get payed at my student employment position, which seems like a no-brainer to take it. But..

If I were to take this new position, I would have to deny any signings I got for internships this upcoming summer. However, if I kept my student employment position, they would allow me to work at an internship over the summer and then resume my employment when I come back for the following fall semester.

I think that getting an opportunity to work for these companies I applied to this summer would be an amazing opportunity, but I'm also not guaranteed any of those positions. I would have to accept this offer for the new company within the next month, and I most likely won't hear back on any offers until after this Winter. I would still have employment this summer with my current position if I were to deny the new position, but I honestly am not sure if I am able to continue working when the work is as slow as it is.

It's really a battle over getting better experience/pay right now, or risking the chance of denying this new opportunity for the chance of getting an internship this summer. Any advice would help a lot for I am having a lot of trouble thinking this one through."
q65qsm,10,2021-10-11,"No Mentor at work, what do I do?",Kusora741,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q65qsm/no_mentor_at_work_what_do_i_do/,"About 3 months ago I started my new/first job as a software engineer. The company I work for is relatively new to the United States but has been around since the early 90s in Europe. I am the first software engineer hired in the states, and any of my software counterparts are 9 hours ahead of me in Europe. As my day is beginning, theirs is ending.

I have a degree in CS but no prior internship or work experience to this job, so this is my first real gig. I currently don't do much other than just sit in the office from 8 to 11 twiddling my thumbs, and constantly asking for work to do, and then getting permission to stay home after lunch but ""being on call"".

Well one day I made comments to my supervisor (who isn't software, just an engineer who does designs for our machines), and some important people in our office in Europe about how our software is poorly written, that even an amateur like me could tell that it's complete spaghetti. It's so bad that when errors happen in our machine or bugs need to be fixed, it takes days, if not weeks sometimes, because of how poorly the code is put together and finding the source of the error or bug is a horrible process. I should preface by saying the code we write is structured text mixed with ladder logic (I work with PLCs). 

So I was then tasked to write a proposal and possibly rewrite the next generation of our machines using ""better coding practices"" and to make software ""better"". Well there is a HUGE problem. I understand the logic of how things work in our machine when I read it, I can read and write code as well as a recent grad can, but I have no idea how to put a whole system together. I don't know where to start, I don't have anyone to really ask. 

What should I do? I love the people I work with, I love the idea of our product, the TCP is higher than what I thought I would get and does a lot more than make ends meet. I would love to be the ""super star"" that my teammates think I am, and I would love to make needed changes to make our products more efficient and easier to work with when a problem arises, but I just have no idea where to start, or what I am doing. Ideas? Thoughts?


Tl;Dr: new grad with no experience. I was tasked with a project or reinventing our software possibly from scratch and don't know where to start. I have no Mentor and no real help. What do I do?


Thanks all"

I apologize if this question has been asked as I tried searching and couldn't find any threads with the keywords. I tend to do very well on coding challenges (past almost all that I have gotten the invite from) where I am able to relax and just enjoy the coding.  However, I struggle with social anxiety and when I'm doing pair coding interviews I feel very uncomfortable and nervous and it impairs my ability to think so I perform a lot worse on problems that I should've been able to solve when I later reflect on them. I know that this probably happens to everyone to a certain degree and the social anxiety is what I really need to (and am in the process!) of working on, however I was wondering if there are any jobs or internships that do their hiring solely or largely based on the coding challenges/assessments for the sake of my sanity in the meantime (last year of my CS degree)?

q687wp,0,2021-10-11,I'm looking for advice on getting started in CS,Novaline,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q687wp/im_looking_for_advice_on_getting_started_in_cs/,"I'm 23, graduated with a B.S in CS this May, and have been trying since March to get a job in the field. My degree has a concentration in AI &amp; ML, but I also took some Cybersecurity courses. Because of those courses, I have been applying to junior developer/programmer, as well as Netsec / Sys admin positions, that I see on LinkedIn or Indeed. Due to not have any internship experience or relevant IT work experience most of college (I was a server), it feels like I am already fighting an uphill battle. Admittedly, it feels like I am stuck in limbo right now trying to land my first job. I've had numerous interviews (some going to a second phase) but nothing seems to stick, despite the interviews seemingly going really well. At this point, it is pretty demoralizing (I try not to let it affect me too much but it does get to me sometimes) watching all my peers and friends from back home get into the field and be comfortable working while I struggle on Step 1. With my student loan payments approaching next year, I do feel an added amount of pressure to get something going for myself soon but I am at a loss. I truly believe once I get started I can successfully keep the ball rolling, but getting into the door is tripping me up. I'd appreciate any help or advice."
q68lin,8,2021-10-11,My first experience with my internship,IAgs73,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q68lin/my_first_experience_with_my_internship/,"Currently since there is no real way for me to get a job I had to study from the start of this year. Ofcourse the only course available was a course about trading and service.

I ended up in a local store and was promised verbally to get some hours if I did good from me. I managed to do everything my boss wanted me to do, I managed to sell extra stuff, even learned stuff on my free time so I could use the postage system so I could give customers their stuff they ordered online too. 

Fast forward 5 months. The week before my internship ended my grandmother passed away. I was in shambles. She was very close to me. I had to stay home for one day to recharge my mental battery in order to keep on smiling as I worked at the internship. 

The day I ended my internship is what made me hate bosses and working all together. I was told I was one of the best people that was in the cashier position and that I did everything flawlessly, but however, I was denied a position. Why? Well, the boss in question couldn’t ’trust my luck since I could lose them money because I stayed home that one day’. 

In my eyes this sounds like I was denied a position because my grandmother died. 
What are your takes on this?"

q69gp6,4,2021-10-11,Feeling a tad de-motivated lately in my job search,Dralafi_XIII,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q69gp6/feeling_a_tad_demotivated_lately_in_my_job_search/,"Background: I graduated with a CS degree in 2020 with a GPA of 3.01 (not kidding). Got a SWE internship based around theoretical computer science using Python (think image analysis), but took a cyber security job mostly out of desperation for money at the time. As of 2 weeks ago, I have transferred back into SWE, but it's mostly around ASP.NET with some bits of SQL and C# built-in. I am working on but have yet to finish a portfolio website built around React containing various projects I've done throughout the years. Just simple stuff: physics calculator made in Python, a JavaScript Blackjack web app, etc. That said, while I am grateful to the company I work for for taking me in and giving me my current SWE position, in the long run I want to do full-stack development based around React, as that's where the most plentiful of jobs are as well as typically the most paying (just being honest).

My problem is a lack of faith not in my abilities perse but that luck will not go my way. I've applied for several positions, namely Workday, Indeed, and Dropbox, among others. I was assured that I'd be a shoe-in for Workday, but it turns out I didn't get the job. My heart kind of sank after that. I know I should finish my portfolio website at a minimum, keep grinding away at Hackerrank and Leetcode, and eventually something will come up and go my way, but there's a part of me that just feels like the path from A (where I'm at now: \~$70k base, no TC package, old tech stack, not cozy job) to B (working on webapps using a modern tech stack, &gt;$120k base with TC benefits, cozy job) is so ambiguous and nebulous that it's not only not going to happen anytime soon but also not at all, and I'll just find myself jumping from okay-job to okay-job for the rest of my days. Anyone have any words of inspiration? I could use some right now."

**Field within CS**: Robotics

**Undergraduate Institution**: University of Washington, BS in Computer Science (not international student)

**GPA**: 3.76 out of 4.0

**GRE**: not taken yet, aiming for 168+Q, 162+V

**Research Experience**: six months of basic work, follower by soon to be three months of research study and analysis culminating in paper to be published after applications due, all directly related to my interest within robotics

**Publications:** above paper is aiming for RSS 2022

**Work Experience**: 2 FAANG internships, one unrelated to research, other very tangentially related 

**Letters of Recommendation**: 
1. well known robotics professor I came to this school to work research for, did research under his post doc for 6 months, under him for 3, strength will be determined by my research output in next few months
2. professor I TAed for the entirety of COVID, did lots of reworking curriculum to increase student engagement, should be strong
3. either internship manager who had very good impression of me, or the postdoc I worked under who is now assistant professor at another school (unsure which one to go with)

I made a short list based on schools that have similar projects to what I want to work on. I know it’s an ambitious list but my backup plan is to take the return offer I have from my internship and pursue PhD after a few years. I want to know what you think of my chances and any feedback/tips about my profile.

- Carnegie Mellon (PhD robotics, MSR)
- University of Washington
- Cornell (PhD only)
- MIT 
- Stanford (PhD only)
- Georgia Tech (PhD and MS)"

Does it matter where I get my IT degree (online vs. traditional college degree)? Would it be wise to accept the job and transfer over to an online program? Or should I bite down and finish my degree (currently at a junior level)?

The rest of the questions comprised of classes that I am taking currently so I had no idea how to do them.

Or even know what to learn?,spin1t,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q6d7qa/how_to_learn_more_than_leetcode_or_even_know_what/,"So basically I mastered Leetcode / DS&amp;A but still got destroyed in an SE internship interview... 

I am a college sophomore giving interviews for software engineering internships. I thought all I had to know was Leetcode and DS&amp;A so I studied my ass off and would say I know 100% Easy, 100% Medium and 50% of Hard questions on Leetcode. I did the whole thing in Python as that was suggested as the best interview giving language.

I thought that would be enough but during an interview today morning I got asked system design questions regarding a website and databases. I only have very basic knowledge in databases so I squandered the interview. They also asked if I knew Java, which I know but not as well as Python.

I felt a little caught off guard... I didn't know that ""I didn't know"" these concepts if that makes sense.

Is there any resource that will give a more holistic advice on what to know for tech interviews?!?"

q6ekew,1,2021-10-12,How to prepare for math and coding assessment for Mathworks internship application,dcfan105,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/q6ekew/how_to_prepare_for_math_and_coding_assessment_for/,"I applied for Mathworks engineering development group internship for next summer.  I already completed a prerecorded video interview and I guess they were satisfied with my responses because I got an email today asking me to complete a timed assessment on math and analytical reasoning skills and coding or Matlab skills (for the latter I'm supposed to pick of them, not do both).  I'm not worried about the math part but the part about it being timed worries me because I tended to need extra time on tests and I have accommodation for extra time at school.  

I'm also not that experienced with programming or Matlab.  I have some experience with both (I had a programming class with C++ and I've been learning some Python, partly for a class and partly out of my own interest; I also did some programming in Matlab for a math class, but it was a couple years ago and I've used it only a little bit since then) but not a ton.  

I honestly wasn't expecting to get a response for this internship since it sounded coding heavy and I'm an EE major instead of SE; I just figured I might as well apply and see what happened.  But now that I've at least got a shot, I want to do the best I can on the assessment, as this does sound like a really cool internship opportunity.  In addition to my concern about the time, I'm not quite sure how to prepare.  The assessment is on HackerRank.com and I've looked through some of their sample problems, but there are so many topics and I don't know what topics Mathworks assessment will cover.  HackerRank lists the arrays topic as being covered by 70% of employers, so I worked on a couple of their practice problems on arrays, but I really doubt that's the only topic I'll be tested on.  

Any advice for what else to study and how to handle the time limit?  If it helps, I plan on using Python, since the only other language I'm comfortable with is C++ and Python is much easier to use, even though I have less experience with it than C++.  I have until October 18th to take the assessment."
q6fzdr,1,2021-10-12,Associate's in Information Technology as a stepping stone,DaddyJohnnyTheFudgey,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/q6fzdr/associates_in_information_technology_as_a/,"I know that this has been asked numerous times before, I just don't want to be reviving dead threads and want some more personalized answers. I feel my situation is a little different from others I've seen.  


So, I'm pretty fucking sad overall about my degree and have been this entire semester. I found out this semester while looking for an internship that all the job postings for IT jobs I qualify for, I would have qualified without wasting 2 years getting an AAS. Apart from that, most of the jobs I don't qualify for are looking for experience, which I don't really have yet, and I don't care to get there.  


I don't really like IT, personally, it's just not my hope for my career, but the field pays really well and has secure jobs everywhere you go. Additionally, I have a pretty good understanding of tech, so my plan before college was to get my AAS in IT, then I could have a career in IT to pay my way through my Master's so I can practice Psychology, and then get out of IT as fast as possible. I guess I missed the memo that ITS seems to be more interested in experience and certs over other things though.  


Right now, I have the rest of this semester to do, and then one semester after this, then I'll have my degree. The issue is, I \*hate\* these classes. They are tanking my GPA (Due to having no drive for it, honestly) and my drive to even go to class because I just can't stand the material, and that's been really intensified by the realization that not only does it seem like my degree won't actually help me get a job in IT, but also that I can get a job as a cook (Something else I'm experienced with) anywhere getting at least 30k a year. This seems consistent with a lot of other entry-level IT positions. It might just be my area though.  


Tl;dr: It seems like I've wasted my time getting my AAS and I have other job opportunities. Should I stick it through for my final semester and get my degree, or should I move on to my Bachelor's immediately? And realistically, what kind of things can I do with an AAS to pay my way through college (So probably getting 5 years of experience max before I leave the field)?  


Thanks for any responses. This has been heavily on my mind for a while and I just found this sub."

I'm considering applying to HBS 2+2 program and other deferred programs. I'm relatively early in the applying process (~1-2 years out) but wanted to get a feel of how my profile would look.

**Background**

* Top 10 CS school, Major: Computer Science (Specialization at the intersection of AI &amp; Human-Computer Interactions) (5.5/ or 6 year BS/MS program in CS)
* I'm in my 4th year of 5 in my BS (family problems + interning extended my 4-year program to 5) + 1-1.5 for MS.
* *Work Experience*:
   * SWE Internships at Start-up, Mid-size, and Silicon Valley BigTech Company, and FAAMG
* *Extracurriculars*:
   * Executive Leadership in a club (very active involvement, lots of impact here)
   * Chaired and founded a global conference (involved top CS schools (UCB, MIT, CMU, etc.) and sponsored by several big companies (FB, MS, Google, etc.))
   * Writer &amp; Editor for a nonprofit in an area I'm passionate about
   * Was in 3 fellowships (Data Science, VC, Backend focuses)
   * Research experience (AI &amp; Blockchain)
   * TA for a course with MS/PhD students
* *Race/Nationality*: Indian/American
* *Sex*: M

**Stats**

* *GMAT Score*: I haven't taken a test (Sorry I'm relatively early in posting this but just trying to get a feeler, so don't attack me), I got a 35 on the ACT, and am pretty good with standardized tests so hopefully that shouldn't be a problem. Any advice here would be appreciated.
* *Undergrad GPA*: 3.4/4.0 (I know it's low but aiming for a 3.5+ which is the highest honors for us), Master GPA will be 3.8+ for sure.

**MBA Info**

* *Goal of MBA:* A motivation for applying has been Product Management. I have a strong technical background and would like to tie it with an MBA to be a product manager at a Big Tech company. My school has a very strong technical program but not much business and professional exposure, which I feel is necessary and a huge gap.
* *Target Schools*:
   * Berkeley Haas Accelerated Access Program
   * HBS 2+2
   * Chicago Booth Scholars
   * Columbia Deferred Program
   * Stanford GSB Deferred Program
   * Wharton Advance Access Program
   * Yale Silver Scholars

I'd appreciate any thoughts or guidance. And again, I recognize some important details such as a GMAT score are missing but I would like to get a general idea or any advice. Thank you!"

You don’t have all that much time or energy to learn the fundamentals or the advanced stuff at best. Do you want to know how frustrating it is being asked to do 30 things and you only confidently know how to do maybe 1 or 2? My anxiety started before the job and it has only gotten worse.

I’m taking a break from weed for a bit and getting on a better health and overall routine, but holy fuck do I still have so far to go. If they don’t get tired of my shit by the end of the year I think I’ll be okay, but every single day is so stressful figuring out what I overlooked or what I forgot to do or what I didn’t get to because I was so overwhelmed I fell asleep at 11am and slept till 6pm. This WFH shit has been a terrible on boarding process, and I’ve been doing it for 18 months now (this job only 6, but had a 100% remote internship that led here).

I’m a college dropout that has very good interview skills and I did grind basic leetcode for a good bit. I’m trying to keep up with people that have been playing with programming since a kid and graduated from every elite school you can name. The imposter syndrome is real. The anxiety is real. I guess I’m just making this post to say to this sub to please be patient with your learning. Otherwise you’ll find yourself moved across the country during a pandemic feverishly trying to hold up your house of cards.

q6ja5h,11,2021-10-12,Update(Kinda) on my Post 3 Months Ago about wanting to Switch to Computational Bio from CS + more questions,YoungDiCaprio101,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/q6ja5h/updatekinda_on_my_post_3_months_ago_about_wanting/,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/oakaar/current_cs_student_looking_to_switch_into_biotech/) is the post if anyone remembers? Looking back, it was almost just saying everything on my mind, even though I bet it sounded naive and pathetic to a few.  


Well, I'm taking Intro to Computational Molecular Bio, and just finished a Grad level Computing Research class for Computational Bio. (I'm 3rd year student). These are the only 2 classes I've taken in Computational Bio/Bioinformatics.

I've done decently well and I enjoy it a LOT more than CS. Looking back at the many comments on my original post, (obviously very thankful for a lot of the advice and have written a lot of it down in my notes), I know many people recommended staying with CS and minoring in this, or doing a masters in Computational Bio. I assume because CS is a safer, more employable degree and does not require a PhD, which I do not want to do. Also because of the pay, and I have read a few Reddit posts of people desperately trying to switch people off Bioinformatics because they've been screwed by scarce employment opportunities. But I've REALLY started to just dislike the overall material of CS compared to CompBio. I don't know if it's the classes, teachers, myself, I just do not enjoy it. I'd like to switch out immediately honestly. And I have made an appointment with the head of the Computational Biology/Bioinformatics department at my school to talk to her about what I'll be saying here essentially..  


My goal is to hopefully just do a Bachelors in Computational Bio, can probably do a minors in CS with how much I've done, and end up at a Bio company like Pfizer, GenenTech, Roche, BioNTech etc. Please do not laugh at my naive confidence! I know I am far away from this level but that's the goal. I was thinking if I could just land an internship at one of these places, or perhaps an internship at some place like the Broad Institute(no one really speaks about them here weirdly, they're a top research lab aren't they?) or at GenenTech, then immediately after graduating I can stay with the company. I know Tech companies like Google offer their interns full time employment after graduating. I hope it's the same for CompBio unless it's just too competitive/scarce? Is that a possible thing? Being offered employment upon finishing a degree from the place you interned at? If this happens would I need to get a PhD or even Masters? I'd love to be able to research Immuno-Oncology and bypass doing double my years in University(I also cannot afford it I think). I'd get my Masters if I must though.  


Please do let me know, I cannot stand CS anymore and would want to switch. I don't even care about the money really. I'd say though stability is an important factor.. But that's not really a thing in this field? Well at least in the University jobs where you apply for grants and stipends, but I would want to avoid that if possible, just because of my interests."

My first choice of applying would be to Canadian programs at: 

1.  UBC
2. McGill
3. Queen's

I'm interested in HEP and find they have great research groups.

Also, because programs in Canada specify GRE to be ""advantageous"", my second choice of applying would be Europe (as deadlines are by December and I haven't taken up the GRE yet). UK, I don't prefer much because of their one year masters which I've heard people repeat to get into a good PhD program outside of UK. 

I'm sorta confused here. Because I was building my profile last year I didn't apply for the 2021 intake anywhere (and also because COVID fucked with my internships and finances). I've enrolled in an MSc program at my Uni anyway as backup but don't intend to complete it.  

Would it be better to complete my Masters in India and then apply to a Canadian MS-PhD (I find this to be overkill!) or do a Masters in Europe and then build on from that? I have a CGPA equivalent to 4.0 by US standards. 

I'd also appreciate Uni suggestions. Thank you!"

Microsoft would be in Seattle and Amazon in NYC. For the purposes of the internship, I don’t really have a location preference, but I’d like to be on the East coast when I’m working full time.

- HQ, every team has its presence here so more engineers. Possibly meet more people and figure out more about career path
- Bay Area, where many tech companies are located. Might be able to visit different companies
- friends will be on the west coast too
- look better on resume(maybe?)

Here is the ninety-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

q6p3y9,1,2021-10-12,Working in a book literary agency as a future self-pub author ok thing to do?,SnugglePuggle94,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q6p3y9/working_in_a_book_literary_agency_as_a_future/,"Hi all. Wanted your take on this.

Growing up I've always wanted to be a fiction romance author. That's still a dream to this day and I'm working on it, but in the meantime, wanted to be in the book field for a job that helps me pay the bills.

In the past ten years or so, I've thought about how cool it would be as a literary agent, to help future authors get published. Right now, there's an internship I could apply for to get a foot in the door, but then I thought-what would people think if I actually became an agent while self-publishing my own work? Doesn't that contradict things?

At first all I wanted was to traditionally publish, but then I found out not only how hard it is to actually get accepted but also that you basically sign all rights to your work to the publisher. You have no say in cover artwork or anything. They take most of your royalties and can even change your work and you don't have much say in that, and that was the kicker for me. I don't want a publisher to change my writing into something I don't approve of. 

So, this past year, I decided I'm self-publishing. Currently, I'm having my debut novel beta read for errors and plot, so that and I'm not financially ready, it will be awhile before it hits the market.

I'm not sure if following the literary agent route would be ok, or even working in an actual book publisher but in a editorial type position would be okay if I'm also writing as a selfpub author.

What do you all think?"

Just by glancing at the name, I'm not sure what the job description entails.

The work description is also not particularly clear in the contract I signed.

I just noticed this paragraph in the contract's text.

&gt;""As a core member of the (Company Name) team, you will be presented with continuous opportunities and challenges that will strengthen your critical thinking abilities and execution capabilities, on the work that truly matters to the World.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, I work in an almost all-encompassing job that should be regarded a complete developer position, and I have no seniors in my career to advise me on the best/professional way to execute, so I've been teaching myself online and freely doing my work in my way. Therefore I'd like to ask you experienced programmers, is my job really normal? And how many programming languages do you need to know in a company?

In the two years I've been working, I've had to touch a lot of things.

Mainly doing.

* Flutter
* Android - Java, Kotlin
* MacOS/iOS - Swift, SwiftUI
* See customers to get requests
* Assign work to some interns and lead them

Occasionally required to do.

* Website - HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript
* Backend - Python
* Designing UI
* Forced to promote and sell our products on the street when the pandemic was not yet severe

I went to a local college and completed my core cirriculum classes, then transferred to a larger state university to finish my B.S. in Computer Science. I've only taken Programming Principles 1 and Programming Principles 2 and was curious as to whether or not a company would even look at my application having only taken 2 Computer Science classes.

I understand that most companies put their requirements on the application page, but I don't really see the point in applying if I'm not going to be useful, or the things they will teach me are far beyond my current understanding. 


TL;DR: I've only taken 2 Computer Science relevant classes, is it worth it to try and find an internship this early?"
q6qt0o,9,2021-10-12,[CA] Can an underperforming Intern/Co-op be fired?,Snoo-71938,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/q6qt0o/ca_can_an_underperforming_interncoop_be_fired/,"I have mentored 6 engineering interns before, some during the summer and some during the school year. The interns all came from the same school, and their internships were paid. Our company firmly believes that interns should have the opportunity to learn valuable job skills, and are not simply an ""extra pair of hands"" for performing mundane repetitive tasks.

The last 5 interns were wonderful. Unfortunately, despite having the best grades and on-paper records compared to all previous individuals, the current intern is off to a very bad start. He has been with us for three weeks so far, and the following incidents have occurred:

* There were 3 days on which he messaged me early that morning, saying that he would ""be a little late"" because he had things to attend to. On each of those days, he showed up nearly 2 hours late. He apologized and explained that those things ""took longer than expected,"" or that ""traffic was really bad.""
* On one of the days in which he showed up extremely late, he also had to leave 1-2 hours early
* There were several other days in which he was nowhere to be found during our scheduled training, because he came back late from lunch
* On another day, the entire plan had to be scrapped because he somehow *accidentally* forgot to wear shoes to work. Halfway into a training session, the safety manager noticed that he was wearing slippers in the laboratory, which is a violation of safety protocols. By the time he returned to work wearing proper attire, there were less than 20 minutes left in the day
* This intern has also caused some legal issues for us, with California Labor Laws. Despite repeated verbal and written reminders from the HR department, he committed meal break violations on 6 days (logging an excessively short meal break or no meal break at all, due to reading emails during lunch)

I am at a loss for what to do. I have had a conversation with this intern that his personal life is clearly taking his mind off of work, and he appeared to be very apologetic and contrite. However, he continued to have attendance issues, although the exact reasons for his lateness were different each time.

Due to his poor attendance, this intern has fallen severely behind on his training. After 3 weeks, his learning is on par with that the other interns had achieved by Week One. He has the best academic records out of all the interns I've managed before, but he is by far making the least amount of progress. I am not a stickler for punctuality, and am fully content to let interns manage their own time when they've reached the point that they can work independently. However, when someone is very new and is still undergoing training, it is imperative that his schedule is synchronized to the trainer's.

Can an intern be fired? Or perhaps, should an intern be fired, or would this defeat the entire purpose of an internship---to teach technical skills and professional standards of conduct to college students?

\----------------

He is not taking any classes this semester, and is scheduled to work full-time at this internship

\----------------

**Update 1 week later:**

The intern didn't have any major attendance or punctuality issues this past week. But unfortunately, he committed meal break violations on 2 more days. This brings his total up to 8 violations in 1 month of working with us. Once again, he submitted his timesheet without recording a meal break, due to allegedly reading emails or doing work on his computer during lunch.

Somehow, no matter how many times we remind him and re-explain the policy, he cannot get it right. The HR and Finance teams are becoming quite angry with him, because this is something that can get our company in serious trouble with California Labor Laws.

I'm planning to send this intern the following email, with my manager and the HR director cc'ed:

*""Hi \[intern\],*

*I'm writing to discuss some troubling behaviors and tendencies, which need to be addressed immediately.*

*Throughout the first month of your internship, I have noticed that you do not seem to be treating your work with dedication and responsibility. On multiple days \[****list the dates****\], you showed up 2 hours late or left 2 hours early due to a myriad of personal distractions. On several additional days* ***\[list the dates\]****, you also failed to be present during training sessions due to ""coming back late from lunch."" These issues with attendance and punctuality have caused you to miss many training opportunities, and have prevented you from making satisfactory progress in your learning. Upon completion of Week Four, your degree of familiarity and experience in* ***\[Areas X, Y, Z\]*** *is on par with what interns of your technical background have historically achieved by Week Two.*

*You have also demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to pay attention to detail and following instructions. This tendency has displayed itself most prominently in the 8 meal break violations you have committed in the past month. \[****HR lady #1****\] and \[****HR lady #2****\] have given you several verbal and written reminders to follow this policy. They also explained the catastrophic legal and financial ramifications that could befall the company due to these frequent and repeated violations, but your noncompliance continued.*

*I hope that this message conveys to you the seriousness of these issues, and the importance of rectifying these behaviors. Please strive to improve in these areas, so that your work ethic and professional integrity will not come into doubt.*

What can I do to get some experience?



/*-------------------------------*/
Thank you everyone for encouraging comments and tips! I will make sure to complete my project and apply new grad application. 
It was very meaningful to hear from everyone! 
Thank you!!"

q6sww2,0,2021-10-12,Can I apply for software developer internships with a non-cs degree and a university certificate in software engineering?,fancytaco101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q6sww2/can_i_apply_for_software_developer_internships/,So I have a bachelors of arts in public health and I'm currently enrolled in a year long post graduate certificate program in software engineering at a university. I know that internships are usually for students enrolled in degree programs such as bachelors or masters in computer science or something related. Is it even worth it to apply to internship positions because pretty much all of them state they want someone in a CS degree program or with a CS degree.
q6szdq,0,2021-10-12,Does this job description fit my career position? does it feel a bit like a trap?,Daniel_Yo70,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q6szdq/does_this_job_description_fit_my_career_position/,"Here's the thing: I believe I'm still a newbie in the workplace; I've been with the same startup company for almost two years, including an internship and then working as a worker, primarily doing programming; my current position is Solution Lead, but I believe the name of this career position is ambiguous; I have no idea what the job content is just by looking at the name.

Just by glancing at the name, I'm not sure what the job description entails.

The work description is also not particularly clear in the contract I signed.

I just noticed this paragraph in the contract's text.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""As a core member of the (Company Name) team, you will be presented with continuous opportunities and challenges that will strengthen your critical thinking abilities and execution capabilities, on the work that truly matters to the World.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, I work in an almost all-encompassing job that should be regarded a complete developer position, and I have no seniors in my career to advise me on the best/professional way to execute, so I've been teaching myself online and freely doing my work in my way. Therefore I'd like to ask you experienced programmers, is my job really normal? And how many programming languages do you need to know in a company?

In the two years I've been working, I've had to touch a lot of things.

Mainly doing.

* Flutter
* Android - Java, Kotlin
* MacOS/iOS - Swift, SwiftUI
* See customers to get requests
* Assign work to some interns and lead them

Occasionally required to do.

* Website - HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript
* Backend - Python
* Designing UI
* Forced to promote and sell our products on the street when the pandemic was not yet severe

&gt;!By the way, I have Social Anxiety Disorder, and this is why I'm not brave enough to switch my career. !&lt;

Thank you for seeing the end, and thank you for your valuable comments!"
q6t99x,2,2021-10-12,"How to respectfully, but firmly, say 'no' to my managers' request?",Drawde123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/q6t99x/how_to_respectfully_but_firmly_say_no_to_my/,"I (30M) work as an administrative assistant and planner for a large bank. While the position is below my educational level and interests, it was a great job to get at the start of the pandemic and after a burnout. I've been there for almost 2 years now, and the job is, due to my new manager, slowly improving. The work itself is based around the number of cases you get done every day, with a % that you have to achieve every day. While the work hasn't been that much the last couple of months (we've had worse weeks), my manager has asked me today to change my day off from a Monday to a Thursday so the 'work could be more evenly spread across the week and you would do your colleagues a favor'. When she asked me today, I already said that I'd rather not change it. 

In this job I've been asked to change my day off multiple times. With me having the Friday off originally, that was asked to change to a Monday due to a colleague following classes on Friday. When I went to do a UX internship from Jan until May, I could have the Friday off again. Then when the internship wasn't extended, I went back to my old department and had the Friday off again. Then, my new manager told me that couldn't be done, so I had the Monday instead again. Now she asks me to hand in my Monday again for a random Thursday for a 3-to-1-to-1 workweek instead of a full 4-day workweek. In the meantime, I've handed in an education proposal to I could develop myself towards a Scrum Master position, which has been two weeks unanswered. Additionally, I've been giving a lot of trainings and workshops and have taken up extra responsibilities because my manager asked me to.

I am fed up with this and (almost) everytime she asks me to do something, it's under the umbrella of ""you would really help the team"" or ""with this new agile way of working, everyone has to do their share"" or ""I help and coach you towards the Scrum Master role but you gotta help me too"". I feel like I am already doing enough for the department as it is and I'm not even keeping track of the overtime I regularly work. I've been applying to jobs since 6 months but so far no luck, so I'm in this position until it lasts.

So how can I firmly, but respectfully, decline my managers' request while still having an ok relationship with her?"

However, I did not take it serious enough until my final year where it was too late to enter IB due to no prior internships.

I applied to the MI5 and after a grueling background check and application process I got in. I then took the role and have been working on and off the field for a few years now.

Is it possible for someone with my experience to move into IB? I know I don't have much transferrable finance skills from my work. However, I excel at negotiating in extreme situations, advanced problem solving skills from my time in the field and many other skills. I also studied accounting and finance in University.

I want to try to break into IB, however I am pragmatic as well. If I do not have any obvious routes available to break in, I will continue with the MI5. However, my life priorities have changed due to family and the work I do is dangerous. Essentially, my percentage of putting myself at life endangering risk has decreased since my family requires my presence. I need to work in a safe office environment now.

Or in other words I am not the same care free guy who left university haha.

Would love everyone's input."
q6w0in,7,2021-10-12,what a disaster,justicenkac,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q6w0in/what_a_disaster/,"Just some major depressive venting because why not I'm looking for validation I guess.

Junior CS student with 0 (zero) (none) (nothing) internships :)))))))). I also had 5 interviews this cycle, one of those being a final round at a big company and failed all of them. I've applied to 150 internships. So, doesn't look like I'm gonna get an internship this cycle either, and once again I am a junior. So it's looking like I'll be applying for new grad with absolutely zero internships next year. My response rate will be awful, and I'll waste this degree that cost my immigrant parents tens of thousands of dollars.

Why am I failing all these interviews? I am terrible at leetcoding, and just cannot simply \*know\* the answer to coding problems like y'all can, which sucks, but is part of life I guess. Some people just aren't as lucky with the iq character stat. I've done approximately 120 leetcode problems, and can roughly solve 20% of mediums. In one of my itvs I actually failed an easy. Ofc I'll fail interviews like this. Like no shit. But I've been applying, and trying right? Maybe one of those I'll be able to solve. But, if I have 0 prior internships, my response rate is around 15%, and of those maybe I'll be able to solve 20% of the questions, so that puts my chances at what, around 3%? And this is this year, so new grad w/ no internships will be an even lower rate (impressive).

And yea, the cycle isn't over, but If I am unable to pass interviews, well then what's the fucking point. This is so disastrous. I need internships to get jobs. And other internships to get internships, which I can't get lmao. Maybe I can grind LC this summer for new grad. But tbh, two things will happen:

1. 0.0000000001% response rate for new grad cuz ya know: 0 internships
2. How likely is it I'll get good at LC in 3 months when I've done over 100 and im still fucking dogshit.

Anyway, I'm done. What a fucking disaster. How the fuck did it get to this point gmgmgkmfjen\[ifujnbwepihfbh. I hope you all get offers, y'all def deserve it."

Hi. I am in my junior year of a CS degree, expected to graduate May 2023.

I am currently working part time as a Software Engineer Intern for a local startup, and it will end this December.

Spring 2022, I am free.

Summer 2022, I will be interning at Capital One as Software Engineer Intern

I wanted to ask if it was worth it to take off Spring 2022 as a student to work full-time at MathWorks as an EDG intern from Jan-May.

My interpretation of it is that it isn't necessarily a software engineering role, and is solely dependent on the team you get. I am not sure if the amount of prestige (not sure where they stand) of MathWorks on resume and risk of getting bad a team is worth delaying my graduation, and possibly introducing burdens on C1 + return offer.

And honestly, I think I'm good. Two software engineering internships is good enough, IMO. But I'd love to hear what others think.

Thanks in advance.

Process: honestly hella long. Took like two months, with 2/3 week gaps between each interview. I really did not like their interview process. Do well on the first round HackerRank. Then hopefully u get to second round technical screen (if it can be even called that), where you go over your HackerRank code (not the multiple choice) and implement very simple follow up questions (&lt;5 lines of code). Then third round final interview is a behavioral with a hiring manager.

I don't have any specific advice aside from doing well on the HackerRank, be able to explain your code, and using STAR format for behaviorals.

(18M),YourPetRuski,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/q6yo5i/how_do_i_live_on_my_own_18m/,"I'm not in the mood to write my entire life story, so I'll just make it short. Basically, my sister never went to college, never had a job, crashed her car which mom paid for, didn't pay her back, always was a big troublemaker and fought with my mom several times, got married at 18, and moved out. I on the other hand have always been very good in school, work however much I can whenever I have a break from school, am in college right now with a 3.9GPA, never have yelled at either of my parents, always follow rules, and do my best to please them. Despite this, my parents love my sister, and miss her, while constantly yelling at me about how I'm a horrible person, apparently due to me ""constantly"" playing video games (despite the majority of my time going into school), among other things. I mean, hell, they constantly tell me I need to lose weight, and when I begin going to the gym and weighing everything they serve me for food (which is mostly high-calorie carbs) and tracking it into a calorie-tracking app, they call me a picky bitch and that they don't like how I'm becoming more independent the older I get. I mean, I'm just sick and tired of it. I want to move out ASAP, but the thing is, I have no money and do not have the time to work besides 8-12 hours on Saturdays, especially considering I'm full-time college and soon will be going into internships. I am in a Dental Assisting Program and plan to get a job once I complete the course, which will be next August.

How can I live on my own? Obviously, I'll get many more grants and financial aid due to not being a dependant, but how do I go about finding the money to pay for rent, car insurance, gas, food, AND college? Can I go on welfare or are there some other alternatives? I suppose I can live in my car for a bit, I don't mind that, but I do need wifi to be able to do homework."

2. **Jr &amp; Sr. yr. physics teacher:** 10/10 – Although I was actively failing the class jr. yr. and considered dropping out of IB because I couldn’t get out the class, they always supported me in and outside of class with extra tutoring, support; was most engaged student during COVID Zoom world; they wrote me an email after submitting my letter about all the awesome stuff they said about me.
3. **Jr. yr english teacher:** 9/10 – I was one of their favorites and they were the sponsor of the school podcast; interacted with them in and out of classroom and through Zoom; professional but I could always talk to them so they knew me very well
4. **Former IB director**: 10/10 – They used to be my WorldGeo teacher freshman year &amp; sponsored Model UN. I also volunteered a lot for their events; they became IB coordinator later and helped me navigate my future in IB program and college; moved to different city but still kept in contact; knew a lot of personal life and told me they wrote a fantastic letter of rec
5. **Head choir director:** 10/10 – After 4 years I’m basically part of their family and their children are some of my best friends; I was very very involved in choir and spent all my free time there so they know my vocal abilities v well; was always at their house, super comfortable
6. **Asst. choir director:** 10/10 – Once again, like their adopted daughter; spent so much time together because of All-State audition process; I helped choral program a lot during COVID times as president so I was always behind the directors supporting them professionally in choir and musical seasons

**Interviews**

\*\*(\*\****Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)***

1. **Princeton:** 10/10 – Alumni interviewer is a lawyer in my city so we shared many common interests; told me that I would be a fantastic fit for Princeton and that if I got in, they would be contacting me immediately to convince me to attend

Scholarship of $20k/yr; interviewed w/3 main heads of dept.; had to submit music supplements (3 videos); they told me I would be a fantastic fit &amp; couldn’t wait to see me in the fall (on the condition of getting into GWU first)
4. **American University Music Dept.:** 9/10 – Started a little slow; the head of music dept.; right after insurrection in DC so sensitive time; discussed plans living in DC and what to do at American; professor really seemed to like me but I couldn’t tell right off the bat

* (Applied to 2 Ivies, several TX schools, and Pomona College with this app)
* Decided to scrap it entirely and wrote something totally new in a day

\*Wrote about never finding peace or tranquility until COVID forced me to take a break; connected to family aboard and missing those connections/roots

**Additional Information:**

Please don’t procrastinate or apply to a ton of colleges! It’s more important to focus on a specific set of schools &amp; tweak those application materials instead of doing what I did. Granted, I was online all of senior year and I wasn’t allowed to leave my house hence all the time spent on college apps. Additionally, I’m actually really glad none of the ivies worked out because i’m SOOO happy at Wellesley right now; it is a perfect fit for me! and that’s what’s most important!"
q6yxym,1,2021-10-12,Should I delay graduation for an internship?,Bossez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q6yxym/should_i_delay_graduation_for_an_internship/," 

I am supposed to graduate around January 2022, but I am thinking of delaying it to June 2022 or something similar for internship purposes.

My reasoning is that:

* I have no prior job experience nor any internships
* I only have the programming projects done for the university courses
* I don't know any popular frameworks enough yet nor have any good side projects yet
* I haven't grinded out leetcode yet.
* I want to get a job within 6 months of January 2022

I have read that companies discriminate against new grads for internships over senior university students. That is the main reason I am considering delaying graduation. I am thinking that I could get an internship and basically graduate in June 2022. I have heard that the entry level job market for developers is extremely competitive and there are no jobs for those without any experience or internship experience.

What do you guys think?"

The only reason why I pursued an IT degree was because my school did not have a CS degree as part of their program."

The program is functional and I provided a few test cases I can come up with with the time constraint (2 hours). After looking at my code, they decided not to proceed to the phone interview and I desperately want to ask them why. I really want to improve my coding skills so please help me with feedback on what is the problem of my code [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/blackjack-B475/main.py). 

Here are the list of problems that I can think of in my code:

* magic number: I intentionally did this because I thought I would make the code to be consistent with the game rule but I guess this is a bad practice in any situation.
* did not write unit test
* manual testing with txt file: I probably should have use the *unittest* library for proper testing.

Background: I am currently a junior study CS. I had done a few projects in the past but I've never had a code review so I don't really know how to write ""professional"" code. 

Game rule (it's Blackjack, skipped it you already knew): interactive card game (player vs computer) where players starts with 2 cards. Points is calculated as the total number of points from all the card on one's hand: numbered cards count exactly as the number, letter cards (J,Q,K) counts as 10, Ace cards counts as 1 or 11. The player with draw card from the deck and then the computer. Whoever reaches closet to 21 or first reach 21 will win.

Any help is very much appreciated!!!

Tl,dr: Got rejected from a coding challenge. Feedback needed to help me improved!"

Don't know what to do anymore.,Hopeful-Treat7935,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/q702qt/no_interviews_even_after_doing_everything_dont/,"I am a junior CS student at Georgia Tech and I have a decent amount of relevant experience in programming, although none of it is at a big company or anything. As far as I've been told, my GPA isn't too bad either (between 3.2 and 3.5). I have applied to over 50 internships on different websites and attended the career fair (both CS and all-major). Yet, I haven't received even one interview email or call yet, and it is already mid-October. It's all either rejections or ghosting. I feel hopeless at this point. I used to think that with some experience, a few projects and a decent GPA, an internship wouldn’t be this hard to find. I don’t know what to do anymore. And being on an F-1 visa probably doesn’t help either!

I wanted to ask, is it common to go through this for someone with my credentials? What should I do?"

Unfortunately not too much has changed for me, but that is probably just telling me I should actually get help instead of wallowing. Here it is:

“The past few months i have felt better than I have in a while. I’m not depressed and I no longer feel like giving up on living. It’s taken a lot for me to get here, and to be honest I don’t know why my life is better now than it was, but it feels that way. The problem is, I think it’s cause i have kinda given up on myself, and I know it is short lived. I haven’t worked out, i haven’t pursued any kind of new relationship, friend or romantic, and I really haven’t challenged myself. This isn’t the person I want to be, so why does it feel so easy and stress free to act this way. The person I wish i was is fun, carefree and personable. A person who tries new things and learns new things. I want to go out and meet new people and not feel like I’m just following my friends around and feeling like I can’t function on my own. I want to dance to fun music without caring what everyone is thinking, or even just be  the guy who talks to his mom and his family about his everyday life without feeling inexplicably uncomfortable. Why is it so hard for me to be who I want to be? It feels like something is sitting on my chest,  making me feel like I can’t breathe and forcing me to watch everyone else live the life I want to live. I watch my friends and my brother run around this world confidently, thriving, and acting exactly how they want. Why is that so hard for me? Why do i have to sit here and feel so oppositely of how I think? Why am I so scared of what everyone is thinking? I know what I want to do so why does everything feel so wrong when I try to do it. 
I feel a lot, sometimes too much. When I am in a group of people, I get so overwhelmed that I choke on my words. I can’t talk, then my whole face feels hot and my eyes start to water. And that’s before I can even start to think about what is happening. Then I go and sit alone in my room, or don’t speak up in class or around friends for a while. I have spent so much of my life sitting alone feeling like no one cares, that at this point it’s a wonder that anyone cares. I had a friend point out that for the past few years it wasn’t that I wasn’t welcome when I didn’t get an invite, it was that I took myself out of situations so often that it seemed I didn’t want to be there, and people tend to forget you when you aren’t around. I cannot remember the last time I had someone try super hard to get me to go somewhere or do something with them the way I have seen my friends try to get each other to participate. 
While the whole social thing sucks, the part that is the worst is that my social issues have had such a detrimental effect on my academic and future professional life. I haven’t joined clubs, i haven’t volunteered, and I am scared to apply for internships and further school because the idea of talking to a stranger about myself is just about the scariest thing I can imagine.”

I don’t know why I’m sharing, i just found that the description was pretty apt for what I was feeling. Never shared this with anyone, don’t even remember why I wrote it at the time. Still haven’t challenged myself much in the past few years, but this might just kick me in the ass to move forward after feeling stuck for the past few years."

q73hos,1,2021-10-13,How can I succeed at my first coding assessment for an internship application?,dcfan105,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/q73hos/how_can_i_succeed_at_my_first_coding_assessment/,"I applied for an engineering internship with Mathworks for next summer and I already had a prerecorded video interview that just ask general job interview type questions. I guess they were satisfied with my answers because now they want me to do an assessment on math/analytical thinking skills and coding or (exclusive or) Matlab. I'll probably do the coding since it's been years since I used MatLab for more than plotting. I can use Python or C++ (or a few other languages I haven't learned) but I've never done a coding assessment before and so I'm not quite sure what to expect. The assessment is on http://hackerrank.com. They do have practice problems and I worked on a couple in the arrays topic because they said 70% of employers test that topic, but I don't know what else I should practice, since all the other topics they listed had much smaller percentages and the Mathworks assessment instructions don't say anything about what kind of questions will be on the coding portion. hackerrank has a test to get certified in Python (and options for a bunch of other languages too) so I was thinking I might do that just to get practice, even if I don't do well enough to get the certification, but I don't know how well the topics on that assessment will match whatever topics Mathworks tests. Their internship description was pretty vague too (it sounded like they try to find specific projects that match each intern's skills) so that's no help in knowing what they'll test on. 

Do you have any advice on what coding concepts would be good to practice in general for this kind of thing or on how to do well overall? 

I only have until 10/18 to do the assessment."

In terms of knowledge, I didn’t find any difference on an absolute scale.

But on paper, UofT students suck. I don’t know what’s wrong they also list non-job related thing on resume too like ‘server’ at XYZ. 
On the other hand, UWaterloo students also had bluff roles and titles but they were at least slightly selling in my opinion for example.

Developer @ XYZ society 

But for senior students, same in terms of knowledge I would say didn’t find any difference.

But for behavioural questions, UWaterloo students had better examples from work/Co-Op

Lastly, experience build experience. Y’all are lucky it gets harder to reject a person if they have relevant demonstrated experience even though you performed average with any other university student in an interview for internship"

I'm targetting FAANG / strong finance firms - I am comfortable doing most leetcode hards and basically all mediums, so I'm not worried about passing interviews, but I'm concerned that I may not get past the CV stage.

A few notes:
- X is a proprietary programming language used by a lot of companies in certain areas of finance. I'm a little worried this will affect my chance of getting interviews at good companies, does anyone know if they take issue with experience in more niche programming languages?
- I think my first experience section (as a senior) is much weaker than my second (as a junior). I'm struggling to translate my role as a senior into ""accomplished X by doing Y as measured by Z"" - especially as I haven't been a senior for so long - from just having a list of things I have done on the job, which I know isn't seen as compelling.
- I've also heard conflicting opinions on including skills such as line management, scoping requirements, managing stakeholders etc. vs having everything being ""accomplished X by doing Y as measured by Z"". Should I remove anything that isn't in this format?
- I was actually hired as more of an analyst, but have programmed at my job from day 1 and I moved into a hybrid analyst / developer role. Again, I'm confident on passing technical interviews but worried about this affecting my chances of getting interviews in the first place?"

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the Netherlands in Embedded Systems, focusing on AI and cyber-security. And my Bachelor's degree was in Electrical Engineering.

As I can do an internship during my masters, I wanted to know:

1. What are the chances of getting an internship in the UK as a European? And how should I go about it?
2. Would the internship help with securing a job in the country after my studies?
3. Without the internship, is it possible/likely to find a sponsored job in the UK?

I'm also happy to graduate schemes and the sort, but the chances of that look even slimmer. Also, I don't care about the salary too much (although I do need to eat and live!).

1. Get an internship at a FAANG company in Europe during college  
2. Get a return offer at that company to start working there after my studies  
3. Work there for about a year  
4. Get relocated to their US location  
5. Have the ability to switch to another FAANG company after having already worked at FAANG in the US  


Now, this is where I need your advice:  
First of all, let me know if you see any flaws or difficulties with my plan. Secondly, my resume is not impressive. I can't boast about my GPA, as it sucks, I don't have many personal projects, and my only work experience is at my current firm.  
That's why I want to learn skills that are beneficial for one specific FAANG company, that I can put on my resume so that my resume contains lots of keywords that that company likes to read. For example, Facebook likes people who know React. Amazon likes AWS, and so on.  
Can you guys let me know what tech stacks are particularly beneficial for certain FAANG companies?

So I'm applying as a CS Major. I'm having trouble deciding between Brown CS and Carnegie mellon SCS for the ED round. On one hand Carnegie Mellon SCS has a stellar reputation for Computer Science. It's cognitive science and psychology electives i've heard are really amazing.And the research and number of nobel laureates in Carnegie Mellon is greater than at Brown (for CS at least). But is it true that for undergraduate programs the rankings of individual departments do not matter much? Plus all the talk on the internet about CMU stress culture has me all freaked out(I've done the application for CMU, not submitted yet). Brown on the other hand has a open curriculum and is easy going, and I like the old ivy league school prestige they have going on. But it's CS not as good as CMU.

I am more interested in the hands on approach to CS and am particularly interested in AI and cognition aspect. I'm ok with stress, but i don't want it to be too much(Not the best at handling stress). I would also prefer taking a good amount of Humanities, Arts, and Sciences courses throughout my undergrad degree (CMU's breadth focus is good and Brown's open curriculum is equally good for me). In terms of social scene, I would prefer is a group of friends that I can hang out with or do something fun with over the weekend(Im an introvert). I don't want a party school.

I prefer small class sizes, more individual attention from professors and tons of experiential learning opportunities like internships study abroad etc.

In terms of location, I would prefer a small town environment with decent greenery but not totally isolated from cities.

PS: I've completed the Carnegie Mellon application, not started with Brown. Im just freaking out whether I might have chosen the wrong school or something and Brown might be better for me."

I have decided that I'll spend my first year with learning and contributing in open source and development as much as I can. I'll try to go for an internship in my second year and will focus on my CGPA and projects in my 3rd year.

Now, I have 2 questions I want your opinions on:

#First

the norm here is, most students pursue 2 years of masters after the 3 years of undergrad ends, just to get a better/high paying job. But I'm confident I can achieve that level of skill, and good job with in these 3 years, and I really do not need to pursue masters like everyone else. 

The question is, if I do pursue masters, I'll live more of the student life, more enjoyment and more carefree. But if I go for a job, I'll be ahead in my career, and earn a lot more than people my age. What would you have done if you were on my place?

#Second

I've read a lot of posts in this sub that talk about negotiating your salary and job hopping. So, as a fresher in the workplace, how long should I wait till I start looking for another job? What are some pointers, that made you look for a different workplace?"

I neither liked the subject of my degree nor the experience. People in my course weren't particularly social, I got constantly canceled on or rejected when trying to initiate hanging/ going out or simply not invited. I did join several student associations, yet people usually would go there for career events and barely stay for socials. I was often alone and therefore started getting FOMO and anxiety as I had high expectations of a great university experience. During online university, things got even worse as most of my peers followed the courses from their home city/country. I was good at the subject I was studying, even though I didn't find it particularly interesting, so I stayed around. 

Now, that I am done, I am in a lot of regret for chosen particular subject and university. I am currently doing an internship in the field I studied but still can't see myself enjoying working in the field long-term.

I now have the chance to continue at postgraduate level and apply for Master's degree starting in September 2022, but I am scared it will be more of the same and people are going to be even less social and willing to go or hang out than during undergrad. Should I start a new undergrad degree in a different field? Scared I would be too old though as I would already be 24 + it would extremely costly. Are people social at post-graduate level?"

Should I hop jobs now?,rg_cyborg77,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q7dpsd/i_got_promoted_to_a_lead_and_had_a_quick_rapid/,"I am in my late 20s and I have been really engaged in this startup since its inception.

I joined as an intern then became full time and manager and eventually a lead of a tech wing.

All this growth happened within 4 years.

The hike is 10% per year on an average. It's not much compared to job hop hikes but considering it's a startup it's fine. I really like the core team and CEO as we have been together in building this product. We have a really positive culture and there is mutual respect and trust among each other.

There were times where the stress level was high (and I did have my burnouts) but the team was supportive to give me breaks and I can take my time off too. Aside code, I learnt a lot about startups I general.

Recently we got funded and I got promoted to a tech lead. I also got a fat bonus equivalent to 2 times my annual pay. They strive their best to treat me well and I am grateful for it.

But recently I see people hopping jobs to get a 50 or 100% hike (esp during covid). I really wonder if I am missing out something.

On one hand I have a good team with a strong culture who wants me to be in their journey to become a big company.

On the other hand, I have FOMO as I see people hopping jobs to get hikes and more experience. Doing this would obviously end my relationship with a current company.

The question I have in mind is should i hop jobs now? Is it even worth it given the respect and treatment my current company provides?

We've all known each other for around 8 years now and share a very tight knit friend group.  

Our startup has made a decent amount of progress over the past year especially within the last few couple months. However, myself and my other friend have noticed a lack of effort being put in by our third friend. We've had multiple discussions about his lack of commitment, but no significant changes have been made thus far. Ever since early this summer, it seems that our company is no longer his number one priority due to a summer internship. For context, he also attends one of the highest ranking universities for Computer Science and has a very rigorous course-load. 

Recently, we've been having internal discussions about going through a seed funding round, but are unsure if our third friend has the necessary motivation and passion to carry out his assigned tasks. 

I'm very conflicted as how to proceed being that he is one of my closest friends. But at a certain point he may be detrimental to our progress. Any advice for what to do in this situation would be greatly appreciated!"

Both locations seem amazing to me as I would love to live in either after graduating (this will be my last internship). One concern is WLB. I know Microsoft is usually much better, but not sure if being on an Azure team will affect this greatly, though I may learn more.

I went to a vocational school for plumbing before covid. It was ok, the only time when I was taught anything was when something broke on campus and we had to fix it. After a bit i got some internships through the school to work in different of places some were good, most were bad. When covid hit I had to go home since school closed so i just waited for it to end....but it never really did. soon enough they gave me a certificate that was it. its been about a year since then, I've been working a retail Maintenance position part time.

Its a janitor with a few extra steps and to be frank I don't mind the job but I feel like I wasted my time going there only to end up in retail. I've met a lot of great friends working there but most of them left to go to college. the people that are here don't plan on staying. 

 After talking to most of them I've been thinking if I should go to college. i wasn't the greatest student but I want to make something of myself and I don't want to be in retail the rest of my life. i was thinking  something in Computers like Cyber Security or Databases though i know next to nothing about how they work or if i would like it at all. 

My brother ( who is also going to college) is telling me going for 4 years isn't worth it and I should try a certification course. My friends tell me I should at least try a class or 2 before I commit to anything.

q7g1oy,1,2021-10-13,"The road not taken: A overthinking see-saw of ""Choosing the right career option"" - Technical vs Non-Technical?",swap_null,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/q7g1oy/the_road_not_taken_a_overthinking_seesaw_of/,"As an Engineering Graduate in Computer Science in India, I got my first job as a Software Engineer in an MNC. The pay is good for some people, but I am not satisfied with it. Keep in mind that it does not mean that I think I deserve more(based on my skillset as a fresher).  
I never liked coding during my college life and I just studied enough to make it through. I realized that in order to secure a job in the technical field, I will need to be good at it since almost all companies require the candidate to perform well in a coding test and also pass a coding interview, I had to practice and learn the basics to get in. I got 2 offers and I chose the one with the better pay and better working environment based on my research. 

Now since **I was not into technical during my college life, I tried looking into Marketing and primarily Digital Marketing**. That field was new and it's definitely not going to stop being great in the future. I tried a few internships and none of them were a great learning experience for me and it made me doubt this field. This is the exact reason I did not enjoy coding, I found it interesting but the teaching method was so dull that I didn't enjoy learning it.

Keep in mind that I have done online training in Digital Marketing and I still find it interesting. I like the field and how people use psychology to manipulate consumers, I love reading and watching videos related to these topics.

  
The issue that concerns me is the ""What-ifs"" that I keep getting. These what-ifs are just a barrier in my growth and I have started to realize this fact. I want to try the field in which I have had no good experience in but I find it fascinating enough to give it a shot(talking about marketing and digital marketing). On the other hand, I will be giving up the field for which my family spent lots of money to get me this degree, which would not be a fun thing.

**What if?**

1. What if the coding/technical field is the one for me? Maybe I just need to find what works for me.
2. What if the Marketing job does not pay me well enough? Technical jobs will pay me more in the short run and I will earn a lot if I stick to a particular skill and later switch jobs. 
3. What if I think I will like the Marketing role but I don't and now I have ended up wasting a few years of my life which were crucial to earn money?
4. What if nobody gives me a good Marketing job because I don't have an educational qualification. What if I can't compete with the qualified people for the Marketing jobs?

These are some of the questions which make it difficult for me to find an answer.

I have been told that if I stick to it, a mutual connection can get me a technical job that will pay almost 2.5 times what I am making right now.

I used to say to myself that coding isn't my cup of tea but since I joined my job, the training has taught me that I never actually tried it on my own to know if I really like it or not.

Honestly, I think I want to give both of the fields a shot, any idea how do I start? And how do I stop overthinking about the right career choice and instead just keep learning? I would love to get some clarity."

I'm in a predicament right now while I am applying for my first software engineering internship. At my university I have minor accommodations for a diagnosed mental illness that allots me slightly longer exam times and up to a 3-day extension on assignments in emergency situations. Now that I am taking online assessments I find that some of the time limits are killing me. This week I was invited for my first technical interview and while scheduling it I was asked if I would like to request disability-related accommodations (like extra time) for the interview.

Now I know employers are not legally able to discriminate, but something inside me still feels like I shouldn't disclose my disability and should just try my best. I fear the employer will see the extra time request and think of me as a burden/slow worker. In reality, I don't necessarily work slowly, I just *sometimes* need to walk away from work and come back to it and that's really what the extra time is for.

Has anyone here had this dilemma? Have you ever requested accommodations and how did it go?"

I actually came into college as an Electrical Engineering major but then switch after my freshman year (we have a first year engineering program where all EE, CPE, and CS majors take the same classes freshman year, so that didn't delay any of my classes). My reason for switching to CPE is that I wanted to work in hardware/embedded, but decided that if I would be okay with going on to do software engineering. Recently I had a coding interview for a software engineering internship position where I had to make some fixes to a website, and man, when I first opened that up in Visual Studio Code, I immediately knew I didn't want to ever have to work on something like that. I feel like with computer engineering, I'm closing so many doors on electrical engineering jobs that I would honestly prefer to doing anything software related. I generally like my EE classes the most and also feel like I am more competent in those classes than I am in my CS and even CPE classes. I don't want to mislead anyone, I am okay with programming as a part of a job, even a large part of the job, I just don't want that to be all that I do. I haven't talked to my advisor, but I have looked at the degree requirements and I'm pretty sure I can graduate on time in EE without taking any summer courses, so that shouldn't be an issue. The tipping point for me was trying to sign up for classes next semester and realizing that computer engineering majors are way more limited in what they can take for electives, while electrical engineers can essentially take the same classes given that they have the proper prerequisites (which I do since I got so far into CPE). I also want to add that the computer science minor is something that I have already completed due to how far I got into CPE, so I don't have to take any extra classes for that"

I have run into a predicament this year choosing internship options for summer 2022. Last summer I was able to work at a big oil and gas company as a Software Engineer and landed a return offer for next year. I would be working in Houston, but the pay is very very low compared to other SWE intern positions in Houston and elsewhere in the US.

I was able to get a scholarship from my school that paired me with one of the companies that sponsor our school's CS department. I was lucky enough to match with a bigger tech company which opened up connections to people at that company. Before receiving that scholarship, however, I applied to the company I was paired with and made it to the final round of interviews. My recruiter said that the team I interviewed with gave me positive feedback but moved on with a different candidate. My recruiter offered to search for other teams that I could potentially match with and I also have a networking event with people from the company I got paired with. 

**Pros of a tech company:**

Better pay

Closer to home (no relocation)

Tech company

**Pros of big oil company:**

A guaranteed job for summer 2022

Good WLB

Familiar work environment

With my return job offer expiring in the next couple of days, I have turned to this Reddit community for advice. Should I play it safe and return to the company I interned with last year or should I take the gamble and hope for a spot at the tech company?

In the heart of the fifth sphere of Twain, the Decadia district, two teenage girls were relaxing in the bottom of their open top boat, watching the seagulls fly overhead.    Jean and Clara, twins, laid with their feet at opposite ends of the tiny rowboat and their heads side by side.

Neither had spoken for over twenty minutes, when Clara's dataslate necklace rang.   Clara touched it and a pink and red holographic girl appeared over the two.   Clara laughed.  ""Tabitha, what's up?""

The floating red and pink AI danced around a bit, cartwheeling.  ""I had an idea.""  She said.

Clara rose up on her elbows.  ""Yeah?   Another prank war with your brother?""

Tabitha crossed her eyes and spun in a circle.  ""Nope.   That war is still ongoing.  No, this is way better.""

Jean reached a hand out and flicked water through the hologram.  ""Spit it out girl.""

Tabitha changed into a bird and flew around the boat, landing on the railing.   ""I found the place.""

Clara and Jean shared a look, and then turned back at the holographic bird.

Tabitha changed into a cherub, fluttering her wings.  ""At the border near the Kawaroo, Krattoch, and Lantillian factory districts is a legal void.   Lots of pipeworks, rooms and stuff, but no one claims it because it would ruin claims on a truly vital bit of habitat.    Your dad lost claim to it years ago when he sold the area to the Consortium.""

Clara put her back against the hull.  ""Sounds dangerous.   I think you should keep looking.""

Tabitha shook her head and turned into a cat.  She started purring and walking the rail.  ""The place isn't that bad.  Lots of room, power, atmosphere, and deep in the station.    No one goes there.  No cameras.   I've had two of my crawlers stationed there watching this whole week, no ones been in or out.""

Jean smiled at Clara.   ""Mom's over at Sparrow for a decacycle.   It might be doable.""

Clara shook her head.  ""No.  I want a party just as much as you two, but an abandoned industrial hab sounds way too sketchy.""

Tabitha hopped into the boat as a hyena, laughing.  ""Too late.  Invites are out.  Party at the Gabellum tonight!   I rolled through your friends lists, and their friends lists, and theirs, and theirs, and theirs.  Party!""

Jean laughed.  ""Sounds like we got a party to get ready for sis.""

Clara shut her eyes and sighed.   ""I'm taking my breather just in case, and so should you.""

Jean looked at Tabitha.  ""You got a line on any spikes?""

Tabitha flickered into the bow, reclining as a glowing red man with sunglasses.  Tabitha pulled them down a bit.  ""Gurl.  I got the hookup.   My parties are dope.""  Tabitha flickered again into her pink and red girl form, tightrope walking the rail.  ""My brother is going to DJ.  We got all our crawlers heading down there to set up.   Hope to see you two there.""

Clara shook her head as the AI vanished.   She looked across at her sister.  ""Guess we should row back and start getting ready.""

Jean grabbed her oar and lifted Clara's over to her.  ""Think she'll invite Brandon?""

""Yeah.  He's on both of our friends lists.  I'm sure she did, but she's probably listening still so, if she didn't I bet she did now.""  Clara said, as she started rowing.

Jean shivered and screamed out over the lake.  She turned and looked at her sister.  ""Balls!  I'm excited.   This is going to be fun.""

Clara headbutt her shoulder.  ""Keep rowing dumbass.""

Jean glared at her.

Clara broke a smile.  ""I'm excited too.""

\---===\*===---

Clara and Jean took a vacuum pod across the three spheres over to stockyards.   The two girls walked through the masses of working peoples and crossed over into the Kawaroo district.   They stood twice as tall as everyone in the concourse.   The small feathered creatures with their tiny plump hands darted out of their way.   One small one stopped, mesmerized by Clara's shimmering blue dress.

""Beautiful!""  It clucked at her.

Clara knelt down, looking it in its black beady eyes.  ""I think you're beautiful too.   Can I pet you?""

The Kawaroo youngling looked at her, then back at its mother and siblings.   The mother nodded, clucking at it.   The youngling looked up at the giant human.  ""Can I touch your outer covers?""

Clara nodded.  The youngling stroked its head on her blue dress, and Clara petted it.  ""You're soft.""  She said.  After a moment of petting, Clara stood up.  ""Thank you for letting me pet you.  If you're ever in Decadia stop by say hi.""  Clara threw over contact info to the mother and started after Jean to catch up.

Jean laughed.  ""What was that?""

""They're cute.  If they weren't sapient I'd keep one.""

Jean giggled and looked at her wrist slate.  ""Access tunnel should be up here.""  She looked and pointed.  ""I think this building here.""  She waved her sister to follow and ducked into the shop.

Gree roots and branches wove through the ceiling, walls, and floors.   A Kawaroo female with three long head feathers clucked at them.

""Strangers.  Strangers.  What are you in my shop for?   You don't eat our feed.  Why are you here?""

Clara approached the counter.  ""Um.  I'm sorry.""  She looked around at the aisles of food and odd items.  ""Um, I was following our map and it said there is a tunnel around here.  You ever heard of the Gabellum?""

The clerk looked over the humans, and then back at Clara's eyes.  ""I know where it is.  Why do you want to go there?  That is a silly place for anyone to go.""

Clara flicked over five credits to the clerk.

The clerk looked over the amount and then back at her.  ""What is that for?  You are buying something?""

""Is the entrance around here?""  Clara asked.

""You really want to go in then.   Yes, it is around here.   Back of my store is an access hatch.    In waste room.   It is silly to want to go down there.  Why you humans want there?""

Clara looked over at Jean, and Jean walked over.

Jean flicked the clerk five credits as well.  ""We are going to use your entry hatch.   You may get lots more peoples coming through.   Feel free to charge them five.""  She looked at Clara and then back at the clerk.  ""Yeah, charge everyone five credits who comes through.  Make yourself some profit.  Just direct them to the hatch ok?""

The clerk eyed the two humans and pattered back and forth on her splayed feet.  ""Is this trouble?  I don't want trouble.""

Clara laughed and started toward the restroom.

Jean shook her head.  ""No, shouldn't be.   Just a party.""

The Kawaroo shivered her feathers, and raised her head plumage.  ""Party.  Many youth coming.   You use my hatch, you take my youth with you.  They need to be social, meet other species.  What say human girls?""

Clara stopped in the door to the back hallway.  She looked over at Jean.  Jean shrugged.

Clara smiled at the clerk.  ""More the merrier.""  Clara then waved Jean to follow.

The two girls went into the restroom together and found the hatch near the sink.   They pushed it open and entered into the ventilation systems.

The air was thick and warm in the tunnel.   After a few hundred meters it opened up into a large expansive cylinder going up and down.   Clara stood at the edge looking down the shaft.   Red lasers pulsated through the tube, up and past them.   A four legged robot crawled up the wall of the tube and stopped beside them.  Tabitha projected out of several holoemitters in front of them.

""Hello Clemens girls!  You're early!""  The AI shouted.

Clara looked up the shaft.  ""Um.  Yeah we came to help get things set up.""

Jean leaned in and looked down.  ""This the place?  I don't really feel like falling to my death today.""

Tabitha shifted into her gymnast form, and began cartwheeling again.  ""That's the beauty!   The whole place is a grav-joint.   The habitats on the other sides are all downwarding into it.  Come on in!  You can walk around the whole tube.""

Clara looked at her, and then crouched down.    She leaned over the edge and put her hand onto the wall beneath the tunnel lip.  Her inner ear changed and she felt the peculiar shift, her body felt like it should be falling down the tunnel they came in through.   Clara looked back in at Jean.  ""Feels legit.""

Jean laughed and jumped out the tunnel, landing in the Gabellum tube.   She rolled as she hit and looked over at Clara.  Clara glared at her and she burst out laughing.

Clara looked over at Tabitha.  ""Alright.  Let's start getting set up then.""

Tabitha walked the crawler over to her, projecting herself larger in front of the human.  ""Well, I've got crates of drinks stored down in those empty pipes over there.      You could start setting them out for people.""

Clara nodded and started toward the open piping.   She brushed aside a mass of moss and found the boxes of drinks.   Whiskey, wine, scotch, and pallets of beer were piled in the back.   She walked toward the first and felt chilled.   ""Tabitha, it's freezing in here.  I thought you said this place had a stable atmosphere.""

Tabitha projected herself near the mass of moss.   ""Well yeah, most of the tube is warm.  That piping runs out along the outer hull.  All this moss grows here to catch the fog that forms.   I guess I coulda stored it out here and let it go bad in the warmth.""

Clara grabbed a box and started over towards a flat area to uncrate it.  ""Nah I don't care.""  She groaned as she sat it down.

Jean looked in at the drinks.  ""Damn it.  When are some boys going to get here to do this.""

Clara walked past her, and gave her a smack.  ""Quit being lazy and grab some bottles.   Tabitha needs our help.""

Jean groaned.  ""Lame.""

\---===\*===---

Within the hour five Krattoch showed up.   Their alpha, Prophen, quickly set about with his pack and started moving the drinks for the girls.   Jean and Clara climbed on a ledge and started directing them.   Tabitha appeared next to the girls.

""My brother is busy at the moment, but he'll be here in about thirty and start the music up.""  The AI said.

Clara shrugged and opened a bag of poppers.   She leaned her head back and flicked one into the air, catching it in her mouth and chomping down.   ""Doesn't matter.  I'm in relax mode.""

Tabitha flickered for a moment.  ""The poor little Kawaroo is overwhelmed.  Lots of people showing up in her store.""

Jean looked down the tube at the tunnel entrance as four more peoples arrived, two Infinigan, a Grazer, and an Eir.  She pointed.  ""Avio!  Get your ass over here!""

Avio, a newly arrived Eir, transitioned into the gravity well and started walking over to her.

""You got the spikes?""  She asked.

Avio reached into his belt pouch and pulled out a glowing vial.  ""I have quite a few of them, each species tailored.   Did you wish to make a purchase?""

""Of course, you slimey stud you.   I want one for me and my sister.""

He pulled out another glowing vial and handed the two over to her.  ""Eighty clams.""

Jean nodded and threw the amount over to him.  ""Done.""   She handed one over to Clara.

Clara looked it over and then looked at Avio.  ""She's been bragging on this stuff.  What's going to happen to me?""

Avio stepped closer to her, his head in front of hers as she sat.   ""You will feel warm, a comfort will fall on your body.  Your mind will feel at ease, and your senses will be heightened.""

Jean leaned over and laughed at Clara.  ""Brandon and I made out for hours on it.  It's amazing.  You feel everything like, so intense.  It's amazing.""

Clara looked down at it and then up at Avio.  ""Is it addictive?""

""It is less so than your alcohol, but more so than your sugars.""  He replied.

Clara handed it back to Jean.  ""Give mine to Brandon when he gets here.  You two enjoy it.""

Jean smiled and hopped off the ledge.  ""Will do.""   She pranced over toward the tunnel entrance as several more groups entered.

Avio left to go associate with the party he entered with.    Several Krattoch walked over and purchased green glowing vials off of him.

Clara shook her head.  ""I'm not a fan of that bit Tabitha.""

Tabitha flickered beside her.  ""I am.  I wish I could feel half of what you organics do.""  Tabitha looked over at the tunnel as two more human females entered.   ""Speaking of that.  You know those girls?""

Clara looked over at them.  ""They're new.  Came downstream on the Harbringer, some religious families and refugees.   They're in my chemistry class.""

Tabitha smiled, flickering into the form of a large red python.  ""Sssssure.   I want to meet them.""  She hissed.  Tabitha slithered down from the ledge and crossed the tube over to them.

Clara watched as the Tabitha changed back into a small girl and started talking to the two.    The three of them walked around the tube walls over to the drinks and each of them poured themselves a glass.   From Clara's vantage they appeared to be standing on the wall, perpendicular to gravity.   After a moment, Tabitha pranced back over and the two followed.

Tabitha laughed a bit.  ""Clara, I want you to meet Etta.""

Etta was short, stalky, acne just starting on her face.   She approached and extended a hand out to Clara.  ""Hi.  Tabitha said you were the two hosting the party.   My sister and I wanted to thank you for inviting us.""

Clara shook her hand.  ""No problem.  You're in my chemistry class aren't you?""

Etta nodded.  ""Yeah.  I didn't think you noticed me.  We try to keep to ourselves.""

Clara smiled and looked from her to her taller sister.  ""No need to be shy.  Humans need need to get to know each other.""  Clara then extended her hand to the taller sister.  ""Clara Clemens.   Nice to meet you.""

She took it and shook.  ""Marion.""

Clara nodded.  ""Nice to meet you both.  You liking the Twain so far?""

Marion looked at her sister for a moment and then met Clara's gaze.  ""We, well I miss home, but it's gone.   I guess we're making do, adapting.""

""How's the rest of your family taking it?  Have any other siblings?""

Etta crawled up to the ledge, struggling a bit with her short legs.   Eventually she made it and sat next to Clara.  ""No, its just us.  Thankfully there's a fund for refugees.  It helps.""

Jean approached with a bottle and handed it to Clara.   Clara accepted it.  ""Etta, this is my sister Jean.""

Etta smiled and lifted her glass towards her.

Jean nodded. ""You guys are in our chemistry class.""   She pointed at Marion.  ""You sit by Brandon don't you.""

Marion sighed.  ""Yeah, he's cute.  I lucked out.""

Jean glared at her.  ""He's mine.  Back off, understand?""

Marion lifted her hands up.  ""I meant nothing.  You can have him.""

Clara rolled her eyes.  ""Jean, they were just telling me how they are refugees here, how our dad's fund has helped them get settled.""

Jean looked them over.  ""Oh, well that's good I guess.   You two plan on working or something, or you going to be fund kids for the foreseeable?""

Etta leaned over, staring Jean down.  ""I've already got an internship.  Going to be working in a research lab over in the Infinigan wards.  What about you?  You going to work or you just going to live off of daddy's money?""

Clara cleared her throat.  ""Jean and I do help my dad.   Jean works down in the accounting firm, learning the ropes there.   I've always been more hands on, and he lets me work in his shipbay on the weekends.   Lots of Infinigan there too.""  She looked over at Marion.  ""What about you Marion?  You got anything lined up?""

Marion shook her head.  ""Not yet.   I like ships though.  Your dad have any room for more helpers you think?""

Clara nodded.  ""Hell yeah.  Especially humans.   The Infinigan get to him sometimes, and I don't get down there as much as he would like.   I can put in a word for you if you want.""

Marion smiled.  ""I'd love that.   We could use the extra clams too.""

At that moment Tabitha's brother arrived and began broadcasting synth music through the Gabellum.   Jean's spike started kicking in and she started writhing to the music.   She danced away from the girls.

Marion shouted. ""I see Brandon coming in.   Do you think she's really mad at me?""

Clara shook her head, shouting back.  ""No.  She is just reactionary.  She'll be mad for a moment, but don't worry.   It passes quick.""  Clara looked and saw Jean making out with Brandon already.  ""I think she's already forgotten about you.""

Marion watched for a moment, and then caught the eye of one of Brandon's friends.  ""Who's he?""  She shouted.

Clara laughed.  ""Fair game.   Lucas Rain.  He's really smart, but awkward.""

Marion smiled and looked at him.  ""I like awkward.""  She started walking off to introduce herself.

Etta leaned in towards Clara.  ""We've really never partied before.  I don't really know what to do.""

Clara pointed her bottle at Marion who was laughing and talking with Lucas already.  ""She's doing alright.  Get out there, introduce yourself.""

Etta shook her head.  ""It's too much.  Mind if I sit with you here?""

Clara took a drink and shrugged.  ""Doesn't bother me a bit.""

The two sat and watched as the tube filled with peoples.   Some started lifting others onto their shoulders and into the grav-void that ran down the center of the tube.   The masses danced underneath as an Infinigan female curled her arms in and floated down the tube above everyone's heads.   Clara laughed and reached a hand out, catching the Infinigan girl's hand, and she pivoted down onto the ledge.

""Hey Screechtongue.""  Clara said.

""Hey.  I'm loving this party.  Tabitha said you and Jean put it together.""

Clara shrugged.  ""In name only.""

Screechtongue bobbed her ears, and stretched her four arms out into the air.  She writhed back and forth as lasers and music pulsed around her.    ""I love this!""  She shouted.

Clara leaned over to Etta.  ""I think she had one of Avio's spikes.""

Etta nodded.

The two human girls sat on the ledge watching as the numerous species danced, coupled, kissed, sang, and enjoyed themselves in the tunnel.

Etta watched Marion as she kissed Lucas.  She could almost feel his lips herself."

I will finish my bachelor's degree in CS at a Swiss university in about a year. (Swiss nationality myself)

The goal is to join FAANG(+) afterwards, so basically Google (since Amazon &amp; Netflix don't have offices here and Facebook &amp; Apple tend to hire only experienced people). But I am also interested to join in EU countries and companies just below FAANG (e.g. Yelp, Uber etc.). I've read a lot that at US companies you should mainly cram leetcode, which is what I'm doing.

My ""problem"" is that my resume seems pretty 08/15. So I've never done an internship, my GPA is decent, but nothing special. I had projects at university, but of course they don't have the same value. Right now I'm programming some random stuff so I have a bit more practice for my bachelor thesis (which will be rather programming-heavy) and also feel like doing some side projects.

I've also often read that side projects hardly play a role for recruiters, at least.  What do you guys think about this? Even if it's not enough for FAANG, I think it makes a good impression for ""normal"" employers, and it also shows what you can do regarding programming.

I don't have time for an internship now, or would either have to postpone graduation, or do it after graduating with a bachelor's degree.

**How can I get the most out of my modest resume?**

I consider myself to be very gifted but so far I have only taken the path of least resistance and invested too little."

I've noticed that a post on this subreddit has about a 0.95 probability of either being about jobs or internships, most noticeably at Big Tech companies such as FAANG.

There's a complete lack of passion and genuine conversation about computer science. This is in stark contrast to how I and many of my peers experience the field and academic life. For example, Big Tech companies are very much frowned upon and often referred to as ""selling your soul"", even by some of our professors. 

I'd like to start a conversation about how you experience your time at university/college. Do you love CS as well? Are you just in it for the money? Somewhere in between? I won't judge. After all, you won't fool me into believing that ***all*** engineers, doctors, and lawyers are strictly following their passion and not whatever makes their bank accounts grow the fastest. 

I for example would love an academic career even if it means never setting foot in a corporation such as Amazon (which to be honest I see as a bonus) if that means I get to do what I love: CS. So what about you?

Anyway, cheers and good luck!"

I've come to reddit to seek advice as Reddit never fails. 

I'm currently an intern at an industry leader in my industry. I've only been there for about a month and a half now. My term there ends at the end of December so naturally I was searching for a job for after this term. I got a very good offer with better pay from a different smaller company and the deadline to take it or leave it is in a few days. 

My two options are:

1) Go to my current manager, be open about the situation, and ask if I will be offered an extension at my current company.

2) Accept the offer from the different company for now. In this case, if later down the line I do end up getting an extension from my current employer that I'd like to accept, I will have to let this new company know that I won't be able to move forward with their job.

I'm a fairly young professional so this is the first time im in a situation like this. Would greatly appreciate any advice as to which of the two routes of actions to take or if there is a 3rd better option I'm not considering.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been wanting to get into tech as a career for around a year and change now. I've done a lot of PC building and other tech projects before that in high school (Im now a sophomore in college). Since deciding to go into IT I've had a job as an in-house IT tech for a logistics company, but eventually had to leave because they did not need me anymore (they outsourced their IT to an MSP). I then worked testing cell phones and doing general IT for a small online retailer for a few months, until I landed an internship through a connection at a software development/IT firm (as an intern IT technician). After the internship I asked for the job and was declined because I do not have enough experience (I did not mess anything up either, but they werent sure that they could send me out to clients, mainly because they were not prepared to train me as an intern - they even admitted this was the reason after I asked). 

&amp;#x200B;

I passed CompTIA A+ 1001 and am hopefully taking 1002 in 2 weeks. Over the past month or so I've been looking into many different tech support jobs and they all either require way more years of experience than I have, or a bachelor's degree which I will not have for another two years. I have applied to schools, IT firms, pretty much everywhere, and imo I do have a pretty solid resume for someone my age (albeit with a 2 year work gap because I spent 2 years studying abroad, not related to school). I've been going about applying using LinkedIn, Ziprecruiter, Indeed, and my own personal connections.

Any advice on how to land an entry level help desk job?"

Well I decided to stick it out and I’m starting to really enjoy grad school now. I’ve made some new friends and good networking connections. My thesis is making good progress and it’s in something I find interesting and important. Thanks for all the advice! I’m glad I stuck with it!!

Asking for some advice.

I’m a graduate in Electrical Engineering and I am on contract for a Research Assistantship through the university.

After this semester, I have one more semester and a summer class.

I worked an internship over the summer and ended up falling in love with the job. They offered a full time position and I turned it down to take this research position with the school. The deal I got with the school was a good deal. My school is free and I get paid a salary. 

The only problem is that I have realized I hate grad school and I miss my job terribly. So now I’m conflicted. 

Would it be detrimental to my career to resign from my research assistantship and go work? I don’t want to burn any bridges and I hate going back on contracts. Also, I’m almost done and I would hate to quit when I’m this close. However, right now I am living for the weekend and hating nearly every second of grad school.

Any advice?"

Hello,  im a mature student. thinking of going back to university but I'm in a  really tight situation so CS path is the quickest way for me to get a  university degree, since I'm 23 I feel like spending more than 4 years  is too much.

So my questions are.  First of all is the life in IT worth it ? Financially ?  The industry  offers the most opportunity towards financial security and growth. So I  know once I'm in it I'm all set. but in my experience from my 2 years of  freelance dev and most of my friends from school became SWE and I know  for a fact that IT is a lifestyle more than just a 9-5 job, its hard to  allocate time and resources to build other interests when we  constantly  obligated to upgrade and learn new skills to catch up with new  technologies.

Burnout rate, one of  my friend just snapped, he's mentally gone . just under 2 years of SWE  as an outsourced worker from a developing country. My 3 years of prev  uni was the darkest time of my life , i was in my worst state mentally  and physically. and every single one of my friends in IT says the same  thing.Its an excessively mentally exhausting [job](https://job.im/)  . Its easier to rest your body than your mind so I chose to work in a  physical job instead in the past 3 years but i know there's no security  in this job. somehow in the future i have to earn an actual wage that  can sustain LIVING. So i started to debate with myself  about this whole  IT thing again.

So, i would  greatly appreciate any insights,thoughts,and advice from any of you who  took the same path in IT how did it go ? Uni ? internship ? and  importantly hows the life-work balance. Do you think IT industry job  invades too much of your time and life ?

thank you"

I'm in my last year of college. i don't really have any meaningful side projects, and the only tech-related internship I had was a rather bad experience. At that place, I wasn't speaking my native language and it made it really hard to learn. so i feel like i haven't had a ""normal"" internship experience yet.

my grades are okay, I think it's 3.7 gpa. I transferred my major to CS in my second year because I came into college undeclared. also got a minor in a humanities subject, due to interest. 

I never had very much guidance in terms of job. so yes, maybe I should have tried to do more projects or internships before. but I didn't... 

when I look on job postings, it all looks too difficult, and I get overwhelmed really easily. i somehow don't even feel qualified to get an internship, but i know that's stupid, after all I have years of classes under my belt.

has anyone felt this way? I feel like I don't have as much of a fundamental love for cs and coding as other people. I like learning cs stuff in class, I like doing coding assignments, even theory classes are fun to me. but i just never felt compelled to build something on my own. all I've made is my personal website, but it's not complete. now looking towards getting a job, I realize that my peers are way ahead of me. I just feel kind of stupid at this point.

any advice or words would be appreciated. even if you don't relate, i would like to hear some thoughts. thank you and sorry for sounding so pathetic lol"

I'm in a bit of a weird situation here. I am currently doing second-degree in Computer Science. I was fucking around and applying to things this past year and somehow I landed a full time ""SWE"" (I use this term lightly, I don't feel like much of an engineer at all) job at a grant funded research group that is partnered with a US federal executive department. I was (and am still) ecstatic, especially given my experience level (low!). I am definitely learning a ton and am far happier than I was at my old SOC job, and I am very thankful for the opportunity. 

However; I am beginning to wonder if I shot myself in the foot. I am working with somewhat old (not ancient) frameworks and technologies in helping maintain a CRUD app. I plan on only staying for a year, but once I'm out should I apply to internships or should I shoot for FTE? I will likely still be in school a year from now (thought close to being done).

If I do apply for internships, would it be weird that I have full time experience as a ""SWE""? I have no internships prior to this. In a way, I feel like I skipped a very important part of the CS experience. 

Thanks all!

I could do Databricks over winter and Facebook over summer to fit both, but since Databricks winter is 16 weeks long, I would need to take both winter and spring quarters off to do so.

I'm a former IT Technician at Fedex, and have also worked as a Ops Tech IT Intern at Amazon. My dream is to be a full stack developer and travel the world while doing so. Only issue is, I'm not as knowledgeable to be a dev quite yet. I'm originally a missionary kid and was taught to always strive to be the best and work hard. As the saying goes, ""He who does not work, does not eat"". So having a work-drive is not much of an issue for me. But the issue still arises that I'm currently without a job as of late.

Nevertheless, the cause as to why I'm without a job, is simply because of lack of production and the chip shortage. On top of me simply walking in, doing the wrong thing at the wrong time/place is why I got fired. In short just know that I was simply fired due to having to take an emergency phone call and having to leave work early due to flooding recently in Tennessee; which had caused my family to be trapped in their homes. My employer didn't take a liking to it as he thought I should've stayed and kept working but to me, my family **always** comes first.

Since then I've been looking and applying day and night for jobs around the clock, with little to no avail. Many require degree's or a more ""professional"" experience. From entry level positions such as...

* Data Analysts
* Software Tester
* PC Helpdesk
* Ops Tech IT
* Game Tester
* Web Dev
* Front End Dev
* HTML Dev
* Programmer
* QA Analyst
* etc

&amp;#x200B;

While that is stirring in my mind; I have been waking up early and learning how to further enhance my skills as a newbie programmer from originally learning HTML and recently started learning JavaScript on a website known as [mikedane.com](https://mikedane.com), whom has multiple languages to teach from Web Development to Software Development, to even Databases. He's taught me a lot from starting from a basic script such as hello world..

&amp;#x200B;

And even though my understanding is not as well as others out there in programming. I'm still longing for a chance to be able to just try and work in an environment that allows me to pursue my dream. I have the drive for it, and know I'll succeed, its just the opportunity to make it happen has yet to be shown. And while I'm sure some of you are probably wondering why haven't you applied for unemployment? Well truth be told, I have, its just that I keep getting denied due to the fact that I was fired (even if it was for a reason that was as important as taking care of my family)

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I'm at a cross; I've tried recruiters, and the one I've been with hasn't contacted me within almost 3 weeks now and I'm worried that they've abandoned me. I'm short on cash, have bills due soon and can't seem to find a job in the field that I've worked in for almost a year and a half now, and the local jobs nearby don't nearly pay enough to make do with my current situation so I'm forced to have to either drive 30-150 miles just for a decent job, or if I could, work remotely as I'd love for that to be; so I could save gas and be there for my family when needed. All in all though, I'm at a cross and don't know what to do. I'm 21, and have worked hard up until now and am having a hard time finding the courage to keep going on or to find hope at all. If you know anyone who is hiring or would be willing to hire me, please please dm me, or reply in chat as I'm certain without a doubt that I can be of use, given the chance to try. Thank you in advance and my apologies for the long winded story..

q7t61q,5,2021-10-14,How do I prepare for programming interviews when I even can't grasp a single concept efficiently? Even with dedicated practice?,justwantaneasylife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q7t61q/how_do_i_prepare_for_programming_interviews_when/,"# This is all additional context for my question. No need to read it if you don't want to :). Just me ranting here.

Junior in college for CS degree here. I had to take a lot of my integral courses for my major during the pandemic online time (Data Structures, Intro to AI). It really didn't go well for me (more like it went to f\*\*\*\*\*g shit). I tried my best and went on this sub's FAQ and read the resources for learning Data Structures, watching videos and programming them on my own so I wouldn't struggle down the line as I graduate, but even with that I am now realizing that I essentially didn't grasp the idea of any one of these concepts in those classes whatsoever. I mentally checked out from March 2020 until now because of this constant stress of being behind.

And now I'm in my Intro to Algorithmic Thinking class in-person, and we're talking about Divide and Conquer, Greedy algorithms, and we seem to be going at lightning speed (like introducing 2 algorithms per class), and by the time I kinda abstractly grasp one algorithm (not even counting the programing portion, just the intuition), another 3 are pelted at me, with random callbacks to Data Structures that I didn't realize were coming.

And I also know that getting a computer science internship during the Summer as a Junior onwards can be an integral part of starting a CS career and getting experience, so I have started mass applying for the hell of it, and am trying to play catch up with Leetcode and reading up on Data Structures as well. I have gotten a couple phone interview screens scheduled somehow, even though I know I am struggling to attempt to learn a lot of these basic concepts.

**Here is the learning loop that I am stuck in:**

1. I read/learn about a concept on my own or in-class (ex-&gt; LinkedList, Stack, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc)
2. I either grasp the concept abstractly, or I get stuck and have to watch hours of videos to understand it. But either way, for about 60% of these topics, I can understand the basic high level overview of what is happening, given at-least a week of watching videos and white boarding examples
3. I then try to program it using either pseudo-code or normal code. I play around with it. And once again try to see how it works. This either takes a decent amount of time or a *lot* of time &amp; debugging (I can't program it without at the pseudo-code as well)
4. I then try to solve school homework problems or Leetcode problems (like that Blind 75 question list) that uses the concepts. **And this is where I get stuck.**

* *I can't seem to understand a lot of the way these questions are phrased*
* *If I do understand the problem, I don't even know where to begin with the solution. With all of the constraints and differences in what the are asking for and using the algorithms or structures I have learned*
* *If I happen to understand the idea of a solution and maybe think of a possible algorithm or data structure to use to solve it, I don't remember how to program it without pseudocode, (which is something I am trying to avoid, using pseudocode). Or worse, I blank and I forget the concept*
* *I don't seem to have the way of thinking to approach these problems effectively*

5. Lastly, I get really frustrated and try approaching one of the other topics that I am trying to catch up on and understand, and in the process, throw out my progress learning the prior concept and restart the cycle.

Oh and to give you some additional laughter. About two weeks ago I got really frustrated with one of my homework assignments regarding Big-0 and Growth of Functions (don't get me started on that) and I just went to one of the easiest Leetcode problems that I could find (Fizzbuzz). And when I read it, it took me 30 minutes to understand the problem. But I then got an idea to try and solve it. And then, I realized, that they were asking me to use vectors. **My school never went over vectors at all.** I have only heard of them as an alternative to arrays and a little easier to use. And I then felt like an idiot and closed my laptop.

Pretty demoralizing. I'm at the point where I feel like I am a Freshman. I don't even feel a difference in what I know sometimes, from then till now. And I am so close to graduating and being thrust into the job hunt.

The only genuine sustained interest that I have found in programming is Web Development and UI/UX stuff. I have taken two courses on Server Side Scripting and Javascript and DHTML, and love it. I love making the server interact with the webpage and gather information. I actually love learning about it. And I want to build a website using this functionality that I actually enjoy and turn it into a project. Or, maybe, get a job with it!

But then I realize I won't even pass the technical interview stage as it stands currently, lol."

This is probably the worst day that I had. Bad work day, feeling utter defeat, being told that this probably isn't best field for me to work in, almost got hit by a car.

Was doing great at my internship. Was always on time, did the paperwork, schedules clients, the works. And then for the first time, I saw a client on my own. The info my client gave me was soul-crushing; I felt so many emotions (sadness, anger, hatred, vengeance), probably more intense than her. For a while, I ruminating about how badly they had it. And the cherry on top was a session I did with a co-worker with a story that wasn’t made up. I didn’t know what to do with this information, I felt I had to approach her differently. I felt awkward. Obviously, I’m not going to disclose it due to confidentiality.

I talked to my supervisors about this, and they said it was important to bring up. We talked, and we found out that the problem was that I felt that I needed to befriend them (which is a conflict in the session). Even though my client cried and told their life story, they went on with their day. I, however, replayed that scenario for a week. I was so caught up about it that I neglected to take care of myself (lack of sleep, bad eating habits, stressed out 24/7).

I told my therapist about it, and he was kinda concerned about how the role play was handled. For him, it seemed that this large amount of intimate information was too much to handle, especially with someone I work with. It's like the principal venting to a middle-schooler about how bad middle-schoolers are. Like, what am I supposed to do with this information?

That's where my ADHD/triggers play in.

TL;DR: Terrible at making friends for years due to a large history of rejection. Met my closest best friend/mentor, who encouraged me to go to counseling (and is the reason why I pursued this field). First person to actually wanted to engage with me. Had lots of fun, but he'd disregard me a lot. Ghosted me (and used multiple apps to contact me), canceled plans at the last minute, and wanted to see me on short notice. Told me he was having these ""moments"" with his demons. Wanted to return the favor since he helped me. He told me ""we should hang out more"". Ghosted me until he told me that he was never a ""go-outer"" or ""texter"". And never spoke to me again.

That was 2 years ago, and it still haunts me today. I'll admit I was needy, and texted him a lot for affirmations. I was new to adulting at the naive age of 18, too absorbed in schoolwork, and still didn't have a lot of friends in college. He'd often give excuses, but I brushed it off not to offend someone I looked up to. And I tolerated that for a long time. And then, I get ditched as if I was nothing, as if nothing we did matter. You don't know what ""rejection"" means until you've been tossed away by the person you trusted the most. Not to mention, this was during COVID, and I lost all but 1 of my relationships due to falling-outs, them moving to different states/countries, or just not meeting everyday from Mon - Fri.

Because of this, I've been so jaded and hostile towards people. I have major trust issues. I get angry easily. I honestly, wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy (and I'm an extremely vengeful person). I know I have other problems besides this, but that relationship was the most impactful. I've worked with my therapist (he's amazing) and I've learned a lot of coping skills, more about my personality, and ultimately that it's not my fault that the relationship ended the way it did. I took blame for others just so I could be included. I treated people's problems as my own, cause I was sad when my friends were sad. I'm EXTREMELY indignant when someone has been wronged for being good, and for their perpetrators (bullies, abusers, etc.) to get away it. And this carried over to my sessions (real and fake). I would take my clients' problems as my own. I thought this would be a normal thing, to connect with them, validate their feelings get to the nitty-gritty, and make these breakthroughs one step at a time.

I was so fucking wrong. They told me I'm eventually going crash and burn the way I'm approaching things. Divorce, violence, and all that mumbo-jumbo are factors that I currently can't handle. And if a client were to do something bad to themselves, (which is a huge possibility in this field) I'd probably never forgive myself. I eventually told them how I felt at the moment, with all that was done. I was asked if I would like to see a counselor with personal issues if I had personal issues myself. I said no. It's because they wouldn't be able to handle other people's problems and counter-transferring their emotions for coping. That was practically the route I was on. The biggest problem, alongside ""befriending"" was my demeanor of always being anxious, which in turn, made the other people did sessions with anxious.

And with a long pause, she told me that I wasn't ready for the LPC field, this major, this career field at all. I started crying the second she said that. I felt devastated, defeated, worthless, weak, scared, and angry. All because of things I thought I got over with. I mean I knew I wasn't ready with my lack of experiences. I just never thought it would come to this. They said they're not kicking me out, they're just viewing the situation the way it is. They recommended me to look at a different field of study, additional majors, jobs where you don't need to see clients or have licensure, etc. Maybe take a semester off, graduate later, maybe take a loan. My parents pay for my college, and would be pissed off to the nth degree if I did these things. They recommended I talk with my program advisor (who never answers my fucking emails) for the next plan. In the meantime, I dropped 2 clients and trying to find more ways to get hours. I need 300 by December, 600 by May. I only have 89 hours. I'm so behind, it's pathetic.

That this point, I'm so lost. I do want to be in this field. I do want to graduate on time with my cohorts. I want to be licensed. I don't want to take another semester. I don't want to take loans. I don't want to change majors or career paths. And I don't want to quit. I feel that this is my calling (something that I chose MYSELF). I mean, I improved so, so much by doing counseling. And I want to return the favor for other college students and help with their lives too. But I'm so emotionally wrecked with everything, and I'm not sure how to handle it. I'm starting over from scratch. I'm ruminating about failing. I stay up until 3 AM just because how pissed I am at myself and the circumstances I put myself in.

And every time this happens, I remember my former best friend, who always appears at the back of my mind, and just stares. I hate all of the flashbacks of the good and the bad times we had together. It's so painful. I can't get it out of my head, it's like a broken record. And I keep talking about it, and I'm just muttering the same garbage as before. Everyone tells me ""You'll get over it"" and ""Life happens"" and ""It will pass"" and ""Life goes on."" It's like I'm a bad luck magnet, and everything crashing down on me. And no one seems to understand (especially friends who knew both of us) how hurt I am. I don't want to sound like a victim. I just can't control these emotions and symptoms and I don't know what to do anymore.

I feel alone. I just want to go away far from here and never come back. And I honestly don't think a lot of people are going to miss me. And that sucks."

That is probably the only flaw in my resume so far. I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate in one of my country's top 5 colleges as a Bachelor (Hons.) in Statistics with Computer Science and Mathematics as my electives. My family income is about 10LPA (INR).

I am targetting top colleges (preferably in US, Europe (I've heard Germany offers hefty scholarships) or Korea) that offers Masters in Statistics or an integrated PhD in the same. 

I am studying really hard to maintain a good CGPA, along with that I am taking a certificate course in Korean language. I am well-versed in Java, BASIC, C and Python and we're taught Minitab and R Programming in college along with C. I've been an active problem solver in AoPS since 2019. 

My extracurriculars: I have been involved with Peta since 9th grade but I wasn't that active because academics are given a lot of importance where I live. Although, I am currently in the process of getting involved again and I'll be starting an internship with an NGO that deals with sexxual abuse victims. I regularly attend certificate seminars hosted by my college. I have been one of the head girls in my high school. I am now a Students' Departmental Lobby member in college (basically something on the lines of a student representative). I can speak 3 languages and I'm  learning another. I can play 5 musical instruments and I'm waiting for acceptance at my college's Theatrical and Music societies. I was trained in classical dance from the age of 7 to 14.


I had no idea what goes under extracurriculars so I wrote whatever came to my mind. What do I need to do in order to get into a top college in US, Europe and SK? I am willing to work harder. Asking for a friend here."

I am currently a sophomore majoring in CS at Cornell. 

As my decision to go into tech was fairly recent, I'm slightly behind on recruitment and other things for summer 2022. In terms of coursework, I am at par with everyone else in the first semester of their sophomore year. With regards to previous experience, I don't have any direct tech experience, but a generally good resume (numerous previous internships at well-known organisations) in things that are tangentially related to software engineering (think data analysis for economics/policy think tanks and writing code for an econ professor). 

I had a few questions: 

1. When do tech internships generally allow applications until? Is it like finance, wherein even though applications are allowed until very late, the spots fill up very quick (and may already have filled up)? 
2. Does it make sense for me to wait another 1-2 months to apply to certain roles so that I can improve my resume? I was thinking of getting some more experience, maybe landing some CS research with a professor, doing some side projects, and contributing to open source stuff. How much are my chances affected if I am applying now vs over the winter?

I'm an introvert, and I just don't like it when my job is revolving around selling product and talking business nonsense with people. 

For a while, I have always wanted to learn something related to tech and coding stuffs, but my parents didn't permit me as they thought doing IT is for ""geeks"" and difficult to find a stable job. But now I truly find STEM (particularly IT/CS) is suitable for me, personality-wise. 

I am already 22 and I know it's pretty old for a person to start with another degree instead of doing master.  But I cannot honestly find myself in torturous treatment for the rest of my life with too many business related stuffs. This can be the most dramatic event in my 20s if I choose to switch my career, but if I don't do it, I will drown myself in deep regret for the rest of my life. 

Should I spent 3 more years of schooling and work at the same time, or just work with the profession I  hate with decent salary ?"
q7uwjj,5,2021-10-14,First year substitute teacher at an elementary school. Is this normal?,SnowFlakeObsidian4,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/q7uwjj/first_year_substitute_teacher_at_an_elementary/,"I am a first year substitute teacher in an elementary school. Before this, I had only done 3 internships (which were successful) and I worked for a language school teaching English as a Foreign Language (very common in my country). In the language school, classes were small (one-to-one or groups of max 4 students). In an elementary school, I can have up to 30 kids in a class. My ex boss was quite upset when I quitted, and the kids and families had spent the whole year asking for me to teach them the next. I have also passed an important exam for teachers in my country at 24. Most people with years of experience fail it (more than once). With that, I want to say that I am young and have a lot to learn, but that I am not completely useless either.


Is it normal to have a school in which all classes are complicated? By complicated, I mean pupils never raise their hand to speak. If they want to tell you something (prob go to the toilet so as to skip the class), they rise from their seat, approach you, and shout at you that they ""have to piss"". There is constant noise. They don't know how to stay seated. If you try to do an activity standing in a circle, they don't know how to do a circle (10-11 yo). When you speak, they don't look at you. They chat (scream) with their friends instead. If another student answers one of my questions or tries to participate, they don't listen to that student either. They consider that if you want them to participate, you have to call them by their name. They pay attention only if you call them. But the rest of the class keeps being noisy, so it's hard to ask questions, let alone give instructions to the whole class. They insult, too, both the students and the teacher (I haven't been insulted yet, but it is only a matter of time). There are fights which can be physical. They also throw stuff all the time.


Are all students like these? Thankfully, no. However, about 80% misbehave like that. I feel bad for the remaining 20% because I can't teach properly with this kind of class. 


I haven't done anything effective until now because I am trying to follow the school rules: no punishments. All right, I can try something with no punishments, but rewards aren't allowed either. So no video at the end of the class, no stickers... Nothing to motivate them to behave. We also have to be careful when talking to students even when they misbehave to avoid offending them.


I love the idea of solving conflicts through discussion and reflection. I've done it in the past. But for that, students need to listen. And they don't know how to listen. Yesterday, I devoted the last 30 minutes of the lesson to ""discuss"" what had gone wrong. The few that answered me told me that if I wanted them to participate in class I had to shout. Excuse me? I hate shouting. Who likes being shouted at? What kind of class is this? They believe the normal thing is to behave like that. Those that behave well tell me that I am not doing anything wrong and that the rest misbehave with all the teachers. The well-behaved students even say they are sorry I have those rude kids in class.


It's my second week. I'm frustrated, but only the right amount, since I choose to view this as a great opportunity to learn better classroom management skills. Besides, I am not their main teacher. They are the ones being called son of a bitch and having to teach them most hours of the day. I see each group only for 45 minutes a week.


One of the main teachers has given me permission to scold the kids and punish them if they misbehave. She says that if the principal has a problem with that, she'll take full responsibility, not me, the substitute teacher. Let's see if it works and I can teach today.


I've seen some work by the students decorating the English classroom walls (things they do with their main English teacher). They are wrong. As in, they need to describe themselves with a drawing. Where it says ""favourite book"" you have their age. Where they have to write their age, you have their names... And so on. This main teacher has an assistant. I don't. I haven't talked to her, but I think she can't really teach either, or else, this wouldn't happen. Not with 11yo that have been ""learning English"" since they were 4. The first thing you learn when you are four is to say your name in English. They still don't know??? 


You might be wondering what does the principal do. We had a teachers' meeting with her. She was worried about where to put the kids' folders because, according to her, they distract kids now that the folders are in sight. We should hide them. I didn't say much cause it was my second day and I was still adapting to the school (I still am). But how are the hidden folders going to teach these kids some manners and respect? Call me a fool, but I don't see it. I don't see either why the folders are more important than talking about the chaos and the fact we can't teach and how to solve that.

Anyway, I'm really curious if this is what a common school is like or if I am in a bad school. I haven't had the chance to talk much to the teachers, but they all look stressed out. Not that I blame them."

I’m a CS Senior who will graduate in June. I’ve started applying for jobs at the beginning of October and got lots of interviews. So far I’ve only one one internship for 6 months where I worked on the backend of an E-Commerce site. As an intern I obviously did not get much work to do. I learned a lot about the SDLC, testing, Agile, scaling etc.

Apart from this my programming knowledge is pretty solid. I have a great understanding of OOP, DS&amp;A, best practices, clean code etc. I have an overarching good idea of how software is built and put together. Since I’m only a Senior my knowledge isn’t super deep as that of an Architect.

Before my interviews I brushed up on LC, OOP, and various common CS/programming concepts. But when the technical interviews hit, shit hit the fan. I was constantly being asked about super deep technical architecture, how I would design a backend and why, how would I scale servers for more users, and what features I worked on in my internship. Apart from that my live coding challenges have been coding up a React app with 6 features in 30 mins, a palindromic substring DP question to solve in 30 mins, and for me to design with UML an entire full stack web application and explain my reasoning.

I’ve been applying to graduate/junior positions in small to medium size non tech companies. Please be honest, am I just stupid or have these companies been asking me questions way out of the scope of a graduate/junior?

Maybe some can offer a slap of harsh realities or even some consoling constructive advice. I'm nearing the end of a conversion course in SD through Springboard. No prior experience in this area at all. This sub has been great btw in trying to understand more about this industry and experience's had by other redditors.

  
 Anyway, we're expected to apply for an internships/jobs from Jan onwards and I go to the career fair. Have a virtual call with a nice guy from a company. Just a chat and no real expectations (internship role is a bit out of my county and not sure if realistically I'd make the move for what it is). He puts me on for one interview then 2 days later. Accidentally forwards me the CVs of some others scheduled in who had BScs and MAs in relevant fields (not expecting much now but I'll go for the interview, sure).   
No idea what to expect except some logic questions. I do a bit of prep as far as I can in doing those riddle-like questions. Interview goes surprisingly well (young guy and vibe well together) as I actually manage to talk aloud about the puzzle given and work it out (at least I think so as we do about 3 in the interview). Get an email from the original guy afterwards saying he'll put me through to the final round and that I did well. 

  
Interview the next day is with the office head and the VP of the company... (in another country). Bricking it a little and told there'll be more logic questions. On the day, different vibe - two senior interview guys - nice and polite but maybe my vibe or theirs was more serious but I was overcome with stress and completely bombed. Not only did I not get the logic questions but when one explained to me the paradoxical logic in the problem, I nodded on just begging in my mind that they just give the answer. Failed both questions. Not only that though(!), I was asked about all kinds of things about SQL, HTTPS protocols - things which I hadn't studied before (I had done SQL in a databases module earlier this year but nothing really on security). I realise some of these topics might have been easy to a more seasoned dev, I really felt like a deer in headlights. Finding it intimidating and overwhelming when I see job descriptions list off a massive stack of tools used that Ive never heard of or job descriptions/titles that are still outside my range of understanding. 

I just felt terrible after this interview. Total and utter feeling of uselessness and questioning this new direction altogether. As I near the end of this year I'm having serious doubts of being able to perform in interviews - I feel like I just know nothing and am doing the coursework just keeping up to speed. I know I shouldn't feel this way - just need to learn from it and do better. Still need to figure out a plan of action here. Grateful for any advice!

Looking back in a year from now I might think how naive I'm being here. Any similar experiences? Or maybe just roast me here if you like (put share some positive advice)!"

I recognize that I’m at a huge disadvantage because of my lack of experience, but I still want to apply to some anyway.

In order to maximize my chances of getting an internship, is there something I should pursue outside of school? Whether this be online courses, Leetcode, etc. Really anything that will make my resume a little stronger before applying.

And if it’s completely ridiculous for me to try to get an internship, does anyone have suggestions for good things I can do this summer?

Sorry I can’t reply to everything, but to address some common points:
- Small Canadian school (not an American citizen)
- One internship (big tech company but not Big N, think Oracle)
- These are definitely the higher paying offers for new grads but they are standard. The industry is heating up

Edit 3: I picked Asana :)

Asana (SF): 218k first year, ~190k recurring

Roblox (San Mateo): 251k first year, ~216k recurring

Stripe (Seattle): 283k first year, ~243k second

Evaluate my offers?

I like the idea of WLB, but I understand early in my career is probably the time to take the risk of sacrificing WLB for growth. 

Location has been a primary motivator for me and I live close to Seattle so I’m pretty confident I want to get away from this climate and experience California weather. Not sure if I’m making a mistake by turning down Stripe’s insane offer just for better weather.

Asana seems to have the absolute best culture + WLB but at the expense of comp (which is crazy to even say considering it’s 220k first year).

q83bah,0,2021-10-14,Should I really look into switching colleges or what should / can I do in this situation?,StardustNyako,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q83bah/should_i_really_look_into_switching_colleges_or/,"Oh boy, let's go. So, you'd find this in my history easily so I'll just say: I go to the University of Michigan.   


The thing is, I'm a junior. I have been getting a reassonable amount of interest / success thanks to my school's name and city location, and I guess I have interesting projects (Bob, It was one AI bot I made with a team, IT'S HILARIOUS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THAT). Anyway, I am also in a club that's really selective and would help me build the real skills for my career. 

All in all, things are finally looking up after suffering 2 grueling years of shit before this. But I am definitely not out of the woods yet. The first big hurdle is I went through life dealing with a lot of shit and most likely having undiagnosed neurodiversity that was never addressed. Sooo I am a tired, depressed stressed out person at a super rigorous school who is currently struggling to get my work done, let alone, thrive. 

Feels like a tiny miracle I have the amount of internship success I have had (one offer already at a kindaa? known financial company, getting to the point where internal recruiters are helping me find internship matches in other companies). I cant get proper medication for ADHD until after November 18th (neuropsych eval). So I could start failing shit even this semester, I feel like my brain is just really giving up, especially after that internship offer and even though I try to motivate myself with the classic motivation steps of just needing to push a little longer, I could loose this internship etc, I cant. Anti depressants, kinda have bad side effects that make working more difficult right now so I've held off. 

I am starting Wellburtin Tuesday which will hopefully help me with focus / depression eventually. But yeah, lack of motivation has been a huge issue.

The other issue has been the people I go to school with (The undergrads) I right now live with great people who are actually really understanding for the most part and nice but, the last two years, especially the first year were really tough. I went through a lot of trauma when I came to this school (Not having realllyyy wanting to) because two online friends went to the school. 

I thought we were close, but the moment I got here, they did a bunch of weird ghosting shit (with one of them we had started getting into fights after I got accepted) and I found myself alone and drowning in a rigorous competitive school, when I had gone through years of working my ass off with nothing to show for it, so I was tired and didn't need this stupid competitve ambitious Ivy-esque bull shit. Pretty traumatized after that. 

I tried to visit a therapist after that. Multiple. As I recently learned, since most if not all of them did not specialize in trauma or ADHD, they realyl weren't equipped to help me. My latest therapist suggested transferring schools given the shit I'd gone through with this one (Another big issue is that well, this is a school filled with rich white kids, many of who Im sure have loving supportive families, or at least make friends easily. I, don't. I've been trying, it's been rough.) I am a comparatively poor minority. I try to not let that get to me but talking to them online has shown the consequences of those differences. Sure people act different online, but Im not interested in meeting someone who's a dick online irl because ""They're so much better without the PC allowing them to be a bully anomynously!"" But yeah . . .

I've definitely met nice people but the trauma I dealt with the first two years really paints my emotions when I walk around / communicate with people here. I'm just now finally meeting most of the decent people I ever met on campus (ones who are closer to my age, I wonder if there's a trend hmm) but the past really fucked me up. Been struggling to find the time to keep trying to find therapists who take my Medicaid insurance. My school therapy service? Only for short term therapy and my first appointment with them is October 21st. I called some time back in September, lol I forgot about this LOL 

So, TLDR I have good elements to my school, good name, good opportunities, but I got hella traumatized by ghosting and subsequent gaslighting while keeping afloat in a rigorous school, with undiagnosed ADHD, litttle access to therapy, and a therapist tryna maybe soft get rid of me or suggest the only thing she could think of of going to a different school which, ngl sounds tantalizing , but transfer credits are a bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight / advice is much appreciated."

I recently switched career paths and have started a CSMS to go into Software Engineering. My background in CS is very limited, don’t have a super impressive project portfolio and no relevant work experience.

This internship is for the spring and I’m still looking for something for next summer, but I’m getting rejected by everywhere, which is understandable.

My question is, is there some way I can leverage this upcoming internship on my resume somehow? I’m sure once I start and have it under my work experience, my prospects will improve dramatically, but by then most, if not all summer 2022 internships will be filled. I just wasn’t sure if there was someway I could subtly let companies know that while I don’t have experience now, I will before next summer.

Goes to show how random the process is. First round was purely technical, 2 LC medium in 45 minutes. I needed some hints but spoke well while I coded and solved both. Final round to be completed. Full process has taken \~5 weeks so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft: Applied with a referral and they took 2 months to get back. First round was pretty standard, 20 minute behavioral, 20 minute coding. It was an open ended question that required you to design your own classes, but the actual implementation was LC easy. Final round was 2 45 minute interviews. The interviewers were super chill and I honestly had a fun time talking to them. The questions were more open ended than standard LC but including all the followup questions I'd give them a LC medium. I thought I did really well but got rejected :/ From applying to getting rejected took \~3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Citadel: I was invited to a virtual career event with them last summer, and everyone who attended was scheduled for a first round interview without an OA. After seeing the OA when my friends did it later, I'm not sure if I could have even passed it so I really lucked out here. First round was a LC medium. I solved it, but felt like I didn't do too well because the interviewer was cold and unresponsive the whole time. I was surprised to make it to the final round. This was pretty wild, I was expecting standard DSA questions but I was asked to do some web development right off the bat, as in write HTML/JS from scratch to implement some interactivity. After that the next 2 interviews were normal LC medium. The final round interviewers were much nicer than the first guy. Full process has taken \~3 months, and I will say the recruiters take forever to respond to emails, up to 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Intuit: Applied with no referral. Intuit had way more stages than I was expecting and had I looked into the full process I'm not sure it would have been worth the hassle since I already had a return offer from Amazon, and idk if I'd take Intuit over Amazon. Fairly tricky OA =&gt; screening interview with Karat (3rd party interviewing service) =&gt; behavioral + technical interview with Intuit engineer =&gt; behavioral interview with recruiter =&gt; final round behavioral + technical with Intuit engineer, including presenting one of your past projects (I showed em a full stack hosted web app I made for a class). The interviewers and recruiters were all very nice and quick to respond but man the process was a hassle, it's taken around 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Palantir: I cold applied and got rejected. Then I got a referral, applied again, and got a recruiter call, just like what happened with Facebook. I know I think this is really dumb too but don't hate the player hate the game or whatever. Recruiter call was sort of a behavioral interview but felt pretty chill, a lot of time was spent answering my questions about Palantir. First round was with Karat, they asked a bunch of tech trivia and time/space analysis questions, then you solve as many LC easy/mediums as possible in 45 minutes, I solved 2. I then got ghosted for a month so I thought I was rejected, but was recently scheduled for the virtual onsite.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Key takeaway is get referrals or cold email recruiters if at all possible, even if you've already been rejected. What're they gonna do anyways reject you again? Also, live interviewers are easier than OAs if you aren't super good at DSA but you can communicate effectively.

I am currently a junior in college studying Management Information Systems. I have an internship role with a mid-size manufacturing company as an IT Business Analyst and I have enjoyed the work. The company has treated me very well, it is headquartered near my hometown (a pro for me), and they've been able to help me unlock opportunities internally to try different types of work. I interned full-time with the company last summer, am working remotely part-time for them now during the school year, and have an offer to be full time with them again next summer, most likely exploring a new role with a different team.

I came into this internship recruiting season with the intention of seeing what was out there, learning more about other companies, and potentially interviewing/finding new offers and opportunities. I got an offer to intern with KPMG for a roughly 50% pay increase, and I have an interview with Deloitte next week. These are both companies that are considerably larger and come with more ""prestige"" than my company.

I am ultimately still feeling like I'd rather return to my company, even though they pay less, because I have enjoyed the work, the people, and the way they have invested in me. However, I feel this slight twinge of potential regret, as I know that the other companies could lead to ""bigger"" opportunities due to their size. Both my current company and both of the other firms have expressed that there would be an extremely high chance that I would be hired for a full-time position next year when I graduate.

Bear in mind also that although I make less money with my current company, the difference is more than made up by the arrangement that I have with them to work part-time during my school year.

TL:DR - I have an internship with a company that I like and that treats me well, but I have an offer (and one more that could come) from two considerably larger firms. Am I wasting a good opportunity with either of the larger companies?"
q84gj6,2,2021-10-14,[19M] I’m lost in life,WhatDoIDo1846392,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/q84gj6/19m_im_lost_in_life/,"Throughout most of my high school career, I was pretty depressed. I had no motivation to do anything and felt down basically everyday. The problem only spiraled because I refused to acknowledge it and seek help. I had high expectations of myself, and expectations from others which I failed to meet in the long run. 

It was tough, and even continued into college. After my first semester, I realized I needed to change something. I took the next semester off, was diagnosed with depression, and started up on some medication. I was ready to change my life for the better. 

Fast forward a few months, and I thought I was ready to go back to school. I was preparing this whole time to better myself and get back into class to give it my all. I switched my major from marketing to computer science, and was excited. Well, a few weeks into class, I’ve skipped a lot of days, I have little to no motivation, and now I’ve just stopped going all together. It’s difficult, because I’m not in the best spot financially, and decided to withdraw from my classes pretty late, so now I owe thousands for classes I’m not taking. 

I want to go to another university, and I know I have the academic capability to excel in colleges I was not accepted to (I am at a safety school), but my transcript is terrible and my high school transcript has only declined since the start of my freshman year. I have no job, I’ve been searching for internships and jobs related to computer science, but it’s difficult seeing as I haven’t even completed 1 semester worth of cs classes. I’ve started taking online classes offered by Harvard for cs (CS50) to further my knowledge of cs in the meantime.

I’m lost, stuck with this massive debt because of poor decisions, no way to pay it off, and feeling really unhappy because of everything going on. I’m not as depressed as I used to be, but I’m extremely stressed out at the moment. 

I don’t want to live with my parents anymore, I want to be independent, but I’m not sure where to begin and how to get on the right track."

I'm looking to do computational plasma physics (especially with application to fusion), and I want to be in California.

Looking at schools in California that have strong plasma physics programs, I'm primarily interested in UCSD, UCLA, UCI and UC Berkeley. I have two questions:

1. Is it dangerous to apply exclusively to the UC system?
2. Is the UC system too competive for me to have a chance/should I try to identify ""easier"" schools to apply to?

For reference, I'm applying with a \~3.75 cumulative GPA (\~3.9 STEM GPA). I had a rough first semester of college, but I've performed well the rest of the time. In terms of research experience, I only really have two. One is my personal undergraduate research project that I'm working on this semester. It's not related to plasma, but rather statistical physics. The other is a DOE funded internship that I did last summer at a laboratory in California where I worked on a computational plasma physics/fusion science project. I'm presenting the work at this November's APS DPP meeting, but there's currently no publication coming out of it.

My 3 LoR's should be strong (research adviser from my summer gig, long-term physics prof and personal research adviser, and a professor who I know well/whose classes I've performed well in.)

The past few months I've just been steadily convincing myself that I have no chance, but I want to at least pick my schools well to give myself the best chance possible. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance for any advice."

Last year I had a pretty poor time applying for internships, and only managed to find a good spot in the 11th hour. Thankfully I managed to finish last year with top grades, so I was looking forward to starting early and hopefully having a bit more luck this time.

For my 3rd application today I applied for a big finance corporation. There was a lot of effort required for the application, cover letter, multiple 500 word paragraphs about motivations, projects, etc, as well as a 20 minute game to test your people skills. I fit onto all the listed requirements as well as the optional ones, so I was feeling confident.

At the end of all this was a 6 minute logic test. I missed a key hint that was (apparently) stated at the beginning of the test, so I performed poorly at this part. 4 hours later I was told my application had been rejected. Knowing how HR works there's no way they went through any of the documents I had to send in. All this work was wasted due to 6 minutes of poor performance.

Not looking for sympathy, I know you got to keep your awareness up for these things and ultimately the fault lies with me. But I have to say I felt it was a pretty demoralising experience.

I hope everyone elses application rounds are going better!"

I'm currently a 1st year University student who just got accepted into a small private company for an internship - the work seems highly relevant and would allow me to learn and apply a relevant skillset for my future career choice.

However, I have just realized the firm has a terrible reputation (2 Lawsuits) alongside wage-related violations reported by ex-employees (The executives don't seem to have a great reputation either)

These lawsuits and violations are 5-6 years old now, and since then the company has had nothing of such sort reported on itself - has been doing well financially, and has been featured in a couple of fairly reputable news articles for their success as well.  


My question is - do I still go for the internship?  


I'm worried if having interned for a company like this will be a deal-breaker when I am applying for internships/jobs at virtually any reputable and big firm, which will be down the line.

Any advice would be sincerely appreciated.

I wont be surprised if I make another post complaining about one thing or another but anyway, I just had a chat with my boyfriend about our career history and I realized how hard I have been on myself in the past.

Few years ago when I was 21 or 22 and just finished my undergrad, I started working for this company as an IT intern and they treated me like shit. They wouldn't pay me and didn't even tell me how much salary I would get. Every time I brought it up they would brush it off or say ""keep working and then we will see"".. This went on for 2 months until I finally decided to leave. I wasn't learning anything. They would make me go to this new office they were furnishing and tell me to look after the electricians who were coming around to do their thing.. Nothing IT related at all! I would literally just go there, unlock the door and let them in, lock the door when they left.. I did get to do some fun IT stuff but mostly I just did this and it was so stupid. Everytime I complained they told me ""You are young and at your age you have to start off with dirty hands before reaching the top and be more concerned about experience than salary"" like fuckkk off I already gained an undergrad degree by then and whats the point of this UNPAID ""internship"" if I am not even learning anything! Anyway, I left the company on bad terms with them.. And I felt like I was a diva and ungrateful.. for asking for money and complaining that the work im doing is not related to my field.

Anyway, later I joined this other company for 6 months before going back to university to do my masters. My mental health was really bad at the time. I am gay and I was living with my family who are extremely religious and homophobic, I found out my ex of 3 years cheated on me and blamed it on me, I was constantly stressed about my university admissions.. A lot of stuff was going on and I was mentally drained. I didn't do so well in this new company. Partly because I didn't get enough support and everyone I was working with was super conservative and judgmental and partly because I couldn't get myself to do much work I was always depressed and I would go to the toilet and cry for my entire lunch break. I hated that I sucked so bad. I completed university with 4.0 GPA and I hated myself for what I had become. Even when I went back to university, I wasn't doing so well, my mental health was terrible and I was constantly partying to forget about my life and existence. I was surprised that I even managed to complete my masters with 3.3 GPA. 

Anyway, I just joined a new company and I was terrified I would suck. But since I joined, everyone has been so supportive and friendly.. It brought back my desire to work hard and after such a long time I have had a manager tell me ""You are doing an amazing job and I hope you stay with us!"" I actually get excited about going to work. I actually feel motivated to work hard. I still struggle with mental health issues that can sometimes screw with my work but for the most part it has been incredible!

I just wanted to say, if your experience with your job or university made you feel like you suck, re-evaluate the situation.. Was there something more to it than just that? Could it be possible your work environment made you miserable? Could it be that its not you but your mental health? Dont jump straight to hating yourself like I did in the past. :)"

I personally think having Amazon on my resume is better than Cap1, although they are definitely both great. I would also rather work for a tech company (especially a FAANG) than a bank. However, I *really really* like NYC, and living there for the summer would mean I'm super close to my family and a *ton* of friends. My Cap1 recruiter also had to pull some strings for me to change my offer from McLean to NYC. I should also mention that I've never visited Seattle before, but I'm sure living there would be super fun as well – I would just know way fewer people.

I am a first-year student at a top 10 computer science school in America. At a virtual startup career fair, I told my interviewer that I will be done with data structures by the end of the semester and will be taking algorithms next semester (which is my academic plan in an optimistic scenario), along with extensive experience working with machine learning back in high school. The interviewer seemed impressed and extended an internship right on the spot and said ""if you're still interested in working with us, just shoot me an email before let's say, February, and we can discuss the details of the work"". I didn't get that many details of what the internship will entail, just that I have the option of work-from-home or moving to their office on the West Coast next summer.

I was told that most first-year students couldn't get internships because they don't have the skill sets necessary.

I personally felt that the interviews overall went much better this year than last year, especially the case and the technical. This honestly hurts because I studied so much more this year than I did last year (barely studied last year). I went to the interview prep workshops, I upgraded to LeetCode premium just so I could do all the C1 problems I hadn't already done, I worked ahead on two weeks worth of school work so I could focus on preparing for the interviews full-time."

Just had my first technical with a well known tech company for a SWE internship.. The phone screen went a little like this:

Behavioral questions and answers,  thought I answered pretty well.

The The technical portion. The first was very easy and I finished it in about 5 minutes. The second was a continuation of the first and I took some time to think. I basically explained an answer I believed to be O(n^2) , but I talked about how I thought it could be O(n). 

My interviewer said let's go with the o(n^2) you said. 
So I started coding it out with thought, but got stuck. The interviewer then started talking me through and I said I thought it would be a DP solution. So I explained that, but he said that wasn't necessary. Hw then explained how to think about it recursively and to tackle the subproblems of the question that way. With this, I started coding the solution and he even started helping me again.  ( ex. I said out loud, ""this should return..."" and he said ""probably false"") 

I coded out the solution and it worked and then he asked runtime. I said O(n),but then he said something like ""are you sure? How much work is done on each element?"" And then I correct myself to O(n^2). 

So then the interview finished, I asked questions, blah. The interviewer gave me quite a bit of help, though I never explicitly asked ( I was moreso talking through my thought). Is this how a successful interview goes? Or is this kinda a failure?

I know this sounds dumb and I'll know when I hear back, I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm even pumping iron as i type this. Any experience?"
q8ere3,12,2021-10-14,Fighting burnout is really difficult when you genuinely enjoy what you're doing,VVarhound,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/q8ere3/fighting_burnout_is_really_difficult_when_you/,"So, I'm a full time CNC machining student on my last semester before graduating, and also have a part time paid internship (and just today got confirmation from my manager that they're going to offer me a full time position when I graduate, woo!) 

I'm keeping up with work, and *mostly* keeping up with school although there's some programming and stuff I should really get done... but I've gotten 100% on nearly everything I've turned in, and I'm about middle of the road compared to other people in the class in terms of having stuff finished, I'm not way ahead but I don't think I'm exactly behind either, so far. I've got a combination of finally being medicated and really enjoying and being interested in metalworking to thank for that. It's just starting to come at the expense of... basically everything else hah.

I've got school from 7am to 2pm, and then work afterward until 8pm. Both are usually pretty physically and mentally demanding, so I get home tired and intending to get some homework or other stuff done, or sleep early, or both - but also feeling like I ""need"" to vegetate to wind down, or like I don't want the whole week to be a cycle of ""school - work - sleep - repeat"" so I sit and watch mindless youtube videos or do mindless internet things for a while, usually don't get enough sleep, don't get stuff done... my apartment looks like clean laundry exploded on the couch and dirty laundry exploded on the floor. Groceries that don't need to be kept cold still sitting in the paper bags on the kitchen floor and I'm using those as a pantry. I think ""I'll get some stuff done on the weekends"" but then on the weekends I just marathon sleep and vegetate some more, instead of even doing marginally more effort-intensive fun or relaxing stuff like hanging out with friends or playing video games. 

And then - even knowing logically that I shouldn't compare myself to other people like this - a friend at school was saying how he's in about the same position, except his job didn't want him to decrease his hours and actually gave him more responsibilities based on the experience he's gotten from school, so he's generally at work until midnight *and* lives further from the school than I do, so it's like ""dude how are you even alive but also what right do *I* have to complain in comparison"" hah.

My mom thinks I should ask my job to decrease my hours at least a little, especially since I'm doing well, they've already offered me the full time position and I'm sure they'd be fine with it since they know I'm in school and have been flexible about things because of that, but... it's really tough to want to do that. I like my job. I don't want to make less money hah. And also the whole... feeling like I need to prove myself good enough after a lifetime of impostor syndrome and being unsuccessful before getting diagnosed, thing.

Maybe I should switch to working weekends instead? I'm not sure if having more time off each day but no full days off would be better or easier than the current situation.

As it is it's just a constant ""just gotta make it through the week"" and overall ""just gotta make it through until December when I graduate"" and I am exhausted."

q8hyq9,2,2021-10-15,"I don't know what to do, I need some help on where to go from here!",MrNeopolitan2k,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/q8hyq9/i_dont_know_what_to_do_i_need_some_help_on_where/,"First of let me just say I'm desperate, young and daring to try almost anything at this point. I'm a former IT Technician at Fedex, and have also worked as a Ops Tech IT Intern at Amazon. My dream is to be a full stack developer and travel the world while doing so. Only issue is, I'm not as knowledgeable to be a dev quite yet. I'm originally a missionary kid and was taught to always strive to be the best and work hard. As the saying goes, ""He who does not work, does not eat"". So having a work-drive is not much of an issue for me. But the issue still arises that I'm currently without a job as of late.

Nevertheless, the cause as to why I'm without a job, is simply because of lack of production and the chip shortage. On top of me simply walking in, doing the wrong thing at the wrong time/place is why I got fired. In short just know that I was simply fired due to having to take an emergency phone call and having to leave work early due to flooding recently in Tennessee; which had caused my family to be trapped in their homes. My employer didn't take a liking to it as he thought I should've stayed and kept working but to me, my family **always** comes first.

Since then I've been looking and applying day and night for jobs around the clock, with little to no avail. Many require degree's or a more ""professional"" experience. From entry level positions such as...

* Data Analysts
* Software Tester
* PC Helpdesk
* Ops Tech IT
* Game Tester
* Web Dev
* Front End Dev
* HTML Dev
* Programmer
* QA Analyst
* etc



While that is stirring in my mind; I have been waking up early and learning how to further enhance my skills as a newbie programmer from originally learning HTML and recently started learning JavaScript on a website known as [mikedane.com](https://mikedane.com), whom has multiple languages to teach from Web Development to Software Development, to even Databases. He's taught me a lot from starting from a basic script such as hello world..

;

And even though my understanding is not as well as others out there in programming. I'm still longing for a chance to be able to just try and work in an environment that allows me to pursue my dream. I have the drive for it, and know I'll succeed, its just the opportunity to make it happen has yet to be shown. And while I'm sure some of you are probably wondering why haven't you applied for unemployment? Well truth be told, I have, its just that I keep getting denied due to the fact that I was fired (even if it was for a reason that was as important as taking care of my family)



Nevertheless, I'm at a cross; I've tried recruiters, and the one I've been with hasn't contacted me within almost 3 weeks now and I'm worried that they've abandoned me. I'm short on cash, have bills due soon and can't seem to find a job in the field that I've worked in for almost a year and a half now, and the local jobs nearby don't nearly pay enough to make do with my current situation so I'm forced to have to either drive 30-150 miles just for a decent job, or if I could, work remotely as I'd love for that to be; so I could save gas and be there for my family when needed. All in all though, I'm at a cross and don't know what to do. I'm 21, and have worked hard up until now and am having a hard time finding the courage to keep going on or to find hope at all. If you know anyone who is hiring or would be willing to hire me, please please dm me, or reply in chat as I'm certain without a doubt that I can be of use, given the chance to try. Thank you in advance and my apologies for the long winded story..

I dropped out of highschool at 16 due to depression and thought life would get better if I just started working earlier. I participated in a internship as a chefs apprentice working part time at $10/hr, then it ended and was never offered the job, then started working as a housekeeper for a couple of months for $9/hr, but I didn't want to do that because it was disgusting.

 Then I had a hiatus before working at a factory that build the infrastructure to small business buildings which was grueling work. Wake up at 3am get home at 7pm and start over the next day for $11/hr. I was 17-18 during this time. Then I started to work at a hotel for 2 years working the night shift for $12/hr until I was robbed by two guys who zipped tied me and threatened my life. So I resigned after like 2-weeks. Then I started working in the parts department at a car dealership delivering and selling car parts. Which was very monotonous and really didn't help with the depression. So after like 2 months I had to quit. 

 I admitted myself into a psychiatric ward for suicidal thoughts. Which was one of the biggest mistakes of my life as all they tried to do was give me Zoloft and keep me with people in FAR WORSE condition then I was in a locked and isolated part of the hospital. Didn't even get to go outside for fresh air or anything. Then shortly after coming home id say about 6 months go by and I didn't have another job. And then my mom divorced her husband which cause me to no longer have a place to live although my room was in the basement not much of a ideal living situation to begin with. Only on the day of that I had to leave, my cousin said that I could live with him and my Aunt.

 Now we're in the first half of the pandemic and I'm 20 years old. I received the stimulus and I was fooled into buying my first car which costed me about $4000 but in hindsight isn't even worth $2000. Now I know better. A couple months go by and now it's my birthday I'm turning 21 and I didn't even do anything with none of my family and as I'm laying down to go to bed someone is outside towing my aunt's car away so we run outside to retrieve our items before he pulls away. Mind you like 2 months prior I paid almost $5000 to get her car out of the impound. I did so with gratitude that she lets me live here rent free, but still this is a bummer.

 I had no money left and so naturally I started working again, this time at a nursing home that my aunt works at. Since I had front desk experience at a hotel I worked reception at the nursing home part time for $10/hr. Then things get a little more stressful for me. My cousin and his gf are having a baby. So in the months leading up to my nephews birth my cousin is pretty much designated driver for everyone as he needs the car in case of an emergency. Eventually the baby is born and the baby mom is kicked out because she's being very problematic and disrespectful to the entire household. She even handles the newborn like she didn't give a fuck. So as my cousin works 12 hours shifts towing, I have to babysit his newborn child from 6am to 3pm until my Aunt comes home and I have to go to work.

 So back at work I am being transferred to a closer facility to home to help my aunt in the kitchen as a dietary aide getting paid 50¢ less but more hours but still less than full time as I have to watch the baby. I have to take the bus to work as my cousin is using my car. And then it's about 6 months of this until my cousin gets partial custody. Still have to babysit and take the bus to work. Making just enough money to pay my car insurance (for a car I'm not using), phone, credit card, etc. and whatever little money I have left I spend on food, clothes, etc.

 After about 4 months my cousin buys his own car. A 2014 Audi A4. And gives my my POS car back. Eventually my cousin tells me I can get a job with him doing road side assistance making more than double what I make at the nursing home, so naturally I say yes. Come to find out I was under the impression of making $20+/hr when in reality it's was $13/hr plus mandatory overtime. I was working 72 hours a week for $13 an hour changing 20 tires a day with a fucking tire iron, the company didn't give me shit to work with. The highlight of my day was jumpstarting a car. Now we are in the middle of summer while there is a heat advisory and I'm trying to change a man's tire in front of his house (don't understand how that requires ""roadside assistance"") and it won't budge. I call my boss and he tells me to keep trying and to use some WD40. Still doesn't work and I'm drenched in sweat dying in the heat. Eventually I tell the customer he needs someone with a impact wrench and that I can't do it. I go back to my van and think I suffered a mini heat stroke but don't really think anything of it. I just cool off in the A/C then continue my day.

 Eventually after working only a month the boss wants me to train another employee which I feel obligated to do. So after about 2 weeks it's obvious this man Is a bad driver and I notify the boss about it but he turns a blind eye to it. Not even a week later said employee crashes the van I use to do my job. So the boss moves me over to a 26 thousand pound truck that I'm not comfortable driving so I had to decline and miss work until he got a new van but after some time off I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to work for this company anymore, they don't pay you on time, they constantly lie to the customers about how far away I am, and they don't care about their employees not one ounce.  

So now I'm unemployed and my life is starting to get to my mental. My Aunt and I take care of my cousins child more than he does and most of his money goes towards his Audi he sometimes misses payments on and Weed that I don't even smoke anymore because I get headaches now. Now it's the present day and I'm still unemployed still babysit while my cousin has another child on the way with a different woman who isn't any better in the sense of raising a child. She literally yells at her own 4 year old daughter calling her names like stupid, annoying, and screams at her to leave her alone. Besides that. I'm going back to working at the nursing home pretty soon but this time as a cook. But I feel like a marionette. A puppet being controlled by strings. I can't help but to feel like it's almost impossible to pursue my interests because of my financial and family situation. I don't want to leave my nephew or have my cousin resent me for the way i feel towards him. And he's told me before that I'm not bound here and that I can do whatever I want but how could I? Any advice?

TL;DR; : I'm stuck with a child that isn't mine, mentally drained, and a financial burden that feels impossible to climb out of."
q8kmi3,1,2021-10-15,Anxiety about future and Career (Substitute Teacher to Teacher),Elegant_Space_2385,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q8kmi3/anxiety_about_future_and_career_substitute/,"Im a 30yo Man. I went to college for pastoral work and graduated in 2013, I did three internships working at different churches, but have never found a staff position at a church. One of the internships I did was at a church in Hawaii which was from 2016-2017. After my internship I figured what the heck i'll stay in Hawaii until i get hired by a church. I interviewed for a lot of church positions but never got hired. 

I juggled a few different jobs here and there and eventually became a substitute teacher because it was my best option at the time.

Subbing in Hawaii isn't a bad gig you get paid $170 a day, get calls every school day, the hours are short about 6 hours, but really 4 or 5 hours because you get a 45 min lunch break and most of the time get a free period unless they call you to fill in another classroom. The time goes by fast, and you do something different everyday. Sometimes there are fun and interesting things to do too, like school assemblies, dance classes, hawaii immersion (this is where guest comes into a classroom to teach about hawaiian culture and history), When I subbed in band class (I don't know how to play any instruments) I turned it into a talent show. There were also days when I would just oversee recesses, or fix things around the school, sometimes I became the crossing guard. There are days I would become a parapro and work with just one special needs student, and other days I taught special ed, and there was the time I taught extremely special needs students which turned into making popcorn and watching a disney marathon. I got to watch spelling bees, play students in chess, teach deaf children with an interpreter translating for me. I taught gym for 2 weeks with no provided lesson plans which equated to doing recess during which I got to really talk with my students and get to know them. I've taught in school suspension where im in a class of just kids who got kicked out of other classes (not as bad as you would think). I would walk out to say goodbye to my students as they are loaded onto busses and wait by the car line, and I would give them high fives and joke around with them. 

Those where all the good parts about being a substitute teacher. The bad parts, is that while  it is a good gig it's just a just a gig. I get payed a flat rate with no chance of pay increase. You don't have any stability and I often get anxious if I don't fill my calendar. The school year also has a lot of breaks that you don't get paid for. 

Then there are the behavior problems I've had to pull students off of each other for fighting multiple times. I have had students try to fight me. Then there are just bad classes, the groups of students that are a seemingly from hell incarnate, classes where students break all the rules and go nuts. luckily enough I can call the security guards and have students be pulled out of class, but I hate doing that even though I do it fairly often, I would also have security just come to the classroom and not take anyone just so they know I can get them there at any time. 

then there are the principals most of which are nice and just happy that you are subbing at their building, but some are just downright intimidating and demanding. Like if I have a class get out of control blaming me for the students bad behavior, which is fair but some classes try to ""punish subs"" and can get overwhelming and it brings down the hammer on me. I also got in trouble for reclining and putting my feet up on the desk during one of the free periods when I didn't have a class.

I moved from Maui to Michigan during covid and thought this will be a great chance to do interviews for churches because i'm so much closer to many of the church's i would like to work in. Well unfortunately a year later I came up short again.

So here I am 30 years old looking to make some moves. I decided to do a program called iteach which will allow me to get a teaching certificate. i have to show them that I have a 4 year degree and pass a test which I took today and passed. The program is $4000 and will be 6 months of online school, followed by 1 year of teaching before I get a standard teaching license.

1. first off i'm afraid that i won't actually get hired as a teacher (which is one of the requirements of the program) as they dont help place you, they give you a document that shows you are in a licensing program and will become a certified teacher by the end of the year, but it up to me to get hired through the normal processes, and i am pretty scarred from all of the years of getting rejected from churchs.

 2. Second thing is that I don't really want to be a teacher (not that I dislike being in the classroom), I really want to be a youth pastor. I just can't seem to make that happen. the actual hope in becoming a teacher is to make my youth pastor resume look better.

3. Third thing i'm scared of is getting difficult classrooms, and a hard ass principal.

4. Forth thing i'm scared of is the amount of work it will take. i'm going to go from a pretty unstable but low stakes position, to a position with a lot more responsibility. I think I can do it, but I don't know how much it's going to take out of me.

All in all I feel pretty foolish. I'm down on myself because i thought I would be further into a career by this point in my life, and i wonder if i'll ever be able to buy a house. 

Speaking of housing i can't seem to find a place to live other than one place that charges $1600 a month which is about half of my income on a good month. My family is encouraging me to take the place and promised to offset some of the cost, my last place was $1200.

&amp;#x200B;

In general teaching in hawaii get a bad wrap for 1 thing in particular, low wages i would start off making $38,000 for one year followed by making $50,000 for the next five years, and finally at year 6 it tops out at $52,000. If i get a masters it then tops out at $56,600 Phd $67,000.  
For comparison a Sub will make $30,600 if he has perfect attendance, but it is goes down $170 for each day they miss.

im looking at paying $19,200 in rent.

So i just ask myself; Am I doing the right thing?"

q8pur7,2,2021-10-15,Need to make an internship decision today - any last-minute advice? [Electrical Engineering],orangeandblack5,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/q8pur7/need_to_make_an_internship_decision_today_any/,"Hi all, just got an offer last night that's competing with my offer due today and trying to sort things out within the next few hours. **Edit:** My offer due today agreed to extend my deadline by a week, so I'm no longer quite as pressured for time. Advice still greatly appreciated!  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Basically, I have had an offer from a large defense contractor in the southwest US - it would be a systems engineering role on an aerospace project, and I had to pull a few strings to get it. Just yesterday, I received an offer from a small local firm that does rapid prototyping work - it sounds really cool, and very similar to the environment I've loved so much on my student project team in college, but it pays nearly 40% less, doesn't contribute to retirement savings, and isn't close enough to commute to, so I'd be moving either way (although the large firm covers relocation expenses while the small one does not).  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I've worked at a few large companies over the past few summers, and have generally found the desk job environment to not be to my liking, which would push me towards the small firm as possibly being a better fit. It'd definitely be a newer experience for me, and therefore probably worth trying with an internship if possible. Plus, I'm not sure I've really considered the full ramifications of moving so far across the country, and so committing to that scares me a little bit. I have prior experience in the area, and it's not unlivable, but it's hard to say it's better than where I am now in any way.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
However, I'm hesitant to accept the offer because it feels like throwing away money I could really use to pay for grad school (which I'm starting next year [for certain]), housing, and/or to buy or lease a car to get to and from work (I don't have one currently and would need one for either position), and it also seems to me the small firm would be much more likely to offer me a full-time position when I graduate grad school than the large firm if I don't intern with them - they've really been trying to woo me over, and although it's not guaranteed I suspect I'd still have good odds of getting full-time if I don't intern with them and end up disliking the large defense firm - they say that interns are prioritized in full-time, which I'm sure is true, but if they weren't trying so hard to get me right now I wouldn't even be considering it.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I'm hoping I can get a few outside opinions on the following questions:  
  
* How much should I weigh a 40% salary increase if it's only for approximately 12 weeks? Note this would all go straight to tuition/living expenses/buying a car/paying off loans.  
  
* Would greater negotiating power with a small firm when discussing full-time salary make it worth it to lose out in the short term, even if that means taking out larger loans?  
  
* Would a small firm look less impressive on a résumé than a big name company, in the likely case I end up applying elsewhere down the road?  
  
* Does anyone with experience moving across the country for a first job have any tips on how I should think about and weigh that?  
  
* How important is interning at a small firm at some point, to get a feel for what that environment is like?  
  
* Is my expectation the small firm is more likely to hire me if I don't intern with them than the big company fundamentally incorrect?  
  
* Are there any other questions I should be asking or concerns I should have that I'm not thinking of?

I am from India and hold a masters degree in physics. My initial plan was to do a PhD and enter academia. But for various reasons, I have given up on it. I have a good GPA and a couple of decent research internships under my belt, but no work experience. Apart from subject knowledge, I have a good grasp of programming (Python) and computational algorithms. 

I am looking for industries and roles that would fit my skill set as a physicist. I am open to new things and unconventional career paths. I am not very keen on traditional teaching positions. 

My first consideration was content and curriculum related positions in Edtech. Data analytics seems interesting, but might require another degree as far as I understand.

**Capital One-McLean, VA**

Relocation: $1,500

**Salesforce-San Fransisco, CA**

Salary: $138,000

Signing Bonus: $25,000

Relocation: $11,000

One of my biggest concerns right now is whether or not the Salesforce salary is too low for Bay Area COL, Capital One on the other hand is more than enough for NoVA and I'm hoping to be able to push the signing bonus to match Salesforce so that the overall compensation difference isn't too wide.

I'm also trying to stay in the DC area to be near family, and from what it seems my recruiter wasn't too confident on being able to switch to a Virginia or any East Coast Salesforce office for that matter (atleast straight from the beginning idrk about switching offices after a few months) and also I haven't really been able to garner much information on the level of remoteness for new grads, so that's another concern. But I don't want to pass up on the opportunity on what is considered a more ""prestigious"" company but I'm not sure what the general consensus on Salesforce's prestige is.

As for work itself, I feel like both companies have really good work-life balances and culture, it's just I've heard Salesforce's projects can be a little bit boring at times, whereas I never had that problem at my Capital One internship, but I'm not really sure how substantiated these claims are."

I liked my classes that involved making  and designing websites. Coding was relaxing to me and I like the problem solving component.

1. So firstly , don’t stress if you’re getting ghosted. 99% of companies will ghost you because of your graduation date. The companies that don’t that i know of usually have programs specifically for freshmen. Literally this year I’m getting phone screens at basically every company I apply to as a sophomore but got only 1 / 200+ Apps freshmen year. 

2. Quality &gt; Quantity when it comes to projects. People always say yo do projects and it’s true that’s really good advice. However you don’t need 5 different projects on your resume. Try to pick something you’re generally interested in , maybe get a couple friends together and build it up slowly over the course of the year. Bonus points for live links. No ones going to look at your GitHub repo but if you have a live demo (easily hosted for free on Firebase) or even a YouTube video showing how it works that will go a long way. Literally Every single one of my interviewers has brought up the major project on my resume and they had used it for themselves to check it out.  A very common interview question is to describe a technical challenge you faced when building these projects. 

3. Networking. This goes in two ways 1. To get offers at startups , 2. Referrals . Join CS clubs and professional organizations at your school, many of the upperclassman had / will have internships at cool companies , and these are a much more likely source of referalls than dm ing strabgers on LinkedIn. A great place to get experience on your resume as well is small startups and you can network your way in by finding the CEO and messaging them on LinkedIn showing genuine interest. 

4. Leetcode , literally don’t stress over the leetcode grind and focus on learning the material in your classes. 

Lastly , literally do not stress. If you can’t find a summer internship just work a normal job and work on a project you find interesting. That alone will put you ahead of most other applicants."

q8zbzr,7,2021-10-15,Received a coding test for the job after the recruiting manager told me the company would extend me an offer?,leetleetleetleet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q8zbzr/received_a_coding_test_for_the_job_after_the/,"Over the last month, I've been in the process of interviewing for a startup (as a senior in university who is graduating next May) that's had a ton of growth (it has maybe 200 - 300 employees), and for the most part, everything in their interview process has been pretty good. I first met with their senior director of engineering and talked with him for 30 minutes, and he seemed to really like me. He told me that he'd reach out to one of the recruiters and have him schedule me another interview, and a week later, I did a 1.5 hour interview with 3 people in the company (30 minutes with each person). I thought those interviews went extremely well, and the team there seemed to really like me. All of those interviews were just about my resume and my past experience as an intern. Most people who work there used to work at the company I interned at and the CEO of the company even worked at the company I interned at for almost 18 years, so they were very interested in what I did there. I thought it was a little odd that I wasn't given a technical assessment, but I thought they were more just interested in what I had done at the company I interned at. I also thought that they might have thought that I'd be fine without a technical assessment since I passed a technical assessment at the company I interned at.

This is where things started getting weird and where I've started to feel more uncomfortable.

On Tuesday, I received a phone call from the recruiting manager saying that the team thought I would be a great culture fit and that they would like to extend me an offer. She said that they were in the process of putting together a compensation package for me. The recruiter asked me what my salary expectations are and kept pushing me to tell her what I'm looking for before she would say what they're willing to pay. I didn't want to do that, so I told her I was hoping they would tell me what they're willing to pay first and that I needed more time to do research. However, she didn't want to tell me how much they pay. She also kept asking me how many companies I applied to and where are they located, and she was pretty pushy in trying to get specific answers. Ultimately, we decided to have a phone call earlier today where we would discuss my compensation package.

An hour before my phone call with the recruiting manager, I received an email from HackerRank from this company with a REST test. I was very surprised to see this because I thought I was already done with their interview process. Why would the recruiter tell me on Tuesday that they wanted to extend an offer and then schedule with me a time to discuss my compensation package and then, three days later, send me a coding test for the position? Why didn't they send me this before she told me they would like to extend an offer and before we scheduled that phone call? I would understand doing a technical assessment before that phone call on Tuesday, but the fact that they're now making me do this technical assessment after that phone call on Tuesday just feels like a slap in the face.

When I talked to the recruiting manager on the phone today, I asked her about this, and she said the test is a standard test they give to people at all levels and said I would need to complete it to finish the interviewing process. She still wanted to talk about compensation with me today, but I told her I didn't want to discuss this until it's official that they want to hire me. She also said she did research on the market and has an idea of what they're willing to pay, but she didn't want to tell me how much. If this is a standard test they give to all candidates, why did she wait until after calling me and telling me they would like to extend me an offer to give me this test? Surely they wouldn't forget or anything because that's what their hiring process is. 

From my conversation with her on Tuesday, I was already starting to feel like she wanted to lowball me and play games with me to pay me less money, but I now feel like the whole point of this test is to come up with an excuse as to why I should be payed less. For example, if I don't do as well on this test, they could say that they can't pay me as much because my performance wasn't good enough, so they might use that to find an excuse to reduce my salary. I just feel like this may be a red flag, and honestly, it's killed any excitement I had for working at the company and makes me just want to get an offer somewhere else.

Has anyone ever had any experience similar to this? Does anybody know why a company would do something like this? Would this be a red flag that should make me reconsider the company? Also, is the fact that the recruiter doesn't want to tell me how much they would pay me until after I tell her my expectations an indicator that they want to underpay me?"

I am having a big problem looking for jobs right now. Many jobs I've looked for that were listed under ""entry level"" require 5+ years of experience, many require experience with countless types of software I've never even heard of until looking at the qualifications, and here are some other problems I have looking for a job that many other people won't have:

1. I can't relocate. I don't have much independence yet, I can't get a driver's license yet due to medical issues, etc. so I'm nowhere near ready to move out yet. Out of the many jobs I've applied for, I've gotten calls from three companies but they've all had to reject me due to being unable to relocate.
2. As mentioned above, I can't get a driver's license yet, so I need to get a job that's a close drive by or to an area where a bus goes. Can't have my parents driving me an hour to my job and an hour back, then an hour to pick me up and an hour back.
3. I have had no work experience or internships. The only experience I have is a few months of volunteer work 2 1/2 years ago.

I've also had multiple rejection emails, and some companies haven't even sent me an email back.

It's just so hard to find a job listing that doesn't require years of experience and that isn't an hour's drive away. And it's not like I don't live in a place that doesn't have a lot of CS jobs. I live only about 10 minutes away from the Johnson Space Center, a place full of programmers.

Do I have ANY chance at all right now of finding a CS job? Do I need to go ahead and work at minimum wage jobs to get work experience before people will hire me? Do I need to wait until I'm independent and able to relocate?"

I know their recruiting has been pretty slow and messy so I'll share my entire process for those wondering:

Overview: OAs -&gt; first round interview -&gt; final round interview

8/9 - Recruiter reach out to apply

8/13 - Received Hackerrank and ModernHire assessment

8/14 - Completed OAs

8/19 - Received email saying I passed, was told I would receive scheduling tool for first round on week of **9/6**

10/2 - After long delay, received scheduling tool for first round

10/7 - Did first round interview, was given a take home assignment about 24 hours prior to interview. Choice of backend and frontend.

q95z48,28,2021-10-16,[Poly] Destroying CCA Myths,lisalim169,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/q95z48/poly_destroying_cca_myths/,"Why CCA is extremely useful in poly despite popular belief:

First, school opportunities. Who doesn’t like going overseas or joining school events that gives you 1 credit to skip your general modules! Scholarships, special programmes, overseas programmes all need excellent CCA record to give you the best chance at succeeding and living your a good life as a poly student.


Secondly, it can be a backup if you’re that close to getting into your University course .  Everyone should believe that they can make it into University with enough time and effort. However, life may throw you around a curve (or a bell curve) and you may be justtt a few points away from the cut off. Can’t direct entry? With a good portfolio, you may succeed in your ABA! It may also help in your appeal.

Internship/ work interview: Internship or final year project. you don’t get to choose… or do you? Companies interview students and choose, so a good portfolio definitely helps. Remember, grades land you the interview, but your portfolio and personality lands you the job.

  
Now, for any CCA i’ll suggest leadership roles or a role that’s directly or very relevant to your aspiration in life. To balance CCA and your grades, I believe GPA is always first but CCAs leads to more opportunities and greater chances. Take Low commitment CCAs!

  
My suggestions:  

YEAR 1
* Do not join student relations cca or sports cca. Takes up a lot of time and usually the points given are not worth it
* Join all the CCAs you’re interested in Year 1 (most time to spare) I recommend 3-5 CCAs, with the assumption that the commitment level is low at 1-3 times per month (ask them!)
* leadership roles: Look for undervalued clubs that’s not very popular that you’re interested in. Very easy to get leadership role. You’ll get the role half a year after you join when you’re in Y1 semester 2
* only apply for leadership roles for CCAs you’re sure you want to keep

YEAR 2
* what I consider high commitment: 1 or more meetings per week. Low commitment: 1-3 meetings per week
* filter out CCAs that you don’t really like (especially non-leadership roles)
* I reccomend keeping 2 CCAs to stand out and use for portfolio. These 2 CCAs can have leadership roles for CCA points
* having an excellent CCA record usually needs a leadership role so apply for at least one
* Drop CCAs if it’s affecting your grades or you find out it takes too much time (e.g. found out student relations was AT LEAST 2 days a week meetings and when the event nears, it became everyday meetings even during holiday. Only got one measly service point for more than 30+ hours of commitment. Seniors don’t care and will drag informal meetings to from 10pm to 2am in the morning.
* Manage your time well and you can do it (I’m in a intense business course but was still able to handle a few CCAs)
* Main point for it not to affect studies but still stand out: 2 LOW COMMITMENT CCAs, at least 1 leadership role
* Do not sign up for all events/ programmes/ projects in year 2, sign up for 1-2 max per CCA (2-4 total for 2 CCAs) while doing your assigned duties. Commitment may increase to 1-2 meetings per month or weekly meetings based on your CCA. You may want to reconsider the leadership position if it is weekly meetings

YEAR 3:
* You have tons of CCA experience and use it fully!
* should have juniors taking up your roles so lesser or no more things to do

Maximise your portfolio and time by having 2 CCAs but only utilising 4-6 days a month with the rest for studying. CCA meetings usually stop at exam and project periods or excuse yourself from meetings if you’re rushing to meet important deadlines and meetings haven’t stopped (don’t make it a habit!)

**Points to take note:**

\- You need to write 3 different 600-character writeups for 3 courses, but **only one 1000-character writeup**! (can paraphrase for similar courses) ​This is because **all 3 schools can see all your write-ups**, so it is bad if all your write-ups are the same, and may be **used against you** in your interview.

\- You can get **more than one interview and offer**, but your final offer will be chosen **based on your ranking of choices** (even if you are accepted in more than 1 course)

**Steps for write-up:**

1. **Research!** Every course, regardless of similar names, will have different specialisations and electives so take a look and see what is best for you. **Our website is great for this as we aim to have a complete compilation of experiences for ALL courses in Singapore!**
2. Shortlist **12** courses based on your interest and note down the name, L1R5/ ELR2B2 cut off points and the course's code for reference (this info is needed to fill up the application form)
3. Rank these courses **by interest** \- When in doubt, research and list the pros and cons.
4. The **top 3 courses** is what you should apply for your EAE or DAE
5. Rethink if the top 3 are best suited for you and re-rank, to **confirm if you really want these courses**, before doing the write-ups to save yourself precious time!

**What to write:**

\- Interest (What ignited the passion)

\- Relevant activities (e.g. CCA, AEM, competitions)

\- Activities beyond school (e.g. work experiences, internships, non-school volunteering)

\- Aspirations and long term goals

\- Talents and Achievements

\- Relevant personal experiences

**What NOT to write:**

\- Personal particulars

\- Subjects and results

\- Generic information

\- Introductions (e.g Business is a amazing world of interlinked connections that can. change the world...)

\- Vague information

\- What you will learn in the course

\- Describing the course

\- Irrelevant talents/ achievements

\- Things that you are bad at

your 600 character write-up

Based on aptitude and passion - with relevant experiences, examples and achievements only! (Non-relevant can be written in the 1000-character essay) **Emphasise on what makes you unique!**

**Main 3 points to write about:**

1. When/What/Who/How triggered my interest (Personal story)
2. Relevant experience/ Personal qualities (Use real life examples!)
3. Long term plans/ aspirations

**Secondary points:**

1. Talents and achievements (related to the course)
2. Relevant school-related activities (e.g. workshops, CCA, AEM, competitions)
3. Relevant activities beyond school (e.g. work experience, internships, volunteering)

Your 1000 character write-up

Based on talent and achievements - non relevant experiences/ achievements are written here (Mainly entrepreneurship, leadership, community service and art/sports. Other achievements are also accepted.)

There will be a question: Do you have any other achievements/ talents to highlight? **Always click YES!**

When you write your write-up, most of the content can be copied from your report book/ CCA certificate! However, DO NOT use short form (e.g. instead of NYAA, write National Youth Achievement Award), even if it saves space. You must also support the achievements with real life examples/ events! (E.g. when you write that you have over 80 hours of VIA, state some of the places you've volunteered at)

**Format for writing: (Rank by most outstanding to least)**

In year, I attended competition/course and achieved award/medal.

* CCA achievements
* Non-related achievements
* Personal experiences (e.g. work experience, volunteering)

———
**What to prepare for portfolio** 

* Relevant certificates and awards (AEM, CCAs, Academic - can be found in report book)
* Relevant personal experiences and work samples (Support with evidence!)
* Participation in relevant workshops
* Recommendation letters (e.g. from coaches, bosses, instructors on relevant skills)
* Most recent Report Slip
* Polytechnic special certs (e.g. NP's Entrepreneurship Quiz which states that it can be used in your portfolio)
* Print multiple copies In case the lecturer wants a copy. You can use this extra copy to guide the interviewers on your points.
* Bring your IC and always arrive early!

**Types of interviews**

1. Panel interview - Interviewed with some other interviewees at the same time
2. 1-1 private interview - Interviewed individually
3. Group work - Working together with people you have never met before to submit a project
4. Aptitude test - Taking an individual test **(Usually before an interview, on the same day)**

**Interview ethics**

* Dress formally/ school uniform (No jewelry, perfume, loud colours and clip/tie your hair)
* Sit properly and do not fidget
* Body language (Smile, have eye contact and gesture appropriately)
* Do not badmouth other polytechnics 
* Do not use too much Singlish (especially for language courses)

**Grading of interview (May vary)**

40% - Attitude

25% - Appearance

25% - Communication Skills

10% - Qualities

Aim to impress the interviewers! Ask good questions (not on the polytechnic's website) for a better impression. Some questions I think are good to ask: ""What are module credits?"" ""Can you join more than one CCA?""

**Answering technique for interview questions**

1. Situation (What is happening)
2. Task that needed to be accomplished
3. Actions taken to perform task
4. Results of your actions

**Tips and tricks for difficult/curveball questions (they test for certain qualities)**

* Ask to clarify to buy time
* Think/ ask for time before answering
* Its really hard to predict these types of questions, so just answer them the best that you can!

**Analysing questions**

What is your biggest weakness? *-&gt; Trick question, used to demonstrate self awareness and analytic skills and the ability to improve.* It's best if you can view the weakness as a strength!

**Possible interview questions (and think how it relates to the course)**

\- Why did you put that poly course as 1st/2nd./3rd choice?

\- Why did you choose this poly?

\- What are some highlights in your life?

\- What are some of your key learning life experiences?

\- What are some achievements that you are proud of?

\- What is your greatest achievement?

\- What is your greatest strength?

\- What do you believe is your professional weakness?

\- What is your biggest weakness?

\- What do you think this course is all about?

\- Where do you see yourself in 5 years (after graduation)

\- Tell me about your skills

\- Tell me about a time when... (e.g. you had to handle a challenging co=worker/customer)

\- Describe a time when you went beyond the call of duty

\- Pretend you have similar achievements and results as the previous candidate. Why should we accept you over her?

\- If you are rejected from this course, what other courses are you considering?

\- Assuming your score isn't ideal, are you sure you can cope?

\- Value that you have/ need for your course

\- Any course related news you've heard about lately

&amp;#x200B;

India based US citizen new grad here. Recently graduated from one of India's top private university with a degree in CS. Prior to graduation I interned at a big american bank where I enjoyed the project [(see resume)](https://imgur.com/Ih2TfUf) work culture and team. Everything was really good.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I had an offer from a big Cal based SaaS/PaaS company. I reasoned it being a tech company, it would look better on my resume and would be better work experience. And the slightly better pay definitely didn't hurt. Oh how I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 3 months since I joined and I've basically written a few selenium tests in this time. The entire team is really poorly coordinated. I've been told to ""never push to git, you could mess up the code. Send me the file via teams"". Our production branch is the dev branch. My other new hire teammate has received feedback for being annoying and asking too many questions (what??). In short it's been an awful experience so far.

&amp;#x200B;

My short to mid-term plan is to move back to the US. I've been applying for new grad positions in the US and grinding leetcode basically full time for the past month, but I'm not getting many OAs. Do I need to do projects to up my [resume](https://imgur.com/Ih2TfUf)? Do I go back to my internship boss and beg for a job? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified that staying at this role will kill my resume with barely anything to show besides writing test cases. This is a low code company, so when I asked my manager if I could have some more code heavy work, that our entire product is to reduce code for developers. Should I just resign?

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got an internship at Tier 2 FAANG (Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, etc). My goal is to work there for four years before going for my MBA, preferably at an M7, and then transition to PM at a FAANG. 

In line with these goals, I started to search on LinkedIn to see if I can find any MBA students at M7 schools with a similar profile. To my surprise, I could barely find anyone that worked as a Software Engineer at one of these companies and then went on to pursue an MBA at an M7. Even when I removed the restrictions of race, gender, and undergrad school prestige, the results were more or less the same. I am confused, I thought this type of profile was overrepresented in the sense that there are already too many people at M7 schools with this type of profile but that doesn't seem to be the case.

This really bums me out because it looks like B-Schools are discriminating against software engineers regardless of race, gender, nationality, etc. In fact, the only way I saw people in the tech industry get into top business schools was if they were already PMs at FAANG companies. But this begs the question, why the hell would I do an MBA if I was already a PM at a FAANG. It just doesn't make any sense.

Anyway, is there some truth to my claims or do you see plenty of Microsoft/Amazon/Salesforce software engineers at M7 business schools?

Thanks!"

As a start, I graduated a year late from my uni (bachelors degree) because it took me a year to finish my thesis (a requirement to graduate in my country). Ended up graduating with honors and got A for the thesis. But I still graduated later than my peers/cohort. This makes me feel like I have to catch up because I'm underachieving and behind. 
While waiting for my thesis, to make the best out of the situation, I got an internship and professional mentoring during that year. It has helped a little, my CV got shortlisted usually and I got to interview at some places, I failed most of them and got an offer from one (it’s a decent company but I have to start from internship to get converted to full time so I'm still on interns salary for 4 months). I got a potential competing offer yesterday (full time position, higher salary), I need to nail the interview to secure it but I failed. Miserably. I totally won’t get this job. Guaranteed.

If you are eligible, please apply to fly ins! It was  disappointing that most of the fly ins were virtual, but I’ve made so many friends through these programs that make it easier to get through this scary process that is college admissions. In future years it’ll probably be in person, so you’ll get to travel and truly feel what it’s like to be on a college campus. Ultimately, my only regret was not applying to more fly ins!!!"

Last summer, I was an IT Intern. I didn't do any coding at all, so I made sure to really land a software engineering internship next summer so I have a strong resume during my senior year.

I just got an offer for an internship next summer from a company I met during my school's career fair. It's an amazing internship. Really good ratings on Glassdoor (higher than the previous company I worked for and I loved my previous company), paid housing, 10-12 weeks, a \~$35 per hour gross salary, and the job listing itself is, essentially, Software Engineering, including Mobile App Development, Data &amp; API Development, etc.

I'm slightly hesitant, though, because a) The title of the internship isn't ""Software Engineer Intern,"" which was my main goal. The official title is a ""Technology Intern"" and b) They didn't give me a technical interview. They offered me the job after one behavioral interview, which they said really impressed them, so I'm worried this internship won't be as technically heavy as I would like it to be.

How important are the words ""Software Engineer Intern"" for recruiters and will I have a disadvantage if I don't have one? Does the name of internships matter at all? And how often do quality Computer Science internships hire students without giving them a technical interview? (Granted, this wasn't Google or Amazon. It's a small, relatively unknown, Bank)"

q9iok0,1,2021-10-16,Free from toxic parents - What next for finances?,swashbucklercheese,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/q9iok0/free_from_toxic_parents_what_next_for_finances/,"I am new to reddit and I am loving the response and help I am getting from the questions here.. I would love to get some basic foundation on next step for my finance now that I am done with my responsibility as a guarantor..

Little background : I was brought up being gaslighted constantly in this belief of being indebted to family and parents for them raising me for 1st 18 years.. Culture back home (the part of India where I am from) was such that independence at adulthood and aspirations to become strong self-made adult is rarely encouraged. Helicopter parents and suppressing ideologies run wild back there. Archaic culture is the norm. Even most of the role models I had as a child back home were all so involved in being tied to family.

After my father moved the family to Canada when I was 17.. I was exposed the diverse and global culture. University peers were confidently and rightfully managing their own lives as adults.. I too decided to do the same.. My narrow views were broadened and I was strongly feeling the urge to practice this free and self made adult life. Decided to take student loan for all of the uni fees, worked jobs and I decided that whatever rent/food money I was taking from parents after 18 should be returned - which I did with my 16 months internship and sharing first 2 years of salary with my father as a professional engineer.. I evened out all the financial help I took from him ever and logically felt like I have no indebtment to them anymore from my adult life. ..However, there was still this control and entitlement from my father that was hard to shake.. My mom's severe gaslighting didnt help either. My mom has always been under his control too (they belong to this culture of patriarchy and orthodoxy). She would always do heavy guilt-tripping and emotional extortion to even think of any financial freedom or freedom in general. This is the phase where he asked me if I would guarantee a house for them and he asked me to rent a room in this house so I can contribute to his mortgage. Now I dont know why, but I didnt question them much (which has been my problem since I was a child)..I lived in the house paying rent 3 times the actual room rates and I was sharing all my salary with him.. I didnt need to do this. I should have been living somewhere with 1/3rd rent with full freedom as an independent earning adult, but this was contempted and discourage quite a bit..

I am 24 by now.. A year after I lived in their home, my friend wanted to visit and stay over but my father didnt allow it (one of millions of controlling things he did).. I decided to review my whole life and honestly felt like its time to end this whole ordeal. I left their house and have atleast my spatial freedom. I can have my friends over and practice adult life. However, I was still not financially free, I was still chipping in my salary to them, but now I was just ""lending"" them rather than giving my money away for free.. Because I was getting a bit over my naivety and found that he has all kind of money and dont need to gain any financial help from me.. I demanded this lent money back in a year

My father worked at a bank and he asked me if he can return my money by opening an account with his bank and invest there in my name.. Again - naive me agreed to build one more association with him and get him to act as my customer service rep. Here too he started handling investments like he owns my shit without my consent.. He thought he has full authority and entitlement to act on my behalf - I never ever agreed to this, but I guess my allowing of all the suppression over the years confirmed his entitlement in his mind.. This is outright fraud.. This was the LAST time I ever wanted to associate with him.. This gave me lot of paranoia and anxiety of what else in my financial world is being controlled - I decided to be diligent about checking and monitoring credit reports/ tax returns/slips for past 10 years.

I decided to send a warning email to his bank email to never ever be my customer service rep again and never deal with my finance again or I will complaint to CRA/cops.. I moved all my investment from the bank he works at to other bank. Closed all the accounts and I cut all the financial ties with him.. Wrote another email on how I will never ever practice any personal or financial affiliation with him ever again. strict boundaries and they are never welcome in my life ever again. If i ever see anything in my credit report or cra slips that i have not done myself from now on, I'd report to cops for identity fraud. After cutting all the personal and financial ties, after warning to never commit any identity fraud - the one last association I had with him was this guarantorship - which luckily he never defaulted and wrapped up quickly with his own money.. The mortgage is now discharged and now we are here. I am finally free - I am 27 though. bit late in blooming but catching up to being a strong adult.

\-- What are your views on my strict boundaries and complete estrangement to parents? Deep down, I have small guilt on ending this in sour note, but my logic says this is absolutely necessary

\-- Is there anything else I should be tracking other than next credit reports and cra slips to catch any identity fraud in future?

\-- What should be my next step for setting up my financial foundation? I am starting from scratch. I have 6 figure income though. Should I set the goal to max up my tfsa and rrsp? and should i dive into ETFs for the start?

Thanks,

Im currently an EE undergrad student and about to complete my 3rd semester. For my comming semesters i applied to several internship with two standing out (ironically at the same company):

1) This would be as a test engineer. The department itself is responsible for creating test and quality control for new semiconductors leaving the fab. It's not really for verification but they told me that they were working close with these guys.
Since this department covers a lot of different topics there are a lot of possibilities here.

2) I still have no idea how i managed to get this one: This department is responsible for the architecture and design of data storage in semiconductors all the way down to the actual transistor level.
This department is a lot more constrained in what they are doing but i think(??) that this would be an absolute career boost for me.

The benefits of both departments are essentially the same and both almost guarante a full time employment afterwards.

Hopefully you can share some insights if you're working in similar positions since I really have no idea which one i should choose."

2. Tutoring/mentoring peers at honor society.
3. Volunteer at local elementary school.
4. Producer of an independent film (It goes along with my minor degree. It requires a lot of leadership but doesn’t fit my other tech profile)

Tech management (PM and above)

Essay:
Will focus on tech innovation. Since most of my experiences are with start ups, most of my projects and my works are very large scale and require a lot of designs, collaboration with other teams’ managers and PMs, and leadership among interns.

I am scared that if I ED CMU, I might not get in and I won't get into Cornell RD. So I will end up going to a public university I don't like much.

q9n4qa,18,2021-10-16,So I've had this tiny spark of an idea rolling around in my brain for a long time now and it's only been within the last two years and even more recently the last six months that it's germinated and begun to sprout. Here me out... (Famous last words!),yeahbatman,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q9n4qa/so_ive_had_this_tiny_spark_of_an_idea_rolling/," 
What if Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z just said no? Just unilaterally decided on Monday to not go into work at their shitty jobs? A labor force wide ""strike"" all at once, if you will. There aren't enough boomers left on our level to replace us and those ""above"" have proven they won't do it unless they're forced to. Let them figure out what the fuck they're gonna do for once.

And my thought began to form like this: We were taught as children to taken what we are given and be satisfied while the adults are free to take what they want. Yes? 
By that logic, WE ARE THE ADULTS NOW so why not take what they've refused to share for thousands of years over the span of empires? 

If we ALL stop working suddenly, what can they do? Fire us? We effectively just quit. Arrest us for nonpayment of bills and taxes? Cool, hope they can find enough room in their over-filled jails and prisons because we won't be paying for new ones to be built. Enact martial law? America has a out of control gun problem, or did they forget that? We're not helpless and so many people are tired, burnt out, and pissed the fuck off.
They have been pitting us against each other since always and they still are even now as strikes are popping up in little pockets all over the place. 
Let's dismantle them and their geriatric out-of-date government and install our own brilliant creative, empathic young people, those who we KNOW share our values and beliefs for how our lives should be led. All we have to do is work together and build our small communities back up and into a global community where the central value is YOU TAKE WHAT YOU GIVE. We only want businesses where everyone is equal within the company, from the highest officer to the lowliest intern. Pay us what we ARE worth and not what they deem acceptable. Why are they allowed to live high on the hog while we bleed, sweat, cry, then die with little to nothing to show for it? Why do they think occasional pizza parties or a bonus (good or bad) at Christmas are an acceptable way to show appreciation for the money we make for them? We only want appreciation in the form of PAYING US MORE THAN PENNIES ON EACH DOLLAR WE EARN FOR THEM.

We are tired and we just want to live lives where we aren't in a constant state of stress and survival. Let the government tax the rich for a while. Bezos, by himself, has more than enough to start paying our bills for us. We've earned a long rest. We've earned the time to learn new skills to better ourselves, our careers and our lives. We've more than earned the opportunity to work doing something we are passionate about. We've earned the chance to start and spend time with our families and loved ones. WE HAVE EARNED THE CHANCE TO TAKE THE TIME TO  OVERCOME THE TRAUMA IF JUST THE LAST TWO FUCKING YEARS! 

Can you imagine what we could do, what we could become as a society? I can. I see us standing up for ourselves in the face of all the many different kinds of injustices of our abusers (both professional and personal) and calling out their actions publicly every time they step out of line.  If we shine the light on the abusers, they can't hide in the shadows anymore. So maybe it's about time to bring their mansions down and let the bright sun shine down on all these roaches and stop the cycle of systemic abuse that started so so so long ago. 

The bottom line is businesses  start investing in employee welfare or they shutdown. The government starts truly investing in the welfare of it's people or they shutdown (I mean, they're already well on their way anyway, am I right?) 
They want to watch the world to burn, we want to see her rebirth as she rises like a phoenix from the ashes. 

Besides, they already started the year with a failed insurrection, why not rub our glorious world changing revolution in their faces at the end of it? 🙂 

 In conclusion, go forth fellow disenchanted children of the internet age, and spread this message of true freedom as far and as wide across the world as you can. Open a dialogue with your fellow workers, and organize. Spend your money locally or at small online businesses, or barter for what you need instead of giving your paltry earnings back to the overlords. Cut off their blood supply and they'll shrivel and die or make the changes necessary to adapt and survive.  Take your lives back and commit to helping making this world a truly better place for all of us to live in."

After i finish the associates (in about 3 months) I want to be able to apply to backend development jobs, so for my final project I am working on a CRUD App with nodejs, MySQL and Javascript so I can have something to show off to recruiters and employers. 

The question is, is this a good idea or should I consider learning other languages first? 

I do have the basics of programming already (just need to get deeper into a specific stack and start making proyects),I am also learning CI/CD and cloud. 

As I said the goal is basically be able to apply to backend development jobs in the future since I have a good networking and systems fundamentals already.

I graduated with a 3.43 GPA. I tried looking for an internship during Fall 2019-Spring 2020 for the summer of 2020 (that was my plan) and was interviewing with several companies but once COVID hit in Feb/March, all of them decided to cancel the internship / not go with me. I was thinking of maybe postponing my graduation to Dec 2021 so I can look for a summer internship but my advisor convinced me not to and to just graduate on May, which I did. I think I kind of regret it since I have not been able to find a job since graduation, and internships are out of the questions since alot require you to be an active student. 

I have been applying everywhere in the US, and have had several phone interviews, but none of them go anywhere. The furthest I got was the 2nd and final interview (exam-&gt;1st interview-&gt;2nd interview) but wasn't chosen. I am not going to lie, but this took a toll on me and made me quite depressed. In addition, 2 weeks ago I had to go to the ER for some other issues and had to pause on job searching etc. 

Any suggestions as to what I can do to improve my chances at being hired? Or getting more interviews? 

I talked to this staffing agent and they said they would send my resume to ""several"" companies but I haven't heard from them ever since... 

I've been actively trying to gain new skills, like I took a Six sigma course (certification) and already took the exam a few days ago. I should be getting my certificate a few days from now if everything goes well.

I also started learning Python the begining of this summer. Went over some online courses (YouTube but courses) and I am trying to figure out how to work effectively in github (I've only used it to look at repositories and other people code). 


Yet, I am unable to find anything. I feel like my lack of experience is hurting me. 

Any suggestions? How do I contact recruiters personally? What other sites can I apply to? I've been using LinkedIn job section, Indeed. Any skills? Certifications? Etc. Should I just give up and go to graduate school (I applied to master's in computational science for this Spring of 2022 but I haven't received an answer yet wether I've been accepted or not)? I really wanted to go to grad school after a few years working in industry as I find that subject really interesting, but I wanted to get a feel of life in industry first but I guess I am getting desperate here. 

Any suggestions???

q9tu8d,2,2021-10-17,struggling to find job (again),awaerr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q9tu8d/struggling_to_find_job_again/,"Hi there, I've made this kind of post a few times here before, but think I just need an update on what the hell I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: Graduated with a CS degree in 2017, didn't get a internship out of school and stagnated a bit. In 2019 I was able to get a decent internship as a DBA, which ended in 2020. 

In March of 2020 I was thinking about getting more into web development (specifically front-end because I like working with designs) and I entered into a certificate program at my university which I finished in January of this year.

Back then I was asking people if I should go do a bootcamp but it seemed like everybody said it wasn't a good idea just from the fact that I already have a degree and that I should just work on projects on my own and ""get over my mental roadblocks""

I can say that since then I've made a few programs and even made myself a portfolio website, but as i've been trying to apply to any sort of Junior Web Developer jobs I can find, I usually am met with either no reply, or a rejection. I am kinda hesitant to do open-source stuff as I feel like I just don't know enough to be helpful/contribute anything.

Honestly I dont know what to do, my parents hound me all the time and tell me to go back to school to get a master's degree, as they say nobody wants to hire somebody who has been out of school for 5 years. But all my other family members who have found success with CS all say there wouldn't be much point to it unless you ""wanted to move up in your career"" (which I have none). I have a ton of ideas for projects and I wouldn't be against just continuing to work on them, I started doing the google Kotlin course and I'm gonna see if I can't get the certificate through that too. 

Whenever I get  interviews (so far, about 2, from Stripe and Lessen) I start working with leetcode or hackerrank which has been a pretty good tool , I also am going through the ""cracking the coding interview"" book just so I can be better with a lot of the data structures/algorithm stuff.

At this point though, I just want a job... my dream job is going into something related to front-end, doesn't even have to be a faang I just wanna work with front-end or UI/UX, but I feel like I might have to just go back to school just so I can be considered for anything. I have thought about getting a second degree in Human-Computer Interaction, but I dont know if that will attract job positions for Front-end Dev...

I'm kinda at a loss here, is there anything I can do to help me land a job in the next 6 months? Should I try to connect with more recruiters? Should I go to more hiring events and hack-a-thons? Should I just go back to school and get my master's? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: whats best way to get a junior web dev job in 6 months? Do I need to get a master's?"

I wanted to drop off from Uni and start a different subject but I decided to go on. I am very good at my studies I have good grades and am actually a bit ahead of my study schedule. This crises went on for a few months but I thought it came to an end.

I thought that I maybe have problems with my mental health, and I probably do but I think nothing major. So I always come to the conclusion that Me and my work moral are the problem.

Does anybody have ever felt the same or has advice on this topic?"

I will graduate in February, and by then I would have about 1.5 years of commercial experience in .NET and Azure (normal work, not internships). I've looked at some job offerings, but what worries me is that basically all of them want senior developers (so essentially +5 years of experience). Is it even possible for a person in my position to find a job? Where should I look? Is there anyone here with experience similar to mine? I know that I would have to then apply for H-1b visa (which isn't that easy to get in the first place).

I wanna apply to us unis on this fall 22. From my childhood I decided that I will be a CSE engineer. But for the last two years, I started loosing my interest on CSE. I think I never loved hardcore programming. Last year, I started a digital marketing internship which ended in the middle of this year. During this period, I started loving marketing. Starting my own business, doing perfect marketing and banging success; I started dreaming like this. But in our country, you have to choose among 3 groups: science, commerce and arts. I have chosen science in my 9th grade. Because I love science. So I had no courses like marketing, accounting, management, etc. That's why I have no idea about the bba courses. Student who took commerce studied all these subject but they couldn't study higher mathematics, physics like me. So I have insecurities whether I can do well studying bba or not. Or studying cse will be okay for me. Recently, I heard about a course which is Computer and business or something like that. I loved the concept and started thinking about the course. What do you guys think? Should I study on this type of course? which unis have this course on us? I need unis which must have a good acceptance rate and aid or scholarship for international students.

In hs I didnt do as well as Id liked to have done getting a 3.7 uw gpa. I was majoring in cs and had choices of purdue, usc, unc, uwisc madison and a few others. I choose purdue but I sort of regret not going to usc and also want to aim for some t25s. Im a freshman and im doing well this semester and looking to get a 4.0/3.91 depending on how my math grade turns out. 

My main question is if I choose to apply transfer to schools this year and I get rejected am I still allowed to apply as a junior transfer? Or are you only allowed to apply as a transfer once per school? I say this cause if its only once I feel like id be much better off waiting and preparing. 

Furthermore, when actually applying am I allowed to put future achievements. For example, I have a few summer internship offers at f100 companies but I wont be able to start them till after the application cycle is over. Can i still include them? Thank you."

qa50ia,187,2021-10-17,The fact we've normalized working through school is insane and incredibly self-defeating. Adding REQUIRED unpaid internships to graduate is even worse. How can ANYONE defend this system?,NaturalRattle,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qa50ia/the_fact_weve_normalized_working_through_school/,"Since I graduated high school, I've had to work through school. First through college (living with roommates), then through prerequisites for grad school (living at home), then, finally, grad school (living in a studio on my own).

I'm 30 now and spent nearly my entire twenties pursuing some kind of education. I've been surrounded by people who also chose this road, and many of them come from families who are so wealthy they literally don't have to work through school. There are plenty of others like me, who come from middle or lower income families and have had to work the entire time, and the difference is *painful*. The former camp will have no or much lower loans (the biggest privilege), got better grades, experienced less burnout and mental health issues, and just generally didn't have to deal with the wildly self-defeating act of working all day to come to homework and studying for long hours. They ultimately had a much better quality of life. I've personally been burnt out for years on end and have no other options (excluding taking out more loans to foot living costs). Note I can't live with my family even if I wanted to.

I chose a road I ultimately regret daily. If you've ever wondered why mental healthcare is becoming increasingly inaccessible and classist, I'll tell you a main reason, as someone who works in it and studies it: a whole lot of clinicians these days come from major money, and many don't see an issue gatekeeping their profession to their fellow rich people. I'm currently a graduate student in Clinical Psych with the goal of becoming a therapist for children/teens. As of a few months ago, I have to work 12 unpaid hours per week (minimum) of a practicum internship - if I don't, I can't graduate. Coupled with my job (4 days a week) and classes (2 days a week), I think about dropping out every day, and found a similar sentiment/feeling of utter defeat in some posts on the psychotherapy sub (though, again, it seems that most pursuing this particular education road have some kind of privilege to get through, such as parents or spouses supporting them, or generational wealth \[I have several classmates I can think of with trust funds, and my school isn't even close to top tier\]). There's been a lot of dissent in recent years about how unethical unpaid internships are (e.g., only the wealthy can realistically make them work). The fact that they are alive and well in 2021 is baffling, but the fact they are *required* by certain institutions to merely graduate is insanity. These systems pay no mind to those of us who cannot live at home or be supported by others, who cannot take out additional loans for living costs (I had a friend in my shoes do this - it basically doubled her loans collectively), and need to work through school. People like me, who fit into the aforementioned categories, are expected to suffer through this dynamic, sometimes for years, ruining our financial and psychological health in the process, and turn around and say, ""It was awful and extremely difficult, but I got through it and so can you!"" I'd rather just...be paid a living wage for my labor. The fact that thinking this makes me seem entitled or otherwise radical in many spheres is indicative of how institutionalized our current culture generally is. It's also worth noting that a lot of people who do need to work through school either a) DO drop out despite being potentially wonderful additions to their field, which is extremely sad or b) take much longer to graduate, costing them a LOT more money overall. I'm in the latter category. Working through school has caused me to have to take slightly less units per semester which ultimately set me back years, collectively, from finishing my education. And that's added utter *teeth* to my loans due to increased interest.

My only recourse is a futile one - hoping from the bottom of my heart the majority of my loans will someday be forgiven. In the meantime, I am preparing for a life of debt till death while people sit and judge me as lazy or spoiled for expressing myself regarding any of the above, mindbogglingly defending this system. In general, I'd strongly discourage anyone from being like me and pursuing higher education...unless they can get hefty scholarships or come from enough money to foot both living and tuition costs. For the rest of us, pursuing a higher education in this era is ultimately an act of punishment I can't condone. We really need to do better."

How do I talk to my girlfriend’s sister about her mental health.,SleepyHungry718,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qa6c1c/desperately_need_help_how_do_i_talk_to_my/,"My girlfriend (20) has a mental health issue. She has anxiety, is depressed, feels empty, and feels dissociative. She has been struggling with this her whole life and I’m worried about her future. For the last 3 college semesters she failed most of her classes and if it continues this way she will not graduate college. I tried sitting with her to do homework together in hopes it’ll be easier but it is too overwhelming for her. She quit a good internship because it was overwhelming. Not doing well in school is furthering the anxiety and depression. 

She has a good relationship with her sister (31) and looks up to her a lot. The issue is that her sister doesn’t really believe in mental health issues and the few times she mentioned any bits of struggling her sister responds in “just try” “stop being lazy” kinda way.

I know her sister loves her and cares about her a lot but she doesn’t understand the seriousness of her issues. Over the past year, I tried convincing my girlfriend multiple times to try again to have a conversation about this with her older sister but she won’t because she’s afraid she won’t understand and get shut down. Not being able to confide in her sister is also affecting her a lot. 

Im the only person that knows the severity of my girlfriends issues. I’m afraid her sister might take offense to this coming from me or dismiss depression etc with being lazy. How do I talk to her sister about this to get her to understand the severity of these issues?

I’m very worried about her and her future and I’m note sure what to do. Thank you for any advice.

Edit: her sister is also her bestfriend. They have a good relationship and her sister basically raised her. My girlfriend doesn’t have insurance nor the money to see a doctor out of pocket."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
Your documentary shows that over the decades our previous notions of prehistory have been shattered by archaeological research and our understanding of prehistoric man has evolved a lot during the 20th century. Can you see our understanding of homo sapiens of this period changing much in the future? Or are we reaching the limits of what we can find out from scant burial sites?|This is a very difficult question to answer. We archaeologists always think that we are reaching the limits of our understanding but actually new discoveries are constantly being made and constantly showing that these limits are systematically being crossed. To take an example: certain regions of Europe are not at all studied (or very little) such as the Balkans, Greece and Turkey. And these were strategic regions for arrival into Europe so we can easily assume that we can make very interesting discoveries in these regions in the future. This is a geographic example. If we take an example of site-access we know that with the rising of sea levels, many palaeolithic sites are currently below sea level. So in the submerged areas near Spain, Italy and Croatia - there are actually hundreds of sites. These would certainly challenge the image we have of prehistory. -Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|Hi ! I'm sure that our understanding of Archeology will still evolve a lot in the future. Myself, I started to be interested in prehistory in 2003, and even since then it has changed a lot. New discoveries are coming out regularly. For instance, the fact that Paleolithic people had black skin only started to be known in 2015 thanks to DNA research! - Pauline
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Thanks for the answer. I understand that it must be a really difficult question. I'm really surprised that the Balkans, Greece and Turkey are not studied much. Wouldn't our interest in the classical world sometimes mean that prehistoric finds are unearthed when digs are made at ancient Greek or ancient Roman sites?|There are for sure some prehistoric artefacts below the ""classical world"" (because there are some everywhere in Europe in this time) but the digging could destroy old roman or greek buildings... and sometimes, prehistoric levels are a few meters under the ground, it depends of the stratigraphy of the place.- Pauline
&amp;#x200B;|It should be remembered that there is a lot of archaeology about other periods that are more ‘prestigious’ for those countries so prehistory has indeed gotten a bit left behind… -Jacques
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
This reminds me of an experience I had, as an outsider, with an archeologist, whereby they once explained to me how they were ‘leaving a site today for future studies when they have the technology’ and that really gave me a new respect for the scientific process involved.|Yes ! That's true ! I'm living in Perigord (south west of France) where prehistoric sites are everywhere. The first time I went there, I said : why don't you excavate every site ? They replied : to keep it for future generations of archeologists ! They only excavate places which are in danger (threatened by modern building...) not the others... - Pauline
Hi Pauline and Jacques, I have always been interested in archaeology as a child and now wonder as an adult, what is the best practical segue to enter into a profession in archaeology while being a holder of a university business degree? Thank you in advance for any tips and life hacks.|Hi, I started myself to be interested in Archeology (Prehistory) as an adult and I discovered that you could (in France) re-do some studies and also do some excavation (as a trainee) even if you are 35 years old or more. You could also work in a museum for example... But I don't know how it works abroad... Maybe Jacques could answer more ! - Pauline
&amp;#x200B;|The situation is not so different in Italy, Belgium, Germany and Spain. But, in England I think it’s a bit different. There are Anthropological schools and Archaeology is more aligned with Anthropology in Britain. - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|There are several possible avenues that you can take to become an archaeologist. In France the most classic way is to first study History with a speciality in Archaeology (since Archaeology often depends on History). However, in a big university such as the ones in Paris you can study Archaeology from the very first year. Afterwards, you can do Biology or Geology or if you are interested in a more ancient period. - Jacques
I hate to be this guy but I have to ask what do serious archeologists make of all this ""ancient alien"" stuff and about how a show about that particular topic managed to get broadcast on what's called the history channel? Have you ever come across anyone who believes that stuff personally and if you have did you do anything to try and talk them around?|Of course, no serious archeologist believes at all in these theories of ""ancient aliens"" !!! I never met someone who talked with me about that. In fact, archeological artefacts and science give us so many proofs that we don't ""need"" to imagine aliens to explains those facts !!!
&amp;#x200B;|When I read about these absurd theories, they make me feel that it is linked to people who say that they do not believe in the skills of prehistoric man or woman (and even for Egyptian people) and their very good old techniques. - Pauline
&amp;#x200B;|Thanks for your question. No, I have never come across anyone in my discipline who believed in that. -Jacques
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
What I find a little alarming about it is that it seems to have become quite popular theory. I dont like that the show on the so called history channel has lasted for so many seasons because that only means one thing, that it's getting a lot of viewers and ratings. Von Daniken is an obvious hack but a lot of people seem to be jumping on the bandwagon. I dont doubt that a professional archeologist wouldnt take these ideas seriously, I was more curious about any encounters you may have had with laymen who may have been influenced by these conspiracy theories?|Yes, that's a shame... I agree with you. It's not acceptable that the History Channel is screening fake news like this!
&amp;#x200B;|We are doing our best to do good documentaries to spread real scientific views!
&amp;#x200B;|And hopefully, there are on youtube also some people that are fighting very well against those conspiracy theories. - Pauline
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Hi Pauline thank you for this AMA. What do you think about the theories about Atlantis? One theory believes it could be a site off the coast of Portugal.|Hi, I'm sorry but I haven't worked on that period (it is really later than Prehistory ;) ), and I don't know about the current scientific theories surrounding that... Is it fake news or not ? Are there some real clues of something or not ? I couldn't tell you, sorry !
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
I’d imagine any theories about ancient civilizations would alter the definition of “pre-history” though right? Is there a particular date agreed upon for when “pre-history” ended? Or is it always defined in terms of the set of historical records we have?|The difference between ""pre-history"" and ""history"" is based on the invention of writing. Before it is Prehistory, after it's History because you could find some written elements to understand archeological artefacts.
&amp;#x200B;|So in the Word, prehistory ended around -3 500 years BC, with invention of writing in Mesopotamia. But locally it could be much later ! Like in France (Gaule in classic World) : History officially started with roman conquest in - 33 before JC.
&amp;#x200B;|If you think that way, there are regions of the world were there was no writing which came to History very recently !
&amp;#x200B;|Could you imagine that ? Funny right ? - Pauline
What are your thoughts on modern practices surrounding death, especially burial of caskets in concrete lined graves?|What is very interesting is that throughout history certain practices for the treatment of the dead do not leave a single trace for archaeologists . For example, certain populations put their deceased in trees where the corpses are progressively eaten and disappear completely. These mortuary practices leave absolutely no trace. But then there are other populations that put a lot of time and effort into preserving their dead, almost without limits. So you can see a sort of extreme inegality in these practices. For the future I imagine it will be the same (being buried in a concrete casket or otherwise). - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|It will be a clue for archeologist of the future as a mark of our times, in my opinion ! - Pauline
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Which populations had tree burials like that? All I'm getting on Google is tree trunk coffins used by the celts. :/|I didn't know about tree burial but I know that some Indian tribes put their dead on platforms made of wood, which doesn't leave any evidence many years later.
&amp;#x200B;|I also read an article about practices in South America where dead people were let at the top of mountains to be eaten by big buzzards... That kind of practice left no evidence of burial, but of course, it significant for these groups.
&amp;#x200B;|Our current practice of cremation - and the ashes left in the sea, for example, is another practice that will leave no burial evidence for archeologists of the future ! - Pauline
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|&amp;#x200B;
If they disappear completely, how do you know about them?|We just suppose it, linked to anthropology ! Because during very long periods of the Palaeolithic there were absolutely no graves at all ! Some before, and some after, but sometimes during like 10 000 years there was nothing! That's why we wonder what could have happened ? We speculate on the kinds of death practices that could have existed that wouldn't leave any evidence... - Pauline
How do you see DNA sequencing changing your field in the next few years? And secondly, how many cats are too many?|This is a very good question. DNA sequencing has totally revolutionised Palaeolithic Archaeology to an incredible extent. In 20 years we’ve had to almost completely revise our models of understanding. This is applicable for the last 30-40,000 years. It will aid us to be very clear in our analysis. To answer your second question - too many techniques and information are difficult to sustain clear thinking, you’re right. -Jacques
I have always been curious, in your experience how are excavation sites / archaeological digs funded? I used to think it was some NGO and get confused when I see archaeological digs online where the intern pays to join the program and wonder if that is how the dig stays operational?|In France there are two main types of funding. On the one hand it’s the Minister of Culture and Public Funding and the second is for ‘prevention’ archaeology where you do archaeology to see whether there is anything to be found beneath a road that will be built, etc. This is paid by the industry who is looking to construct on that site. - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|This is more or less the situation in Europe. But in the US there is a lot of private funding. There are also countries where private funding is present and important (in Spain and Switzerland, for instance). This also depends on the country's university research and legislation. The best system, I think, is the Scandinavian system - with its long tradition of public funding and university research. Plus, their museums are very well organised. -Jacques
Seeing as how even ancient humans have burial sites, do you think it is in human nature/ a primal urge for humans to just bury the dead? If so, what advantage do you think we gain by bothering to go through the whole process while most other animals don’t bother, evolutionarily speaking.|Thank you for your question. I think that burial is a significant sign of culture and not a primal urge for humans. There is no advantage, evolutionary speaking, to bury someone than to abandon them. So that means that those people cared, and maybe believed that it was important to do something for the one who dies. As we do ! Just remember that they are exactly the same specie as us ! They are Sapiens ! (Neanderthals also buried their dead, but not before) So their brain was the same, emotions too, and capacities of beliefs too. - Pauline
&amp;#x200B;|Very good question. Prehistorians consider a certain number of technical innovations as signs of progress and modernity. For example, the invention of a tool. The first tombs are one of the most important signs of modernity in humanity. For certain Prehistorians they consider that before the burial of the dead humanity was not actually ‘complete’. 100,000 - 120,000 years ago burial sites appeared for the first time. -Jacques
Do you think we are more similar to or more different from the major peoples you have studied?|It depends on what you study exactly. With neanderthals there is an anatomical or a physical difference of course (which make sense, in that they were present between 50,000 and 200,000 years ago). But, when I studied caves (dating back 25-30,000 years) these are people who are just like you and me, with differences to be sure, but mainly through their environment rather than cognitive and intellectual differences. - Jacques
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Thank you! As a follow-up, is your response about the people in the caves more of a consensus in the field or something that is still debated frequently?|There is no debate about who painted in the cave : they were Homo Sapiens as Jacques said, so exactly like us, morphologically speaking. The very few examples of neanderthal cave art are in debate, but it is not the case for all the discoveries dated after -35 000 years ago. (the majority of Palaeolithic cave art is between -40 000 to -10 000 years ago in Europe, when only Sapiens were living in that period) - Pauline
Hi! How do you balance the task of trying to interpret the physical evidence into some form of historical narrative, whilst trying to remain objective and avoid anachronism/biases?|Archaeology is a science so, like all sciences, you need to learn lots of references. You cannot arrive at an archaeological site and explain something without a minimum of amount of knowledge. Often we compare archaeology with surgery - no one would like to have heart surgery by an archaeologist (and vice versa - a surgeon cannot do archaeology). It’s a specialist job with its own codes and references, that you need to learn and that is what ultimately aids interpretation. -Jacques
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Thank you for your response!|You're welcome!
What was one of the most unique, interesting, or mysterious Palaeolithic burial sites you have seen?|Thanks to this documentary, I have been on the most interesting and mysterious Palaeolithic burial sites that I know ! (except the Russian site ""Sounghir"" where a Russian team shot for me).
&amp;#x200B;|But the Balzi Rossi Caves (near Vintimille / Menton on the Italian border), Dolni Vestonice site, and of course the Cussac Cave (the best maybe) are my favourite !
&amp;#x200B;|When I did my masters degree about gravettian graves (-34 000 to -24 000 years ago), I studied 82 buried individuals. When I decided to do a film about this subject, my co-author and the producers and ARTE.tv told me ""you have to choose"" ! So I chose my favourite, the ones I thought the most amazing!
&amp;#x200B;|But maybe the Sounghir site is the most unique burial site in all of the Palaeolithic period, due to the number of ivory beads and grave goods (such as weapons that were 2m long and made with mammoth ivory)...
&amp;#x200B;|For more recent examples from the Palaeolithic period there are beautiful sites with amazing graves in Perigord (south west of France, were I live now) : Child of La Madeleine (1200 shell beads for a 3 year old child), Lady of St Germain La rivière, Lady of Cap Blanc... (Prehistory Museum of Les Eyzies) - Pauline
Do you think that your work mores so proves the existence of the Abrahamic God or disproves it?|In my opinion, it is not related. The purpose is not to prove the existence of God or not, but to explore archeologic artefacts to understand our very old past and human peoples that lived long before us ! Yes, science could prove that human life started much longer ago than the Bible says, but does it disproves the existence of God ? I don't think so. Everyone is free in their religious belief. - Pauline
What is the most difficult archaeological dig you've been involved with, and why?|For me it was, without a doubt, the cave of Bruniquel, in the south-west of France. It was a very hard cave to access technically and physically and also difficult to study. Everything about it was difficult and complicated. On the other hand, there are also sites that are difficult to study but are very easy to access. - Jacques
What are your thoughts on the seemingly degrading level of technology used in Ancient Egypt, as laid out by Graham Hancock's Fingerprints/magicians of the Gods, if you're at all familiar?|Never heard of him either... But all the people who tried to do links between stars and sciences are generally linked to fake news or conspiracy theories ! What they think, is based on nothing ! - Pauline
&amp;#x200B;|I'm sorry I'm not familiar with Graham Hancock's work, could you please re-phrase your question? - Jacques
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
What I have seen is that many scientists disparage challenging theories from the fringes without ever confirming or denying them for themselves, which of course is completely unscientific. Scientists have a very bad habit of not looking at challenging evidence, because of their presupposition that ""it can't be true so there's no point in looking into it."" So they make judgments on something they've never looked into, which is completely unscientific, and since none of them are looking into it, it stays on the fringe. Eventually some of the stuff breaks through and yesterday's ridiculed theory becomes tomorrow's accepted fact.|I try as much as I can to be open minded to all these ideas. I try to verify for myself some theories about stars or sunlight, sunset, solstices... For Neolithic (megaliths) there is evidence, for sure. But before, in the Palaeolithic, not at all. No link (as far as I can see) between stars and cave art. Only in rock art or megaliths - but as I said this is in the Neolithic period... not before. Except (for Palaeolithic) maybe some ""calendars"" can be linked to the moon : a bone engraved of small dots found in Dordogne in Abri Blanchard https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Abri-Blanchard-Dordogne-France-Archaeological-Museum-Photo-author_fig1_233529986
&amp;#x200B;|So yes, keep your mind open and listen to these theories, but many many times, it is just imagination of their authors.
&amp;#x200B;|- Pauline
Prehistoric human existence is assumed to entail short, savage lives, where copulation often equalled rape, and the strongest male ruled by brutality. My personal research paints a drastically different picture: egalitarian groups, where each member was valued, and resources were shared. “Civilization” seems to have brought at least as many woes as improvements. We’re taught human-nature is to be greedy and hoard, yet, my study of prehistory, and my experiences, lead to the conclusion that human nature is to work on behalf of family and community, contribute, and learn. Is 98% of human history drastically misunderstood, or am I missing something?|It's actually the opposite picture: Prehistory had a reputation for being egalitarian but now we understand them as having had hierarchies and various other forms of inequality. I recommend you watch Pauline's documentary as it is exactly about this issue: https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/097508-000-A/the-nobles-of-prehistory/?cmpid=EN&amp;cmpsrc=Reddit&amp;cmpspt=link
&amp;#x200B;|I agree with that too ! - Pauline
&amp;#x200B;|Dear Broomiester, I quite agree with you : old cliches of "" short, savage lives, where copulation often equalled rape, and the strongest male ruled by brutality"" had to be forgotten because it's just based on XIXth archeologists theories and our views have involved a lot since then ! (my first documentary about prehistory ""Looking for Sapiens"" is about this evolution of our vision : https://heritagetac.org/programs/2020-lo3mp4-85fa25)
&amp;#x200B;|But on the other hand, we couldn't be sure of your version of "" human nature is to work on behalf of family and community, contribute, and learn"" because artefacts leave no proof of this way of living...
&amp;#x200B;|Of course I prefer your way of seeing them ! It is closer to mine !
&amp;#x200B;|But my real thoughts is that we are talking about a duration of 30 000 years (when there were only sapiens and hunter-gatherer in Europe) and a very large space of thousands of km !
&amp;#x200B;|So what I really think, is that the most probable way to see them is to have a vision of diversity of practices. Some tribes were maybe ""greedy"", others ""hierarchical"".
&amp;#x200B;|Some maybe ""matriarchal"" other ""patriarchal""... (why not ?) Some violent, others pacifists...
&amp;#x200B;|You just have to look at present-day humanity to figure out the diversity of the past !
&amp;#x200B;|The only real difference is that they were a lot more numerous than us, so less competition over territories... I guess. - Pauline

I am very excited to watch your docs, and to have been introduced to your work! Got very interested in prehistoric humans in the early 00’s, and it was astounding to discover how little we know. Thanks for doing an AMA, and spreading your work.|Thanks a lot !!! - Pauline
Hey Pauline and Jacques, thanks for doing this. What you have highlighted is a bit like the #metoo of archeology. How were the reactions in the sector on those findings on the presence of female power in paleolithic times?|Hi, in fact, Mr. and Mrs De Lumley found that the Lady of Cavillon was a woman in the 1990s... so archeologists had time to figure it out ! But this information was never really in the spotlight in the media and that's why I wanted to show it in a documentary. But as the movie said, we are not sure of power and status of these buried people (male or female). They could had been buried for others reasons... - Pauline
Hello and thanks for doing this AMA. What are your thoughts on the era of the Neanderthals? How long do you think they made it before going extinct? My hobby is studying this period of time and AFAIK the last ones lived in Portugal, but this stuff seems to be in a constant state of change. Was it 40kya? 25? Also, what do you make of the two very recent discovery of new species of Homo? I’d imagine more of this is coming due to climate change. Do you concur?|The question about the extinction of Neanderthals is the only question, today, which has still not been resolved. We have an enormous amount of lot of knowledge about Neanderthals - but no definitive response as to their extinction. There are many possible explanations but these also differ according to different regions of the world. So, there could be a difference between Portugal and Russia, for instance. What is clear at this stage is that there is no sole reason, but several reasons, for their extinction. - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|In terms of your second question, about the findings in Israel a couple of weeks ago -this is too recent for me to make a statement on - it’s too premature. Plus, ‘new species’ is a bit of a buzzword in archaeology ! - Jacques
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Agreed, it’s kinda early to be declaring new species. I’m thinking that one of them may be a Denosivan, wouldn’t that be something. Anyway, thank you for the responses, and as always, thanks for all that you do!|Thank you! Very kind.
Hi! Awesome AMA - I've always been curious about how much time pre-agricultural people spent ""working."" Like, how much time on a day the average person spent doing something directly related to survival. With such an advanced cultural/religious life, I'd guess that people (or part of the population) had a substantial amount of non-survival work time. What does your work tell us?|Yes, you're right. To go further (if you don't already know his work) you could look at Lewis BINFORD's ethnographic works about Inuits and comparisons with archeology. And also Claude Levis-Strauss' works.
&amp;#x200B;|https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Binford
&amp;#x200B;|https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss
&amp;#x200B;|Hunting and gathering left a lot of time for non-survival works (such as taking time to make beads, body ornaments, but also maybe ritual practices ?...etc).
&amp;#x200B;|But you have to remember also that everything was made by hand so it takes time too ! (all clothes, so a lot of work to make leather from animal skin, sewing, making tools... maybe baskets...) And also yes, some people may have been specialised (for example in knapping flint to make stone tools)
&amp;#x200B;|Current or recent tribes of hunter gatherers helps us to understand very old cultures with a similar way of living and their rich inner world.
&amp;#x200B;|Pauline
What was the most important discovery in your personal careers and what was the most important / exciting discovery that happened in your lifetime?|The biggest discovery was definitely the cave of Bruniquel, but from an emotional as well as a scientific and aesthetic point of view it was the Cussac cave which made the biggest impression on me. - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|I'm not an archeologist, but a film maker, so I couldn't really answer your question... But I could say that the most important discovery I've filmed is Cussac Cave, which is of course in the documentary, and also recently the Montaigne grave (a French philosopher of the XVIth century). It's not sure yet that this grave was his, but it was amazing to be with archeologists during the digging (September 2020, and November 2019) - Pauline
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Just giving us the names of caves isn't telling us why or what, which is what we actually want to know here.|The cave of Bruniquel where Jacques did some research is very well-known because these are Neandertal works (-70 000 years ago) : a very strange construction of a circle made by stalactites in a very hard-to-access place deep in a cave. It is absolutely unique !
&amp;#x200B;|A very nice documentary was done by one of my colleagues, Luc-Henri Fage : ""Le mystère de la grotte de Bruniquel"" recently which won a lot of awards. I think you could find it in english version. The title is something like : ""The Mystery of Bruniquel's Cave""

When there are opposing archaeological theories, how is the decision made as to which is the 'final current' theory that makes it into the text books in schools?|Perhaps this is a slight variation to your question but there is a danger for us, Prehistorians and archaeologists, with creationism. This is not so developed in France but in certain countries it is. Here, what is taught in schools respects scientific advances but usually with a lot of delay (10 years or so for certain discoveries). There is definitely a delay between science and society. Where we have difficulties is with opposing theories such as the creationist arguments. - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|In terms of opposing archaeological theories in general, frankly we're used to this in our field! - Jacques
&amp;#x200B;|Very good question ! (maybe more for Jacques who is the ""real archeologist"", I'm more of a film maker)... In my opinion, what I think is when a theory is shared by a large group of archeologists, you will see it being taught in schools and books. It needs to have been verified on a large number of archaeological sites. When it's impossible to decide between several theories, you have to mention all of them. In fact, it depends if it is easy to prove, scientifically : for example, old time climate is very well known and for sure very cold, but we may never know what was the purpose of people who painted in the caves... - Pauline
I feel like many Hollywood films and video games have fantasised this idea of ""tomb raiding"" or ""grave robbing"" to the point where we don't see it as a serious issue. So I'm curious, how much of a threat exactly do grave robbers pose to modern day archaeology? Are they any examples you know that us laymen may not know about, but should ? Thanks for doing this AMA, by the way. I'm really enjoying the insight.|I feel like many Hollywood films and video games have fantasised this idea of ""tomb raiding"" or ""grave robbing"" to the point where we don't see it as a serious issue. So I'm curious, how much of a threat exactly do grave robbers pose to modern day archaeology? Are they any examples you know that us laymen may not know about, but should ? Thanks for your question!
&amp;#x200B;|In terms of prehistoric graves, I don't think that there are/were robbers ! (there is nothing of value for your time (no gold or silver... only shells and flint !) - except for archeologists !). As far as I know, Egyptian archeology still has some problems of grave robbers...
&amp;#x200B;|And another problem is people with metal detectors that destroy information for real archeology (for historical period)... The best thing to do when you make a discovery is to talk to an archeologist (or a museum near your home) to tell them : it will be much more useful for human knowledge, than just to put a beautiful object on your shelf ! - Pauline
I used to think of prehistoric communities as insular non trading tribes, but have seen some stuff about trade routes that covered moat of the connected world. how did these trade routes function without writing or currency - was it all barter ?|Yes, we have a lot of evidence of that ! We're quite sure that ideas, people and artefacts travelled for long distances (200 km, maybe more...) and spread knowledge, technology, beliefs, objects... And yes, barter was used for a long, long time before currency and writing. They were all hunther-gatherers before -10 000. So they travelled a lot. - Pauline
Hey Jacques and Pauline! Thanks for doing this AMA! I will be traveling to the British Isles this fall seeking out ancient burials and megaliths. Can you recommend me some of your favorite spots in that area? I know you’re mostly based out of France but I thought that I would ask. Thanks!|Hi ! Thanks for your question ! There is a very well-known palaeolithic grave found in Britain, it is called ""The red lady of Paviland"" (but it is a young man !) and it was the first paleolithic burial found in 1823 if I remember well... It is around -33 000 years old. So around the same period (gravettian) as the graves that we talked about in the documentary.
&amp;#x200B;|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lady_of_Paviland

How often do archaeologists find grave goods, and do the grave goods confirm or challenge Western notions of strict gender binary?|About strict gender binary, we really have no information at all. About grave goods in general, for paleolithic, yes it is often but not systematic. Some have flint (used or not) with them, and others have objects sometimes : figurines of horses (Sounghir), ornaments, bone points (Lady of Cavillon), sometime needle (in a child grave - no gender found), weapons...
&amp;#x200B;|No evidence of differences between men, women or children. Some have evidence, others don't. In english, you could learn more with the excellent work of the archeologist Paul Pettitt :

So, when do you think people started populating North and South America? I’ve always thought there was initially a west coast coastal population, any evidence for them is now under water though. Is there any way to find evidence of human habitation on the near continental shelf?|I know that all evidence of the beginning of populating of North and South America is definitely on the west coast, and maybe -20 000 / 17 000 years ago (or before according to new theories), or later -14 000... There are several theories and studies are still in progress. But yes, there is evidence (Clovis point for North - 14 000...) I remember there was a problem because the oldest evidence came from South America, even if we know people came from Bering land bridge...

This is a really interesting topic and it's not often we get to talk to someone with your expertise. What I am really curious about is boats. From my very limited reading, it seems like the peopling of the Americas happened really quickly in terms of how people were dispersed. The time it took to get from what is now Alaska/Canada to the southern tip of South America is so short from what I've read. Do knowledgable people think that maybe sea travel, at least along the coast, was involved as well as walking in terms of dispersal across the continents? That also kind of makes me want to ask, do we know just how old are boats and seafaring are? No worries if you don't get to this, but if you do, I am very curious about your answer!|I remember that yes, boats along the west coastline, is one of the most plausible hypothesis to explain how they get from north to south so quickly... But the oldest boats we found in archeology are much later... (of course it is wood, so the conservation has not been very good !) I think there is one example in Mesolithic (the last period of Palaeolithic) around - 10 000 years ago, and much more in Neolithic around -5 000 (canoe, ""pirogue"" in french). Some of the neolithic canoes are visible in museums.

How do you feel about the claims of the Native Mounds at Louisiana State University being the oldest man made structures known in existence? They’re dated to about 5500 years old, but some suggest that they’re more like 10,000+ years old.|Hi thanks for this information. I didn't know about the Native Mounds. All that I know is that the oldest structures made by man are in Terra Amata in Nice (evidences of hut) which are 400 000 and 380 000 years old and the Lazaret cave (evidence of huts and fire) 130 to 170 000 years old ... and of course the strange structures of Bruniquel (Neanderthal -70 000)...
&amp;#x200B;|But it depends on what you mean by ""structures"".
&amp;#x200B;|I had a look on the internet about Native Mounds; they are quite similar to megalithic structures in Europe (tumulus, Neolithic - 10 000 to -2 500). So its seems possible. (why not ?) Very interesting indeed ! - Pauline

I recently got contacted by a recruiter about an entry level role at a big bank where the role is more finance oriented than data analysis oriented (tools used according to the recruiter are excel pivot tables, vlookups, etc.) The manager of this role is willing to take new grads and train them to perform the role.  


Should I take this entry level role since it appears somewhat related to data analysis, and build up experience to be able to transition into a more traditional data analyst role, or should I stay on the job market and keep improving my skills until I secure an entry level position in the analytics field?"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

Currently a second year uni student. I finally moved up to my uni after my first year in quarantine, but holy fuck did shit hit the fan quickly. When I was in high school, I was used to taking a high workload and busting my ass off at school. I was a typical over-achiever with so many accomplishments under my belt and with my life and mental health in pretty good shape. Now that I'm in college, however, I feel like I have no control over my life anymore. After my first midterm in which I got my first not-so-good grade, I feel like I understand nothing in the class anymore despite never missing a lecture. I feel like such an idiot for not knowing what's going on but I really just want to get a good grade. I'm sure that with a bit more studying, I will yield better results, but it's so hard not to compare myself to others and make myself feel like a dumbass. I go to office hours and I try my best, but when I'm alone trying to apply what I learned, all my stress and anxiety become so overbearing that I physically cannot function and just start to cry and I honestly don't know what to do about it. Maybe it's because my uni is pretty competitive and practically everyone I've talked to has a 4.0, but I actually feel like I shouldn't have come to my uni and that maybe my acceptance was a mistake, which I guess now that I'm spelling it out is imposter syndrome.

Secondly, I'm having major identity issues. I came from a very diverse city with practically all cultures, but now in my current uni, my race is *actually* an underrepresented minority. The only real people I've talked to in my language are the cafeteria workers, my apartment janitor, and the homeless woman begging for money with her children down the road. I feel like such a foreigner. I've experienced being the only URM many many times before, but it was tolerable because I would come home to a loving family and support group. I come from a three-generational home where my aunts and uncles and their families are within a 10-minute drive and all my closest friends live within the next three blocks. Coming home from a very isolating day at school to a lonely home makes me feel like absolute shit. Maybe it's because I have no one to relate to or who I've connected with, but I've been having such a hard time making friends. I've only really talked to about 3 people I feel kinda comfortable with, but they all have really large social circles that I feel clingy for having to ask them to hang out with every time I'm lonely. I'm not used to having no friends or people I could at least talk to, and this loneliness is started to decay me from the inside out.

The worst part though is my fear of disappointing others (and myself). I'm the oldest child from a family of immigrants, the first on both sides of the family to go to uni, and the only adult female so far not to get pregnant at 18. I'm so scared of being considered a failure by my family and friends back home, so the pressure has really been on me to lock in a good internship and start thinking about future job prospects. I have no idea where to start though. Applying to internships while trying to juggle midterms *and* being a functioning adult has been such a hell hole that no one could've prepared me for. 

Now here comes the complicated part. I can finish my degree within the next school year with no problems. I can even tack on a small minor I'm also practically done with. I would be able to move back to my home area and be back in an environment I truly feel comfortable in. My concern is job prospects. Would limiting my last summer to 2022 hinder my ability to find a good job? I hope to break into HR and find a good job within the sector, but one less year would mean one less internship, aka less time to network and build my resume. Money isn't necessarily a concern for me, so staying another year wouldn't hurt me financially, but I'm scared of my mental state only getting worse. The more I'm on campus sometimes, the more isolated I feel. It's gotten so bad to the point that I constantly feel like my hair is going to fall out and like I'm going to hurl and I have no idea what to do. Anytime I try to work on something, I simply cannot function. The pressure gets to me and I feel so suffocated and alone and I think I have what is considered a mental breakdown. Would staying another year help me in the long run, meaning I should just suck it up and move forward? Are these feelings just fleeting and will it all feel better once I get through the semester? Someone please help :'))

Sincerely, a struggling college student"

3) FB has been receiving a lot of bad press and i don't know if an internship there will be viewed negatively in the future

qai4xk,2,2021-10-18,Need to get my shit together,cheesyrhy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qai4xk/need_to_get_my_shit_together/," I have never been so lost and confused in my life to the point that I hate myself. I'm trying so hard not to go down the rabbit hole of ""I'm not good enough"". Because if I do, I'm pretty much paralyzed.

Okay, to begin with, I'm 24/f and I recently graduated from art school and I'm an aspiring animator(2D). I say aspiring because I still feel so far from the goal. College was amazing but I seem to have lost my focus somewhere along the way. I ended up focusing too much on my boyfriend(now ex) in the past year. I had dreamt of being in the art/design field since I was 15. In high school, I was that artist kid who knew exactly what I wanted to do. There was never a thread of doubt. I was an average student in school and I always knew that whatever I do, I have to work hard, be it an artist or an engineer, or a doctor. But with animation, I found something that I actually wanted to work hard for. I instantly fell in love.

But the past year has had me questioning that love a lot. When I was younger I wanted to do something that would make a difference to the world, social work essentially. The desire to do something that makes a difference is still there. Still strong. In college, I learned how to combine that desire with art. But last year made it painfully obvious which professions actually make a difference. Sure enough, I just stayed home wallowing in self-pity. And as I said I focused too much on my relationship(2 years long). It's like I wanted to be was his girlfriend. When I went back for my final semester, I was really excited to explore my love for art again. But early on in the semester, I had a conversation with my boyfriend about my lost love for art and he put me down for having a negative attitude and made me feel like I hadn't prepared enough for the final semester(which I realize now, was not true). For whatever reason, I carried on that self-resentment I got from the conversation for the rest of the semester. Albeit, I don't blame him for my attitude for the rest of the semester. I should have tried harder to get out of it. I ended up with a final project that I'm not too proud of(because it's not complete).

I finish college in June. We end our relationship because didn't want LDR. Little did I know, ending the relationship would make me realize just how much I've been holding myself back. I thought that ending our relationship would get me down because I lost him. But honestly, it got me down because the rose-colored glasses came off and I realized just how much of myself I lost. In simple words, I felt like shit. I still do. I hate how much I let a relationship affect and control me. There is a lot of myself that I lost but I won't get too much into it for this post, I want to focus on my passion.

As an artist, I have to constantly improve and keep practicing. And just never stop. But I stopped. for 2 years. And that is the main reason I ever questioned my choice of work. Because I had made little to no improvements. I was stuck. And now I'm not good enough. I'm not where I should be to be able to work in this field. I refuse to blame my ex or my relationship for this. This is all my doing. I kept dreaming big and doing nothing.

When I finished college, I decided to take some time for myself. It was a big change and I just wanted a breather. So I didn't even try to look for a job. And it was during this time that my rose-tinted shades came off and I went deeper into the rabbit hole of misery. I hated(hate) myself. Because at the end of the day I have no one to blame but me and my laziness.

I spent the past four months trying to work on my portfolio, improving skills, and/or just sitting and doing nothing. Unfortunately, I spent more time doing the latter. I developed a habit of daydreaming. I'd just wake up, get ready and just sit and daydream the whole day. It was the only time where I wouldn't feel awful about myself. And I got lost in my head. It was a few weeks ago that I realized that I'm lost and having a hard time getting out. There are times when I just end up not moving, and before I know it, it's been days/weeks/months. Some days I'd wake up and I manage to do some work. But if you look at it as a whole, I spent the majority of my time just sitting. So basically I spent four months daydreaming, I felt paralyzed.

I realized that I love what I do. What I want to do. This is it. I love animation and I can't even imagine doing anything else because I don't want to. The past week I tried harder to get out of my head. And for the most part, I've succeeded(I think). I started some online courses. And 2 days ago, I got a rush and I mass applied to several places for a job. It was 2 am, I was exhausted but I really just wanted to apply. Unfortunately, most of the applications were sloppy and full of careless mistakes. I copy-pasted some cover letters and forgot to edit them for some companies(so now, some places have a cover letter that says ""we spoke on the phone earlier"", even though I haven't for most of these places). God, what a mess. Then yesterday, I tried to apply for an internship at a studio that I've loved and looked up to for a long time. And I just got a reply saying that my work needs to be better and I need to improve. And they told me to work on it and apply again. And while I already knew this, I'm crushed, to say the least. I'm not even good enough for an internship?

As I mentioned earlier, I don't want to go down the rabbit hole of ""I'm not good enough"". I can't afford to feel paralyzed for another four months. While it's painfully obvious what I need to do now. I'm ridiculously terrified. I'm panicking and feel stuck again. It's like I've been drowning for the past four months and I didn't even know it and I've suddenly woken up in the middle of the ocean with no life vest. Even though I know how to swim, I'm too terrified to realize that and I continue to flap my arms around like a moron to stay afloat. I don't want to reach land just by flapping my arms around, I want to swim there. But my mind is too fogged up. I'm so lost. Honestly, I don't even what direction to go in. I know where I want to be but I don't know how to get there. Okay, I'm just rambling now. Heck, I think this entire post is a ramble. I'm sorry about that.

Well, I'm not really sure about what I'm asking here really. Maybe, just...help? Where do I go from here? I don't know. I just hope that once I post this, I don't go back to my bed and get lost in my head again."

So it had been about a year since I started to be more social and trying to stop being an introvert. Finished my degree early this year and started off working as an intern, a recruiter.

I know for a fact that this job is not a good way to start for an introvert (correct me if I'm wrong) but I wanted to try and crawl out and stop being an introvert. It was going great and awesome until 2 months ago, I started to feel forced and pressure when I need to call a candidate, anxiety creeping into my brain and I keep finding myself creating a reason to not call any candidate, it is bad, very bad.

I even switched to 2 different companies after my internship which all of them doesn't last long at all and now I'm stuck, I'm not sure what to do, what's my next step. I thought I can get away from being an introvert swiftly but nope, he is back.

Also where is the best place to find jobs at a start up. The only feasible approach I can think of it looking ayt a VC firm like bolderton's portfolio and just looking through there websites for jobs. There must be a better way though.

To give you a brief overview, this is what happened to me.
I was participating in group competition last year. We had to do certain tasks related to programming. 
It was a group of four people including me (3 males+1 female). I was the only female member of the group. I was awkward seeking for help ,but I still did try to ask for help from my members for the tasks. It just so happened that unfortunately my computer crashed twice and i had to get it repaired. At this point I was giving up and started to ignore doing the tasks .(it required a computer).I also felt very anxious to ask them to tell me more about the work because I felt my self esteem sink. By the end of it my group finally made it to the end and become one of the runner ups. In one part of my mind I was grateful their efforts made them reach there,but on the other part I was ashamed that I did nothing to contribute to this. The competition also provided internships to students who reached the final stage.
Since I had no contribution I felt that I didn't deserve it. I let go of that opportunity, which I don't regret.

Fast foward to now ,I've been very anxious and letting go of many such opportunities because I'm unable to console myself from the fear of being judged and rejection.I cannot for interviews which I've been called for multiple times.
 I've lost the confidence I once had in myself. It's so very disappointing because I've won prizes in other competitions last year. I've been a good student academically all my life. This whole year all I've done is look down on myself and cry alone. I tried telling my mom that I've been feeling this for a very long time. I've wasted 10 months just loathing. I haven't grown or built myself as a person this year at all.I had so many plans this year of improving myself by building technical skills and knowledge to build my career , but everything is at a standstill.

My mom said I need to calm myself down. So I did. I went out and chilled. I went played VR Games with my cousins. Visited the expo 2020. But I can't seem to be happy. I feel burdened by being happy. I go out showing people how happy I am and my enthusiasm makes my little sister smile. She wants to hangout more with me. But I cannot.I ignore my friends invitations to go out too.

I've been contemplating a consultation with a psychologist but my parents aren't very keen on the idea when I brought it up once.
I don't know if its a mental health issue or I'm just oberthinkng it.I haven't told anybody in this detail except you all in reddit."

This year I graduated in my bachelor's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science degree with a 1st class classification (highest possible in the UK). I then spent the summer doing an internship for my University where I worked with a small team on a laboratory automation project. It was really interesting cutting edge technology and my supervisor valued my contributions enough to have me named on the research paper that was produced as a part of the work, which is something that I'm really happy with and I feel is a good career boost. I then applied for master's study in microelectronics at the same University in order to continue my education, this is because my ambition for the longest time has been to work toward a PhD. I am now in week 4 of this course.

Meanwhile, my former internship supervisor passed my name on to a colleague who was looking for part-time developers for his automation and robotics startup, and I got this job and now do this alongside my master's, working as a ""Junior Automation Engineer"". I am on £19k a year (pro-rata ofc) which I believe is slightly on the low end of what I could be earning but I am also happy with it as this is an extremely rare opportunity for me to be able to do part-time engineering work that's flexible around my university schedule. I've not been able to find another company that can offer something like this. Also, my new boss has mentioned to me that they have the scope for me to do full time work should I want to during holidays, and even to potentially transform this into a a full time position after master's. 

Now here's my dilemma. I'm really enjoying this job, and I've come to find through my internship and this work that I love and thrive in getting stuck into work and being able to research and work quite independently producing real useful work. I am also not enjoying my master's as much as I thought I would be. It's okay, and I think I'm pretty good at academia, but I'm rather tired of doing boring repetitive lectures and uninteresting cookie cutter exercises. I am at a prestigious university yet it still seems like most lecturers don't care to create an interesting learning environment. Additionally, I have some personal struggles with the course. I have always struggled with anxiety, particularly in lecture halls and classrooms. I struggled through my first year of my undergrad, and then I feel as though I was somewhat saved by COVID. Now my master's is back in person and after a year and a half break I feel like I'm struggling more than ever with my mental health here.

I'm not sure what to do now. Part of me is considering dropping the master's and trying to move into work full time. My worry is that this would cut short my ability to pursue a PhD in the future, as well as future earning potential. I just want to hear perspectives of other people and any and all advice is appreciated. I just feel like I'm struggling a bit right now with what I should be doing and what I want to be doing in life."

First time poster. I'm in university doing computer science at the moment and I volunteered to do some data entry work.

I'm having to put in approx. 4-5 hours a day which, on top of uni and work (which is already insanely busy), is extremely challenging. Now I'm not a data science student so it's not relevant to my major, and i've already got an internship lined up so my question is: should I make the sacrifice and do this data entry volunteer work or should I just drop it?

Essay Abstract: My Commonapp essay discusses my upbringing in a conservative, heteronormative &amp; homophobic community through a streamlined metaphor &amp; anecdotes. It also discusses my experience of living in 2 places, one urban and one close to qualify as rural. Additionally, it discusses the financial hardships my family has had to face and hobbies that I didn't mention in the rest of my application. To conclude, the main essence remains about me finding myself in a diverse world that stands against me.

Demographic/Additional Info: My course includes Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (Including Calc.), English Language &amp; Lit along with Computer Sciences. I took an open course at the University of Pennsylvania during the Summer of my Senior Year to get certified by UPenn &amp; UNICEF on 'Social Norms'.

From what I see is that they initially start with a bootcamp and then a 2 year contract with one of their clients. They're similar to FDM but maybe with a slightly better salary. For the 2 year contract, I'm wondering what would happen in case I need to leave? Do I need to pay any penalty? I'm also questioning if this would be seen as a good experience to have on my cv and whether or not it would open up doors for developer jobs or would it pigeon hole me into consulting jobs.

However When I went to take it I felt like I was completely in over my head. I am taking a DSA course offered by my college this semester, so my experience in Data structures is mediocore. I have a few personal projects primarily involving javascript, and backend development. And the only work experience on my resume is volunteer work. Should I halt my internship applying in order to spend more time focusing on DSA, Leetcode, and other Computer Science skills. Over will the lack of having any internship/relevant work experience by Junior year put me at a serious disadvantage for applying for jobs and future internships down the road.

qatazt,18,2021-10-18,Help with College Decision,MidnightFerret123,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qatazt/help_with_college_decision/,"I (recruited athlete) have to make a decision between two schools soon. I like both schools a lot but am indecisive about which one I should choose. I want to major in engineering and want to have very good career-building opportunities. Below are the main factors

School A: Georgia Tech

\- Very high-ranked engineering program (my current intended major), large focus on engineering/tech

\- The athletic dorms are very nice, each person gets their own room, has a living room, showers, etc.

\- The campus is scooterable, and commute to classes &amp; sports facilities is very easy

\- In a big city (Atlanta), which I personally like, both for things to do and potential internships

\- I would be able to drive there and have a car

\- Facilities are very nice

&amp;#x200B;

School B: Duke

\- Very high ranked school overall, not only in engineering, students major in a larger variety of things

\- Sophomore, Junior, and Senior dorms are nice, but still with a roommate &amp; communal showers/bathrooms

\- Commute would take longer, freshman year I would have to ride a bus between campuses for practice as opposed to a 3 minute walk

\- It is more selective than GT, and has a better reputation or ""curb appeal"", because it is ranked higher than GT

\- Because of the selectivity, I've been told that I'd meet many interesting/driven people while I'm there

&amp;#x200B;

My main worry about going to Georgia Tech is that if I chose to pursue something non-engineering (most likely will still be in the STEM field though), I will not get as good of an education/as valuable of a degree as I would from Duke. Also Georgia Tech doesn't carry the allure of being a top 10 school.

My anxiety about going to Duke is that 1) Commutes will be longer from the dorms, and the dorms aren't as nice, 2) Durham is a smaller city, whereas Atlanta has many large companies willing to offer internship positions

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty adaptable, so I'm not going to *dis*like either school, I just don't want to waste a good opportunity."
qathp5,2,2021-10-18,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/18/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/qathp5/weekly_job_qa_thread_10182021/,"Hi all,

Here is the ninety-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

Plus, my situation has affected my mental health.

Anyway, because of my struggles with ASD, here is my life situation:

\- I still live at home. Housing is beyond expensive in my part of the world.

\- I have two college diplomas but am struggling to move forward with my career path despite this.

\- I work part-time at my dad's place (Warehouse and occasional office work) because I'm struggling to find a job in my field. I'll admit I don't apply to a ton of jobs but almost every entry-level job seems to require five years of experience. Most of the ones I do apply for don't get back to me or reject me. I had an interview over a month ago, but I didn't get the job.

\- I would network, but because of my social struggles, it is hard to. I've tried connecting with people in the past couple of years, but some eventually stopped responding to me. I recognize that networking is crucial these days to find a job, but it's hard for me.

\- I worked at a grocery store a few years back for over three years until I quit in time for my online internship and for the end of college.

\- One of my diplomas is in journalism (From 2019), so I do contribute to one online magazine a couple of times a month and have my own blog, which has autism-related content in it. The only problem is, I struggle to make my site more popular and to actually find a job in my field. One of my dream jobs is to be a magazine editor.

\- I've never had a girlfriend, and I'm still a virgin. I really want one, but almost every girl I know is taken. The last time I confessed a crush to someone was over eight years ago but that ultimately led to the person blocking me on social media (I'll admit I was a bit clingy and socially unaware at the time, so I kind of deserved it), which crushed me for quite a while. I learned from the experience, though. Since then, I've been terrified of asking girls out, even if on dating sites. I have lots of female friends/acquaintances, some who have even been flirty with me in the past, but it doesn't get past that. I'm convinced that few girls will like me because of my autism, and I barely even know any women on the spectrum.

\- I go through lots of anxiety, particularly in unfamiliar situations. I'm no stranger to anxiety and panic attacks.

\- I don't have a license (I've been scared of driving for much of my life). My dad says I don't need one because Uber is far cheaper. My parents are also concerned about my safety. The thing is, though, it will be much easier to find a job and a partner if I have a license. Women want a man who has made lots of progress in their life.

\- Money isn't a huge issue for me as I get government support due to my disability. Plus, I make a decent amount at my part-time job. Still, I wonder how much of an issue this will be when my parents aren't around (They're in their late 50s, so they still have lots of time to go). Even with money, I still want to feel like I've accomplished a lot by working, which I haven't.

\- When I notice others' progress (Married, engaged, having kids, own home, working full-time, driving to cool places), I can't help but wonder if that will ever be me.

\- Outside of these issues, I have strong interests in weather and playing the piano. I engage in these topics frequently when I'm not working or writing.

I'm not suicidal or anything, but it scares me knowing that my life could possibly be the same 10 years from now, even if I try to make improvements. I know many people on the spectrum are in a similar boat, but I still feel like I'm capable of achieving more than I have. I mentally feel like I'm still a teen.

If you have any advice, feel free to give it to me here (No rude comments, please). COVID has enhanced these difficulties, but I still feel like I would have these problems even if it weren't for the pandemic."

Recently attended a keynote presentation at my school.

Main topic of conversation was that we should be focused on either starting our own tech company or we should be focused on joining a growth company (no where with more than 250 employees).

The speaker admitted he was speaking in absolutes, and there are exceptions to every rule but he said that working at Google, Amazon, any big FANG type company is going to lead you to be unhappy because there are just less opportunities to learn compared to a [growth type of company](https://breakoutlist.com/).

He further said, ""no one will care if you have Google on your resume, it's about what you did not where you did it that matters.""

Up until this point I largely agreed. Working at bigger names as an intern I have found that often the 40 hour work week is more like 20 or 30 hours of work and then 20 or 10 hours of doing whatever I want. This has been made easier by all my internships being remote but I have seen similar memes and jokes about this same idea in general. I have found that I can only maintain my sanity during these times if I own my growth and set goals to learn more about a specific technology or work towards goals outside of work whether in the gym or in other hobbies.

I can see how his point of working somewhere where the company is growing and growing fast would eliminate this and force all employees to contribute all 40 hours rather than having this ""free time""

I disagreed with this point here though because I feel the prestige of having FANG on your resume is going to get your in a lot more interviews than otherwise. Once you're in the interview I agree with what he said as it doesn't matter if you work at Google if all you did was basic work etc.

I am largely posting this to see this subreddits opinion on if having FANG on your resume is better than having Series E companies like Gusto, Stripe and also if it is better than having more medium sized companies like Notion, Rippling, or any from the link above?

Im only a Junior and am trying to see if I am blinded by ""prestige"" or if that is really a real thing."

Next semester, I will have to do a mandatory unpaid internship (very common in Belgium, should be illegal but it is what it is).

So I got two interesting offers. One is from a company digitalizing documents for knowledge workers. They have a product where they classify incoming emails, send them to the right persons automatically using machine learning. This company is a so called scale up. Basically they left the start up fase and have begun to expand to other countries.

The other is a very small start up with like 10 people working there. They accumulate coordinates from users from certain apps. With those coordinates they do all kinds of cool shit like determining to what stores they go, what mode of transportation they use. They apply algorithms on this big data and visualize it so customers (supermarkets and all kinds of stores) can analyze their performance vs their competitors.

Now, I really don't know which one to pick. The first one will probably let me work with tensorflow and do my own thing. The second one just seems really interesting in what they do. They will also let me do algorithms and big data stuff. The second one also has some really smart people working there. People with phd's and years of research experience.  I wanna do a masters as well so working with these smart people seems like a big plus to me.

Is it a dumb idea to go for the smaller one? Can anyone offer me some advice?

So far, I've only been fixing minor bugs in a couple different projects, but it's been pretty challenging at times, as I'm not used to reading other people's code or to following the flow of things in larger projects. I feel like I'm learning a lot, but I've also been having quite a bit of imposter syndrome, feeling like they'll realize I'm a fraud or something and shut down any chance at a future job. 

I know I have a tendency to be hard on myself though, so I'm trying to just enjoy it while it lasts and hopefully manage to do well enough that they will want to hire me later on. 
I do have a couple of questions for anyone who read this far though:

1. How long does it usually take to get into the flow of things at your first internship/junior dev job? 

2. In your experience, do companies hire people as juniors even if they've had a rough start and have on occassion asked a ton of questions? 
Objectively, I think I've done pretty okay, but I would like to hear from others anyway, I think it might help my anxiety a bit to be honest."

So a little bit of backstory, Im a professional bartender, but few things in life (covid, and being little burnt out at current restaurant) pushed me to persuade a programmer  career. I was always good computer wise - working on Linux/MacOs/Windows, I know my way around some technical stuff in terms of computers , how they work, hardware, software, a think more than regular average human in that department. 
From teenage years I was intrigued by programming but I didnt had a chance to give it more thought until summer last year, but February 2021 was a time when I started doing some tutorials and wrote my first lines of code.

Last few months gave me a moment of clarity that I want to become a python developer, not only to earn money but to have an opportunity to develop my skills. For me at this level working with code is something really interesting, fun and creative and I want to be able to translate my app ideas into working and functioning code. 

In last 2 months I did my share of YT tutorials and classes, from understanding objects, loops, if conditions, pandas, little bit of ML, regular expressions and computer vision. Little bit of GUI programming with PyQt5 as well as some extra basics of Django/Flask, HTML and Javascript. Im also doing Codewars ( 7 kyu ), and trying to fiddle with how to process restaurant data with help of python.

Whats next?

By January 2022 I want to become an intern/ junior full stack developer. Like I said I have a profitable job so money for a start isnt as big objective for me ( but I dont want to work for free as well ).
Sooo question time! How do I get from current point to getting first job as a developer? I know hiring someone with no professional experience is difficult but I thought that in my free time I could create something of a ""portfolio"" of code on githut and link it with my CV so my future employer could see that I have basic logic and knowledge required for work.

Any more Ideas? IT seems totally different than Bar Industry so Im really at deep waters but I dont wanna give up and succeed in this crazy career change.

I was always good computer wise - working on Linux/MacOs/Windows, I know my way around some technical stuff in terms of computers , how they work, hardware, software, a think more than regular average human in that department. From teenage years I was intrigued by programming but I didnt had a chance to give it more thought until summer last year, but February 2021 was a time when I started doing some tutorials and wrote my first lines of code.

Last few months gave me a moment of clarity that I want to become a python developer, not only to earn money but to have an opportunity to develop my skills. For me at this level working with code is something really interesting, fun and creative and I want to be able to translate my app ideas into working and functioning code.

In last 2 months I did my share of YT tutorials and classes, from understanding objects, loops, if conditions, pandas, little bit of ML, regular expressions and computer vision. Little bit of GUI programming with PyQt5 as well as some extra basics of Django/Flask, HTML and Javascript. Im also doing Codewars ( 7 kyu ), and trying to fiddle with how to process restaurant data with help of python.

Whats next?

By January 2022 I want to become an intern/ junior full stack developer. Like I said I have a profitable job so money for a start isnt as big objective for me ( but I dont want to work for free as well ). Sooo question time! How do I get from current point to getting first job as a developer? I know hiring someone with no professional experience is difficult but I thought that in my free time I could create something of a ""portfolio"" of code on githut and link it with my CV so my future employer could see that I have basic logic and knowledge required for work.

Any more Ideas? IT seems totally different than Bar Industry so Im really at deep waters but I dont wanna give up and succeed in this crazy career change.

Do u guys have any ideas where to begin my professional way as a developer?"

qayzk1,18,2021-10-18,Is it possible to transfer to an T10 from a cc?,sweatedduck34,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/qayzk1/is_it_possible_to_transfer_to_an_t10_from_a_cc/,"I am currently a freshman attending a California Community College studying computer science. Through high school I didn't have the best grades and had a 3.5 but failed a class but took rigorous courses. I currently have a 4.0 and plan to keep it all semester. I'm taking a full course load right now and will take classes over the winter and summer. I have good extracurriculars and have an internship lined up for this upcoming winter.

I was wondering how hard it would be to transfer as a sophomore applicant? The schools I was looking to apply to would be NYU, Cornell, Penn, UChicago, etc. but my top choice would be NYU. I imagine I wouldn't have a very good chance considering I didn't have the best high school GPA. Would applying as a junior transfer be better in my case? I read somewhere that schools accepted more sophomore applicants because they would be at their schools for longer periods of time. My alternative option would just be to transfer to a UC school like ucla or berkeley. Also would it be better if I applied as an undeclared major because CS is a very competitive major to get into? Thank you hopefully someone can help clear this up for me :) also ignore the grammar errors lol i typed this fast"
qazooq,31,2021-10-18,How do you prepare and get that new job when feeling overwhelmed and defeated with your current job?,s0cksey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qazooq/how_do_you_prepare_and_get_that_new_job_when/,"Seriously, how? I've read so many posts on here about how to get that second job, how quitting the first to get the second is obviously a bad idea, but I don't know how some of y'all can get yourself interview ready while getting your ass kicked at work. 

Some insight: 3 years at current company and they're my first ""real"" software engineering job. Went from intern to full-time hire to tech lead. Feeling like I still lack a good amount of technical knowledge which I'm guessing is only getting worse in my lead role since I barely write a line of code anymore. As you can guess- I'm frustrated, exhausted, stressed and over-it in my current position and I miss writing code so much.

 Anyway, enough with the complaining, I want to get a new job and stop shooting myself in the foot.  


Any tips on-  
1. Effective interview prep/study while also working full-, if not over-time?  
2. How to effectively handle the anxiety and stress that comes with the interviewing while juggling an already strenuous job?   
3. How to communicate to interviewers that I do *not* want to lead going into my new job without sounding like a bad candidate?"
qb04ta,55,2021-10-18,I've been having some issues and I think it's too late to recover.,throwhawei,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/qb04ta/ive_been_having_some_issues_and_i_think_its_too/,"I've been having issues academically for a while. I don't know how long I've had these issues but I'm noticing it more than ever now. It's extremely hard for me to focus or be motivated. I'll sit in a lecture staring at the professor and notice I haven't been paying attention for the past couple of minutes, dozens of times per class. I'll watch a recorded 1:15 long lecture so I can pause and rewatch parts I missed and it'll take me at least a couple to a few hours even at 1.5-2x speed because I'm constantly having to go back a few minutes because I lost track of what the professor is saying. I'll be pulling out my phone or opening a new tab or standing up to go to a different room or just doing or  thinking of random bullshit vaguely connected to what I was listening to and I don't even notice it's happening. I'll read and reread textbook passages because I just don't remember what I just read. 

I've withdrawn from every course I've taken the previous two semesters and I'm failing all my current courses. It takes me so long to do the homework, I watch and listen to the lectures and I just can't remember things well and I've been forgetting the foundations required to understand what's going on in the courses I'm currently in. It feels like it's a circular cycle where I'm just spending more effort and just failing harder. When I was going slowly and wasn't able to take full course loads cause of requiring new prereqs from a major change I felt like I could do it. It took me longer than most people I noticed but I thought I could. Now that I'm trying to take a full load or close to it I realize I'm incapable. I don't think I'm fit to be a computer engineer.

In January I realized I had been having issues with memory and focus. I would forget simple things constantly. I had also been having a difficult time controlling my emotions for a long time. I randomly cry and I don't know why. I'll cry over things that aren't that sad. I sometimes get angry at things that I have no reason to be so angry for. In addition to some physical symptoms this led me to go to the doctor. Turns out I've had a severe hormone imbalance for a while. I've been taking medicine for close to 6 months now. I thought things would get better I would be able to focus and remember things better and I would be able to perform in college.  If anything these issues have stayed just as bad or gotten worse despite the medicine.

I'll lay down and feel this immense pressure of the looming deadlines and other thoughts and just not do anything when I have multiple assignments due. I feel like it doesn't matter because I'll get failing grades anyway. It doesn't matter because I do the work but I don't understand it. If I somehow scraped through I wouldn't be able to land an internship. I wouldn't know the bare minimum for a career. I'm on academic probation and I know I'm going to get kicked out of school after I don't meet the 2.0 this semester. I'll then have to start paying off loans as soon as I'm not actively enrolled. I'm in debt and I won't even have a degree to show for it. I moved into dorms to be able to spend as much time as possible on campus but I'll have to leave those too if I'm not enrolled. 

I wanted nothing more than to graduate from UCF and make something of myself but I don't think I'll be able to. My parents who have sacrificed and struggled so much all their lives will have invested so much time and effort into someone who couldn't even make it when he had all the support in the world. In a couple years I'll be 30 and I'll have barely accomplished more than I had when I was 18.  


Sorry for this long winded rant/essay. I'm just feeling sorry for myself and I hate it. I feel like yelling as loud as I can and I guess I'm doing this as an alternative. I feel like no matter what I do I won't be able to succeed."

I can barely compile a list of 150 companies that take interns. 

Do people just apply to as many Fortune 500s as they can? Do all of them even have software engineering internships?"

qb57v6,1,2021-10-19,Should I assume I was ghosted or should I be patient?,JoseANS,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qb57v6/should_i_assume_i_was_ghosted_or_should_i_be/,"I (21 M) matched with a guy (28 M) on Tinder, the day was Saturday, October 9. We started talking at about 1 pm and ended our conversation at about 5 am, and I enjoyed our conversation. The next day, on Sunday, I messaged him through the app at 1 pm and he answered me at about 6 pm (I don’t remember very well), we talked until it was dark at night I believe. On Monday, I sent him a message at about 6 pm and he answered at 10 pm, he said that it took him so long to answer because he had 2 jobs, so he worked  all day and got off at 10 pm; we talked up until 2:00 am because he had to go to sleep so he could get up to go to work the next day, at this point I started to kinda like this guy. The rest of the week up until Thursday I set an alarm clock at 10 pm so that I can message him through Tinder right around the time he gets off of work, and every day we talked until 2-3 am. After all the ours of conversation, I became invested in him.

First, I will give you some context, we are from Mexico and he is a doctor (I am a med student and still have 2 years to go). In Mexico, after you finish med school, you have to serve one year of social service, and then you do one year as an intern, after that, you get your degree. The thing is, that after that you can either work as a general doctor or you can compete for a residency in the specialty you want. In order to get into the residency, you must take a 450 question test called ENARM which contains questions about every speciality, but in this case you don’t pass the test by getting a certain score, but by comparing your results with the rest of the doctors that applied for a residency in that year. Depending on the speciality, there are a certain number of “spaces” allowed, for example, last year there were only offered 5 spaces for the speciality of Legal medicine (meaning that there were only going to accept 5 people nation-wide to get in this speciality in the year), compared to the 3,582 spaces offered for the speciality of Family medicine. The one who has obtained the highest score in the exam can get to choose for any of the 27 specialities available, and then the next higher get to choose, up until all the specialities are filled up. The specialities that most people want to get into are General Surgery, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, which means that they are the hardest ones to get into because they will be the ones to fill up first, so you really need to get a high score to get into them. As you can imagine, this is very stressful (I’ve even had nightmares about this exam).

The thing is that when he got his degree at 24, instead of applying for a residency, he went and worked in a mine as a doctor for 2 years. After those 2 years, he presented the exam the exam but didn’t get a place in the speciality he wanted (which was General Surgery), so he decided to try again this year. He studied a lot for this exam (a whole year) and was very nervous about getting a place in General Surgery, he cared about this a lot and worked very hard for it. It was very important for him.

The last time we talked (on Thursday), he told me that he was extremely nervous because on the next day he would find out  if he got a place in the residency or not. I gave him my phone number and told him to call me or send me a message at any time he wanted so I can offer him support. After I gave him my number, he told me “Oh thanks, I was about to ask for you phone number because I was about to close the app”. Just before ending our conversation he told me “Hey, if I don’t pass the test, I will close everything and shut down for some days, so don’t worry, that’s just how I am”, I told him that everything would be alright and went to sleep. I didn’t ask for his phone number, I just gave him mine.

The next day, when I checked for him in Tinder, his profile wasn’t there, so I assumed he deleted the app, I got kinda nervous, but trusted that he would message me when he got out of work at 10 pm. He didn’t message me in that Friday night, so I got scared and thought that maybe hi didn’t get a place in General Surgery again. I waited for him to message me on Saturday at 10 pm (he also works on Saturdays) and he didn’t message me as well. I had the hope that he would message me on Sunday, because we had said that we should meet on Sunday (but we didn’t set a time and place), so I hoped that he would at least message me to tell me that he wasn’t in the mood for us to meet, he didn’t message me.  At this point, the thought of him ghosting me crossed through my mind, but I also had hopes that he would message me on Monday. I imagined that he would’ve thought to take this weekend for himself to mourn.

The thing is that he didn’t message me again this Monday.

He did told me that he wouldn’t talk to anyone for some days, but when should I move on?
I mean he might have lost my number and can’t contact me. Maybe he is still sad and will message me later. Or maybe he lost interest and won’t message me again. I didn’t ask for his number, so the only thing that I can do is to wait for him to message me.

I know that we talked for a few days, but I do care about him and I want to know if he’s alright. He is kind and we got along well. He also told me that he was interested in me.

Do you think that he will message to me? How long do you think he will take to message me? 
Or do you think that he ghosted me? When should I draw the line between being patient and wait for him and assuming that he ghosted me and move on?

Please be honest and don’t give me false hopes.

TLDR: The guy that I was talking to told me that he would close everything and shut down for some days if he didn’t pass a very important exam, he hasn’t talked to me in four days and I don’t know if I should wait for him to message me or if I should assume that he ghosted me."

I currently intern for a company and have had some great experiences here, I'm still learning a lot of things. I'm a beginner sysadmin with very basic knowledge, still in college where they don't particularly teach us much besides active directory and redundancy.

The company currently wants me to figure something out and I can't seem to do it. So, what they want me to do is change the ""Other user"" text on the Windows 10 log in screen to ""Office"". The computer is joined to a domain, and ""Office"" (other user) should log into the domain.

The reason behind this is that it's a laptop meant for working from home too with normal users.

I've already tried this from spiceworks: [https://community.spiceworks.com/how\_to/140751-change-other-user-text-on-windows-10-login-screen](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/140751-change-other-user-text-on-windows-10-login-screen) and it didn't work. I've already tried searching for more solutions, to no avail.

That aside they said I could make a static user listing that logs onto the domain by default with the name ""Office"" if that isn't possible.

I was wondering if anyone here could help me with this?"

I see a lot of  jobs posted on LinkedIn for juniors or interns, but never saw in the job description that they will sponsor a visa for internationals.

People think it's easier to learn at comfort of home, it's not, at-least for me. therre is just so much distractions, family members giving household work, siblings disturbing, internet connections in 3rd tier city, and mainly ME using reddit in background. i have no idea where time flies by. I feel f\*\*\*ed.  I regret taking BSc, i had no good options due to multiple reasons. I regret a lot of things. All my life I went with flow of life, where ever i was kicked, completely chilled, but now that i see my father retiring just few years after my college will be over, i am very anxious.

**Now** \-

Things I am interested in - ML/DL/AI stuff, data science, Cyber security/security engineering. (and i dont like Web development btw, i know it has a lot of job and scope, but i wont really enjoy it. but maybe i would if its the best way out for my situation.)

thing is. I dont know. Anything. How to get my sh\*t together, how to get started, anything about things i am interested in. Will i even get a job with how i am and a BSC DEGREEE!!? My family and relatives often make my think about the choice i made. 

1. What should i do? Focus on my degree, getting grades? how much do they matter?
2. Should I do certs course? from where, what platform has best value NPTEL or something else?
3. How am i even going to get internships when i feel like i have no skills??
4. Also What should I do my masters in? MSc MCA? should i even do masters? I thought of doing msc earlier, but am struggling to even find college/courses. 
5. What languages should i learn? ones i wanna learn.. or maybe ones that pay. Which one have high paying demand?

I feel so useless and anxious that I cant even remember more questions.

You you went through my post, i am sorry for low quality post/questions.

And Thank You"

qbb0d4,7,2021-10-19,Is the real life software engineering same as you learn at tutorials?,coloneleranmorad,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qbb0d4/is_the_real_life_software_engineering_same_as_you/,"Hi. I'm a mechanical engineer who has decided to learn programming and become a software developer. I've been watching tutorials and doing exercises on Java for months. It's going pretty well although I sometimes struggle to understand some things and that makes me wonder one thing about this industry because I sometimes feel like ""Do I really need to know this? It seems useless and not practical""

I don't have so much experience as a mechanical engineer as well. I've worked only for a couple of years in three different companies but from my experience, you almost don't apply anything you learn at school in real life. In fact, you do exactly what you're not supposed to do according to your professors at university because what you learn at university is actually the right way to do anything but in real life, you are in a rush and you need quick and practical solutions for everything and mostly, those solutions are technically not perfect but they do the job.

So I'm wondering if it's the same in software industry. Do you really do things that are not actually recommended but they work?

Since I'm posting this, I have some other questions as well.

How often do you get projects like they give you headache, you don't understand the issue, it takes so long to solve it, etc.? Is the job mostly like this or more repetitive?

Is the copy paste myth true? You know the good old ""What people think software engineers do/What do software engineers actually do"" videos. How true is that? Is the job really mostly just googleing and finding solutions, then copying pasting or really digging each issue and finding different solutions? I am really curious about how a software developer or engineer spends an average day at work.

How long do you think it takes to be at the level where you can work as an intern? Of course this depends on a lot of things but just a rough idea. The reason I'm asking this is because I had an interview with a company for an internship position about two months ago and I've been learning programming only for three months now. So my interview was literally at the beginning of my journey and my knowledge was quite poor but they gave me a second chance. They told me to upskill myself for a couple of months and once I feel confident, I will let them know and we will have another interview. Once they see that I have improved a lot and I have the right skills, they will give me the job. It is an intern position and it basically only requires Java and SQL skills as it is a back-end position. So I've been working on my programming skills for three months and either watch tutorials or do exercise almost everyday, at least 5 days a week, two hours a day. I feel like I'm not bad at basics at all but I almost can't solve anything on leetcode or hackerrank without looking at the solution. I can get somewhere but it's almost never flawless. Sometimes, I have no clue how to do it. So I check the solutions or watch the solution videos. I learn new things on each challenge basically and I feel like there is no limit of this. You can keep learning forever. There is so many things but this is an intern position. As long as I understand what they are talking about, I should be fine, isn't it? Do you think I should give it couple of months more or take the risk? Since this is my second chance, I don't want to take any unnecessary risk but not being able to solve leetcode and hackerrank problems is not helping my confidence. Is that normal for a beginner or most beginners solve those challenges quickly? Other than that, I'm able to create basic programs such as calculator, atm, number guessing game,etc. basics."
qbbj1i,1,2021-10-19,Which direction to go?,__dont_mind_me_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qbbj1i/which_direction_to_go/,"Dear community

This is my first post on reddit - I've been reading the resource for a while, but never posted anything myself. Apologies if I break any rules

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, lately I ever so often start to think about the direction I can or should go, and in addition feel insecure about my skill set. 

**Academic background**

* My first degree is theoretical physics (from Ukraine)  
While it does sounds fancy, the reality in many Ukrainian universities is this: science is not the hottest shit, so it's easy to get in - and also relatively easy to get good grades even without studying too much (or at all - once you are known as a ""straight-A"" student)  

* Afterwards I moved to Germany and got another graduate degree in finance and risk management.  
Here I still in many cases took the path of least resistance and mostly took electives in economics (not hardcore financial math / optimization)

While studying I did a couple of internships at a big German bank in portfolio risk management.

  
**Career so far**

1.

My first job was semi-successful: a small banking risk-management consulting, who actually needed someone experienced, but I've convinced them to give a try and eventually failed :D which resulted in me receiving no bonus at all in addition to potentially wasting 1.5 years of my life. But hey, experience.

At this point I understood that classical banking risk-management, in particular as consulting, is not something that I want -- too much internal politics, too much dull regulatory stuff.

Here I have solid experience with SQL, VBA and advanced Excel (no laughing, please - I had to do really complicated formula-based shit), plus intermediate Python. I also know a thing or two about quantitative economic analysis, financial markets etc. My knowledge is definitely more broad than deep - ""jack of all trades"".

2.

I then moved on without much trouble to a more IT-ish role as a business analyst at a more software-oriented consulting firm, still in the banking domain.

Here my technical skills, in particular SQL come in handy. But the lack of inspiration from regulatory topics compensate this :)

Still, I move within the firm to a couple of less hardcore back-office projects and do some classical agile Business Analyst stuff (requirements, user stories, the works). It actually makes fun for the most part. I'd say, my technical skills help me understand the developers better :D and also to easier deal with more ""technical"" requirements

Here, for the first time I work in Scrum teams, learn how to write good user stories, work with Jira, etc.

3. (**current**) - also, I'm 30 at the moment

Now comes the next move, since consulting gets old - being away from home for 4 days a week isn't really good for any kind of relationships.

So I find a place at a corporate startup where I kinda fit quite well exactly because I can handle a wide range of topics. 

For the first time a job actually feels right

*  I'm helping our technical guys deal with prototypes in the pre-sales, doing some python and bash scripting
* I select the contractors and later act as PO when we rebuild our website, including writing some of the content
* I do technical-ish solution design for some of our integrations with customers including desinging API payloads

&amp;#x200B;

**Worries, questions**

When I look around, I see that most people are already quite specialized (PMs, developers, etc). Whereas I am still this jack-of-all-trades character who knows a bit about a lot of things. For example, I don't really know what position to apply for if I were to change jobs. I also feel that I've taken too many shortcuts in my career and this is starting to manifest itself.

Do I just have the mid-life crisis too early? :D

What would you advise me to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

* \- Korean 
* \- Graduated from American university with a bachelor in psych
* \- Attended 6-month coding boot camp that mainly focused on Java along with the general full-stack stuff
* \- Currently doing a 3-month internship at a small company (# of employee &lt; 30) that specializes in natural language processing and chatbot with Rasa framework. This company also has a team that also does some regular web dev work by using Vue.js and Spring.

 I've talked to my friend who's working as a senior front-end developer in NY and he said that focusing on JS along with other currently-popular back-end language will land me a job in America more easily than focusing on AI &amp; Machine Learning. 

Before attending the boot camp, I had no prior knowledge of software engineering and along with the start of this internship, this is also my first time learning Python, algorithms, NLP and etc. So I'm still newbie af regarding the both career paths.

My internship ends in November 30th and this company is about to start working on this big project that will result in nation-wide distribution of the final product. My boss has expressed a couple of times that he would like me to keep working with them but I don't know whether I'll also participate in web dev work once I'm finished with Rasa deployment that I'm working on right now. 

My goal is to eventually get a developer position in USA. 

Right now, I can only think of 3 possible options that I can do:

1. Stay in this company, accept the full-time position and keep digging into NLP &amp; Machine Learning
2. Stay in the company but express my desire to participate in web-dev work
3. Leave and look for a new full-stack developer position. 

Which do you think seems like the best option for me to choose to achieve my ultimate goal?"

Frankly, until recently I never considered leaving the security of the government but now that I am, I’m thrilled but anxious about the seemingly endless possibilities.

I have considered contracting, as a lot of my friends have moved onto. But what else is there? ( there’s a ton but it’s overwhelming)

I am currently in the application process with many of these firms:

1. What is the best strategy in terms of managing the recruiting timeline? For some of the smaller places, they want to know details of my other applications (and sometimes would speed up/ slow down the process depending on my progress with other larger firms). Is it best to be transparent about all the applications or not share details? For some places, I hypothesize that having competing offers can increase probability of getting an interview or having a faster process, so mentioning that I am waiting to hear back from other places (instead of not sharing details) can potentially be advantageous.
2. When negotiating salary and exploding offers (assuming I get more than one offers), what is the best strategy? I want to be prepared if I am in this position soon."

qbf7hr,5,2021-10-19,Doubts on internship,Pariston,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qbf7hr/doubts_on_internship/,"Hello, quick background first: I am 30, on my 5th and last year of CS degree. I'm pretty late because of life trouble that led to me starting late and having to work (not cs-related jobs) while studying. 

I have been contacted by the HR of an important company for an internship and I assumed that they had looked at my profile before contacting me, which, along with a few questions on my known programming languages during the phone interview, led me to believe that I'd be in a software developer role, which is my desired career path and THE stuff I worked towards during these long years, towards which I also developed a passion I dare say. I may lack practical experience and not know what are the state-of-the-art best practices, but I feel competent and can I feel like I can learn anything with the notions I learned during my studies.

With that said, the company is trying to insert me into this department that is mostly dealing with server setup (upgrade from physical machines to virtual to save costs, machines that need to manage networks and connections from the little I gathered) and whenever I mention programming I get comments such as ""yeah that's a useful skill to have"", which implies that that's not at all what I will be learning (or doing).

My dilemma is the following: the company is pretty important, is serious and has some very good values, I really like the idea of working here. On the other hand I have no preparation and frankly no interest in what they are training me to do, to the point I get almost sick thinking that the bulk of my studying won't be of use. 

I know this might sound whiny and I realize that work isn't always about what you *want* to do, and I don't even know if this is the sub for this kind of questions, but this situation is really tough on me mentally right now and I could use some advice and guidance from a third party with more experience.

Thanks."

It might really be me just emotional right now.

Anyway, I graduate in 2 months and like everyone else graduating soon, I am now looking for a job and have been applying to many places. I think I have around 200-300 applications now over the past 3 months. I have had multiple interviews now as I mentioned before.

I feel very depressed now and I do not know what I can do to improve my chances of getting a job offer. Every time the interviews go well and the interviewers love that I know so much and have so much knowledge of web development, both frontend and backend. They love that I have a project that I implemented OAuth2 authentication on the server, end to end encryption by myself and that I know all of the Linux commands and latest technologies in use there like Docker.

But, at the end of the day, every interview I do, they always come back to me and say that they went with someone that had more experience than me even though that candidate do not have as much knowledge as I do (I know this information due to recruiters). Literally last week I had an interview with Cisco where I nailed everything perfect and they were joking around with me and explaining everything that they do at the job, you know like when they want to offer you the job. Nope, three days later they hired someone else that knew less than me because they had graduated already. 

I didn't get lucky like everyone else where they had internships, all of my internships got cancelled last year because of COVID when I was a junior. I'm working at this teaching job, teaching Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and C# for the past 2 years in January. I also am like a pseudo-manager and I manage the internal system we use that run Linux and deploys various things using docker, and I help maintain a few of website using Spring.

Now it is like at the back of my mind as I apply to 10-15 jobs each day now is that I am not good enough and I probably don't deserve anything.

qbjhvc,1,2021-10-19,Being Forced To Major In Comp Sci,TransitionPleasant,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/qbjhvc/being_forced_to_major_in_comp_sci/,"Hello Everyone,

F20 Here. 

I hope this post finds you well. I just want to rant about a few things. My parents sort of forced me to major in Comp Science. Before I went off to community college my father asked me what I wanted to major in and i told him that I wanted to major in fashion and he shunned me for it and said fashion majors does not make money at all and killed my dreams. He suggested me into doing computer science because he believed that I could excel in that field since he saw me as a technical person. Once I finally transferred from my 2 year to a 4 year, I took my first computer science class I had no prior knowledge what it actually was ( I though it was the idea and knowledge of computers not programming. I broke down the first class because I saw everyone working and making it seem so easy and for me it was not. I knew from that class that I was not going to like computer science and I was in a lost spiral of what I wanted to do I was stuck. I told my sister and my mother on how I did not want to major in computer science because I did not have any interest in it nothing against the major it was just not meant for me; they both said that how am I supposed to make money then because if I choose any other major it would be unsure if i would get a fulltime position. I feel as if my father wants me to major in computer science because he can brag to his friends on what I am doing; for example: my told our family friend about how I am doing artificial intelligence and how I am building machines which is not the case... I hate doing this to myself and i feel as if i am living through my parents eyes. Recently I have done a internship at a company and I hated it so much I could not get anything done because I was depressed and wondered why I was doing this in the first place.  What I love to do is Photography, Art, Music and it has been doing okay so far. . My father will not listen to me when I say i dont want to do this he responds in saying ""well how are you going to make money you have to do it"" i am so lost, I am currently a senior about to graduate next year I just really need some advice at this point."
qbjy9s,10,2021-10-19,I am quitting my job at Holland &amp; Barrett!,boilingpoint3,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qbjy9s/i_am_quitting_my_job_at_holland_barrett/,"I never thought that all those stories from retail could be true, but they are. In september I started working part-time at Holland &amp; Barrett, a company that specializes in tea, supplements and organic treatments. It seemed pretty idyllic at the time: 20 hour weeks, three days a week, which was perfect because on Wednesday afternoons I teach music. I am a musician and obviously it takes a lot of time to write, record and rehearse the music with my two bands.  


I started off kind of not knowing anything and soon got too many responsibilities shoved on to me way too soon. My manager expected me to be able to do the accounting, open and close the store almost immediately. I asked her to show me it more often, but she just said I needed to learn it by myself, resulting in me closing the store by myself and working late because I had no idea what I was doing.   


She also asked me that if there were emergencies that she could call me up on Wednesdays to open the store. In H&amp;B you have to work at least three hours for a shift which means I had to do 9:15 - 12:15, eat lunch and bike to my music classes for 4 miles to get there and start teaching. Not too bad but still not preferable because then I would lose time for making music. I specifically told her that I'd only like to do it when someone couldn't get there.

My manager has to manage a store in another city as well so she's not in our store full time, this made that I couldn't always count on her teaching me things and that I was in the dark about so many things and didn't get any codes to get in certain accounts and that I constantly had to call her for it. Often she wouldn't pick up and I'd be staying late calling other colleagues to help me fix shit. She's always talking about targets and complains when we don't get get our targets.

Flash forward to the beginning of October and in the break room she addresses that she and her colleague saw that I was scratching my skin a lot in the store. I have had eczema since I was a child and always pay about €70 or more for lotions that help, but they contain cortizone so I cannot take them for a long time. My manager asked that if I had to scratch myself that I do it in the break room because it doesn't look hygenic in front of the customers. I told her I couldn't control it, that it's a medical condition and that I scratch myself unconsciously, that stress makes it worse and that it often keeps me from sleeping but she just responded with 'I hope you don't take this personally.' I was speechless but let it happen.

Then a couple weeks back an older colleague (the one she gossiped to about my 'unhygenic' scratching) has to go to the ER because she had a heavy hernia. This was your typical pro-work person who always bragged about working hard, but she had been limping for weeks. She is now on sick leave for six weeks and my manager has been on vacation since last week until next Monday which makes that there's only two employees who are able to open and close the store (student workers aren't allowed to). Last week I noticed that I had to work five days instead of three, I had to open on Wednesday (I specifically told her three times I didn't want to), I had work extra hours that I was never told of, I had to take care of a student because another manager took an intern from our store and had her work at another store in a different city. If I hadn't noticed that the student was alone on the shift ending then she would have gotten into serious problems. The intern quit effective immediately because she had to work too many extra hours and now the only two colleagues that are left able to close the store are me and another colleague. They have taken another employee from another city to close tomorrow's shift. But I have fallen ill since today and cannot work.  


I am so tired of all these changes, all this shit, I don't even make €12/hr. I have had to deal with way too much responsibility and I'm only a new employee. That manager should take her responsibility and find a new manager for the other city so she can give me a proper training. She also shouldn't take time off when there's someone on sick leave for six weeks and we're only with one experienced other employee and two beginners (now only one beginner).   


My colleague who has supported me enormously is a single mom of three kids of 11 - 12yrs old and said that she also had verbal abuse from the manager like accusing her of stealing and demanding she open her bag and show what's inside (pretty sure that is illegal). She had been waiting to be laid of legally for six months since she had had a lot of formal warnings but she is being strung along endlessly and can't quit by herself or she won't get an unemployment check. For me it's easy to leave since I am just a 20-something guy with a cheap house rented with friends and no kids to take care of. But she constantly has to metaphorically extinguish fires made by the bad communication of our manager and has to keep working with a manager that practically bullies and hates her. It makes me so angry! Worst thing is, is that when she tells HR and the higher-ups about this abuse, they just open their umbrella and tell her that the manager makes impressive individual targets so they always back the manager, disgusting! In the meanwhile this colleague has covered my shifts now I'm sick, has told a different manager about my manager's wrong-doing with my eczema, has helped me countless times, etc... She's an absolute angel!  


I never want to work in retail again, it's just always higher-ups who get to be right and suddenly give you extra shifts and shit, while they make the money, get to go on vacation, don't train their employees properly. I've just had it. I feel a bit guilty leaving the awesome colleague and great student workers behind, but this job just makes me just incredibly unhappy. I wish that there was some kind of legal action I could take for at least HR to be able to sanction the manager. Me and the other beginner leaving will definitely be a good message that she is not able to keep employees with her for even two months, but I want to ask you guys if there's anything me and my colleague can do?

I know this might not appear as the biggest horror story from retail yet. But I really do value my music making time a lot and even a couple of hours extra makes it so that I get really anxious and I have to switch around my hours too much to even just play my instruments. I just want a good communicating job that pays my rent and food so I have time to make my music and not have to worry about sudden shift changes all the time.

TL:DR; I fucking hate my job, manager sucks, I quit. Manager said things about my eczema that cross the border and I want advise of what I can legally do."

qbk51t,2,2021-10-19,Bootcamp or Master of science?,Venusgoyard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qbk51t/bootcamp_or_master_of_science/,"I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at The New School. My major is in economics, and my minor is creative coding. I have some basic knowledge in Python and R and only have recently discovered my interest in CS. My university combines a design school and a liberal arts college, so my economics degree is theory-based and socialist-leaning. 

I feel like I'm in the wrong program, but I do have a scholarship, so I plan on graduating as soon as possible with my undergrad. I have a decent GPA of 3.65. I'm also not a US citizen and am on an F1 visa here. This citizenship situation, plus a not-so prestigious education background, make it difficult for me to seek post-graduate employment here in the US. My peers from NYU and Columbia are landing jobs at significant investment banks here and there; so far, I've heard nothing back from around 50 applications of internships I've applied so far. 

Now I have a couple of choices; one is to return to China and seek international economics/ finance-related jobs, but I want to pursue further education. One of my friends with an average undergrad degree but attended Columbia's Fintech program landed an excellent job at Citibank. My interests and knowledge lie closer to data science and machine learning, and I'm contemplating doing the data science BootCamp there. I also thought perhaps I should do a master's program in computer science. I also saw an online program at UC Berkeley specific in data science, which means I can attend from China while working a job. I don't have any student loans for my undergraduate, but I will be taking one out if I pursue a master's. What would you do if you were in my position?"
qbkh5z,8,2021-10-19,Feeling like a cog in a machine at my Fortune 100 internship,a_wagen,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qbkh5z/feeling_like_a_cog_in_a_machine_at_my_fortune_100/,"Hi everyone! I’m a third-year Mechanical Engineering student, and I’m currently interning at a very large (Fortune 100) industrial automation company. The size of this company — combined with the fact that 1) most people now work remotely (due to COVID); and 2) I’m only an intern — makes it difficult for me to stay motivated. The main issue, for me, is that I feel like none of the work I do matters. The work I do is apparently part of a bigger project, but nobody has time to explain to me what that project entails and how my work will add value to it. It seems like I could do no work for days, and nobody would even notice, let alone care.

This sounds like a dream for most people, but it’s absolute hell for me. I need tasks to have some meaning or importance — even if it’s just a penalty for not finishing them — in order to motivate myself to get them done. I loathe doing work just for the sake of doing work. I can handle routine tasks and the “boring” parts of engineering work if I know how they fit into the “bigger picture”; however, my current tasks seem like things that somebody assigned me just to keep me busy, and doing them feels like pulling teeth.

I know I should just consider myself lucky to have an internship — especially at a “name-brand” company — but the lack of structure and meaning in my work makes things so stressful for me. Am I making a big deal out of nothing? What things can I try to motivate myself, or at least make the next few months more tolerable?

I’ve interned at other large companies in the past, and it seems like the “cog in a machine” feeling is very common at companies of this size. Is this true — will working for smaller companies make my work feel less abstract/more meaningful? Also, are there specific engineering roles/industries that are better for people who want to avoid the “cog in a machine” feeling?"
qbkkv1,0,2021-10-19,8 months into Frontend job and decided i want to leave. Create a portfolio or just start applying?,DoughnutRare,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qbkkv1/8_months_into_frontend_job_and_decided_i_want_to/,"After seeing what recent grads and Bootcamp grads are getting paid, and lots of financial stress myself, I've decided it's time to start looking for a new gig. Also because of shitty management at my current work, but mostly the money issue.

8 months ago i was hired as a frontend dev, making $60k. Before that, i co-founded a Saas company where we built a few web-based prototypes. Before that, i did a Masters in what is *kinda* a Saas accelerator (ideating, customer discovery, product-market-fit, designing, prototyping). Before that, I did a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from a well-known university of where I'm from. I also have 12months of intern experience but we don't count that.

Thing is, I don't have any personal projects. I feel like a black sheep in this community, everyone and their grandmother seems to have a super impressive portfolio. I just haven't had time for it (or at least i tell myself), i've been consistently working long days for a few years now, and need the downtime in the evening.

So my question is, despite not having a portfolio, if I'm going to start applying to jobs in hopes of a better salary, should I just grind leetcode + submit applications or should i first build a couple of personal project apps ?"

I worked for them about 3 months before asking for the job - they told me they don't think I'm experienced enough to go to clients. ISNT THAT WHAT THE INTERNSHIP WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR????

2. Congressional Debate (15hr/wk, 10th-12th): I've had finalist places at regional tournaments and made it all the way to nationals.
3. Summer STEM Internship at \[excerpted\] (40hr/wk, 10th-11th): Spent two summers interning at a Fortune 100 healthcare company. The work was under NDA but the first summer I worked a lot with manufacturing and the second summer I wrote some software for medical device testing.
4. \[Local App Contest\] (10hr/wk, 11th-12th): Won the contest in 11th grade &amp; was featured in school + local news.
5. Math Club (3hr/wk, 10th-12th)
6. Hobby Programming/Scripting (3hr/wk, 9th-12th): Just exploring my interests in CS through learning lots of programming and making lots of small projects.
7. National Honor Society (3hr/wk, 12th): Recently elected President of the chapter of around 50 students.
8. Helping 9th graders (1hr/wk, 11th-12th):

10. Asian Culture Club (1hr/wk, 9th-10th)

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

* APUSH Teacher Rec (6/10): Was a good letter that talked about lots of good qualities of me in the classroom, but the teacher did not know me out of class very well.
* Math Teacher Rec (8-9/10): Known this teacher since 10th grade through Math Club. They're very familiar with my personality, work ethic, and how I am in the classroom &amp; out of it.
* Counselor Rec (6-8/10): I did not meet them very much until this year but they seemed very enthusiastic to write a letter for me. We connected a lot more when I got National Merit Semifinalist and they already had to write a letter for the finalist app for that.
* Common App Essay (8/10): Talked about my fear of public speaking, years of speech therapy, and eventual success in Debate making it to nationals.
* Supplements (7-8/10): Still in the process of writing &amp; revising them.

**Schools:**

* EA: U of MN Twin Cities (local state school), U of Wisconsin Madison, Georgia Tech, Northeastern, U Chicago, Caltech, MIT (#1 choice)
* RD: Carnegie Mellon, U of Michigan, Texas A&amp;M (for national merit scholarship, but might remove), Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Boston University (their national merit first-choice deadline is march 😬), Northwestern, Stanford (considered doing REA here, but I haven't started essays for them..), Duke, Yale, Harvard

Everything but the EA schools are subject to change at the moment. I'm reaching 20 slots on my Common App and I'm worried about not having many safety/targets besides my state school, University of Minnesota Twin Cities. However, I'm having a hard time finding schools that I would want to go to over my state school that aren't my high reaches and are still affordable. Seems like my schools are just a bunch of Computer Science T20s reaches :P.

I'm happy to hear any thoughts on my choice of schools and chances. I'd love to hear any other schools that I should be looking into, especially those that are more reasonable reaches/targets."

I have the chance to intern full time with a great company in Spring, but by doing so I’ll have to potentially push my graduation date back (spring 2023 to winter 2023)

I’m worried that pushing my graduation date would prevent me from receiving a full time offer from another firm I’m interning with which specified applicants to have a graduation date of spring 2023 (I already accepted that one as it’s for the summer)

What should I do? 

Should I accept the spring position, push my graduation back, and risk full time offers or should I decline the offer even after the intense interviewing I had to do?

Any advice? :(

qbs6b2,1,2021-10-19,Help me find a new job?,Andrewx72,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qbs6b2/help_me_find_a_new_job/,"Maybe this is a little too specific, but perhaps someone could be of help. I'm 21 years old, I just moved to LA to hopefully get a job in the entertainment industry.

I have a college degree. This past May, I graduated from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in Dramatic Writing. High GPA. My specialization was screenwriting. I have a great sense of story structure and I know what makes for a good script (applying it in my own writing is still quite challenging, but I’m working on it). I have some screenplays, but I don’t think they’re ready to be submitted anywhere. I want to finish this current one and then go back and revise and collect feedback on my previous ones. My long term goal is to become a professional screenwriter, potentially a producer/director as well. A secondary/alternative goal is to do the same in the games industry, but the lines are blurring with each day; it’s far from impossible to do both.

I’ve had three unpaid internships. The first was at a production company in which I performed administrative duties, ran morning meetings, edited preview clips/thumbnails for the website, and performed script coverage. The second was for an independent filmmaker in which I was in charge of researching and contacting screening societies, film clubs, and independent reviewers to see if they wanted to watch/review the film. This task was not for me; I found it tedious. The third was for an acquisitions company in which I performed LOTS of script and screener coverage. I occasionally submitted pitches for story fixes if a script was bad but the company was passionate about it/the relationship with the writers. I liked this work.

I have experience working in sales, food service, and teaching kids. My current job is a reading tutor at a national tutoring company. It doesn’t pay very well ($18/hour), but it’s very flexible, easy, and rewarding. I was just able to transfer from the company’s New York location to the LA location.

I know basic directing/editing. I’ve got a few short films of my own as well as a couple dozen comedy sketches my friends and I wrote, acted in, directed, edited, and uploaded on a weekly basis for a year and half in school (before COVID). I don’t know a ton about VFX\*, but it excites me. Making films is fun for me.

I have a solid command of Spanish and Italian. I studied the former throughout high school and 2 years of college and for the latter, I am taking a virtual community college class as well as seeing a private tutor on a weekly basis. I know enough of each to get by in Spain/Latin America/Italy without much difficulty. I could probably tutor an American high schooler in either language. In fact, I’m waiting to hear back on my Fulbright Creative Arts grant application in which I would travel to Italy for 9 months to research and write a historical drama screenplay.

I know an elementary level of Python as well as Unreal Engine. I took a college elective in each and did well. I would like to delve deeper into each and maybe even make a game. \*Unreal, while very useful for virtual production for innovative short films with VFX, is hard to run on my current laptop though, and I don’t see myself having enough money for a decent PC for a while if I keep my current job. 

I’ve applied to entry level jobs at agencies, production companies, management companies, internships at studios, and more here in Los Angeles. I have heard that one simply needs to know people at the company to get their resume considered. I currently know two people here in LA, both people around my age who graduated from NYU. I’m making efforts to meet more. My school’s career center paired me with a lovely mentor, a screenwriter in his late 20s, who has told me jobs (or at least the ones I want) are dry at the moment.

Right now, I’m making just enough to cover my cost of living. I want to make money so I can pay rent, my car payment, insurance, and living expenses while also funding short films and putting away savings. Ideally, it’s something that’s not totally draining so that I have time to pursue writing/filmmaking/game development on the side."
qbsrhg,57,2021-10-20,can i report this to the police or is this too trivial?,lucybear234,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/qbsrhg/can_i_report_this_to_the_police_or_is_this_too/,"i bought a laptop off carousell 2 months ago, and i met one of the interns of the shop to collect my laptop and make sure everyth was fine. later that day, the intern kept msging me and trying to chat with me. i’m 19 and he’s 20+ i think, so i didn’t think it was odd that he would like to be friends. 

ultimately, i didn’t like the way he spoke to me and i ended up not replying to his repeated msgs. he would tell me that i was very mature for my age etc, which came off a little creepy from someone i barely knew at all.

recently, ive gotten an issue with my laptop and had to converse with him again to get it repaired. he asked me for my address this time, so that he could give me a timing to come down and check it out. i was quite hesitant to give it, since i’ve had stalkers and have been harassed before, but obviously it was just a business thing and he was trying to help right?

few days after i gave my address, i still haven’t gotten a reply or a time slot for the repair. it has led me to assume that he never had any issue with helping me with my laptop at all. perhaps he just wanted my address for some reason? either way i have no idea why he wanted my address and i’m worried about what he could do with it. 

would a police report help in any way?

edit: i just found out that the shop is having a chargeback dispute on carousell, i think that it would be better for me just to find someone else to help me with my laptop, but please dm me if u need the carousell name to avoid them if you’re planning on buying a laptop"
qbsu5f,4,2021-10-20,Why (CS) Grad School?,excise1,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qbsu5f/why_cs_grad_school/,"Hi all! I am a CS undergrad, about to graduate next year, and I have a very *very* basic doubt that has been nagging me for the past three years. *WHY GRAD SCHOOL?!?*

My Background:

I have always been a decent performer, academically. I have a GPA &gt; 9.5, from one of my country's top tech colleges, decent internships (both research and industrial), a few mid-tier papers, etc. The thing is, I did all of this only because, in the back of my mind, I wanted to pursue further research. Or so I thought.

Now when it is finally the time to start applying, I am having serious second thoughts. I always thought I wanted to pursue research, but I realized that actually it is what everyone else *expected* from me. I mean, that is what practically everyone told me, that since my profile was decent, academically, grad school was my only way forward.

I recently spoke to a very good friend who wants to pursue a Ph.D. and asked him the exact question, ""Why grad school?"". He bluntly said that it was the *prestige* that matters, and *that's the reason why most people who get a Ph.D., actually do so.*

My Question:

Is my friend correct, and is prestige the driving factor for people getting a Ph.D.? Or is it an innate love for the subject that actually motivates Ph.D. aspirants?

So recently I received an offer for the summer 2022 LinkedIn SWE internship. I know that LinkedIn is a super good place to work at overall. However, I am a Junior and also an international student, I'd love to be able to move to the US after I graduate to live there. So that's why my main deciding factor on accepting an offer is the return offer rate.

Sadly, I've been researching and the only negative I've found from LinkedIn is the return offer rate. I even read on some post that on 2020 the rate was somewhere in the 10%-20% (wtf!). However, I'm not sure if that's how it was the last couple years due to Covid and them not wanting to hire many people. For 2022 it'll be in person and maybe they'll start handing out more return offers? Or maybe that's me being too hopeful?

They only gave me until Friday to decide so I need to make a quick decision. I'm currently waiting on my final round results from Microsoft (Action Center says SWE intern and completed, so I've been told I will get an offer?) and gonna have my Facebook final round on November 1st. Microsoft is very attractive to me due to their very good return offer rate. As for Facebook, I like the prestige but I'm not knowledgeable on their return offer rate.

What would you guys do? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!"

I graduated from my masters in July and instantly got a job in August. Had a couple of internships before, but the longest one was six months. I was at first happy that I didn’t have to spend a long time looking for opportunities, but now I’m not sure if I should have taken the job.

I was contacted via Linkedin by this huge tech company in an Asian country, where I studied for my masters. They didn’t specify what my job would be, but I understood it would be based on market research, which I had some experience with. Turns out I work with project management now. And I hate it. I’m not organized at all and the hours are pretty long. I work from 9:00am to 10:30pm most days, sometimes going past 11:30pm. Everything is due yesterday and the learning curve is pretty steep. I have no time to take care of myself and my motivation is gone.

Given, I’m getting a lot of experience from it. My team is great and everyone in the company is incredibly generous, approachable and understanding. If I stick to it, I’m sure I can move up the ladder in no time, considering how fast the company is growing. I could also quit after I have enough experience and move to a “calmer” company. But right now, the hours plus the stress are too much for me. I’m not sure if I’m just being a coward or I’m just not fit for this role. I never even wanted to work with this.

Actually, I wanted to work with Economic research. I’m thinking about quitting so I can study for a PhD in Economics, but I’m not sure if it makes sense. Although I managed to get into really good undergrad and graduate schools, my grades were just average. I’m not sure what kind of program I could get in with those.

Should I quit and look for other opportunities? Currently I have only weekends to apply for jobs/programs. Or should I just stomach it to get more experience?"

Hi, I am writing this from a throwaway.

**Demographics:-** International Student from South Asia, lived there all my life.

**Financial State:-** EFC is $8-$10K, so almost full-ride.

**Intended Major(s):-** Undecided/Liberal arts, but maybe a mixture of Environmental Sciences/CS/Neuroscience/Economics/Sociology.

**S A T:-** 1290 and *2nd score is pending* (thinking of going test-optional, unsure)

**GPA and Rank:-** Okay, so, I graduated 9th and 10th grade from my national curriculum, and the GPA is 4.19/5.00 (9th) and 4.49/5.00 (10th) respectively, and 5.00/5.00 in the nationally held board examination *in 12 subjects*. (bummer- this school will not give me my transcripts because they are absolute douchebags. I will only have the national one.)

Then I shifted to a British-patterned school for sitting A-Levels. The natural progression in my country is to shift institutions after 10th grade.

My subjects- Maths, Physics, English Literature, AS Chemistry (half)

11th grade - 11 papers - 6 A, 5B

12th grade - 8 papers - 6 A, 2B

Final A-Level grades- Maths (A), Physics (A), English Lit (B) (self-studied the whole thing), AS Chemistry (b)

Currently, in a gap year, I passed my A-Levels in August 2021.

**Awards:-**

1. Stood 10th in the National Economics Olympiad 2020 amongst 11thousand participants (pre-cursor of the Intl. one)
2. Unranked, but did the national camp and was in the regional top 10 of National Earth Olympiad 2020 (pre-cursor of the Intl. one)
3. 80 regional awards in quizzing, public speaking, and English olympiads (not sure how to mention that)

**Extracurriculars:-**

1. Core team member of the first-ever Infotainment startup of my country. Funded by USAID and the ICT ministry, we also got a one-time grant from UNICEF.
2. UNICEF volunteer - Helped to vaccinate underprivileged young children and also helped to register the disadvantaged senior citizens for their CoVID-19 vaccines.
3. One of the six prominent judges (quizmasters) in the OIC Knowledge Master - an international quiz competition held among 68 Muslim countries worldwide.
4. Conducted 15 quizzes as a quizmaster in schools around my country.
5. Part of a Global Youth Inquiry under an International Law firm that will be co-cited and co-credited to me. This will be submitted to the world leaders in the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow. I'm the youngest one on the team.
6. Reform and Innovation researcher in a policy advocacy network. I have directly worked with a Member of Parliament on the issue+possible reform of our Climate-induced migration.
7. About to start a social science research paper collaborating with a local university assistant professor and her students.
8. Writer in the #1 English Daily of our country. Mainly oversee the tech, youth, and lit section.
9. Writer in a UK-based online news portal, mostly on Tech and AI.
10. Did an internship in a mental health awareness org. I was their social media and content writing rep.
11. About to join an online tutoring platform specified in my country. KhanAcademy inspired this startup so that it will be a similar model.
12. President of my school's Math Club.
13. Vice-President of my school's Physics Club.
14. Played football (soccer) for a year in my school's team regionally.
15. Class Prefect of my school.

**Essays/LORs/Other:-**

Maths teacher (7.5/10):- Concise, short, and to the point.

English Lit teacher:- Didn't see his one yet.

Counselor rec (8.5/10):- Mentioned everything I wanted, including the minor study gap I had to endure due to some personal and family problems.

Common App Essay and Supplements (I can't rate my essay, lol): Still in the process of writing &amp; revising them.

**Schools:-**

Route 1:- Yale SCEA, Pomona ED2

OR

Route 2:- EA to MIT, UChicago, and Pomona, ED(1) to Williams, ED(2) to Kenyon

RD (dependent on the chosen route above): Amherst, CMU-Qatar, Colgate, Grinnell, Harvard, Kenyon, Macalester, NYU, Reed, Stanford, Swarthmore, UT-Dallas, UChicago, UPenn, USF, Vassar, WUSTL.

Everything but the EA schools is subject to change at the moment. I'm reaching 20 slots on my Common App, and I'm worried about not having many safety/targets. However, I'm having difficulty finding schools that I would want to go to that aren't my high reaches and are still affordable.

I'm happy to hear any thoughts on my choice of schools and chances. I'd love to listen to any other schools that I should be looking into, especially those that are more reasonable reaches/targets.

I'll appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks!"

But not so long ago I went to a career fair sort of event and there I saw that the CTO of one of the companies that ghosted me was there (a unicorn startup). I went to him and I showed him an app I've been working on for the last year or so (an app which was on the CV that got me ghosted), to my surprise the guy was really impressed and was shocked that I had been ghosted. He seemed quite busy so he then presented me to one of the tech leads of his company with whom I ended up talking for like 2 hours about my app. They offered me an internship on the spot.

I was feeling really down from all the ghosting so this really boosted my confidence. But it left me wondering, what would be the best way to write about a large project like this on my CV so that it causes the same impression that they had on the career fair? Looking now at my CV I realize that writing ""Created an app that does X. &lt;list-of-tech-used&gt;"" isn't very representative of how complex the app actually is. Any ideas? Should I add lines of code (+30k frontend, +40k backend)? Screenshots of the app on the CV? A link to a promotional website for the app (I haven't launched it yet so I can't really link to the App/Play Store)? I am feeling like I missed out on a bunch of opportunities for not marketing myself properly."

I have childhood, adolescent and early adult trauma from family and a failed relationship, and I don't feel comfortable trusting anybody.

Added to this is a startup I interned at a month earlier where the seemingly chill boss turned out to be an absolute asshole who had only hired interns to have his works done then fire them before the month ended (so no stipend).

Today I was approached by another guy who's startup is in early stages, and wants me to be in his core team, but I cannot shake off the feeling that most people are two-faced opportunistic jerks.

What do I do, so that I can remain vigilant and yet explore possibilities?"

Where I live at least (Balkans region) there is an overabundance of front-end webdev internships where you can learn the required skills in less than one month and find a job or internship, but to be honest I have no passion for webdev at all. 

I am mostly passionate about machine learning and data science, and started focusing on that after learning the general basics so I only have programming knowledge in that area. I am worried, however, that there are way fewer or maybe no college-level internships at all in this field as it requires more expertise, so that's why I'm making this post. What area of programming can I focus on learning/getting better at and acquire an internship that will help me start my career in data science/machine learning?

Graduated college last december, and worked an internship from October of that year into March of this year. Between a mix of that internship kind of stringing me along, covid, and relocating to a bigger city, I did not work from March - August, where in August I landed my first full time position with my current company.

It was a position I was excited for, because a large portion of the responsibilities related to what I was really interested in - Community Management.

However, the company is trying to push itself and improve its output, and as a result my role has been shifted 2 months into the job. My title has changed, my responsibilities have changed, my team has changed, and everything I spent the last 2 months learning is pretty much useless, except for one portion: Data analytics. What once was about 25% of my job is now 110%, with a renewed focus towards pushing it even harder.

This is not a role that I am interested in, I do not want to crunch numbers and make spreadsheets for my career. I am frustrated that this happened so soon into the job, because I feel like I haven't been here long enough to job hop, especially following that internship that didn't turn into a job, AND my 4 month work gap. I am terrified that if I stay here for 6+ months, my resume will lock me into the ""Data analytics"" role, and I'll be stuck doing something I hate and trapping myself into doing it for the long haul.

Should I start applying elsewhere despite all this? Or should I just stick it out? I admit, I need the income, and I can't pull another 4 month stint of not working."

I didn't knew what ETL was. neither all the IBM tools they were using. 

At some point she was explaining me something and I just could not focus because of anxiety. I went to the bathroom to try to breathe and I told HR director to allow me to work from home because I couldn't focus and my memory was constantly failing. He told me no so I told him good bye. I had to go to a bar to drink beer. It made it worse.

Now I feel horrible levels of despair till the point of considering suicide. What I need from you guys is to tell me if this is normal or if it's just that I'm a broken human unable to deal with what a dev does.

Does anyone have any experiences they could share with regards to their journey trying to land their first engineering job?

I'm not very passionate about programming or computers in general. I mean I like it alright, and I'm sorta decent at it, but I have other things that make me passionate in life that are considerably harder to turn into money (like writing for example). I'm also not planning on having children at any point so at most I'd just be providing for me, my possible signifficant other and a pet.

So long as whatever I do is not evil, earns enough to live and gives me some free time then thats plenty."

I should preface this by saying that I am an academic oddball. I am double-majoring in history and government but minoring in computer science. Most of my experience has been in the field of digital humanities; I apply CS solutions to liberal arts questions. It is very gratifying work.

For a while I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I am considering taking a year off after undergrad to figure out where I want to take my life. I could probably get a policy-related job, but I have been thinking about shooting for a job in tech instead. So far, I have two tech internships I am prepared to show recruiters. 

The first internship involves data science. My university's government department employs me as a programmer. Most of my time is spent writing web scrapers and data cleanup scripts, but I am about to start helping a grad student design a machine learning algorithm. It is a more conventional CS internship which I hope recruiters will find respectable. 

Next semester, I will be interning at a game development startup. It is actually run by a history professor at my university, and it aims to produce educational history games for high schools and universities. I have already met my coworkers: there will be a small team handling story-writing/historical accuracy/etc, another handling the art, and then I will be among the programmers. We will be making it through Unity and C#.

Part of me worries this might be seen as ""juvenile"" work. Another part of me isn't too concerned, as I am building up my Github and it will only be one among multiple projects I can show off. Also, this internship offers a cool opportunity to learn C#. What do you all think?"

Hi guys! I am a 22 year old female that lives in Florida. I am currently enrolled at Western Governor's University for their Computer Science degree. 

After leaving my previous shitty job, I was unemployed for around 6-8 weeks, before I started a new job with an insurance company. 
I am remote (until February), I get paid $18.00 an hour, I have a 401k for the first time, and the insurance is pretty decent. 

Today, one of the places I applied to previously reached out to me. It's not a job technically, it is a program run by the county I live in. This program is 5 days a week for 12 weeks. In it we intern with one of the IT companies that the program partners 3x a week (where it ""maybe"" 8 hours a day, but at a guaranteed $15 an hour) and then we attend class 2x a week, to be taught the Network+ and a COMPTIA certifications. 

I obviously wouldn't be able to keep my new full-time job and do the internship at the same time, and I'm having a hard time choosing which path I should take.

The internship sounds great but I applied to dozens of ""entry-level"" CS positions when i was unemployed, but i never received a single call back. I would barely be making enough money to cover my share of the bills, and the fact that i could technically get the certifications through my college for free, whenever i am ready to actually take the test. At the end of the 12 weeks, the interns have a chance to be scouted to work full-time at any of the workplaces, but no guarantees. I wouldn't want to have to leave the program and then be unable to find a job after. 
A plus is that i hate learning online, and i think I'd really enjoy being back in the classroom again. Especially when I'm still learning the basic fundamentals

On the other hand, I hate my current job, BUT it is with a large national corporation and they have an inhouse IT team in every building. If i hold out for 6 months, i can (maybe) transfer to the IT department and try to work my way up from there. My company has a very ""promote from within"" culture. I also have never made this much money before and i love being able to actually save money, instead of struggling paycheck to paycheck anymore. Also the work office when I go back is a 5 minute commute from where i live. I have also been eating healthier and enjoying spending time with my pets. I would have to spend more money on car maintenance and add time commuting.

My best friend says take the internship and get my foot in the door   My boyfriend says tough it out with the job i have. I can see both sides of the argument. Can you guys help me choose? If it helps, I live in the Tampa Bay area which is growing pretty rapidly in the tech scene.

I'm just so worried that I may not be able to find a decent internship or job after graduate.. even if were required to have OJT next school year.

In line with this, I would like to ask you guys for some advice, what do I do? I guess I can start doing LeetCode/Hackerrank exercises but for the more in-depth topics like databases and whatnot.. I don't think I can really rely on my university that much due to online classes.

qca5l9,2,2021-10-20,How to tell recruiters that I want to drop out of an industrial PhD,FlyOk7642,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/qca5l9/how_to_tell_recruiters_that_i_want_to_drop_out_of/,"Hello everyone,I am a young graduate with a M. Sc. in Computer Engineering, and I am currently enrolled in an industrial PhD. In my case, ""industrial"" means that the program is funded by a company (which has also decided the main research topic), where I am also doing an internship.

I am now almost at the end of the 1st year of the PhD program, but I want to drop out of it and find a normal job in the industry (preferably in an R&amp;D department). The reason is that I feel that my research is not going anywhere, the work that I do at the company is not publishable, my advisor is unhelpful, and I don't want to work 3 more years (at least) on minimum wage just to end up writing a mediocre thesis. Moreover, I've become quite disenchanted with academia, and I would like to move to Industry full time. Hence, I've started looking for jobs.

However, I have some doubts on what to put on my CV and what to tell recruiters/HR people in the first interview. So far, on my CV I mention the internship at the company, but not that I am enrolled in a PhD program, since I believe it could create confusion (e.g. they may think that I am just looking for another internship to do during my PhD, or that I already have the title). Is this a good move?

Obviously, I want to come clean during the first phone interview, and here is my second doubt: how should I tell them?  I fear that telling them that I am leaving the PhD program (before completing it) may be frowned upon, if I cannot convince them of my good reasons. Do you have any advice on how to approach this topic?

Thanks in advance"

I'm planning on doing my master's in computer science. Currently looking for universities to enter in Canada and Germany.I have a higher preference towards Canada due to their immigration policies.


My relevant qualifications are 7.8 CGPA in Bachelor's. No GRE, will be writing IELTS. I'm have 2 semesters left, which is around 6 months.

---

Upon research, it seems that the CGPA, SOP, and LOR are important, along with work experience. Knowing this, I'm planning on taking the following steps to get my profile up.

1. Improve my CGPA as much as possible. It's hard only with 2 semesters left, but I'm confident I can try and get it to an 8, if I put in the work.
2. Participate in Hackathons, and other events to obtain extracurricular credits.
3. Finally, work on my SOP to really target the course curriculum in particular, especially the professors. The LORs also need proper writing, but are more or less standard for all unis if I'm not mistaken.

---

I also plan on trying for internships. This will help me bolster my profile in terms of work experience. But it's been very difficult finding any internships so far.

---

Out of all this, I also definitely plan on doing well on the IELTS, since I've heard it's an important factor for Canadian Universities.

---

I just lack the time for all of this, so I'd appreciate it if you can help me figure out if what I'm doing is good. It's a lot to do within 6 months so I need to ensure that any inefficiencies are weeded out early.

Lastly, I am absolutely open to any further things I could be doing as well. Please do let me know.

I appreciate you guys helping me out with this."

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1540 (790 English 750 Math)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 91/100 UW, 99/108 W. school doesn't report class rank but according to the school profile I'm only around top 30% :(

**Coursework:** Physics 1 (4), Bio (5), Calc (4), Micro and Macroeconomics (both 5s), self-studied Lang and got a 5, taking APES, Stats, and self-studying Chem this year yikes!

**Awards:** National Honor Society, National Merit Semifinalist, not an official award but I have a school record for weightlifting??? I know it's not a lot

**Extracurriculars:** i'm just copy and pasting from my common app LOL

\- Four-year varsity on my school's track team and got 3rd last year at a sectional championship. I don't think I'm good enough to compete in college but hey

\- Intern/youth advisor for a research project at UChicago. Basically it was looking at game-based health education for teens, and since I Am A Teen I did some work with the people there (I put ""Gave constructive feedback on a health curriculum for teens using leading education theory; collaborated with researchers to refine study design"" on my application lmao) I also got a recommendation letter out of it which was pretty cool

\- volunteer at a nonprofit where I ""wrote and illustrated educational storybooks on health topics for children in Peru, researched and took into account target audience's culture""

\- took online courses on topics that interested me throughout high school. I mentioned contact tracing, biostatistics, and Millenium Development Goals as some topics I learned about. this EC is really just me trying to have some semblance of control over my education lol

\- school spirit person. basically I designed t-shirts and murals for our grade every year. yeah

\- obligatory volunteer hours at a local food bank but I'm not even sure I should include it bc it was literally only \~50 hours I got before COVID hit

\- senior year internship at my township health department where I do grunt work lolol

\- heheheh I started working at Subway my senior year 12/hrs/week

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

My teacher letters of rec will be just okay I think!! One of them is my weightroom coach who I've known for four years, and the other is my physics teacher who I joked around with sometimes

My counselor letter of rec will be really good though bc we're best friends lolol. He told me he tried to emphasize my drive, independence, and focus on experiential learning in his letter

My common app essay is currently a work in progress (which is very bad seeing as it's October 20 but oh well). I basically talk about disparate parts of myself, drawing from experience as a mixed-race person but also from my experiences at Subway and my internship because you don't usually see people doing both lol. I use those to talk a little bit about ambition and the amount of real work it takes to make impacts, and then also talk about how simply existing and reveling in the mundane is also cool and valid and awesome. I also say some stuff about social flexibility eg. how the disparate parts of myself allow me to connect myself to all sorts of peers and mentors. idk if this is good or cringy lolol I feel like the line between the two is always so thin when it comes to college essays

some additional info: former long-term depressed person here! i am now receiving treatment and it's manageable now. I'm going to vaguely frame this as ""health issues"" in the Additional Info section but I thought I should mention this here bc I'm not sure how it would affect me

**Schools:** other than the title bc let's be real my chances aren't good:

Rutgers

UMass Amherst

Looking at pros and cons for each option:

[Bill.com](https://Bill.com) Pros:

* From hometown, so I save money on food/transport/housing/stupid bullshit purchases because I live at home

[Bill.com](https://Bill.com) Cons:

* $28/hour + $3000 housing stipend paid in bulk
* 10 week internship
* Same team as my first internship (but I may or may not be able to negotiate this one) (I liked my teammates a lot, but manager was kinda pushy with awkward vibes sometimes) (The tech was AWS/Cloud stuff, so it's a solid stack to work with)

Qualtrics Pros:

* Position in Seattle, which is a tech hub
* $42/hour + $1650/month housing stipend
* 12 week internship
* I have some level of choice in terms of which team I want to join

Qualtrics Cons:

* Extra travel costs, potentially 
* I have to pay for groceries and rent

Reject/Accept and Renege Pros:

* Potentially land an internship where I do something more ✨fancy✨like Machine Learning or something
   * Although I can already do Machine Learning projects through Uni project groups
* Potentially land an internship at a company with better name recognition, which will help my career more
   * Like if I intern somewhere fancy and get a full-time return offer, it would save me a lot of time and effort in the fall of my senior year
   * I don't know how much internship name recognition matters, though

Reject/Accept and Renege Cons:

* Emotional damage of having to renege on offer
* More effort spent applying
* None of the pros are guaranteed

For the technical portion, I got asked a topological sort question that I had a solution for that seemed to work but he made a suggestion for approaching cycles since mine was complicated.  I recognized the optimization a few seconds after he pointed out but didn't implement because of time.  He said my solution was nearly correct and the approach was right and went straight into asking if I had any questions.  I wasn't sure if 1) time was short so he didn't ask about space and runtime complexity or 2) he already knew I was going to the reject pile and saw no point in asking this.  To be courteous of his time, I only asked 1 question and thanked him at the end before leaving.  Kind of bummed because I felt like the solution I had was pretty solid, albeit probably having bugs.  Has anyone else gotten offers with similar experience?

qceq7c,2,2021-10-20,Combining Multiple PQ Queries into a Pivot Table,translinguistic,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/qceq7c/combining_multiple_pq_queries_into_a_pivot_table/,"I work for a rehab program with multiple locations and several thousand past/current residents. I am querying against the ""Residents"" table in my Knack database to provide a summary of the following for each location:

1. Total Admitted (this is easy, just the total number of records)
2. Total Quit (the number of the above whose ""Quit Date"" column isn't blank)
3. Total Graduated (the number of the above whose ""Status""  column can be one of four options: Graduated, Intern, Completed Internship, Apprentice)

I'm wanting to use a Pivot Table so that that all three numbers for each location can be shown together and can be filtered (or potentially sliced in the future with more of my data model) based on the same date range for Admission, Quit and Graduation dates -- and/or location.

My ""Residents"" table has an N:1 relationship with my ""Locations"" table, and I'm also pulling in the ""Residents"" and related ""Locations"" GUIDs in each resident row.

I tried to create three different queries (because I think 2 and 3 have incompatible filter steps) and do a simple left join merge with them based on ""Residents"" GUIDs, but it was extremely slow and didn't give me the result I wanted because the merge steps ended up giving me only the matches for #3 above (where all three conditions were true).

I'm also hindered by the fact that my database's API requires dealing with pagination and only will spit out 1000 results at once, so any queries have to call an accompanying function over each page.

I feel like there must be an easier way. Maybe joining based on ""Locations"" GUIDs and removing the duplicate lines? Or maybe I'm just trying to do it the dumbest way possible.

Can I filter the Value calculations based on the criteria in 2 and 3 and just have it load the whole table once? For example to say, ""don't count a resident as 'Quit' in the sum if their 'Quit Date' is blank""? Adding a filter to a calculation is something that's extremely intuitive to do with Knack so I'm banging my head against a wall lol."

The interview process at these large companies tend to be very fair and don't really make u solve the hardest leetcode questions and they are very respectful. And honestly, I had nothing but a positive experience. Mind you, when I say large, i don't mean FAANG. I'm referring to some large banks/engineering companies in Wisconsin. 

On the other hand, small companies think they are some hot shit who deserve to be real picky with whom they want to hire. 

1) 
I applied to an unpaid internship and they made me program the whole website in react and gave me about a week to do so. It was during the midterm week so I had to decline. 

2) 
I have gone through 3 rounds of interview for one small startup in Milwaukee (unpaid) and had to solve leetcode medium level questions and since they were fairly easy medium leetcode problems, I did alright. They told me they want to hire me and asked when I can start. I told them I can start from the summer since this was a summer 2022 internship. All of a sudden they asked me if I can start commute from next week. (I live in madison WI and thats like a fucking hour long commute). I told them no and that they should find a different intern. They don't even offer transportation stipends wtf. 

3) 
I just had another interview today at a small robotics startup company near my area ($8/hour). It was a hour long interview with tons of cs Fundamental questions. Honestly they weren't hard at all if you have taken 2 intro cs courses. They even complimented my thought process, and then at the very end they were like ""yea I'm sorry but we are looking for someone who has more background in circuit and embedded engineering"". Why waste my time then?!!

Thankfully, I already have an internship lined up at a mid-large size company (5000employees) and they do pay good money. Their interview process was not too grueling and they were very respectful. 

Most of the small size companies that I applied to were either unpaid or minimum wage with no overtime. Some of the interviewers were also rude af at this one start up company that I applied to. 
""Hey, are u really a CS major?"" In my mind I'm like ""Bro, I haven't even taken theoretical algorithm yet. Ofc hard dynamic programming is gonna be hard for me."" This was also unpaid front end internship. 

I don't hate leetcode and I love leetcode actually but these small companies want google level employees when they treat their applicants like total crap.

Does anyone else have a similar experience as I do?"

2.	the architecture document is too old. We got no time to update it for you. What is security architecture document? We never had one.

So I'm a Junior international student. I'm going to have my first (and only) internship next summer. I currently have offers from Microsoft and LinkedIn. I'm also going to have my final round with Facebook on Nov 1st.

My dilemma here is that since I'm an international and a Junior, I need to prioritize getting a return offer. This is my main deciding factor. The issue is that I have to decide with LinkedIn by Friday. 

So right now it's LinkedIn vs Microsoft. I know that the return offer rate on MSFT is like 70%-80%. LinkedIn I know that the past couple years it was terrible (like 10%-20%) but having talked to some people I think that that was because of the pandemic? Apparently they're going to go back to their standard rate which was like 90% or something. I'm also going to have a call with my recruiter about this tomorrow.

So if I choose LinkedIn, that's it, I cancel my FB interview. But if I go with MSFT I can decide from FB vs MSFT (if I get the offer). So in FB vs MSFT scenario, which would you guys go for? How is the return offer rate for Facebook?

Remember that my main concern is return offer. I don't care about pay or location for an internship. I would love it if it was in person (LinkedIn will be, MSFT still not sure) but definitely not as important.

Thank you!

I'm currently a human resources undergrad with three major internships so far.

I absolutely love the job, my team, and the projects have been great. It's a generalist position and I help the team with large projects. I love my job and I wouldn't want to leave.

That being said, I do have a good shot at potentially interning at ""larger"" companies, like Boeing, Prudential, IBM... I've gotten interviews but my heart isn't in it. **Would I be missing out on something or hurting my career by staying with the smaller firm? I'm worried that this might make finding a job after college harder than if I interned with a ""big name"" to round out my four years.** The natural gas industry doesn't have the best rep, so that's a stress point as well. My other line of thought is that being with the smaller company shows commitment, and my first internships with the large company might be ""enough"" to pull the weight. I'm thinking this far ahead since my company has let me know that a full-time position might not be in the cards once I graduate, so I wouldn't want to potentially pigeon-hole myself by staying.

- 3 years of iOS dev internships, freelancing at three different startups.

No publications  

LORs - 1 professional, 2 academic ( I think they are decent since I had good projects)

My current list -
   
Mod : NYU Tandon  

Amb : Stony Brook, Rutgers

Am I listing the unis correctly?  Please help me in listing out more safe unis.

Also, can I justify my low gre score on my SOP or would my profile just be filtered out because of the GRE inspite of having a decent overall profile? Would it be wise to mention that my full time job was the reason I couldn’t prepare well for the test?"

I am an American student planning on applying to UWaterloo this year, and was wondering if anyone could go over my stats to see if I would get accepted into the CS Coop program and also the life sciences program (coop) 
I am debating on weather I should major in CS or Physics, (leaning towards physics). I’ve taken several AP classes at a highly ranked US high school, and scored mostly Bs and Cs. The thing is, my school is known for making STEM classes quite difficult for students, meaning I didn’t score as high as I’d like to for college admissions. I’ll input my grades below: (SAT score is 1430-760 English, 670 math)

AP Physics: 80 
AP Statistics: 81 
Computer Science Capstone: 99
AP Human Geography: 99

Please note: I know that most of my humanities grades are higher than my STEM grades, this is a combination of what I mentioned above, pandemic learning, and the fact that I take easy humanities APs to valence the hard STEM ones. 
Additionally, I am a teaching assistant for my old teacher for a college level computer Science class, which I am putting as a extra curricular, as well as a web design internship for a local business.

Long story short, I got a full-time return offer at this IB I summer-interned at, one of the highest paying option for cs people getting out from my college. 

Recently, I got a part-time offer at a relatively small hedge fund. I stalked some of the people there on Linkedin and seems like they have solid backgrounds and experiences who I can learn from. Problem is I been doing this research work with one of my profs working with c++, something I didn't have much experience about, so that's been a great learning experience. The hedge fund part-time pay is twice as much. For me, it's either doing both or just the research. If I do both, I am afraid that might be too much work and it might affect my well-being (I will be doing all this on top of 5 courses this semester). But if I simply turn the offer down, I am afraid I might regret it in the future, since it seems like it'll be a really great learning experience plus the pay is good. Any advice?

Additionally, I’ve heard just due to the nature of Salesforce’s enterprise products, the work for a new grad can be rather boring to say the least (I already got my team and it’s web-focused Java work), whereas Capital One is a lot more exciting with consumer facing products involving AI, ML, Cyber etc. and I can easily rotate projects after 6 months, it doesn’t seem I can do the same at Salesforce

About 5 years ago, I was working as IT help desk and as some of you might know, it can really suck dealing with people in that job field. During the summer months we would get interns. Kids back in town from college and what not. Well, I opted out of college and got some certs, so I’m the same age as the interns coming in. 

One summer, I ended up getting an intern that I went to high school with and we were fairly friendly towards each other so we would talk a lot. I work in an area where it’s very taboo to talk about wages but one day I decided to just ask and see what an intern at my company makes. Well I’m very happy I did ask because it was more than I made and I was PISSED. With all of my certifications and experience, I make less than said intern who I am teaching.

I didn’t really know how to go about talking to my boss about it so I decided to to just bring it right up. His response was simply “Well we gave you a raise just last month”. The raise he mentioned was simply a “cost of living” raise and it was .35 cents. I left his office and decided that was it.

The next day I started looking for jobs, found an amazing job making 25k more a year with travel to some amazing locations around the world. Luckily, I got that job, put in my two weeks and my boss requested a meeting with me to “talk” about my leaving as if it were some big surprise. 

At first he played a sympathy card saying he was sorry for how little my raise was and how poor the work environment was but once I mentioned that my mind was set and that I was for sure leaving, he changed his tone and started trying to manipulate me to stay by saying “Well I know that company, they only go to really dangerous places, their work environment is horrible. Is that really something you’d do? What about your parents? I’m sure they’ll try to stop you also” etc. etc.

After that, I’d never felt so sure about my choice to leave such a crappy job with such a crappy boss. Now 5 years later, I own a house, I travel the world, and I couldn’t be happier."

You can be stuck with a shitty internship where you're left to your own devices, doing the job of 3 people and getting paid peanuts or nothing at all.

You can be terribly unprepared for an internship, your  health and your education can suffer because of this.

Interns get all the hardships of a job search and actual work with none or very little of the benefits. 

Most young people all over the world actually end up paying  for the ""pleasure"" and ""opportunity"" of jumping through the same hoops as employees do, with little to no support during the internship with a small hope of employment afterwards.

I have no idea what I'm doing. The requirements are not clear to me, everything is in super early stages, there's not a single line of code written yet.

I'm supposed to chose the whole architecture, stack and code the thing. Not sure if I'm ready for this. I'm really trying and I'm learning a lot, but what happens months from now if my employer thinks I'm taking too long? Or I realize that I've made a bad architectural decision and have wasted money?

I've had internships and a fulltime job before. I've built production software before but never alone. All in all, 3 years of experience in total. Should I just keep going 'faking till I make it', should I come clean to my employer and hope they don't fire me and assign a more senior dev to the project? (Oh, I'm the only dev on the project). Should I just look for another job and leave after only a month?

EDIT: grammar.  


EDIT2: Thanks for all the encouraging replies, everyone. I'll keep going and learning as much as I can and doing the best I can!"

Before my upcoming internship I have applied to hundreds of internships and have landed exactly two interviews. 

I was wondering if having Cisco on my resume really increase my application to interview rate or will it be more of the same?"
qctchk,0,2021-10-21,CS minor or self teach?,iblamejoshhhh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qctchk/cs_minor_or_self_teach/,"Currently an Economics major in my 3rd year and having a sort of existential crisis. I currently have no internships and minimal work experience (fast food), so I’m very afraid for what my future awaits. If I could start over I would major in CS but I’m already too far into my major and extending into a 5th year is a no go. But I feel like learning CS will help me get my foot out the door and land a reasonable entry level job. I firmly believe programming is pretty much a requirement nowadays for all sorts of jobs.

So my question is, would a CS minor be worth it (would have to spend some extra money for credits) or would self teaching (perhaps learning various languages and starting projects) be more advisable? Just need some general guidance, I heard minors mean nothing on resumes."

Hey everyone! My boyfriend is very interested in applying to a master’s program in Computer Science. He feels stagnated where he’s at career-wise right now and has had a lot of trouble finding a job that would actually allow him to code. He’s very interested in the data analytics side of things using languages such as Python and R. Have any of you attended the schools listed above for a Masters and could you elaborate on your experience there, including how easy or difficult it is to land an internship and what job prospects look like after graduating? I’m also curious on how competitive these schools are for getting into this program. Thank you!!"

Does anyone have a guide for IT internship salaries? or has anyone done IT internships and can share what they were paid? People who know know what their interns are paid can answer too.

I've seen the intern salary guides floating around for CS majors ([https://www.levels.fyi/internships/](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/)) and holy sh\*t why the hell do they make so much?? Seeing that really makes me want to switch and tough out the math.

I know IT salaries don't really match something like software engineering until maybe way later on. But I want to know there's some hope for making some decent/alright money early on too."
qcxb7w,2,2021-10-21,About to lose my job.,JakX276,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/qcxb7w/about_to_lose_my_job/,"So I work as a data analyst intern. It took me months to get out of my old position as an office assistant at a daycare to this job. I hated my last job. I was taken advantage of and doing things I wasn’t supposed to be doing, so I was over the moon when I got to leave. This job was in the career field I wanted to be in and what I’m in school for(currently pursuing my masters online).

When I was hired they told me that this job was an internship with no end date. Which was perfect for me since I wanted to stay here as long as I could to absorb everything I can do I can prepare for this career. I thought at some point when I finish my masters I can apply to a full time position and then I’ll be set with a job at this company. No one told me this and none of this was promised to me but still I let my imagination get the best of me.

Two weeks ago my manger mentioned something about the internship ending. He was very vague though so I didn’t know if he meant I was being forced to leave so I dismissed it(mostly because he also mentioned next steps and things of that nature) but today it was confirmed that by next month this time I’ll be unemployed. And I’m so bummed. I can’t believe I blew this position. He didn’t tell me specifically it’s because I didn’t do good work he just said something about budget cuts and shit which I’m taking as code for you’re not important enough to hold on to. The intern that started before me is still staying on board for now so I guess I just didn’t do a good enough job. I had a recent death in the family and the affect it was having on me mentally really took a toll so my work began to suffer for a while so I guess that might’ve been the point when they decided to cut me loose. It sucks and I don’t know what I’m going to do. I know I have to get another job but it took me so long to find this one that I can’t help but be nervous for what’s about to happen. I mean opportunities often disguise themselves as a door closing so I’m trying to stay optimistic but still I’m really bummed and shocked right now. All I can do is hope for the best and look towards the future."
qcxowj,3,2021-10-21,Need advice about Linkedin title (22yo just about to graduate),Biskyzz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qcxowj/need_advice_about_linkedin_title_22yo_just_about/,"Hi guys, i am concerned about a few things related to Linkedin title and job descriptions.

I am about to finish an associates degree (2y) on System Administration and Networking. Also planning on starting   engineering career on IT this year (2022).

Also doing an internship as Support Specialist, and im not enjoying the job so far to be honest, since i dont have the oportunity to grow up my skills (or at least the skills i want to grow).

However i am working on development proyects (mostly backend related) by my own, and i plan to seek for developement job oportunities in the near future. I'm also interested about DevOps, but i know this kind of role requires at least some experience, so for now, i dont know if it's a good move to mention this.

The point is that, at the moment, i am showing as Junior Sysadmin, and i feel like employers and recruiters won't give a shit about a sysadmin when hiring developers.

I need advice about this topic, since i would love to work on backend jobs, a mix of servers and databases with development really calls my atention, and im loving it so far on the proyects i am working on.

This are the skills i have on my CV, i also have previous experience (about 1.5y) as a Web Content Manager and a few more non it related jobs

* Windows &amp; Linux systems administration
* Knowledge of Python &amp; Bash scripting
* Knowledge in Networks
* Knowledge of SQL and Relational Databases
* Knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS
* Knowledge in Git &amp; GitHub
* Knowledge in Microsoft Azure (Cloud)
* Notions in Containers (Docker &amp; Kubernetes)

I plan to add JS/NodeJS/Express/Non-Relational Databases and more insight on containers, Cloud and CI/CD Pipelines as soon as i feel 100% confident with all this topics.

Thanks for taking the time to read this :)"

I’m looking to apply for MS in CS programs in the US. My profile without the GRE score looks pretty okay i think - 3.64 CGPA in my undergrad, a couple internships, some volunteer work in an NGO, multiple individual and group projects, an IEEE conference paper, won an ethereum sponsored hackathon for the best blockchain project. Recently gave the TOEFL - got an 116. 

Most of my deadlines are 30 Nov to 15 Dec (a lot of them are UCs). Im wondering if it’s worth it to invest time into another attempt at the GRE or if i should just focus on my SOP and good LORs. A couple of mentors think it’s better if i focus on my SoPs at this point. Keen learn what everyone thinks about this.

Thank you for your opinions."

Im a CS student from Sweden applying to internships all over EU, however, i'm not getting too many responses. Are companies in other countries unwilling to hire from others in the EU? Am I too bad?  From my understanding working in another country in the EU over the summer is quite simple in regulatory aspects.

What are your thoughts on my resume?

I've been wanting to post this for a long time now, but I didn't have the energy to type it. However, I need someone to hear me out. 

So for like about 5 months now, I stumbled upon inattentive ADHD, and yes the cliche, my world started to change. I fell into a rabbit hole. Researched about it. Joined different online groups about ADHD. And I just felt like I could relate to so many of you guys.

Well, except that I did well in my education performance. But, we'll talk about it later. 

Last week, I finally landed myself an appointment to a Psychologist. My first time ever after I delayed it for the reason you guys call imposter syndrome... ""Nah, maybe I just wanted to be special or something."" 

Anyways, I told my psychologist, I think I have inattentive ADHD, because I struggle so much with concentration problems, executive dysfunction, you name it.

But she thinks I have Anxiety (My concentration, difficulty with executing tasks, forgetfulness weren't taken in consideration.) and and that makes me even more anxious of not getting an ADHD diagnosis, because I need help with my ADHD symptoms. And it's affecting my job and adulting life. 

When I do housechores, I switch from task to task. And it makes me feel crazy sometimes, because I walk here and there. Like a chicken without a head. (Dutch saying) One time I walked into my room, seeing my clothes lying on the floor, because I switched to other tasks first which made me forgot I needed to sort out my clothes for the laundry at the first place. 

It's also affecting my performance at work. I'm freelancing for my parttime (I'm a student) / I do basic tasks for companies. Like logistics, cleaning and retail. And I work everywhere. (Not in a fixed place, because I don't fancy being stuck in it).

 Anyways, the thing is, I need to understand INSTRUCTIONS every time I need to be in a new  location. Which sucks, because I don't freaking GET anything. Which makes me anxious I don't do my job well. 

At this point, I think they are gonna diagnose me with Social Anxiety. And that's fine with me. But I need more MORE help with my executive dysfunction, and forgetting where I put stuff, and not understanding a set of instructions, because I don't think I would be able to survive this (adult) life. 

Another thing I think my psychologist won't believe me: I am 100% sure the built in STRUCTURE in my childhood covered my symptoms.

First of all, my mom. My mom had made sure I was home on time (after playing outside) to do my homework. She also woke me up in the morning. (But I would let my younger sister shower first, because I just couldn't get myself to stand up.) My mom brought me to school and brought me home. She prepared my lunch too. I was scolded, when I wouldn't get to eat it. She would also give me rewards when I made it into honors, which I usually did. If I had a hard time at school, I'd go to tutor. 

Second of all: the elementary (and middle) school I attended was the most structured institution I have ever been to in my whole life. If I had to, I would write a research book about it. 
-We were required to copy notes, because our teacher checked our notebooks, which was also needed for grades. So  daydreaming wasn't an option. Except I would hyperfocus so much on making my handwriting so beautiful, I would panic and start copying for real when the teacher erases the lessons on the board. I remember this, because a lot of people complimented me for having the best handwriting at such a young age. 
-We also had a separate notebook for 'assignments', which we would copy from the teacher when the exam/deadline would be for a homework. 
-After recess and lunch, we always had 2 bells. The first bell was a warning bell, which rang 5 minutes before the real bell that signals the start of classes. 
-Etc 

Third of all, me hyperfocusing on school projects. So in my elementary (and high school). Everything was graded. Homework, seatworks (like small quizzes), quizzes, periodical exams and school projects. School projects were one of the things that contributed to a high percentage to scoring/grading. 

And because school projects were a way for me to express my creativity, I hyperfocused on it. And I slept late, cuz I couldn't stop doing it anymore. I drew with so much shadows and details, I made scrapbooks, I edited videos, I made fancy presentations, etc. These things gave me high grades and landed me into honors. I was smart, but the more I proceeded to a higher grade, the more I struggled with certain subjects. So I went to tutor to maintain my honor streak lmao. 

You see, this was all in my childhood. 

I am now living thousands of miles away, in another country alone and independently. And without parents! And I suck at it. I am having such difficult time. 

When I was younger, I only had to the about school. Now, I have to think about school, internship, my parttime, housechores... Maybe this is adulthood.

However... Why is my planning filled with even the smallest tasks? I have to schedule sending e-mails, initiating a call, noting that I have to fold my clothes. I also have to schedule that I need to message my cousin back about her invitation. Cuz everything just seems overwhelming. And I need help. And I'm feeling helpless, cuz I don't want to go through such a long process. 

I've already experimented with supplements. Magnesium helped with the quality of my sleep. Vitamine D (I lack vit. D) reduced my negative thoughts. Not eating sweets in the morning drifted a part of my brain fog.

But I am still chaotic me. I hear my thoughts. I hear a song playing in my head. I imagine myself arguing with my psychologistthat I have. I'm thinking about what kind of business I'm opening up in the future. I'm thinking about standing up to change my bedsheets. But no, I still have to throw the laundry into the dryer. I'm thinking of all of these at the same time!!!

Thanks for hearing me out."

qczpjy,1,2021-10-21,Bit of a strange one… accused of mental health issues,winder30,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qczpjy/bit_of_a_strange_one_accused_of_mental_health/,"Ok, I’ve been married for over a decade to my wife who has very bad contamination OCD. She’s currently studying to pass the exams required to practice as a Doctor in my country and has no experience working as a Doctor (other than a 1 year internship.)

For the past few years, every so often she will keep accusing me of having autism; more specifically Asperger’s syndrome. This is a blanket accusation, with no room to counter it. Basically, she’s making out that I have mental issues and that I am very hard to live with. She now claims that she has had advice on how to live with me… 

The first few times I did look into it deeply online and I’m certain I don’t have Asperger’s.  The reasons she gives - I sometimes like to collect things. Apparently no-one non-autistic would do such a thing. As an example, over lockdown I took an interest in vintage music production (because I wanted to understand audio production) and made a little hobby business out of buying and selling the equipment. That I’m a programmer (she pushed me to study it at university), that I have no social skills (I do with people I find interesting and I want to make an effort, but I’m often quite introverted). Her apologising about me in advance never goes well with me either. If I disagree with her, it’s evidence of my condition and I am unable to understand normal things, apparently. I can say 100% her moods are irrational and her reasoning lacking in logic. - I say so it is etc. 
So she says I’m in denial and of course I wouldn’t find anything wrong with me.

She talks to me like I’m an idiot half the time, doesn’t respect much of what I say to her and eats my time. I’m currently a full time tech CEO of a new startup involved with the development of a new technology, plus work with stocks and crypto trading (and the cottage audio studio trading business). She claims that I do nothing to support her studying (I have done so for the last 5+ years). I often look after our child and somehow juggle decision making / meetings etc so that she can study all day. She’s totally obsessed with studying now, so we have had zero relationship time for the past couple of months; and she studies until the early morning, night and day. She takes a salary from one of our (my) businesses but doesn’t do anything for it. Any business discussion is immediately shut down. 

I’m certain I used to have very bad social anxiety, but nothing more complicated than that, and it’s much more tolerable now. If I ask her what it would take to make her believe otherwise, she states that I would have to visit a doctor and she would have to be present ‘to tell the truth’ about me…

I think at best she maybe has relationship OCD in addition to her contamination OCD, and at worst that she is planning to leave me and wants ammunition for a custody case, from one of her colleagues who I’m sure she would know personally. She was physically abused as a child and in a previous relationship. I know that she seems to behave normally for maybe 2 weeks at a time, then irrationally and confrontationally for the rest of the time. 

I would appreciate any thoughts."

Hi

I had a interview yesterday for a company for a customer service role, it's to do with my internship in my 3rd of college for next year. Had the interview and got on well with the hiring managers and thought it went well in general but now I'm having second thoughts is this the area of field I want to go into.

I'm currently studying Software and Electronic Engineering and I've always wanted to do something with computers or in general networks, something in the role of maintaining data bases or fixing software issues that people may have or If the company stuff started to act up and I'd have a role in fixing this issues.

However, tonight I'm not sure If the customer service role is something I'll learn from? Like answering phone calls all day and that just doesn't seem to cut it for me and I'm fairly confident they may ring me to give me the job so wondering what I should do? I feel like I'm being pressured into taking this role as some others in my class have already got their internships more then a month ago and I've tried to full focus on my studies this academic year .

Thanks for any suggestions"

    s = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++){    // n could be any number
        s = s + x

With this digital logic diagram, it is impossible:

&amp;#x200B;

[No Register](https://preview.redd.it/tgc9butftvu71.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cf5c0936ec8756ae3c9e1285fb547847396c77c)

The above digital logic diagram is a logical circuit with feedback. The combination logic unit is an accumulator (with the '+' on it).

Using this diagram Suppose we feed a 1 into the accumulator (assuming we are working with 2 bits). This is the progression.

1. We begin with the circuit above. With the inputs of the accumulator being x and y

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cr2u5whwwvu71.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4cbec178fb49ba146c26cd85ad83d3bfcec4fd8

2. We feed 01 (assuming we are working with two bits of data) into x

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zyt951m3xvu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c240fa17f3aee1ad53f10b1fc384ba629f61b54e

3. 01 is fed into the accumulator, and the output is 01 because we added nothing to 01

https://preview.redd.it/sdiqo8raxvu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cb3a624bb7348ea4509f7bf696a226934597ec

3, We begin the feedback. x still remains 01 because it had not been updated. y is now 01 because we fed the output into y. Sowe feed 01 and 01 into the accumulator

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8w46jzyjxvu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50a5fbfe425070f23902e4f13beaf10f15f96efb

4.  We add 01 and 01 into the accumulator. So we add 01 + 01, which is 10

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9v0v51hxxvu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13d98e3cb662622328b9ec5482a35feb84374a5b

5. 10 is the output. We then want to feed 10 into the accumulator.

6. x still remains 01 because nothing has updated it. y is the previous output of x and y.

7. (this continues infinitely)

So I understand that this loops forever and thus, an incomplete solution.

This problem is completed with the addition of a register.

&amp;#x200B;

This fixes the problem. To preface, I am familiar with registers on a software level and had an internship doing reverse engineering so I conceptually understand how registers work. In this example, how does a register help? How does it add the control? How does it make it so that s is initialized to 0?

I would appreciate this a lot.

EDIT: Solved

Summary as to why the register

I understand registers on a software level. I've interacted with them a lot when I had an internship doing reverse engineering. But, I've wanted to up my knowledge so I'm resisting the digital logic implementations of them. I digress, but it was to illustrate I have somewhat of an idea of what I'm doing.

The reset signal from the register is sent indicates the end of the loop.

As for the initialization, the load signal indicates to replace the state of S. In other words, initialize S.

So, to recap:

The register does the following ( slight over simplification):

1. CLK = State Change
2. LD = Initializes
3. Reset = Control"

They asked me to complete a small excel assignment which they sent me the next morning. I completed it and sent it back the same day. The sr analyst responded the next day with feedback. I had four mistakes: 2 figures were correct but in the wrong section, minor calculation error and another but worse calculation error for a return metric. He said at the end “all in all these are mistakes that are easily learned/corrected. We will discuss and get back to you in a few days with a final decision”

I have 2 choices - I can be placed on a team that is purely focused on pen testing / red teaming. Or I can work on 75% pen testing and 25% incident response.
 
Pen testing is what I am really interested in and passionate about. I have found genuine enjoyment on TryHackMe and HackTheBox. With the little experience I have in incident response, I do not see myself being happy working in that stressful environment and the type of work involved in forensics. However, my prospective employer is encouraging me to work with a 75/25 split with pen testing/ incident response. I can see why and the exposure it would give me would enable me to become more skilled. I also have to consider the future of pen testing. Will artificial intelligence and automation threaten my pen testing career in the future?  

Other personal things to consider - I need a structured routine. It's important for me being neurodivergent. Also me and my partner are planning on having kids in 3 years. I need to discuss with them if they are happy to go part-time / stay at home while I work to provide for our family. Is there any advice you can offer me on these security roles and raising a family?

Any / all advice is greatly appreciated as a newbie to the field. 🔒

This is my fifth year as a special education teacher. I have aspirations to be a special education director one day. Thus, I have begun my masters in Education Administration this year. 

As part of the program, my school’s new principal agreed to be my supervisor. This principal has been great and very supportive. When I was offered an interview to be a school’s special education compliance coordinator (same district), the principal was very happy for me, praised me, and filled out the reference form.

One week later, I was offered the job. I am very excited because it’s a promotion. However, I know it is a hardship for the special education team at my school because they need to hire a new teacher which isn’t easy with the teacher shortage.

I was offered the job on Tuesday afternoon. Yesterday was extremely hectic and I did not see my principal. Today, I went to see them, but they were having a conversation with other teachers. About 30 minutes later I saw them in the hallway but they looked to be in a rush. They gave me a very cursory hello and rushed on. They did not congratulate or even acknowledge the promotion?

In addition I know the admin team met today to discuss the changes due to my departure. However, none of them have talked to me about it.

Considering the promotion was offered several days ago this is becoming very awkward.

In addition, I need to meet with the principal to get a paper signed related to my masters. I need it signed within two weeks. I am not sure if they still want to be my internship supervisor or even if they could since I’m moving to a secondary school.

I don’t think this principal wants to deal with me, but I would like to discuss my departure and I still need the paper signed.

I probably posted about this in other forums so I will just squish it all together here!

I (F23) feel there is nothing I can do anymore.  My parents would rather seen me in a coffin than my sister single.  The guy I like may have just been playing me.  My job makes me feel miserable.  I lost basically all my female friends cause one friend got mad that I’m a virgin and she’s not.  I have gone through some traumatic stuff (and it is apparently my fault), I don’t have the motivation to wake up in the morning, and I just have nothing to look forward to in life anymore.  I won’t go through all I listed but I will highlight a few things.

My sister (F19) has a bf and I don’t.  In my life I’ve only had short term, and even abusive relationships.  She has long term and “good” relationships.  When she was with her ex, I had an anxiety attack when he was at my house, and instead of my parents helping me they were apologizing to him.  My mom told me when I was coming home for break that the bf was allowed at the house and I don’t have to come home.  Also she told me I had “no right” to dislike him.  I’m honestly the guinea pig of the family.  An ex kissed me, my dad got mad.  My sister and her ex were making out on the couch and it was fine.  And my mom wondered with another guy I dated why we weren’t “affectionate” towards each other.  I dislike her new bf!  I told my parents if they care about me they would make my sister and the bf end things.  Yes, they have that power.  They support her financially (and they support me too) so they can hang that over her head.  I told my mom there are so many people she can date so if they break up it is fine!  And she said “it’s sad you want your sister sad.”

Well, I’ll feel you what is sad!  I told my parents, therapist and psychiatrist the same thing.  One of two (or both) needs to happen by a certain date (will not disclose).  Either my sister and her bf breakup.  Or I am in a good relationship.  If neither of those happen, I’m out of here!  My parents literally do not care, my psychiatrist doesn’t seem phased, and my therapist said “if I had the power to break them up I wouldn’t do it.”  Meaning she cares more about some boy she doesn’t know over her client!  Also, if I’m dead she loses a client.

My dad promised me that if I die, the bf will not be anywhere near my funeral.  He “respects my wishes.”  But he does not respect my wishes while alive, why would he when dead?  And I did reach out to this bf via IG DM.  He never read them and I unsent them.

I had abusive relationships and one where I was assaulted.  According to my mom, they were all my fault!

My “friend” told me he loved me in June.  We never officially got together and he disappeared.  Turns out he slept with another woman and didn’t know how to tell me.  He then tried to “protect” this girl and told me I was “too far” and “too young” though neither was an issue before this girl.  I also found out he wasn’t the guy I thought he was.  And people wonder why I built a wall!  Whenever I break it down, I get hurt and it’s built up even higher!

Today, I was talking to the guy I liked.  As recently as last week, he showed signs of interests, including sexual innuendos.  Now he claims his meds make him “unaware” of stuff.  He brought up his exes today.  I said later that they were worth it and I wasn’t.  He then got mad at me bringing up the exes, but he brought them up first.  I am being honest with my feelings and willing to work through a relationship despite his hardships but he is not being straightforward.  Yes, with his exes he wasn’t in his current situation.  But I walk in at a bad time so f*ck me, right?  I actually like him and wanna be with him.  I don’t wanna date anyone for an ego boost.  It’s unfair to him.  This guy is not the reason I am so sad, but he is not helping!

Due to my past traumas I got banned off dating apps for protecting myself, my privacy, or simply revenge reported for someone not being my type.

I interned at my place of employment!  While an intern, I was great!  Now employed I can’t do anything right!  When someone does something wrong to me, they find a way to blame me!  I teach the little ones, so idk if I’m allowed to have anxiety and depression.  Coworkers have shown concerns about me.  It has gotten so bad I think the kids can tell something is wrong!  My kids always tell me they love me and how great I am!  It’s the only joy at my work.  If I’m gone, idk how it will be explained to them.  I would wanna make it as easy on them as possible.  My parents would rather see me miserable than temporarily unemployed.

I’m terribly afraid my sister will lose her virginity before I do.  I don’t want her to be an adult before I am.  It doesn’t matter if I have sex today or in five years.  If she did it already I will never be first.  I will get a lot of hate but if she did I no longer have a sister.  Our relationship is already strained due to her bf.  Why not just not have a relationship?

I feel at this point I will never be happy.  Maybe I don’t deserve to be happy.  I have nothing good going and nothing to look forward to.

Well, I hope this post doesn’t bite me in the butt!  I’ll try to sleep now!"

qd99mo,1,2021-10-22,TW: Sexual Assault | I was recently sexually assaulted and I don't want it to ruin my life,Darth_Rose,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qd99mo/tw_sexual_assault_i_was_recently_sexually/,"I had a reddit account, didn't use it for a while, and then couldn't remember my login so this is a brand new account. Not a throwaway, just new. I'm just running out of ideas and figured reddit is full of people who might have more.

I don't know where to start with this. I (20F) am a full time (16 credit hours) college student majoring in a tech field in my first semester of junior year. I'm President/VP of two different clubs, an RA (Resident Assistant for those who don't know), and I just got the internship I've been going for since last year. I was holding it all together, barely, keeping myself above water and juggling everything but still succeeding and feeling good about things.

A month ago, though, I was sexually assaulted on a date. I don't know how much context to give for that. It was a first date, we went to get coffee and it went well so we talked about watching a movie together afterward at his apartment. I had friends ready to come get me a call away, and I had pepper spray in my purse so I thought I'd made decent precautions and like I said, the date was going well so I didn't really think about worst case scenarios. But we were sitting on the couch, and he kissed me which I was fine with. Then he asked if we could move to the bedroom and I said no, I didn't want to go very far, and he told me no clothes would come off he just thought it'd be more comfortable and then picked me up and took me into the bedroom anyway. And that's pretty much the gist of the rest of it, I'd say no to something and he wouldn't listen, and my phone and purse were in the other room, and beyond verbally making it clear that I didn't want to be doing anything I froze up, right up until he tried to push for actual, like, vaginal sex and I pushed myself away and unfroze enough to get up and go to the bathroom.

I shut down for a bit after that, got behind on a lot of things. I went to a place on my campus that deals with this stuff and they emailed my professors saying I would need some leniency, then I started going to counseling since it's currently free on my campus and my counselor recommended a support group that I have also started going to. I'm trying to take everyone's advice, I've opened up to some trusted people and I'm actively trying to take care of this as much as possible, but I just. Can't really function right now. I've already dropped one class, I'm really behind in two more, I'm planning on leaving my RA position next semester because I can't do it right now, I just know that I'm failing and I can't afford to. Everything right now is super important, this internship I'm starting in a few months is the biggest thing I've ever taken on, and obviously my classes are at a critical point where failing one might lead to not taking pre-recs on time to graduate.

I'm panicking and I don't know what to do. There's already a lot of shame for me surrounding this whole thing--which I know is normal and I'm working on it with my counselor/support group--but the feeling that I'm letting this impact my whole future so disastrously is tearing me apart. I can't help but think that I'll never be able to distance myself from this if it's the reason I didn't get my degree, or bombed the internship with the company I want a full time position at. And there's also the fact that there are people in my life who have no clue what's going on. My parents think me dropping a class and the RA position is coming out of nowhere because I don't feel comfortable telling them about my sexual assault, and they just keep telling me they think it's a bad idea. Friends of mine are coming to me with problems in their lives since I'm normally 100% happy to be the person to help, and they have no way of knowing that I'm not in a place to comfort them right now. I don't have the mental capacity to defend myself at every turn, to tell everyone in my life who's confused and asking questions about this vulnerable, humiliating experience I'm still processing, hell I can't even freaking focus for long enough to do an assignment in one sitting I'm so mentally exhausted.

I'm just lost. At every turn I'm lost. I'd like advice and tips from everyone about any aspect of this situation, from handling people's questions to catching up in school to having hope that my world won't be completely possessed by this thing that happened to me the way that it is right now. Like, I can't even fall asleep without laying in bed and crying for an hour first. Literally any advice. I'm open to anything."

1) I started an internship 10-15 days back, I have the offer letter (mentioning stipend, duration etc). They hired me on the basis of my DSA knowledge. Now they are making me work on their only ongoing project of mobile dev. I am not at all familiar with it. Never done typescript or native (i know basic react). Now they are giving me tasks every couple of days. It’s a 50k line codebase it takes time to understand they get it. They have given me 4 tasks till now i couldn’t do 2 of them (Sr software dev did it for me i did some of it though) and 1 ongoing. I am clearly a bad choice i feel. I dont know the framework and the task feel complex, i have ongoing college so I dont get good enough time to learn syntax and all fast.

Q) i am getting to learn a lot but its taking time for learning things. But they want the task done. Any suggestions on how do i tell them to give me some time for my tasks to get finished ?
Q) i am not being that useful will i get paid like its written in my offer letter? I know i m not being that useful but i certainly am putting time and efforts. Can they do that and not pay me that amount?"

My boss keeps calling me baby and what not. I started of very normally but then all of a sudden he started interfering in my personal life and him being the CEO of the company, I couldn’t say much. 

He calls me whenever he wants, says things which don’t make me feel comfortable. 
Sometimes I’ve told him that I don’t like what he says to me but he still continues to do it.
I’m just an intern and I’ve made so many excuses in the last 2 months just not to be in a meeting with him. 

I don’t have the balls to tell him to stop it because I’ve let it go on for way too far and maybe made him think that it’s alright to say all this. 

I know I messed up but I need some advice.

qdjkbi,0,2021-10-22,Is this a red flag from my employer?,Dotaproffessional,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qdjkbi/is_this_a_red_flag_from_my_employer/,"I'm under compensated. I knew that when I accepted this job, but it's rough out there for new grads with no internships. I have a good work life balance and the learning environment is great, but I'm paid laughably bad. 

I work for a company that gets public funding and is peripherally involved with education and that's as specific as I want to go. I knew the compensation would be low. 

But even without any internships, any experience, someone with a bachelor's degree in computer science from an ABET accredited engineering program should not be making 45k in a medium cost of living City. 

I tracked down our salary guidelines. The position I'm in is system programmer level 2. The position is actually for 2+ years experience (I had zero) and the salary range actually started at 28.5k (holy shit) and went up to 59k. The mod point is 43k. My boss had to pull really hard to get me above the mid point (hr was fighting him on it) since I didn't have any experience. Level 2 is non-exempt (technically hourly) and level 3 is salary. 

Last week I used this as an excuse to bring up a possible promotion organically with my boss. We were talking about people working from home (him and I go to the office every day) and what time most people prefer to work, so I asked if programmer 3 was salary (I knew the answer). He answered, but it drove the conversation to when I should expect to be promoted to level 3. 

He said that level 3 was 5+ years of experience but that (like he did with my current position) he believed he could get hr to approve it after 2 years. 

This was not what I wanted to hear. I can't work for 45k a year for 2 years. I barely can get by now with my private loan payments, now federal loan payments are about to restart. 

I think I'm going to get my 1 year of experience, grind some leet code, polish up my resume, and maybe do a pet project in my spare time, and start applying places at the 1 year mark. The learning experience here has fantastic and I want to make use of it. 

But I don't even think I can survive 45k for the rest of that 1 year. 

I technically don't need promoted to move up to 59k. How should I (and when should I) talk to my boss about moving me to the higher end of the compensation range for my current level. I'd be blunt that I'm not going to be able to pay my bills come February when loans restart. 

But to the question in the title, should I consider it a red flag that a company would keep someone with a CS degree at 28k-59k for 2 years? And that if HR got their way it would be 5? 5 years under 60k in a medium COL city?"

From what I've seen engineering is 90% white male. At an internship meeting the main person mentioned being disappointed at the lack of female/minority candidates. The panel agreed to re-process the (large) resume pool to get more past the resume screen (based on name I guess), and also post around on female/minority specific boards to attract more diverse candidates.

As an asian I thought about this. I understand being diverse is a great feature for a company that seems to be progressive. At a personal level it did feel wrong to so strongly focus on race/gender though.

Being relatively new to the job made me feel I shouldn't speak up about it especially since everyone seemed to be on the same page. But I'm curious if you guys think it's a big deal or not."

While I do find chip design work to be interesting, I'm more interested in designing hardware for more general industries (such as in SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin, Neuralink, or any other ""deep tech"" company). I was wondering what job role would fit that? So far I've heard of these roles: Digital Design Engineer, Mixed-Signal Engineer, and Analog IC engineer. I was wondering what those roles were and how what someone could do to work in those positions, as well as how much they generally pay and how wide-spread they are in terms of industry. Personally, I'm not interested in pure electrical engineering, I really like for the work to involve digital logic/computation is some way.

I've been at this internship for close to 2 months now. My colleagues and bosses are very friendly and encouraging. Well except for one boss but he's just a tough love kind of guy. Praises me but also very harsh with criticism. Anyway, that's just backstory.

On my first day I was super dressed up but I felt so out of place. Everyone was in casuals and here I am looking like I am just about to meet with a client. However, I kept dressing up like this for the entire time because I was apprehensive about if an intern would be allowed to dress casual. Until I was told by a colleague in a friendly conversation that I'm too dressed up.

Here's my main issue: I'm muscular and honestly insecure as well. I try my best to remain inconspicuous and not draw attention and just do a good job. I wear loose shirts and pants to my internship for this reason. If I were to wear a t-shirt, I'm afraid my bosses would think I'm not serious and also call me out for inappropriate clothing due to my body.

Do I just try wearing casual or should I just stick to the normal shirt and pants?"

So I recently received two offers for a 2022 Summer internship, one from Capital One and the other from an AI startup that specializes in NLP.


C1 has a well known internship program and has a solid salary when converting to new grad. It's also more established and can help me as a jumping off point to other companies.


For the startup, it only has about 15 employees, all of whom are generally MS-PhD level. I do find their work interesting but it seems a bit daunting as breaking into AI as an undergraduate I've heard is difficult without higher education and I don't know if I wanna do that as of now. Is this a valid concern? I also don't know how much I would be able to contribute to what they are doing and I don't wanna be stuck with very ""grunt-level"" work. Would companies see my internship at the AI startup as better than C1? That is something that I'm very unsure about. Also, a bit more general question: If I wanted to pursue AI focused SWE in the future, how necessary is it to get higher education to be successful?


For more background, I am interning at Amazon SWE this winter so I have that going for me but I'm not sure which summer option would be the most beneficial. Also I'm not considering money/location at all but purely based on which could be more rewarding and help with future job prospects.

I received an offer from a well known and established company (Company B) that would pau roughly $7,000 more than company A, and the work I would be doing align more with my career goals. This company also has a pension plan that could benefit me through retirement.

Both positions are great, and there really is not a wrong answer to make.

How can I learn about other potential paths?,Specific_Opening_823,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qdqz4l/what_can_i_do_if_i_dont_care_about_web_dev_how/,"Currently a sophomore that transferred into the CS program at the beginning of this year. I was a Chem major for all of freshman year, so I'm a little behind when it comes to CS. I'm currently taking a Data Structures class and we learn with Java. When looking at potential career paths, it seems like everyone on r/learnprogramming want to do web dev. I don't care about web dev at all, so I was wondering about what else I could do. As of right now, I know that Data Science and ML/AI are two potential fields. I don't care too much about the latter, so data science would probably be my preferred option, but I want to try out ML/AI too.


However, I'm not sure where to get started with either option. It seems like most projects and the like are focused on websites, so I'm not sure about any potential projects I could work up too. I don't even know what type of projects data science would involve. How do I even get started learning these if I don't know Python? I do want to eventually get an internship, but I know basically nothing right now and I have zero projects to put on my resume since I started CS late, so I'm going to hold off until next year to apply. I don't even know what projects would be worth putting on resumes. If I were to eventually make a tic tac toe game with an AI, that seems way too simple/common to be worth mentioning. Is my thought process wrong there? 


Does anyone have any good resources or ideas to get started within these fields? Thank you for any help!"

Due to a few factors I will not be able to finish my masters program. 

Firstly it was advertised as a 1 year MFin course only for me to complete my internship this summer and the college tells me it is only possible to do it in 1 year if you have a very specific STEM background. I start the course and took on as many credits as possible only for me to realise i am severely burnt out, and I am just about passing if not outright failing most of my classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

To top it all of someone in my family had covid and my family basically bankrupted itself to keep the person alive so I do not have support from back home which we had planned for initially, and need to get a part time job which is impossible given that I am already failing

&amp;#x200B;

I can't do this anymore but I don't want to lose my job. Should I tell HR now and hope they have extenuating circumstances? Should i ask the bankers i bonded with over the summer? Would it look like i am incompetent to do the job?"

After countless rejections and ghosts, however, I finally got a call today — and a job offer from a company!

It’s at a mid-sized company and not anything fancy like FAANG, but it’s a 30/hr position plus a 1k sign-in bonus and remote as well! Quite literally my dream internship for the summer. I couldn’t have asked for anything better. I actually posted on the sub before about advice for classes and my fear of not having a summer internship, which resulted in me being inundated by a lot of sketchy PMs asking for unpaid labor. I’m so grateful that someone was willing to take me on — and I’m so thankful for everyone in this sub for always having such good advice that I have followed (and thanks to the kind redditor who looked at and fixed my resume).

**Phobos, Sol, 3764-6-17 TSC**

The eleven hour trip was ending, and Daniel fidgeted with his new identification chip as Phobos came into view. Not so much a moon any longer, it had been cracked years prior by Hammond Technologies. The destruction calculated to yield roughly evenly-sized chunks. Those chunks were hollowed out and converted into a sprawling, nearly impossible to navigate cluster of space stations. The entire facility was connected by kilometer thick cable tethers, creating a Gordian knot of stone and metal. CargoRails to Ares appeared as pillars of twisted machinery, clawing towards the red planet like the talons of a raptor.

One looked up from his dataslate, ""Welcome to Phobos, we'll be docking in a moment.""

Daniel sighed, and without looking to the CorpSec officer said ""Can I ask you something?""

""You just did.""

""Is TOortNet right about Phobos?""

One leaned back in his seat and tapped his thumb on his dataslate for a moment before replying with ""I don't know anything about Phobos.""

One watched the captive as he watched the scenery outside. His face held nothing but despondence. He empathized, knowing what was in store for him at their destination. ""But, if anyone did know anything, I'd assume it wouldn't be something worth discussing.""

Daniel looked over to One ""And that's where I'm going?""

""We're not docking on Phobos.""

""Then where are we going?""

""There's another ship waiting. Actually, it's behind you now.""

Daniel turned back to the window and saw an enormous StarYacht. It shined a dull silver in the dim backdrop of Phobos and Mars, appearing like a sleek rifle buttstock from the side. Daniel turned back to One, ""So, AEETES is...""

One simply nodded and gestured to the disembarkation area. The two ships shook hands, and the yacht hanger pressurized.

""Alright mate, I'm going to give you one freebie. Stand up straight, be polite, be professional.""

Almost as if on queue, all three of the AthenaSec officers stood to attention while maintaining hold on their weapons. Two of them positioned themselves behind Daniel, with One leading. They took a moment to fully attach their masks, and brush small debris off their near-pristine armour. They walked in flawless step down a long, winding corridor with two guns at Daniel's back. Every light unit they passed in the hall powered off behind the officers.

As they rounded the final corner he saw a large, red mahogany door finely engraved with sylvan patterns. As they approached the door, it swung inwardly open revealing deep indigo carpeting and a real fire burning real wood behind a polished ebony conference table. Leaning on the table slightly facing the door he saw Lloyd Hammond, wearing a well-tailored long, matte-silver duster. The open coat revealed a light fashionably designed unit of body armour and a personal ES field emitter disguised as a belt buckle. Despite being well into his sixties, the man looked to be in the prime of his life.

Stood still next to him, perfectly upright, was a man who bore an uncanny resemblance to a bulldog, with jowls to match. Short, balding, and in a well-tailored suit. There was nothing that would draw attention to the man if not for the juxtaposition of the business titan grinning widely next to him.

Hammond leapt off the table, and practically waltzed over to shake Daniel's hand while saying ""It's a pleasure to meet you Daniel. Lloyd Hammond, here come on in. You too One.""

In the same motion he turned to wrap his arm around the shoulder of Daniel, and before an objection could be made Lloyd spoke again and began walking him towards the table. ""Terribly sorry about the rather sudden change of your circumstances. Can I get you anything?""

Daniel was quickly brought to a chair before One sat next to him and Lloyd walked to sit across. He scanned the room slowly, before remembering to reply ""Uh, water, please.""

""Of course."" Hammond pressed a button underneath his side of the table and a small wall panel opened, a glass of water on an antigrav disk hovered to Daniel.

""Firstly I'd like to inform you that your grandparents are fine, they're in an evacuee shelter here on Phobos. You'll be brought to them when we're done here.""

""Now, obviously, we know about your Oort Cloud connections and frankly, we don't care. But, Frank Tailors has officially been labeled an extremist.""

Daniel put his glass down and thought for a moment. That explains the name change, at least. Kind of.

""Extremely generous of you. Sorry to be rude, but what's the catch?""

""Well, that's the good news for you. You get a choice.""

""A choice?""

""There's been an opening in the R&amp;D department. You happen to meet the qualifications, and it would be a significant pay raise. It would also allow you to live right here on Phobos with your family members.""

""I'm noticing a distinct lack of choices. What's my alternative? Incineration?""

""Who do you think I am? I've never had anyone incinerated. The alternative is you get relocated to one of our black sites, where you'll be given a severance package. I'm sorry, I have nowhere else for someone labeled extremist. There is a benefit of this location being where your family is also residing for now, also given new names, same family name as yours. The downside is I seem to recall some rather large insurance expenditures in your file.""

Daniel grit his teeth at that, but before he could respond with what likely would have been the stupidest words to be said in this situation Hammond spoke again.

""Alright, I've read a lot of your online communications and the ones I haven't, Jonas there has. I know your thoughts on myself, the government, and the world in general. So, here's the deal. I'm going to throw in an interview with a Solar Elite, if you agree to take the job. I doubt you will get another chance to peak behind the curtain.""

Daniel paused for a moment to consider what was being offered.

""What exactly is this job?""

""You'd be assistant to my R&amp;D heads, mostly Doctor Dave in physics. In fact, your tentative superior left a rather detailed message as to what your duties would be."" Hammond pressed another underside button and an audio player revealed itself from the table in front of Daniel. ""Although, if you play it you need to take the job. Some of that material is quite sensitive and I can't trust you to just leave with it after.""

Daniel eyed the play button on the device.

""What's the pay?""

Another button was pressed and an employment contract came onto the holodisplay in front of Daniel detailing benefits, bonuses, overtime, base salary, and the standard nine-hundred seventy-three page HR form. The numbers were more money for a twelve year contract than anyone in his living memory had made in their lifetimes.

He looked to Hammond from the documentation, ""I'd like to ask one question before I make a decision, please.""

""Go ahead.""

""Does anyone actually know what the hell is going on with the Sol system right now?""

Hammond leaned back and gently tapped the table as he thought, before responding with""I doubt the people who know what's going on even know what's going on.""

Daniel sighed and looked down at the playback device. Not seeing any choice - or any way things could get worse, being honest - he pressed play and listened as the room filled with a Doctor Dave Johanesberg giving six-hundred and eighty-nine reasons as to why R&amp;D needs an intern.

**Terra-AMERIBLOC Presidential Office, Sol, 3764-6-17 TSC**

""The potential for coffee riots is growing daily as shortages increase, Mister President. The Emu Clans have been increasing raids on agricultural SweatStations near Neptune. It also appears that Oort Cloud Orwellians managed to smuggle literature to the Australian Wastes. Clanfather Emstrewth of the Skylord Clan personally sent you this message.""

President Jorje Dontlin looked to the door, but didn't smile. He learned fast smiling was bad when that guy was in the same room, but he really liked when they wheeled in the holoprojector. The squeaky-squeaky wheels were funny. Dummies are so dumb for not letting the most powerful Big Boy alive smile and laugh when he wants. Those Orwellian Emus were dummies too, Dontlin thought. After all, he has the Nuclear Electromagnetic Radiological or Firebombing football right on his desk.

He never touched it, for to remove it from its glass casing would force him to press a letter and satiate its bloodlust. That said however, his reasoning was mostly due to the fact he didn't know the code for the padlock.

The image of the Clanfather filled the office. Behind baleful red eyes which stared into the soul of Jorje, he could see thousands of Skylord Warriors arranged in marching formation. With biologically enhanced musculature he was as large as an Olympic weightlifter. Further adding to his horrifying visage, countless augments covered him. From the screech emitter, to the fusion-chain talons, and anti-missile point defense systems. The most intimidating in Dontlin's mind were the UNTMIL-grade antigrav wings with attached strafing miniguns. To simply add to the insult factor of the message, he carried the master-crafted RHMFG he had stolen from the AMERIBLOC Presidential Office six Presidents prior.

""Traitor-Clan hu-umens have told history of Nineteen-Eighties. Crimes at Animal Farm cannot go unpunished even after thousand hatchings. Enemy-Clan hu-umens will  lose all speedbeans! All belong now to Skylord Clan! For Clan!""

As the Clanfather released his cry for Clan, the army behind him cried out Clan in turn. The cacophony sounding more like a shrieked caw than a word.

The President scowled at the screen and began to breath heavily through his nose, rocking against his Big Boy Chair safety restraints. These birds were such dummies they couldn't even say 'the'. They would never have graduated even the basic courses in The Electoral College for Special Big Boys. Let alone even come close to the intellect, strength, and strategic acumen of The Most Special Electoral Graduate.

""What do the dummies think about coffee!""

""The dummies are taking caffeine pills because they think coffee is mean now, Mister President.""

""What do the dummies think the Emus want!""

""The dummies think the Emus want batteries, Mister President.""

""Tell Emstrewth I'm going to shove Emu Steve's skull up his bird hole!""

""As far as we can attest to justify an invasion of the Australian Wastes we would need a new Space Station-13, Mister President.""

""I. Want. To. Shove. Emu. Steve's. Skull. In. His. Bird. Hole.""

With every word punctuated by two large, meaty fists slamming upon the table, the dummy man slid a spell paper to the President.

""In that case, Mister President, please sign here.""

Sweat had begun to bead on Jorje's head by the time he had managed to pick up a pen without snapping it in his righteous fury at the avian arrogance. The worst part of being the most powerful Big Boy in the world is you're the only one allowed to know magic, so the President needed to cast all the spells for the dummies. Even the simple stuff.

*-W H O R E H E Y D U N T L I N-*

Jorje managed to calm down after writing his name. The scratching of the pen on the paper was quite relaxing.

""What was that paper!""

""It was to force the rich dummy on Red Rock to make us guns to shoot the Emus that are NOT Emstrewth. And, capture Emstrewth so you can shove Emu Steve's skull into his bird hole.""

He knew this was a time he could smile, but there was so much more than that. He could do the finger pyramid. He did so, and looked to his slave girl.

""I think it's time for a Change of Office.""

As he walked down the Hall of Ghosts of Presidents Past, he shuddered. The faintly flickering slightly translucent specters glared at him, standing on their Ghost Disks - Jorje used to think they were holodisplays because they look the same, but the unfun dummie reminded him of his studies in The College.

All seventeen-thousand prior lifeterm Presidents judged his every action in office, ensuring he stayed loyal to The AMERIBLOC Backers. Even the most Special of Big Boys grow tired with the awesome power of Presidency, and commit ceremonial suicide with two gunshots to the back of the head - just as First President Scott Poor did all those years ago.

He was led down the long hallway to The Room. The heavy, black oak door silently swung inwardly open, revealing the candlelight room within. The walls and flooring emblazoned with occult sigils etched with pastels made from the blood of virgin goats, hand-scribed every President to hold office, and a five-pointed star altar elevated in the center of the room.

Jorje somberly approached the altar and assumed face-down starfish position as the underage slave girl was ushered in, covered in elaborate masking to protect her modesty. It was to be her who would carry out the ceremony.

\-----

Famous Dwarf Character Actress Largo Mockingdale sighed as she dragged the diaper genie from under the alter, smudging the crayon drawings on the floor. She ordered herself to grow a spine and demand a raise. She told herself yet again she isn't paid enough to deal with all this Presidential shit. She decided she would do it on incinerator maintenance day.

\-----

After the ceremony had been completed and the incense lit, the Sarcophagus of Souls emerged from the Pits of Hades and hissed open. Jorje entered his sleeping chamber.

The chamber began providing his reeducation. Twelve hours later, he awoke in his office with a PresMedz IV hooked into his arm.

""Good to see you awake Mister President, you fainted again.""

Jorje blinked and looked around his office, feeling as if he wasn't quite awake or asleep. Must be a fresh IV. ""Oh, dear. At least I wasn't on the plane this time. Has Vunthner called?""

""Your meeting with the Executive Order Panel isn't until tomorrow morning, Mister President. Try to get some sleep.""

His nurse was so sweet, always letting him sneak some quick sleep in the office. Such a shame he never remembers to ask the dwarf her name, he thought. He decided to ask her when he wakes up, however."

Now, I am a freshman in college. I want to apply to internships at top US companies (I go to a target school) and I think I will have a fair shot at the LeetCode questions that I will be given.

However, there is this talk in the interview process that I have to know frameworks/build my own projects/talk about what technologies to use... that I am just not interested in. The idea of going out of my way to write ""some project"" and post it on GitHub for no one to read or use, just for the sake of talking about it in an interview, is not appealing.

Still, I think that the courses that I will be taking and the research that I might do with professors can teach me those aspects of CS. I don't know if the CS courses that I will be taking this year will teach me much about that though.

qe0210,1,2021-10-23,Having second thoughts on doing a BA instead of a BSc?,RedScorpinoX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qe0210/having_second_thoughts_on_doing_a_ba_instead_of_a/,"Hello~

First off, my (21M) academic situation is a bit special. I am from Spain and two years ago I started an associate's degree (not really but something similar which in Spain is called Higher Technician Diploma) in Computer Programming. I didn't want to go study a BSc in Computer Science because I was burnt out from highschool and it seemed everyone was following the same path (fun fact, one of my then friends went into the there and recently abandoned it because it was too much to handle). 

So, there is a thing called dual studies, in which you, as a student, get to work during your second year of associate's while studying, both part time. I went into a big consultancy firm as a paid intern for the first year and then I remained there for another year as a junior backend developer after getting my associate's, so, tadda! I have two years of experience in my field.

Then, life happened and I really needed a change, so I quit my job and, using my savings I came to Denmark to get a Bachelor's of Arts in Software Development as a Top-Up degree (two years instead of four). It's been two months and I already have a job as a junior backend developer again, this time at a start-up, so things are going really well, but I have had this feeling this whole time that I am not really that interested in web development (which I usually find to be what I qualify for)

I've always been the type to like science and math. When I was a kid instead of meeting with my friends I was coming home to do physics and maths exercises off the internet as a hobby. I've always been interested in low level programming (embedded systems, assembler, graphics computation, game engine programming etc.) I can watch so many videos of The Cherno in an evening and have even tried learning OpenGL and how the GPU pipeline works. In my associate's we had a teacher which gave us hard assignments to complete, like implementing our own cipher to a client-server chatting app we made from scratch using sockets, and we had to manage how many packages we sent at a time because the encrypted data was much larger than the raw one, everyone hated him but I loved every second of that subject. However, I feel I miss so many scientific concepts to be able to understand everything I want to do completely.

I don't like what I'm studying right now, everything is focused on enterprise software, managing large systems, test suites and, don't get me wrong, I think it's very useful, but I think I won't ever be able to work in more niche jobs as the previously mentioned ones with my qualifications and experience. I was thinking of going back to Spain once I finish my Bachelor's here and start a BSc in Computer Science, but that would mean not having time to work and, being 23 at that time with maybe 4 years of web development experience (and little to no money because of how expensive Copenhagen is), starting an academic life again would probably be detrimental to my career, especially being in the same field.

Any thoughts?"

Should I just wait until my second year of college to apply to these internships?"

# Profile

**Undergraduate Institution and Tier/Ranking**: International Student, graduated from a Tier 3 college, the college is nothing fancy. 

**GPA**: 9.6 out of 10 (COVID has inflated GPAs quite a bit due to at home exams, take this with a spoonful of salt) 

**GRE**: provide breakdown of quant, verbal and AWA, e.g. 168Q, 167V, 5.0AWA

**Research Experience**: None in a formal lab, have two papers which were mostly a self effort 

**Publications**: 

Two, first author in both.

1. An accepted conference paper in an Indian IEEE conference hosted by an IIT 
2. A second paper currently under review, not really counting on this one too much

**Work Experience**: 3 Internships

1. 5 months an intern in an international consultancy (Think like TCS, LTI, etc but smaller)

2. 6 months as an intern in a startup 

3. Another 3 months as an intern in a brokerage firm


**Letters of Recommendation**: 3 fairly strong LORs from professors I have worked with, the first two I have written a paper with them mentoring me and the last one is my advisor for my final year project.

I’m in my last year of a cs degree, and I’m also currently working part-time for a year-long internship at Intuit.
The internship it’s suppose to end in august, when I’ll graduate, and there is a possibility they’ll offer my full-time.
The thing is that I wanna try to get into for an Masters degree, but it’s not final.
At the same time, I saw all the FAANG companies started their internship application for next summer, and I’m wondering wether to send it my resume.
Would it be very bad to leave intuit for another internship, if they offer me full time?
I want to progress in my career and get into a FAANG company at some point, I just don’t know if it’s ok to turn down a full-time offer the one-year internship, to move to another internship.
What do you guys think?"

But I don't know what I should do first to have this job, like in the future: should I intern in Big 4 audit, or in Investment Banking? Is there a job called Financial Analyst or does it refer to FP&amp;A, Auditor?

I am a CS student who is living in a country which is not the US and would appreciate some advice on my situation. I have full working rights to go the United States (won't need sponsorship or anything) and would be excited to work there in the near future. My issue I think is that because I have lived outside of the US my whole life and I don't go to well-known school + don't have a US address, I believe its hindering my ability to get OAs/past the resume stage. 

I guess the biggest factor currently bothering me is even when I don't get resume rejected/ghosted and I ""pass"" an OAs (with what I think are decent to optimal solutions), I still get rejected. I am also in the process of redoing my CV based on the advice I see online. 

I have been interning  since last month at a super cool company that is well-known in my country but doesn't have much of a global reach. I have loved working here so far. So I definitely see a path where after my internship I work full-time at this company as I'm learning heaps and I definitely have become a much better developer.   

As I have almost completed my degree in three years, I could graduate in May '22. But I am allowed to push out my graduation to May '23 (take ""a gap year""/with 1-2 chill classes), I am nowhere near perfect at LC/System designs so I could really use the time to get really good and I am lucky to be in a position where my parents fully support me, regardless.

So I was wondering what the best path forward to land a software development role in the United States?  Should I essentially graduate rn and work full-time at a cool company in my home country and bet that I'll get more interest after I get 1-2 years of real work experience OR push back my graduation to May '23, work part-time (I have been offered part-time work at the company) and grind DSA till I'm a god, with the hopes of better luck?

TLDR: CS major with full working rights in the USA, living in random country struggling to get US company OAs, etc. Should I push back my graduation with the hopes of getting a new grad offer next cycle or work a year or two at a company in my home country?

Thank you for any advice, thoughts or help!"

Given all of this I was thinking of applying to lots of internships and see what happens. Obviously, a lot of the roles are for the summer and as the question suggests, there is about a one month period from June-July, or mid-June to mid July where I would be unavailable. So logically I am going to apply to a decent number of spring internships, however what I was wondering if there are any demerits for applying for an internship that I would most likely reject even if I got in. Obviously there is the time invested but I am thinking that would be offset by what I would learn from the application experience."

I ended up losing my patience and got angry at one of my grp members and messaged her abt it, because she’s not speaking up and voicing out her opinions when her thoughts are important towards our project planning 🥲

I’m the only one speaking for us which doesn’t make sense to me because she’s in charge of overall concept which means she’s supposed to have a real idea of what she wants to plan out??? She’s also the leader but she keeps quiet during meetings and let me do the note taking which makes me think she isn’t putting in effort.

I feel bad for telling her off, but she’s been doing this since some time back in May and she hasn’t changed one bit even after internship. Her excuse for not speaking is “oh I’m tired”, “I’m done w/ everything hahahah”, but who isn’t tired? 😅

I immediately feel bad after telling her my real thoughts since I’m always someone who rather suck it up and suffer instead, so at least I can get good grades if someone does the job, but I really can’t take it this time because it’s our final year and GPA is really important 😅

qe8n39,135,2021-10-23,I found something terrifying in the slush pile,Hemingbird,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qe8n39/i_found_something_terrifying_in_the_slush_pile/,"A couple of years back I landed an internship position at a mid-tier publishing house. They are big enough that I’m willing to bet that you’ve held a book of theirs in your hands, but not so big that I’d expect you to recognize the name. Swimming in debt deep enough that I constantly felt as if I would one day just collapse, having drowned in it, I was excited. And nervous.

I found out about the job after seeing some online jobs. *Do you harbor a love for the written word? Join us at [REDACTED] this summer*. As a failed—no, I believe the proper term is *struggling*—writer in possession of a very expensive piece of paper declaring my degree in literary theory, I was willing to do anything to convince myself that my efforts had not been in vain. I pictured myself in heated discussions with titans of literature, helping them free their Pietà from the marble of their minds, and I imagined them being astonished at the breadth of my knowledge. Perhaps even insisting on reading my work. Alas, I was sent to the slush pile.

For those of you not in the know, the slush pile is a euphemism used by publishers to refer to the work they’ve received that they haven’t yet had the chance to read. Hopes and dreams. Bitter tears. Ambition. It’s all in the slush pile at some point. Sorting through it all is a task given to the lowest of the low. And at that time, that was me.

Among our fellow humans, there are some with a degree of confidence that is utterly remarkable. Convinced that they could quit their careers and become celebrated writers at the flip of a coin, they are able to generate prose so meandering and lacking in every quality worth mentioning that it’s difficult to imagine that they have ever read a book before. I saw a picture once. Hold on, let me find a link. Ah, [here it is](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:O.2.14_f.60r_DetailElephant.jpg). A Medieval artist, painting an elephant, based on second-hand accounts. That’s what it felt like. Like these people had heard of novels but they’d never actually read any. Yet, they were convinced they could write one. I am not kidding when I say that 99 percent of everything I found in the slush pile was pure trash that no one would ever want to read. There was one work, though, that I’ll never forget.

I had been there for a couple of months when I found a manuscript that seemed a cut above the rest. Polished. Professional. Mr. Linden, my supervisor, had mentioned that seasoned veterans would sometimes ship off work under pseudonyms to unsuspecting publishers and for me to be on the lookout. So it was with some nervousness that I began reading.

It started off in a very apologetic tone. *Dear reader* this and *patient reader* that. I felt sorry for whoever wrote it. At least at first. It was a first-person narrative, detailing the life of a troubled old man. It certainly didn’t give off the air of a prestigious writer. A bit disappointed that I wasn’t about to earn a meeting with Stephen King or Ursula K. Le Guin I kept reading. As a senior editor of no importance, the old man had lost his lust for life. It wasn’t until one fateful morning when he chanced upon a young man in the park that he felt a spark of excitement for the first time in a long while. Reading Proust with a serious look on his face, the young man had managed to wake something deep inside the old man that he thought dead since his days of youth. Knowing it was wrong, he began stalking the young man. He would follow him to coffee shops and cafés, sit a comfortable distance behind him on the bus, steal glances from outside his apartment; it quickly became a thing of obsession. Then an idea formed in the head of the old man. Being too shy to make a direct approach, he would instead play the long game. A position for an internship was coming up and he paid for advertisements to be directed specifically at this young man. The day when he finally received a response he was over the moon. He leveraged his senior position to ensure that the man would be hired and that he would end up in his very office. Then, after all this was done, he assigned him the duty of sorting through fresh manuscripts. One of them contained a story written by none other than the old man himself.

It had been building slowly. The panic, I mean. At first I found the coincidences to be amusing. But then it dawned on me that there were too many of them. Far too many.

The story went on. *I have a confession to make*, it read. *While the young man diligently went about his business, I went about mine. I had to find out what books were on his bookshelf. One day while he was busy I stole the keys from his coat and I had a copy made. And I let myself into his apartment. There, I was delighted to see that his taste in literature matched mine. And the pure ecstasy of the secrecy thrilled me—I felt young. I sat in his chair and I read his books and I felt our spirits grow closer. At this point I know in my heart that we are meant to be together. And what a pleasure it is to write these words from the comfort of his very bedroom, his scent and warmth still lingering.*

I realized with horror that Mr. Linden had been coming in late, sometimes staring wistfully at me soon after arriving. My skin crawled at the thought of him invading my privacy, even breaking into my apartment like a sociopath.

*One of these days I will find the courage to let myself in while he’s home. Oh, how I long to sink into his sweet embrace.*

I discarded the manuscript and quit my internship that very day. Mr. Linden called me constantly for a few weeks. Then it grew quiet.

I ended up leaving the city. Changing locks didn’t seem like enough. At night I imagined I could hear someone fidgeting with a key.

To tell the truth, I’d managed to move on with my life. But today I received a package in the mail, and it has a familiar look about it.

Polished. Professional.

He found me."

In the final semester of my graduation (Jan 2021 - July 2021), I had a time to experiment with different professions. So eventually I found my passion in UX Design (Mar 2021). 

So took a course online on Coursera platform and completed the certification. I secured an internship offer on (19 May, 2021) as a Senior UX/UI intern and on Sep 1, I got a full-time offer in a company. So without research and since they are offering a good pay, I joined the company. Later I realised that there is no learning curve over there so I resigned my the job on Sep 15 and started looking for jobs again.

I came across a LinkedIn post (a big reputed design company in India) and reached out the job poster. After two successful interviews, they really liked my profile and offered me a role. But the pay is significantly low but I'm very happy and I see a lot of learning curve there. I'm also a tutor teaching people on how to use a design software.

The problem is my dad is the only guy who understands me. He believe in the process that growth takes time. But my mom, my brother (mom's son) everybody compare me to my cousins (two females) who studied Computer Science and got higher pay than me.

They always compare me with them and says that she is getting higher pay than you, what did you do those four years of graduation and all. Even though I said that the current profession I'm in doesn't match with what I have studied, they don't understand. I wish I could move out but cannot do it since the offices are not yet open in my work location.

Now how do I stop this comparison BS from my family with my cousins? I'm really really happy in my new company and I can see my future grow. My dad is the only guy who is supporting me (even though he don't say it, he never compares me with anybody). 

Please please tell me what should I do to cope up with it."

Now I am in my final year and I've made a group with my friends, who are all not good at programming, and being the best at programming (even though I'm terrible at at, I'm comparatively better) I'm the one doing all the work. My friends aren't doing anything and as the group leader I'm not giving them any tasks, as they won't get it done anyways, and will instead bombard me with questions, and it feels easier to just do it myself somehow.

But I've only done basics. Actually I did half of a pdf of python basics. My project includes webcam sharing and screen sharing of multiple people, for monitoring students during online exams so they don't cheat. I'm struggling to find sources on the internet that will help with that. I've found youtube videos about webcam sharing but I can only find screen sharing of one person only on the internet, and I can't understand any of the code of the screen sharing. So I was wondering if there were any courses I could do that relate to screen sharing and webcam sharing, as I can't find much on youtube (I did find stuff about webcam sharing, but not screen sharing). I found some code on Stack Overflow but it wasn't running on my computer.

A friend of mine advised me to do an internship. He says all you need are basics and it will help with my project to get some coding experience. But with a few months left I don't want to do an internship as it will take time away from the project. I also don't know much coding and I think I will struggle a lot with an internship and need to work on the basics more. What do you think?"

Going through the search of colleges has really sobered me up to where I stood a bit. Not like I thought I was elite academically, but I was hoping for a lot of things that didn’t come to fruition. Freshman year being a weird adjustment, alongside online schooling hitting me a bit hard in some parts did do its thing, and my scores kinda hurt for it. It’s not like I didn’t do alright, I’m still in the top 35% or so in my class, but there’s a lot to reflect on now that I didn’t think about then. Still think I’m not out for the count on the places that I was looking at prior but, It’ll probably be better for me to pursue transferring if that is where I want to be.

Anyways, I’d love to get some input on whether my range of colleges is about around where I stand, alongside some other recommendations.


Background / Stats:

Nationality: Black / African-American
Place of Residence: Connecticut

Major: Computer Science
Minor: Something Business Related

Cumulative GPA (on the 4.0 weighted scale): 3.85, 3.5 Unweighted

Each Year (4.0 Weighted): 

Freshman Year - 3.62

Sophmore Year - 3.94

Junior Year - 3.91

Term 1 Senior Year (2 weeks left): 4.55 (I don’t know how much it counts for anything, but I put in a lot of work this quarter)


Courseload: Mainly Honors / AP 

Not Including Senior Year: (5 Regular (3 Half Credit, 1 Full Credit, 1 Quarter Credit Pass / Fail ) 17 L3 (16 Full Credit, 1 Half Credit) 2 AP (All Full Credit))

Including Senior Year: (5 Regular (3 Half Credit, 1 Full Credit, 1 Quarter Credit Pass / Fail ) 19 L3 (16 Full Credit, 3 Half Credit) 6 AP (All Full Credit))


Stuff probably worth noting:
I’ve taken every CS class that has been offered by the school I go to (so the two aps and the python course)
I’m currently taking AP Calculus, AP Government, AP CSA, and AP Psychology (took AP US History and AP CSP last year) - Have an A or higher in all of the ones I’m taking this year.
English is not my best subject, usually have around a B- there (though it’s alight this year). Math was pretty good outside of Junior year where it was eh. 
My essay seems to be good, reviewed with around 4 teachers.

SAT: 1280 (640 Reading and Writing  / 640 Math)

Alright ECs: (50 Hours of Community Service, Summer Internship at my school (had to apply, do an interview, was paid a wage), Music Honors Society (Tri-M), Summer Religious Leadership Program a town over I did after I graduated from HS, Public Github of around 5-8 small-moderate sized python projects, some article work for some websites)


College Preferences:

Moderately Sized - Big School around where I am (Connecticut), preferably somewhere where I can get internships with regards to my major for experience reasons and the possibility of transferring later on.


Cost: Not too worried about it but not anything obscenely priced.


My list - Places I have been looking at or am planning to apply to:


I have hardly any Chance / Parents Want me to Apply Here, Their Money / Demonstrated Interest in Transfer Tier:

Yale University, Columbia University, Stanford University, Cornell University, Carnegie Mellon University

Hard Reaches - Probably will apply, but I doubt I have any chance:

Georgia Tech, University of California (San Diego), NYU (probably too expensive anyway), Northeastern University

Moderate Reaches - Possibility of getting in, but it’s less likely than not:

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Boston University, University of California (Santa Barbra), UIUC (unsure if this can be moved down)

Targets - Schools I’ve done pretty good research on and I’ll probably apply to all of them:

University of Connecticut (this feels like a perfect match lmao), University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Stony Brook University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Syracuse University, University of California (Irvine)

Safeties:
Quinnipiac University, Fairfield University (probably could use some more here)


Things I probably have to work on / would love some input on:
My list of safeties
Recommendations on slight reach colleges that are good for my major
Whether my placements are good for my stats, also if these schools that I just started looking at (PennState, Fordham) are worth a good look
Advice for transferring as I want to keep that an option later on

Every piece of advice I see online just says ""study Data Structures and Algorithms"", but this feels quite vague. DSA is such a massive topic, studying it all seems futile as I will never be able to reach all of it. Does anyone have any (anecdotal or otherwise) advice on specific areas I should study, the difficulty of the question, or general advice on how to best prepare myself? Any advice will be more than helpful!

Side question, I was given a referral by a friend who interned at Google. How far will a referral at google help me? Will it stop being helpful after I pass the resume screening phase, or will the hiring committee take this into account after my technical interviews as well?

Unrelated:  
For anyone wanting to know the timeline for my application process, here it is (figured some people might find this useful):

7/16 - Referral from a friend who was an intern at Google  
7/28 - Applied to the Winter 2022 Internship Position (the day the apps opened I believe)  
9/22 - Sent an OA (easy/medium problems on Hackerrank) and a quick survey about my personality  
10/18 - Candidate Questionaire (asks questions about what I would want to do at google)  
10/19 - Invitation to do 2 technical phone calls (must be within 3 weeks of this date)  
10/28 - Date the 2 technical phone calls are scheduled for
11/4 - I was informed I passed my technical interviews and have moved forward to the project matching phase
12/6 - I was informed two teams would like to speak with me
12/8 - First intern placement call for internal tool team
12/9 - Second intern placement call for Google Chrome team
12/14 - Informed that I would be given an offer from the Google Chrome team
12/21 - Official offer is given to me

Edit 1:
I was just informed I passed my interviews!! Im in the project matching phase now. Ill try to keep this thread as updated as I can.

Edit 2: 
I finally matched with a team (Google Chrome) and am just waiting on the official offer to be sent my way."

qevhlw,3,2021-10-24,I'm literally worthless. Seeing others around me succeed makes me feel like an utter disappointment...,Whyisittodaysob,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qevhlw/im_literally_worthless_seeing_others_around_me/,"(Very long depressing story about being a worthless person. Attempt at a Tl;dr below) 

(This is an old post I have posted before but I feel like I'm feeling useless again. I won't even read my own comment because it's long and I feel stupid reading my own words that are pouring out of my depressive rut... If you don't want to read all of it, I 100% don't blame you. I've added one new paragraph just to add something. Anyways, thank you for even giving your time out of your day to read one word of this)

I'll basically show my whole situation even though it's embarrassing. I'm 24(M). I have an Asian tiger mom who wants to put education above all else. With possible undiagnosed ADHD, my whole life I've been doing nothing but procrastinating, having no motivation, always screwing up in the class room, forgetting everything, etc (basically ADHD things). I was doing College and I did pretty bad the first semester and it plummeted my GPA badly. I ended up meeting my first ever girlfriend during my first semester. I started spending. A lot of time with her and at her family's house to which I kind of just moved in rent free. I feel incredibly guilty about this and everyday I think about how I'm nothing but a pathetic leech and I'm literally providing nothing. I help her family with their business and they work a couple of hours a day an. I make some money along with my GF. I ended up taking Online classes because I always hated going to Campus and sitting there for an hour or two when I forget everything anyways. I always try taking notes but they need stick in my head and everything a teacher says immediately dissipates from my mind. I started taking online classes. They allowed me to have much more free time and I just do quizzes, tests, or assignments every week. I would alway drop out of classes that had teachers that wanted a ton of work to be done every week that seemed insane. As I took more and more online classes and bettered my GPA, the online classes at my school started to dwindle and I would only take one or two online classes a semester. Getting the motivation to drive there and drive back while waiting there bored out of my mind when I know I won't retain anything was making me feel terrible. 

****Going on Facebook makes me feel like an utter failure. I see people with actual jobs and graduated while I still haven't graduated and I couldn't even hold down fast food jobs mainly because of some back problems and overall procrastination laziness. I hate it. I would love to work in something that I actual want to work in like writing but that's a no go**** (added extra paragraph in post)

I missed being the early freshman where I lived at the dorm and I wanted to walk to class, even if I still went absent for some days because I just didn't feel like it. I may have done bad but being away for the first time made me want to go. 

I never had a job before going away to college either. My first job was as a busser for an entertainment company. I was actually excited and I would clean tables quickly and efficiently. Even the management said they liked how quick I was. Problems eventually arose as there were ZERO breaks. I would work 7-9 hours with zero breaks and my back would literally be hurting very bad. It was so bad that my back almost gave out and I almost fell. I haven't seen a doctor for it (since I'm a pansy baby) but in middle school I was diagnosed as having some level of scoliosis so it may have gotten worse. My mom always told me it will get better and it never did. 

I gave out, I was already a lazy, procrastinating, possibly ADHD riddled mess but now, I just hated working. I hated standing there when all the tables were done and just messing with a fidget cube because I couldn't stand still. I hated all the coworkers who were just lounging around and I did most of the work in our crew. I hated how I couldn't talk to my GF for a few minutes while she was there but my boss who scolded me could talk for hours to her husband about meaningless stuff. Most of all, I hated seeing my family visit me there and seeing how miserable I was. I just broke and ended up crying so much. 

I ended up quitting and got a new job at a food place in the Mall. I couldn't work the cash register since I couldn't remember how to work it. My social anxiety kicked in when talking to customers to where I would be shaking intensively in my boots. My social anxiety can get so bad where I forget everything. One time, I auditioned for a music group and I had the whole song in my head. I usually love performing in front of people but there were only two people and a camera without any background music. I froze and couldn't remember the first word of the damn song... 

I still had back pain and I always felt inclined to not go and hang out with my GF who I don't feel awkward with and I feel like I can be myself. I would have some sort of excuse for work and I feel bad because I bailed and I wouldn't go because not only did the possible ADHD kick in, but the unwillingness to do anything that seemed like work since I just felt empty doing it. 

I stopped working jobs and just started working with my GFs family. It's an easy job and I get to be with my GF the whole time. 

(Sorry for getting side tracked.) 

Anyways, I ended up getting in a mess with my parent's tax returns and I couldn't go to college this year. Prior to that, I always told my parents I may graduate next year but it didn't come and I just kept lying because I probably have some parents problems stemming from my mom. She raised me and my siblings for the most part. She would always get angry pretty easily and I was physically disciplined a lot as a child. I was extensively scared of her and I lied a lot to get out of trouble. Now, I'm scared of her and I feel like a failure and I know telling her would make her more angry and she would probably take the car she got for me in High School away. 

I'm lying to my GFs family too. I said I was a senior when I'm definitely not as this point. I didn't go to school this year because of our accountant messing up on the tax returns (because our accountant said my mom and her boyfriend were married when they weren't) but I still said I was going to school since I was afraid of working again  (as well as the usual lack of motivation, anxiety about everything, scared of messing up, etc) after all of those bad experiences. 

I'm a mess. I have no idea what to do with my life. I have terrible time blindness and these past few years flew by and I don't even remember a lot of it. I couldn't even remember a combination of numbers (or anything that I needed to memorize right away) but being unable to remember parts of what happened in my life scares me. I'm going to be old and I won't remember a damn thing and if my wife dies, I will just be alone and can barely remember a thing. 

I only chose my major cause I needed one. I have bad social anxiety but I still changed my degree to Public Relations because of how much time I spend on social medias like YouTube or Reddit. I know about companies that screw up on their PR and I've always thought they need to be on the good side of the public. ""Any press is good press"" is certainly something I do not agree with as bad press will cause your downfall unless you're a rare YouTuber that isn't affected by it. 

Before I changed my degree, I wanted to be a game designer but programming ended up being too hard for me. 

I tried learning instruments or video editing but it always ends up in - Do you have motivation? Usually no but if yes, can you even focus on it? If yes, can you even remember it? Oh good! You remember it? Well that's only because of repetitive muscle memory and you didn't actually learn anything. 

Math test? I only memorize that specific problem's work around when looking over a study sheet. When the test arrives, there are problems that throw a curve ball and I'm completely lost. 

I'm pathetic and suck at everything. The only good things I'm good or decent at are typing (hence why I just ramble and post long stuff), singing/rapping, and video games. I've also been told I'm good at acting but I'm Asian and Asians rarely get any parts in movies or TV Shows. 

For each skills I always found a negative aspect. 

-Data Entry for typing? The jobs are diminishing because of AI and those jobs are few and far between 

-Performing Music? I would honestly LOVE to do this one. It makes my social anxiety go away in most cases. It makes me feel good. I've gotten compliments. It makes my ADHD go away since memorizing songs are much easier and I'm able to move around instead of just standing still so it's much more viable than giving a presentation. Let's be honest though. Being a musician that makes money is a pipe dream and wouldn't come true. I don't even care about being mega rich and I would just love to make a decent living off of music but nope. Some people have said to learn music production but the same thing happens (lack of motivation, focus, memory, etc). I usually try and watch videos to learn specific stuff and I doze out, watch then forget, or just give up and put it off. (I'm also not a good song writer but I can write decent stuff). 

( I know this is a weird thing to add but I've been told I look like a celebrity/famous person and some people said I should since I've got the looks and decent talent but with the pandemic going on and making money off of music being a rarity in general, I don't think it really matters) 

-Video games? I'm good at games but nowhere near enough to make money off of them 

- Hell, decent jobs in general seem so hard to get even if I were actively trying to find one, there are so many other people doing the same thing. They have more experience and talent than me (as well as being normal) so why would a recruiter even pick me? 

I described my experience yesterday where I finally applied for 5-7 ( I forgot how many ) internships that look hours on end because a variety of problems. (Such as the websites being buggy, I had to make multiple accounts for each job position aka I had to put down my job history, information, etc multiple times. Made my resume off of a resume builder site and after putting a ton of work into it, the site tried making me pay a monthly fee when it came off as free. It should at least tell you that in order to make one, you need to pay). I didn't even have the gall to do it. I tried forcing myself and it was awful but I ended up doing it even though I know I won't be accepted. 



I forget most of the things I put off. I tried writing in my notes of anything I have to do but there are SO many things I put off that it gets lost in the sea of notes even if I wanted to do it. Even now, I'm writing this in my notes and I'm writing small sentences to make sure I don't forget what I'm going to say next. 

Hyper focus is a thing for me and I only wish I could apply it to things I want to learn. I have to be fully interested in something to even enjoy knowing something new that I can apply which is usually in video games. 

If you can't tell, it seems like I enjoy things that usually keep my body or mainly hands busy but that may just be a coincidence.


Honestly, if I had to pick out a dream route of how my life would actually get better it would start off like this. 

### 

- Make music and get decently noticed to where I have a fan base. I would love to make a clothing line and work with a person who can draw to make merchandise that people want to wear. I see many celebrities make clothes that are too odd and don't stand out from the crowd or are terrible looking. I would want something that people would wear continuously while also promoting your brand. 

(I.e. Someone asks where someone else got their hoodie or shirt to where it ends up in a conversation about music tastes which will introduce the other person into that specific person's music) 

With the decent popularity, that would improve my chances into getting into acting. I would love to try and voice act. Asians get more roles in voice acting and there are a number of exquisite roles that are more exciting. I would also try and get side acting roles. I know I wouldn't get major roles but I'm fine with portraying side characters. 

I would LOVE to write stories for shows or movies. Not by myself but with a team since I bounce off of ideas because I suck at creating them. This would be amazing but these writing gigs are usually for people who network or those who have a ton of experience in writing shows. I doubt I could even get a spot on a creative writing team. 

(I know people will say go into journalism but I can only write a lot about things I care about. I wrote this whole paper on my experience during college but it's hard to write on paper for college which is ironic.) 

With enough money, I would love to open a business that could have some fall backs in case it doesn't work out. I don't know what it would be but I know I want to dabble in something. 

###


That's just a route that I would like but I know it wouldn't come true. 

For a minute there I actually became somewhat happy when writing all of that down. I forgot that I wasn't a f*ck up that has no value in this world and all I'm doing is leeching off of those who are too good to me and I hate it. 

I just feel miserable and as a as I want to see a professional, they are incredibly expensive. 

I'm a liar, I'm stupid, I'm a sloth, I'm worthless, I'm a leech, and I'm just pathetic. 

I have thoughts about ending my life but no one has to worry about that because of course, I'm also a scared wuss. I'm scared of dying, scared of needles, scared of the dark, scared of heights, scared of customers, scared of literally many things. 

My room with my GF's family has a ton of unwashed clothes piled everywhere. Along with being unorganized I don't have room to put them so in my mind it makes me feel justified that I don't get them done and that includes a lot of my home life stuff that normal people get done easily or right away. 

That's not even mentioning my self esteem issues and even when many people compliment my looks, I am very insecure especially after some negative comments by only a few people about either my nose looking like a certain ethnicity or my acne scars. (Negative comments stay with me for a long time) 

I just have so many things wrong with me and the thing is, as awesome as it is to see people like me in the ADHD Sub Reddit. There are posts who talk about being successful and those who actually persevere while working hard. I whole heartedly feel as if I can't match that at all. 

I honestly don't know anything else I want to talk about or put out there. My mind is now going blank but I feel like there's a ton I want to say but now I can't remember. I'm just constantly moving my legs up and down while refusing to read my own post because I'm afraid that I sound stupid and it's way too long. 

I mean, I can't even read a long passage without skimming through it or forgetting it so my post isn't any special. I apologize if it's too long and I don't blame anyone for refusing to read it or skimming through most of it. I'll try leaving a tl;dr as best as I can. Thank you for taking any time out of your day to read a crappy post like mine..


Attempted Tl;dr: I'm a terrible worthless leech. Living and working with GFs family. Feel like a failure. Did bad at first semester of college then slowly started going to Online Schooling since because of usual ADHD problems as well as getting ready, driving there, staying in a class room for hours when I forget everything a teacher says even when writing notes, then driving back made me apprehensive. Online classes were dwindling and I started taking lesser classes and well as dropping out of them. Lied to them about college since I had two terrible experiences with working and my ADHD is gotten worse to where I can't get motivation to go. Can't learn anything because of lack motivation, focus, and I can't remember basic things (or to even do them). Lied to my Asian tiger mom because I'm scared of her as she gets angry really easily and I was physically disciplined by her a lot. I got other things like self esteem issues, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and I'm scared of a ton of things. I suck at everything and the only things I am good at don't make a career path. I don't even know what to do in life and I only chose my major out of desperation. I want to learn new things but ADHD is making it incredibly difficult. Can't go to a professional since it's expensive and I've tried doing and researching various ADHD methods of help. 

I know I left out a ton of stuff but that's my best effort without reading my long post since I'll just skim through it or doze off. Thank you and sorry for the long post.


EDIT: checked how many words I wrote and it was 3,067. I can do this but struggle with 2 pages in College. I just don't get what is wrong with me 

I also wrote this in the perspective of having ADHD at first but now I don't want to go over and put possibly undiagnosed everywhere since I don't even read my own posts. *sigh*"

We went to different Unis in different cities but still talk everyday, so I know all the things that happen in her life and vice versa.

He was never happy when she succeeded and made it into one of the best companies for an internship. 
Now they both have made up and things are going well. But she told me that things were moving fast, as in they were almost saying "" I love you"".

I feel like I am qualified for alot of internships at companies but since I don't have connections I am screwed. And I can't just make connections with random employees on LinkedIn. Especially since this is the time when people have started their interviews, it's too late to make connections now.

Hello,

I recently graduated back in April with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. After dozens of applications and only a few interviews I was able to land a job in September with the title of Virtual Design Construction Engineer where we use Revit, AutoCAD and Navisworks.

The reason for this post is to get an idea of how my career path will be I have noticed that in my department I have not met any other engineer most of the other workers are field workers that decided to transition to modeling because the company offers the opportunity through and extensive training. I was never asked for my transcript or degree to obtain this job which is what I am most confused about; Is my degree is getting valued by the company? I have a passion for modeling/ designing but also have a passion for analysis such as FEA and CFD which is not done in this role it is more of a pick and place job.

I have been studying to take the FE exam because I am interested in becoming a PE and have yet to know of any PE in my department should I be concerned?

I have no idea if I should stay here gain some experience for about 1 to 2 years or if I should look into applying at other companies as soon as possible. ( I do come from having 0 experience and 0 internships). Any advice or ideas would be appreciated thank you in advance."

Then same day I went to my min wage job came home saw an email from company representative saying she is talking with my recruiter to make an offer letter and want my mailing address. Now that was Friday and I am nervous and having a feeling that this not right or how did I get an offer or something or if they give me offer letter but will they wait until I graduate, like that or what will I do in the company.

My question is just simply: What type of portfolio projects can work on to show my understanding of quantitative programming and financial concepts that would increase my chances of landing a quant internship or junior position? (All other factors aside like education, experience, etc)

Any advice is much appreciated!"
qf1rci,2,2021-10-24,How to decide which internship to take? How to manage internship options.,moonwa1k3r,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qf1rci/how_to_decide_which_internship_to_take_how_to/,"This is for my younger brother. He has an interview for a summer internship on Tuesday. It is with a company that will have him relocated. There are other summer internships he plans to apply to when they become available. These other internship will keep him in Silicon Valley and possibly align more with his interests.
If he does well with the interview, what are some advise on how manage the options? He may not get the other internships, but also he doesn’t want to be committed or burn bridges if he does get this first internship. 
Does anyone have anyone guidance? Also, how to best prepare for the interview and/or interview tips."

I am in my second year of college and I need to start internships. I want to get into finance or maybe consulting.

Has anyone done a local internship at a smaller firm?"

I recently got into the Cornell Meng CS program (entering in Spring), and I wanted to know what an example course schedule looks like for the 2 semesters. 

Do most people finish within a spring and summer semester, or does the degree require a spring and fall semester (and potentially a summer internship in between or something)? 

Also, about housing, am I screwed? I feel pretty late to the party, and have no idea where to start to find places where other grad students live. 

I'm completely new to Cornell, so any help is much appreciated. thanks!"

So I am currently in my final semester of my IT degree, graduating in December. So far in my IT career, my experience is mostly limited to 2 internships (one help desk, one end user support/projects), academic projects and assignments, some workshops, and LinkedIn learning. As I get closer to graduating, I am trying to determine how to build up my knowledge and experience outside of my classes.

Where I'm at right now is I received an offer for an IT rotational program with really good opportunities and pay, but it doesn't start until July. I definitely intend on taking some time off after graduation to travel and just take it easy before starting the job, but I also want to continue to challenge myself and improve my skill set. I know I am interested in cybersecurity, cloud, networking, and have been looking into CompTIA, Cisco certifications, etc. but I am wondering if there are more things I can do in this timeframe, from December to July. I know many people create a GitHub, work on Linux and firewall personal projects, I just find these to be slightly overwhelming and I'm not exactly sure where to begin.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Big 4 incoming intern 2022 here. Just wondering what the typical start season is for interns that get an offer letter to come on as associates after the internship? Is it Spring, Summer, or Fall of the following year? And is there any flexibility in selecting a start season or does the firm choose? I heard it’s generally in the summer or fall, but do any associates come on during busy season (winter)?

I assume a lot of it depends on personal graduation dates but I want to knock my CPA exam out of the way before I come on board, and considering I graduate in December I always assumed I would have time to study in the Winter and be onboarded in the Summer or Fall. But idk if I will have pressure to start immediately after I graduate.

Would love to hear any info!

This past summer I've been incredibly fortunate to intern at a large trading firm and it turns out that it opened lots of doors and now I'm deciding between 3 offers in 3 quite different spaces. I'm super grateful for these amazing offers but I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's starting to keep me up at night...

For a new grad role, I'm looking to grow my career in a fast-paced environment where I can gain lots of responsibilities. Comp trajectory is important to me, but so are the culture and work. I'm indifferent between tech and trading as a whole since I think there's interesting work to be done in both industries. Not too concerned about WLB in my early 20s. Any insight is much appreciated!

**Large Trading Firm (\~500-1000 people)**

Pros:

* More well known than the others
* Really enjoyed interning there this summer
* Will return to a team that I vibed with
* Great perks, benefits, and swag 😎

Cons:

* Uncertain growth trajectory
* Concerned about how fast the firm(s) have been growing, especially this year
* May get golden handcuffed to trading

**Small Prop Shop (&lt;100 people)**

Pros:

* Pays A BOATLOAD
* Firm seems to be doing well
* Some super bright people (at least from interviews)
* I like the tech stack

Cons:

* Concerns about stability
* May get golden handcuffed to trading
* Possibly worse WLB (although I'm not too concerned)

**Series A/B Startup**

Pros:

* Cali ☀️
* Really enjoyed the culture
* Very, very talented engineers
* Incredibly promising product with great founders
* Very interesting work in domains that I'm interested in
* Potential to hit it BIG

Cons:

* Comp is 1/3 of my other offers
* Run the risk of failure
* Even if it doesn't fail it may take 5+ years to IPO

I'm happy to share details about offers in DMs, although I won't be offering insight into any interview processes.

PS. If you have similar offers (either intern or new grad) and want to discuss them with someone, my door is open!

Fully remote. I came to this job as an intern and it was trial by fire. We had O365 and some on prem infrastructure. No ticketing system, no MDM, no SSO (different passwords for everything), no logging system, wild Wild West style CI/CD development. I knew absolutely nothing about Azure AD or O365 or Docker…

I spent months learning everything I could, and going out of my way to find things to improve or add to the company. Now we’re able to entirely rely on Azure AD for pretty much everything. 

I ended up being able to leverage Azure AD SSO with every single one of our business applications. Firewall, CI/CD tools, etc. 

Setup security policies in O365, DLP, Sensitivity Labelling, Conditional Access, MFA, etc. 

I setup  Intune as our MDM and Defender for Endpoint as our EDR tool and JAMF for our Corporate/BYOD devices. I pretty much do all the help desk tickets too. 

I do DevOps as well. I setup our testing infrastructure for our devs. I’ve written CI/CD pipelines before (cut  down one the time of our dev teams pipeline by over 50%). If they need to know about authentication, or really the infrastructure behind their pipelines I’m the guy they go to. 



My boss said himself that I built our entire current infrastructure from nothing almost single handedly. 


I currently make 60k in a high COL area (full health benefits though)  but that wage isn’t really cutting it. And housing is only getting more expensive, and in general, just everything. I asked for a raise to 80k recently, but I was pretty much told to wait, which amounts to no. I don’t think my current company appreciates everything that I’ve done. And I’m at the point where I’m ready to go. 

 
I didn’t write all this to brag about myself. Rather, I feel like the job I have is easy because it’s a small company. 
What jobs out there are running an Azure AD/O365 cloud only setup? I feel like my experience is far too narrow to be applicable elsewhere and I’m basically stuck at this job for the the foreseeable future and I’ve pigeonholed myself.  I read job postings and I feel like I’m nowhere near the level of people they want for 80k. Maybe I’m not as good as I think I am and I should take a step back and humble myself and grateful for what I got right now? Stick at this job for several months and see else I can learn and leave?"

qfhl34,214,2021-10-25,"After graduating college, doing an internship, working retail, going to grad school, and going to nursing school, I just became a nurse. Now I don't want to be a nurse and I don't know what to do. How do I move forward from here?",Idol_Nature,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qfhl34/after_graduating_college_doing_an_internship/,"So  for context, I'm 28M. I graduated college in 2016, and ever since then,  I've just felt kind of lost career-wise. I just never really knew what I  wanted to do and never really had a direction to go in. With my MBTI  being ENFP, I do feel often overwhelmed with options/choices and having a  hard time choosing, so I think that's never helped my choosing a career  path. Somehow I've been getting through and falling into things, but  nothing's ever really ever stuck.

My  current background: I graduated college in 2016 with a BA in  international relations/German/Russian. I didn't really know what I  wanted to do after and couldn't find a decent job, so I did a PR  internship with a local nonprofit. I wouldn't say I learned a lot about  PR from that position, but I did learn a good bit from that job about  non-profit operations. After my internship ended, I got hired and worked  at my local Apple store. After about a year of working there, I decided  I wanted to go to grad school, and entered a PhD program in political  science. I got into that program, and on top of realizing I just didn't  like political science, it was a pretty hostile work environment. Petty  faculty fighting in departmental power wars, petty students trying to  undermine other students... It just wasn't great. I left after a year in  the program when one of my fellow grad students committed suicide inside our office. That just kind of sealed the deal for me to get out of there.

After that, I  thought about what I might want to do. I looked at jobs, and after  submitting dozens of apps, I almost got hired in the KYC/compliance  division of a large financial services firm in their Nashville office. I  was actually pretty excited about that job, so I was kind of bummed  when it fell through.

Cue nursing school. When that job didn't work out, I decided I wanted to go back to  nursing school because it was accessible, and I had an interest in  science, medicine, and helping people. So 3 years ago, I entered nursing  school, and I graduated two weeks ago as the valedictorian of my class.  I passed my boards last week, and I'm now a licensed nurse.

However, I'm really struggling right now. During nursing school, stress was at  an all time high. It just kept building and building, and I started  drinking too much. In my last 4 weeks of school, I did a practicum in  the ER/trauma center at the largest hospital in my state. To be honest,  it was really freaking traumatizing. COVID was *really, really* awful. I  watched way too many people either die or almost die in my first week, and I still had 3 weeks to complete after that. There were just so many  messed up things I saw, I didn't feel okay after that. And I still  don't. I just didn't cope well with all of it. My mental health is  pretty bad right now. On the plus side, the stress actually made me feel  so bad that I had to stop drinking, and I've now been alcohol-free for  about 6 weeks now.

I'm meeting with my therapist in about a week to talk about the mental health  issues, but from a career standpoint, I don't know what to do. I got  hired as an ER nurse, and I'm supposed to be starting in a couple weeks,  but there's no way I can start that job. And if I don't take that job, I  don't know what to do... I have zero interest in working other nursing  jobs available to me as a new grad. There are some nursing jobs I  wouldn't mind (outpatient clinic, outpatient surgery center, etc.), but  they're not available to new grads with no experience. And honestly, I  think I'd enjoy them for a bit, but I wouldn't want to stay in them long  term. I'm now realizing that I really think I just don't enjoy nursing,  and can't cope with the stress of many aspects of the job. Too little  too late, but here I am.

So I have  no clue what to do. I'm still supposed to start my ER job in a couple weeks, but I don't think I'll be able to do that. After that, I have no  idea what my next move will be, and that's really scaring me...  Especially since if I leave nursing, I have no idea what I would do  next. Anybody have suggestions about what my next steps should be or how  I would move forward career wise? I suppose my next focus should be  getting a job, whether that's in nursing or not."

However, my only experience with analytics is business analytics, as I am currently completing a post grad in Business Analytics. With that, the focus is on databases, data cleaning/modelling, and business intelligence. That stuff doesn’t interest me.

While I know and understand the tools needed in business intelligence (Access, Excel, Tableau, Cognos, SQL/R, etc), I’d like to have a better understanding of the typical tools &amp; software used in a marketing analytics role.

I quit last Thursday a job at a production company because my ex-boss has been an absolutely unprofessional hack.

Here's the context:

Last Thursday, I up and left my work as I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, after being talked down and berated by the ex-boss for the umpteenth time. This was a very small production company, who had only 3 people: ex-boss, ex-colleague and myself. I worked as videographer and editor there.

The ex-boss got thru my landlady after Thursday in order to settle my last payment and also deliver some editing materials and videoclips. That he got thru my landlady is already a foul, but I said, screw this and let's get it over with. I specifically asked to be given an external hard drive to transfer these files.

At 10.30pm I get an unexpected visit by the ex-colleague with hard disk in hand to transfer 1.2TB of files. He told me the ex-boss is also waiting downstairs in his car. The hard disk didn't even work, which comes as no surprise since ex-boss doesn't even have a clue about anything involving video production, but he seems to just convince clients to hire us despite that very fact.

Even further context:
Cards on the table, I am an irregular worker in a foreign country. I decided to stay here during the pandemic instead of going back to my home country, because there was absolutely no work available in my expertise, while I could survive here. Not to mention my goal is to hit it big in the country I'm based right now.

So ex-boss said he would regularize my position once I started work with him. They were a hellish two months, in which I almost pushed two close friends of mine away due to my anxiety and constant ranting about the shit my ex-boss did on set.

Exhibit A:
We were filming a webdrama my ex-boss was producing, and we were a small team. He kept touching the cameras after they were set by the filming team, give directions to actors after the director had instructed them. He was also talking as cameras were rolling. 

Exhibit B:
We had to interview an official Russian government trade representative. He got 3 models to do the interview for god knows what reason. 2 of them were wearing short suits. 1 of the models covered up with a cushion while the other was feeling uncomfortable so I gave her the jacket she brought and she covered herself up. Ex-boss swoops in and takes the jacket away saying she doesn't need it.

Exhibit B-2:
I didn't even touch my own camera while setting up the interview, with lighting being pointed at the wrong direction and camera settings - which I had done the night before - changed all over the place. Twice I tried to fix the lighting, twice I was told rudely not to touch them.

I had actually left my home country because I've seen my fair share of unprofessionalism, especially from higher-ups, and colleagues back home are all still struggling with getting paid in due time, with payment delays of up to 6 months in certain cases, despite contracts being signed.

In this new country, this is the second time I've had to endure someone who claims they're boss, but know jack shit about what they're doing. My previous boss, also a foreigner with regularized work, used to exploit interns with no pay, both locally and remotely, while I was supposed to be paid by project.

 I've drawn a line to the point that I swore to do my utmost to set up a company myself one day, and never treat my team the way I've been treated. I've been in a directorial position whenever I've done videography work for 10 years now, but I've always kept my mind open and never said that I knew best, and I look forward to learn from colleagues alike.

And I've struggled, and always knew that there were to be some stressful days, but only sometimes, not every single day over 2 months. And I'm not gonna take any shit from my ex-boss pulling the foreigner card on me whenever I'm left dumbfounded when last Thursday alone he asked me to do tasks A B C in the morning, only to be told to do tasks D E F 3 hours later. In fact, I always made sure to make daily task lists whenever I clocked in, in addition to take note of hours of work done.

I can't definitely tolerate any longer is this culture of rampant abuse in workplaces all around the world, which seemed to have been exacerbated during the pandemic rather than slowed down. 

I wanted to share my case to let people know that this is not only happening in the US, and I wish more people across the globe just start drawing lines and demand better, demand to be treated like the humans that we are at the end of the day. Because I have genuinely had fucking enough of belittling and berating as somehow valid methods to ""encourage productivity"". 

I'm also behind the US film industry strike, and may their demands be met, even more so following the recent tragedy on set."

I posted here recently and received the advice to create a portfolio website and supplement my small internship works with some speculative pieces, which I have done. I have 1 blog post and interview from an internship, 1 academic piece which is an analysis of the use of authenticity in marketing over time, and then 3 short form speculative advertisements and 3 longer form ones. 

I’m looking to further my edge as well as better understand what copywriters do on a day to day basis versus similar roles like social media content manager or editorial assistant. I’m very new to this field and honestly the daily activities still seem abstract to me. So my questions are as follows:

What other types of content can i create to bolster a portfolio for entry level writing jobs? For example, would a creative writing piece be out of place given that i am also applying to magazine and blog writing positions? 

What would an entry level copywriter or editorial writer do on a day to day basis? I know it would be writing but what is the process like in terms of approval, what other skills can I hone to make myself look better since I have no  experience at a creative firm?

Are there any other job titles I should consider that focus on writing (long form preferred)? 

Thanks! :)"

But that's the past!

**What changed?**

* I discovered Jordan Peterson and tried to really dig deep what my interests were earlier in my childhood. I loved creating media! So this is what happened up until now:
* started an internship (got a job there now as well for 2 days/week)
* started another degree after dropping out and working for a year before not knowing what to do with my life
* already pushed through twice as much exams than necessary this half year
* almost finished a Google UX Design certificate to increase my knowledge and job possibilities later on in life
* on bad days I motivate myself with my goal and the needed responsibilities needed for these goals
* quit all social media (except reddit as you can tell but that's more of a selected topic feed than a show-off highlight reel)
* quit porn and started no fap as challenge for myself rather than a magic religion (I am on my second month already)
* searching for a new place to move to a new city, away from my past and memories
* made new friends in this new city to have contacts already later on when I move (and maybe find an apartment this way)
* searched up new jobs when I move and planning to apply soon
* increased my pull-up and push-up numbers to 20 both in a single set
* put on 5 kilograms of weight (being almost underweight)

**So what am I missing yet or sacrificing (which I know is bad in the long run):**

* my goals include having a life partner and starting a family (depends on another human, which is risky and I don't know if this is the right motivator as many people preach to be happy on their own first)
* not eating too much, feeling skinny and not happy with my body yet
* no social life or other hobbies as I focus on the studies so much to catch up on what I lost when dropping out (I am 22), but planning to balance everything when I moved (I am kinda isolating myself eversince which isn't good)
* fucked-up sleep schedule, having way to less sleep than needed and I am feeling it

I am definitely feeling a lot better already compared to March 2021, when the break up happened. But there's no stop yet! I must continue in order to not fall back into the pit I was in and reach my goals."
qfmtve,30,2021-10-25,I was accepted on an internship position as a Web Developer and I'm scared,FeatheredDrake,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qfmtve/i_was_accepted_on_an_internship_position_as_a_web/," I'm super thrilled but equally frightened. I have a bachelor's degree in linguistics and I had no programming or computer science background whatsoever. A few months ago I joined a Front End Web Development bootcamp and got a certificate, then I created a few personal projects for my portfolio and started applying. I honestly had no expectations because I knew my chances were super small with no experience in the field, no computer science degree and no background but today I was accepted within a Front-End Development internship.

&amp;nbsp;

I am very enthusiastic about it, but I am terrified. What are the minimum requirements for a Front-End Dev intern? I am not very good with JavaScript and basically most of my projects are heavy on HTML and CSS. I understand JavaScript syntax and I can adapt JavaScript code written by someone else into my own code, but I struggle with writing my own Js code. I am scared that I'll blow this chance because of my lack of JavaScript knowledge.

Anyone here on this sub who started with a webdev internship and was in a similar position? How difficult are things? I am panicky and I can't seem to calm down, my hands are so shaky. What if I can't do it? What if I'm not good enough?

I just need some positive reinforcement but if you have some real advice for me, it would help greatly! Thank you!"

qfrui0,3,2021-10-25,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/25/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/qfrui0/weekly_job_qa_thread_10252021/,"Hi all,

Here is the ninety-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

So I applied for a FullStack developement internship in Germany and I got to meet the CEO of the startup since I passed every application step successfully.

My friend who is working with them told me that they got other applications who reached the same level as me so that made them take long.

I just feel I’m not cut for CS and that I’m always struggling . I have a B+ in this machine architecture class rn but that is after so many hours of struggling and going to the TAs multiple times. 
I remember crying for the intro to data struc and Algo class also.

Also, I’m on probation but I’m qualified to end it early. I can’t get any student loans due to my low credit (650) and I max used all my federal/grants for this semester. 

I’m trying to work hard now so I don’t have to work at all next semester. Want to get good grades and work on side projects for my major so I can get an internship for the summer.

I did the calculations and if I can survive 2 months at this job wit OT, I’ll have about $5-6k saved up, but if no OT $3k. And if my car goes in a month or less I’ll have 1k saved up.

Summer internships are only offered  under the condition that you are still pursuing a degree. So I would  have to put off 1-2 classes until Fall 2022 to meet this condition.

If  I don't do this, then I will officially graduate without having had any  internships. Do you think choosing this route will significantly  diminish my chances of receiving a full time developer job?"

Sorry I dont go to school and I probably never will but I have heard great things about this program. When I was looking at online masters program, I stumbled on CS post bach program at OSU. I had heard some amazing things from people and how they got great jobs from this job. And I always read the Hiring thread and I see people getting job offers and internships before even finishing this program. This sounds like a really good program and I would recommend it anyone who already has a degree and wants to get a CS degree. The reason I cant do this program is because I already have a CS degree and honestly its from a bad school. Its also based in Canada and the job market there is horrible for entry level developers and I couldn't do internships because I wasn't in a coop program (some stupid thing that Canada has) . So I had no luck getting a developer job. Literally starting OMSCS next fall so I have a better chance at getting a developer job. Also my current job is working as a IT help desk at the moment which sucks a-lot. Anyways the point is if you're in this program you're extremely lucky and I'm sure you guys will definitely be successful. 

Good luck to you all!

I'm at a public, four-year college. A decent one, for a decent price all things considered - roughly $17k per year. I'm going for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I was able to skip my first degree-related class because I already knew and used the material (personally and professionally) from that class for a few years, and am breezing by my current degree-related class. Next semester, it will likely be the same, and some of the fourth-year projects relate to things I have already done in my self-taught computer science journey. There are still tons of things I don't know, but I'm certainly not at the level I am being taught at, and there are no more options for me to skip ahead.

To illustrate where I am at, I will use the example of my summer job after graduating from high school this year. My dad works for a company in Philadephia that gets a Computer Science intern from Drexel University every few months. I worked alongside a third-year intern at the same level, even fixing some broken code written by another previous intern. I was told that he originally had to ask his professor for help, but I, completely self-taught, fixed it all on my own. I created from the ground up (wires, resistors, enclosure, microprocessor) a custom alarm system with a web panel, RFID card scanner, and non-trivial logic, and documented everything, attended meetings where I presented what I was doing, and more. I wrote detailed internal processes that new interns now follow. And I had a similar experience two years prior, at age 16 where I wrote and deployed a software solution to speed up the work of myself and my coworkers by nearly 8x more than manual entry.

But now I'm learning the basics at college. It's like teaching first-grade-level vocabulary to a native speaker. The native speaker might not know all the technical ins and outs of grammar, but he can have the same conversations as an English scholar and doesn't get stuck.

In short, I don't feel I belong here at college. The rational side of me says that college is an important investment and can help raise income ceilings for my life and all that. Living away from home has been a great life experience as well. Then the other part of me says that this is a waste of time; I could be working, living cheaper at home (I would still pay a rent), getting experience on top of what I already have and learning through that, saving, and having a head start in the world by the time my peers would be graduating. After all, I assure myself, a decent proportion of CS/IT workers do not have bachelor's degrees (according to [bls.gov](https://bls.gov)).

I am a proponent of delayed gratification - that's why I convinced myself to come here in the first place - but now I am wondering (and feeling) that delaying gratification in this manner may not be necessary in my case. I've already been employed in my field - albeit at an intern's level. Would it be wise to pursue college alternatives such as CS/IT certifications and return to work in Philly, gaining experience and knowledge hands-on while also getting paid? Or should I bite the bullet and endure college to get the degree while incurring some debt and taking some unnecessary/unrelated general education requirements. And of course make the most of college - clubs, networking, etc.

TL;DR - College? I have had previous work experience in my field at a third-year intern's level before even starting college. I am at college, but feel like I don't belong here. I know college can be a good investment, but working early and saving can be too, especially for starting a family earlier than most people a decade older than me can/do.

Are there any pros and cons I'm missing?"

qfznh1,2,2021-10-26,Career Switch: Science Research -&gt; Data Analytics. How will an employer view a Masters degree?,PM_ME_YOUR_SWAMPERTS,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qfznh1/career_switch_science_research_data_analytics_how/,"Hi r/careerguidance,

I'm currently in a unique situation and a bit of a crossroads. Therefore, I need some unbiased and objective advice, espicially from individuals that actually hire people such as a HR manager.

&amp;#x200B;

The Background: 

I graduated in Australia 2019 with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) with 1.5 years wet lab experience. I wanted to pursue an English teaching position in Japan in early 2020. COVID didn't let that happen. Therefore, I wanted to pursue a PhD in a similar science research field and was asured I would be able to get a scholarship and a position. This was not the case and getting a scholarship was much more difficult than usual (no one is 100% sure as to why graduate scholarships are much harder to get at least in Australia). I only got a scholarship and a lab by mid-2021. Unfortunately, it is clear that leaving my current lab is the best decision for several reasons (it is a long story, I can go into it if necassary).

&amp;#x200B;

The Issue: 

I genuinely enjoy biological science research; however, having wasted all this time trying to build a research career and watching it fumble continually due to pieces not in my control is very demorallising. The future for academic research is not looking bright at all in Australia. It is making me reconsider my career path. 

An alternate career I may be interested in data analytics. I get excited about quarterly investor sales reports, investor meetings, and plotting data over time for market research groups.

&amp;#x200B;

My (Potential) Solution:

* Start some Coursera or Udemy data analytics courses in python, R, SQL a bit before a Masters to see if I connect with the tools I be using 
* A Masters of Data Analytics OR Masters of Business (Focus of study on Data Analytics)
* Try a get a job in just data entry to put something on my resume.
* Try and get an internship with companies like EY, KPMG, Deloitte, PWC etc

&amp;#x200B;

The Main Questions:

Does this sound like the best way for me to enter this field?

How would an employer view this kind of resume? Bachelor of Science, not having anything for 2 years, Masters degree.

How to communicate the value of my Bachelor of Science to the employers looking for data analysts? Lots of people seem to think a Bachelor of Science degree would give one great data analysis skills. However, unless you're doing specifically statisitics or informatics the computer skills you learn are a complete joke. So unfortunately I have no skills in python or R. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some Additions:

I've heard that many of these university courses for data analytics are relatively new and still evolving. Therefore, how would I assess as to whether the courses will actually teach me the skills needed to enter a work environment or build a portfolio? I definitely want to make sure a Masters is the right decision because of how expensive it is.

A lot of people say you just need online coursework for these positions, but I haven't seen any profiles from Linkedin without a finance/commerce/maths/computer science degree. Most appear to just be undergraduate degree Bachelors though. 

Even if a Masters is a good idea, is the job environment for these kinds of positions oversaturated anyways? Essentially is the job market just down everywhere and will finding a job just be painful no matter where you go? 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

TLDR: Considering a career switch to data analytics and thinking about whether a Masters degree is the best option for me. 

Please hammer me with questions. I can give more information, I just wanted to the post to be somewhat readable.

Thanks,

qg0u13,0,2021-10-26,Breast Cancer Awareness Month,lemmebepuja,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qg0u13/breast_cancer_awareness_month/,"  

Breast cancer, one of the most prevalent cancers, in women, has a month dedicated to spreading awareness. Yes, October is observed as Breast cancer Awareness Month every year around the globe.

Breast cancer, like all other types of this disease, is characterised by uncontrolled cell growth leading to lumps in the breasts. If detected at an early stage, breast cancer can be treated. But we all know how cancer is as a disease, meaning, breast cancer too can be fatal.

The awareness month is observed for this cause, to let common people be aware of the risk factors, symptoms and early signs of breast cancer. It also gives you a community of people who are either survivors, medical personnel or just common men and women, ready to help you through the tough times. But this month is not always about ribbons and happiness in pink. When it’s a fight, we do not get a 100% chance of winning. We tend to just glorify the winning team, and we almost forget what it feels to them who aren’t at the brighter side of it.

Breast cancer survivors or family members who lost someone to this disease might not welcome October like the others. The tough times that they had endured in the past haunts them. It keeps coming back like a movie scene playing over and over and over again. Anxiety reaches its peak and waking up every morning becomes tougher. Pink doesn’t feel good anymore and it triggers suppressed emotions. 

So, from now on, if you are an ally to this cause, make sure you don’t miss looking out for the people who do not come forward. Your support is not only important for the people who come forth, it’s equally important to those who chose not to.

The code is total spaghetti, I tried to convey this to some of engineers, they say this is startup so we don't focus on code.

qgfh6s,2,2021-10-26,Should I drop out of Mechanical Engineering and change majors?,Joehotto123,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qgfh6s/should_i_drop_out_of_mechanical_engineering_and/,"So after 6+ years in community college and nearly a year completing upper division courses, I have found out that Mechanical Engineering isn't a career that I wanted to pursue. In particular, Mechanics of Materials, Statics, and Solid Mechanics have been my least favorite subjects and hate doing stress calculations of shafts and beams, and I know ME makes heavy use of those subjects. I'm not doing bad in  ME, have a 3.39 GPA, but once I take Thermo, Fluids, and Heat Transfer, it may dip.

I've been good at math for most of my life, but the reason I chose ME was because of my passion with aviation and physics and wanting to get a job with just a BS rather than having to get a PhD with a Math degree (decided on ME vs. AE in High School because of media stating that ME had a better likelihood of getting jobs).

However, I just realized that after taking a  Business Statistics class, working with numbers and manipulating data is more up my alley. At this rate, I'm considering either  a major in Information Systems in the Business Administration department or an Applied Math degree with a minor in Computer Science. I should also note that I haven't made an attempt to apply to internships or made a strong effort in participating in ME clubs: I know that's often the deal breaker and I have an internship interview tomorrow, but want to decide now before my GPA drops below a 3.0

What are your guys's reccomendations of dropping ME in favor of another major? I know I should make my own decision, but just wanted to be sure."
qgg6iu,2,2021-10-26,Atlassian vs. Amazon,PsychologicalAsk2184,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qgg6iu/atlassian_vs_amazon/,"Deciding between the two for my last internship. 

Amazon: Greater Seattle Area

Pros:

* Better Pay
* Bigger/Prestigious name (? Maybe not for interns)
* Bananas

Cons:

* Random team assignment
* Will probably have to actually do work 

Atlassian: Remote  
Pros: 

* People seem really chill
* Gave me a list of possible teams and asked for preference 
* Seems like great culture/wlb, probably a great company to fall back on if I fail interviews next season

Cons:

* Lower Pay 

I'm really only interested in trying to leverage one of these to get interviews at companies like FB, Google, Stripe, etc for new grad. Any advice? Thanks so much!

I wanted to know my odds at achieving an abroad career in the financial sector. For you to estimate my odds you would have to know me, so here we go.

 I am 20 years old, currently studying Actuarial Science Bachelors Degree at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, one of the top universities in South America. I don't have amazing grades (7.5 out of 10) but they are above average. Furthermore, I speak advanced English (Although you might not think so because of my rusty writing) and I am learning Portuguese. I also know a bit of python coding, a skill which I am planning to expand even more. Besides it being a cliché, I am a truly hard-working guy with a really big sense for opportunities, who doesn't give up until the goal is reached. 

I've been managing the finances of my family, relatives and friends for two years, so I would say I have some experience in finance. I live in Argentina, but I also have Italian citizenship and passport, which definitely is a plus. Just for you to know, in South America barely are any investment banking or so, and here young students don't do internships but start working right ahead. Right now I have 1 year of experience in strategic consulting as an analyst, with I think is really valuable for getting a job.

My plan is to finish my bachelor's degree in 3 years and head to Europe or North America.  In the last year or so I will start looking for job opportunities there or here, in order to ask for a relocation when I finish my studies. I don't even think about getting a job in the biggest cities of the world such as New York or London, I would be happy with a job anywhere in Europe/North America (Such as Madrid, Dublin, Amsterdam, Toronto, Chicago,  Zurich, etc.). My ideal job would be wealth management or equity research, but given the case, I would accept anything that takes me out of South America.

Thanks for reading, I would really appreciate you telling me what do you think my realistic chances are.

See ya."

Is this common or was my company an outlier? Also for someone like an interviewer, if they sign their email with just their first name can you call them by that or should you wait till until they explicitly tell you?

I received offers from both Bank of America and Mastercard for their internships (this will be my last internship) and am currently a bit conflicted on which one to choose.

BofA benefits:
- big brand name value
- higher salary
- gives housing stipend

Cons:
- management
- internship experience depends highly on team
- heard work was a bit slow and not really great on WLB
- lots of legacy code, not really tech savvy

Mastercard pros:
- big international presence
- good WLB
- uses more modern tech stack / closely related to my interests

Cons:
- lower pay

Ie. Leetcode easy in October and then Leetcode Medium in November.

Or maybe higher chance of getting an offer in October than November due to less applicants being interviewed. In particular for Amazon, I am doing an SDE Intern Final round shortly. Furthermore, does anyone know what the approximate offer rate is?"

Since I'll graduate in less than an year and plan to move to a German-speaking EU country in about an year I don't want to specialize in any niche language/framework because I want to be able to find a job easily once I move. The problem I'm facing right now is what to do with my time in my country. 

On one hand there is this company developing banking software with C++ using the MFC framework which is really old and according to everything I've read in the internet - outdated, awful and teaches bad practices. I also don't intend to work with C++ in the long term. What's attracting me however is that it's a smaller company, from friends I know the working environment is good and that after a quick internship I can quickly get some hands-on experience in development.

On the other hand I can apply in bigger, mostly outsourcing corporations where I can use newer technologies but will probably have a much longer theory-oriented internship with a questionable working environment (if I am to believe the reviews online).

What would you do in my situation? I'm really torn and wondering how much of a drawback it'd really be to use an outdated technology such as MFC. Can it really damage me by ingraining an otherwise unusable way of thinking or would it be easy to later switch to a more ""modern"" technology? Bear in mind that since I'll also be doing uni I will hardly have any willpower to also work on side-projects where I can keep up to date with other languages and frameworks."

Internships and jobs are presented as being about how much money I can make. Plus the bullshit I've been told will matter so I can fill up my resume and the LinkedIn I don't even fucking want with more miscellaneous bullshit so I can be more marketable. I want to go to grad school but I'm trained for selling myself to corporate America as I almost inevitably will have to eventually, and I just need to make myself look good so they'll want to buy me. Then I can just toil away at that shit until I go numb to it like almost everyone else does.

Too much of the time, an English degree is just an expensive way to sink years into study only to work in something you didn't get trained for. So I'm trapped in a system I hate, and the only exit I see is the permanent one. I'm only promised one life. I don't want to waste time I could spend doing the shit I actually wanted to do. But I'm too afraid of failing at it if I tried."

Wasn't paying attention to speed and boom a hidden cop emerges from the side of the road and pulls me over. 

I have a court date in about 3 weeks but if I'm found guilty I'll get my license suspended which I really don't want to happen since I'm a student and need to drive for school, internship, etc.

I called some Atlanta (where I live, but like 4 hrs away from where I got the ticket) lawyers I found online for free consultations and they all said to find a local lawyer. But the issue is, the county I got the ticket in is tiny and could only find 1 law office on google who wouldn't answer my calls.

I'm really stressed and have no clue what to do, never been in any court situation before and don't know how it works or what to say. 

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated."

Carlos lightly looks at one of the mummies leaning against the wall and feels strange, he has seen many bodies, many mummies. and more skeletons that look as if you look at him and are going to attack him, he looks at Carlos dazzled by the immensity of the city but Carlos can only think of why the city has been sealed with all population including children.

Meanwhile, Roberto barked orders to the interns and assistants:

-Quickly and carefully box everything.

A rush of people meticulously removed utensils and mummy putting them in hermetically sealed box with so much confusion. Nobody notices the little accident a distracted intern cuts her finger in a mummy's teeth

                      Three months later in a big city
-These bodies are interesting they all seem to be contaminated by a retrovirus that alters the body's cells so that they become autonomous. Different from what happens with cancer they seem to communicate in some way maybe through chemical markers or through messenger RNA.- exclaims Rogerio, chief doctor of the archeology department.

                            in another part of the city
The young Eduarda begins to feel bad at the nightclub where she celebrates her birthday with her friends.

-Dude you don't look well, I think you should stop drinking a little. after this comment Eduarda starts bleeding from the corner of her right eye, her friends approach her and suddenly she starts vomiting, everyone in the club is hit or tramples on vomit or blood, after a few minutes Eduarda stops the violent convulsion friends her and some onlookers approach her to verify the macabre fact that she is dead. The paramedics who had been called by the nightclub staff arrive at the scene and confirm the death, thus calling the police, who arrive about half an hour later with the coroner, after the testimonies have been collected, everyone is released, and the body is collected and taken to the morgue of the nearest police station, Eduarda's parents arrive at the police station and speak to the attendant: -Hi, we are Eduarda Monteiro's parents, we were called by the police chief, Novais here to recognize the body - says the father. With a crying voice, the mother couldn't even speak, she just cried. Having been taken to the delegate's presence, the delegate begins: -I'm sorry for your loss, that we have a problem, you can even recognize the body, but we can't release the body because the coroners are on stoppage until tomorrow. ""This is absurd, my daughter died and I won't even be able to know why or bury her until a strike passes,"" she exclaimed. Eduarda's father indignant.

                  Later; in the precinct morgue.
Jackson and Cleide cleaned the morgue, as was usual even with the paralysis of the coroners: -Cleide you heard something a loud thud on metal. ""Jackson stop it we've been working in the morgue for a long time for you to try and scare me man,"" exclaimed Cleide. -No, and seriously you're not even listening. Replica Jackson already worried -Please, you're too big to believe in these things of soulless Jackson- Cleide says laughing. After that, she hears a thud on the strong metal: -Jackson, I heard, is it that some coroner forgot something and came to get it or is it that some prisoner is trying to escape and we better call a policeman here, I'll go call- Cleide goes in a hurry. -Jackson I'm going there to see if it's some coroner- Jackson replies.

Upon arriving in the autopsy room, Jackson saw something that made Eduarda stand pale. But not the same one that arrived not a normal corpse either, but something truly monstrous: In one of the hands the fingers turned into curved claws but at the same time the knuckles of the fingers still seemed flexible each claw measuring about eight centimeters, her skin it was pale almost bluish. And on her arms and shoulders protruded sharp little bony bulges. The white eyes of a corpse, the sharp teeth, no longer looked human, any more than those of a wolf or other carnivorous animal.

Upon seeing this image Jackson left it out: -Damn it, exclaims Jackson. Hearing Jackson scream Eduarda turned to him abandoning her, the body she was chewing and began to charge towards him attacking him with her claws fiercely, the claws so sharp they opened cuts in the walls in the morgue, Jackson moving, quickly managed get out of the way of Eduarda's voracious attack. At this moment Cleide returns with two police officers: - What the hell is this - exclaims the first policeman. -I don't know- answers the second. The two promptly pull out their pistols and shoot until they run out of bullets, but Eduarda only seems to get annoyed with this action and promptly turns to the police and attacking towards them attacks with her claws, she manages to hit one of them by cutting his neck in a movement of her arm, opening the carotid blood smeared throughout the corridor, and taking advantage of the momentum she turns to the second and bites him in the shoulder in pain he drops the gun, at this moment Cleide and Jackson take advantage of the gap given by her and run away screaming with, the screaming more police get up and go towards the screaming, a group arrives and see Eduarda, one of them says: -Is this a zombie? Another replies: -Just in case. He shoots Eduarda in the head with a pistol blowing a hole in her head, but the hole to everyone's amazement, she just doesn't seem affected by the wound and continues to attack and mortally wound several police officers. A policeman with a shotgun shoots Eduarda's head and the head blows off but the body keeps moving and trying to attack whoever approaches, shotgun fire continues until Eduarda is without arms and legs that still continued to move. One of the officers Exclaim: -Shit was that. ""I don't know,"" exclaims another. -We'd better let someone know- says another. -Who, we are the police- replies another. As they argue among themselves the bodies of the dead police officers start to convulse and suddenly the first dead police officers are not as
mutated  yet, Eduarda appears on the stairs in the morgue and rushes towards the others."
qgjpma,6,2021-10-26,Will a Data Analyst Intern role limit my future somehow?,c-kyi,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qgjpma/will_a_data_analyst_intern_role_limit_my_future/,"As a student who is currently pursuing a career in Data Science/MLE and with 3 previous intern experiences in a Data Science role, would accepting an internship in a Data Analyst role be a step backwards in any sense? It will most likely be my last internship before graduating as well.  


The job description itself was pretty Data Science heavy but the role is **Data Analyst** which could mean the actual tasks could differ.  I'm debating because my previous Data Science Intern roles were at small companies and not really recognizable at all (one being government related). This new Data Analyst Intern role is at large company that everyone knows so at least I'd have something with a bit of a ""reputation"" on the resume.  


Is having a big company thats reputable on your resume beneficial for future DS career goals even though it's a Data Analytics Intern position? Will it help getting that foot in the door to get interviews because of the name recognition of the company? Or is having a DA Intern role limiting and restricting your future potential?   


Thank you very much!!"

I’m working as a desktop support intern. I have been applying to cyber jobs and I only had one interview (I was rejected), the others are in progress and some rejected me.

I am in the process of studying for Sec+ (through TestOut for my class) and I think I will be done in a month, and I will apply for more entry-level analyst positions.

I know that ""Cert =/= Job,"" but do you think having the Sec+ land me more interviews and give me more advantages for my applications? How was your experience?

I got my Net+ last week and I am thinking of CySA or SSCP next semester (SSCP requires experience though)."
qgk2s8,744,2021-10-26,To Answer This Sub’s Most Commonly Asked Questions,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qgk2s8/to_answer_this_subs_most_commonly_asked_questions/,"No, your internship or job offer mostly likely will NOT be rescinded if you fail a test (or even a class). 

No, doing grad school won’t *significantly* increase your starting salary, especially in terms of opportunity cost. Do grad school if you’re genuinely interested, and can afford it (if it’s a non-thesis based masters), OR you want to do a niche field (machine learning etc). 

Yes, this sub is not representative of most CS majors. 

Yes, this sub is biased towards Big N. 

Yes, school name matters, but you can still get an internship / job offer at the big N from a non target school. Work hard and you’ll be fine. 

Yes, your data engineering, business intelligence, data science or related internships can help with future software engineering opportunities. 

Yes, GPA matters for *some* companies (usually banks, HFTs, defense / anything government.) Leave it off your resume if it’s below 3.5; most big tech companies won’t ask for it or your transcripts. 

Yes, you can still get a SWE / SDE internship as a math, physics, or engineering major. 

No, double majoring is almost always NOT worth it. 

No, you don’t have to do SDE / SWE full time if you hate coding. Other high paying tech jobs you can get with a CS degree include: product management, DevOps/Cloud/SRE, and sales engineering. 

Yes, Amazon is still a FAANG company. 

No, you weren’t rejected because Amazon didn’t respond to you immediately after you submitted your internship application. 

No, you weren’t rejected because Microsoft didn’t respond to you immediately after you submitted your internship application. 

No, not getting a response after a day is not ghosting. 

Yes, alert your recruiter of competing offers.

5. AP Scholar with Distinction

**Letters of Recommendation**

Recommendation 1: This was from my Calculus teacher. I was kinda embarrassed I got a 3 on the exam (even she said how shocked she was) but she’s really sweet and I heard she writes 🔥 recommendations so... yeah I didn’t talk much in her class but apparently she thinks highly of me. I’d assume like 8/10.

Recommendation 2: Spanish teacher. Had her Junior and Senior year. Really chill lady and she was impressed with my initiative with Spanish outside of school. Spanish class is where I was most vocal and participate most so she saw a lot more of my personality. She let me read the rec and it was really good. 9/10

Recommendation 3: From my counselor. He really liked me and although we didn’t interact much, we developed a good relationship the 2nd semester of my Junior year and 1st semester senior year. 7/10

**Interviews**

In order I did them:
1. UPenn: Awkward cuz he didn’t speak English fully and didn’t really respond when I gave an answer just kinda moved on to the next question. 5/10
2. Princeton: Best interview I had. She seemed to actually be into what I was saying once I went down a rabbit hole talking about investing. 9/10
3. Stanford: Guy was pretty chill. Pretty standard interview it was good but I didn’t do anything to stand out rlly. 6/10
4. Yale: Was going well but kinda fell off a cliff lmao. 3/10
5. University of South Carolina: I was interviewing for their top scholars program which is for the top 50 kids in the incoming class. There were 3 interviewers and I answered everything pretty smoothly. 8/10

I got Ls from almost everywhere I interviewed so don’t take interview advice from me

**Essays**

Common App: I think I told a pretty unique story that not many others could tell. Ended up talking about moving, my grandma dying, getting into investing, and concluded how pessimistic thinking is necessary. I know that all seems pretty disjoint but I made it flow. Especially with the USC essays, I had a lot of “fuck it” yolo humor and not so subtlety dissed secondary education in my supplement. Really, idk why any college would want to admit me.

Supplements: It got to the point where I was churning out 1 application a day (I actually did 3 in one day). Literally, I did Vandy in 20 minutes. Rice took a few hours. Did USC in a day. Did Harvard, Columbia, Princeton all in 1 day. Don’t be like me. Get ur shit done the summer before senior year starts. You’ll have no time during the school year to write essays if ur shotgunning.

**Additional Information:**
Arguably the most stressful period of my life churning out these essays. As u can see, I have trash leadership roles and don’t volunteer like at all. No research. No internships. Lots of individual hobbies and self-projects. I used to read this subreddit and see other people’s god-tier ECs and feel like I wasn’t doing enough. But at the end of the day, I’m just gonna do what interests me, chill, and have fun. 🤷‍♂️"

Say you were in school for CS, got a summer internship, then got hired on and have been there for over a year. But you still have school to finish. Would you just totally not care about classes and grades, to the point where you don't even care about a group project where other people depend on you?

Like does school even matter at that point, past getting passing grades and your degree? I mean if you have a solid internship-turned-job, a lower GPA probably won't seriously impact your future career path, right?"

My current issue is, I don’t where to start. I haven’t had my first internship yet and feel lost when it comes to building something full scale.

Does anyone have any advice?

I know Roblox screwed their interns last year but my recruiter said they’re working on fixing that (ie being more transparent/not having a hard cap of 50%) 
If that’s true I think I personally find Roblox the best company for culture and WLB ( I think working there would be super fun, and the pay is also verrrry nice ). However my desire to be employed FT exceeds my desire to have fun haha. 

I also don’t think that FB is a bad option. I have a lot of friends going and I know it would also be a great time, plus I think FB has a better FT return rate. Also think the tech that FB makes is pretty cool. 

I’m also not ruling out Yext, I talked to their engineers and they seemed super chill and I think I could get some cool work done there, though I think I could get cool work done at any of the three options. 

I’m also thinking about recruiting full time (if i don’t get a return) so the work I get to do over the summer and the name of the company matters a bit I think.

Thoughts? Am junior btw so last internship

I couldn't get an internship partly because of the gpa and partly because of covid. I applied for entry level software engineer/developer jobs for like 3 months, sending out probably 5 applications a day on average, across the entire country and only for jobs that didn't require experience. I did a bunch of tests and probably like 10 interviews, most went well but I didn't get hired. I really wanted to find a job before my lease expired so that I could just move wherever but eventually I had to sign a new lease and find a temporary job. I've been working an unskilled job making like $18 an hour for the past couple months.

I wanted advice on whether I am better off uploading my GRE scores or not for admission in MS AI. (My GRE Score is 165 Q 146 V still waiting on AWA - mostly poor V). I don't think I have the time or energy to give the GRE again. I am currently considering the following colleges -

1. UToronto
2. McGill
3. UoBC
4. UAlberta 

US

1. UT Austin 
2. UCSC

My question is do I stand a chance for admit in these universities and would I be better off not sharing my GRE score since it has been waived off this year or should I go ahead and report it anyway (at least to some of them)?"

qgp8r3,2,2021-10-27,I regret my degree. I do not know where to go from here. Are there any jobs out there that require a nice combo of both hard technical skills and soft skills?,Such-Breadfruit2802,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qgp8r3/i_regret_my_degree_i_do_not_know_where_to_go_from/," 

So technically, I do not have the degree, yet. I should have it by December of this year. I was initially a Computer Science major, but suck at math so I chose the IT degree due to the less math required. Well, I discovered that I have far more of an interest in programming than information systems. My IT degree introduced me to some programming languages, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, etc., but my familiarity with these languages only go as far as what I learned within a class environment. So I doubt I am qualified for any entry level role.

Currently I am working as a front desk receptionist . I have worked at this job for 4 years. It is pathetically easy and mind numbing, the company is going under so I won't have a job in a month. I do not know where to take my life or how to utilize my degree. I want to dedicate some time to developing projects to bump up my ability to get hired, but realistically speaking, I do feel like I will need more than a year of self study to be a decent candidate.

I have no internships. Did no side projects. I can't even get a damn help desk job. I live within an hr away from the Atlanta area. I also have an interest in technical writing. In college I helped out in creating blog posts on the universities webpage about events and even helped in creating fliers and documents for guidance and troubleshooting common question the admission office gets. I have applied to these roles, but no bite.

I have also learned that I like talking to people. Back when I was younger I was enticed with the idea of being a software dev. since I thought I would be thrown away at a cubicle and left alone at a cubicle so as long as I brought on decent work. Well turns out I actually like talking to people. I was just depressed. So I do not know what jobs out there rely on more soft skills but are also in the tech industry.

I have also thought about going the SAAS SDR route or even looked into Pharma sales. The only thing that inspires me about these 2 chose is the potential for some srs $$$$.

I am also 30k in student loan debt. So I wouldn't mind looking into remote positions if they pay well.

I guess what I am trying to say is that I am going to try to work on my own time to hopefully find software dev position. but prior to that I am looking for a stable job but I do not know what type of job or career route I am suitable for based on what I have said so far.Any Recommendations?"
qgpc9s,3,2021-10-27,Issue with internship on resume,hellohello9999910,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qgpc9s/issue_with_internship_on_resume/,"So I am an international student (currently a senior). On my sophomore to junior summer I was originally going to do a research project in my college but covid happened and I ended up going back to my home country for that summer, I was able to get to do some part time coding work doing some web development in an early stage start up due to connections that I had in my home country. So I logically put that in my resume / linked in. 

Anyway, the year after I was able to get an internship in the usa for a well known company, I did an ok job and got an amazing return offer for a full time position (which I'll start after I graduate next may).

The problem is that the start up didn't really work and the project sort of stalled (they are probably going to continue with it but it's stalled for the moment). So if you do a google search of the company I mention in my resume / linked in it won't show up or anything. 

I am afraid that this situation will give the impression that I lied and that they will take away my job offer if they look into it. I would just take this away from my linked in since I have lots of other things to show up anyway, but then my work experience on linked in would be inconsistent with the resume the company I'll work for already has in their records (because I used it to apply for my internship). 

Anyway, what would the best thing to do in this situation be?"

19m. I plan on moving to university next year and while I do it I plan on changing a lot about my life. It's going to be my first time living alone so it's going to be scary and hard, due to other psychological conditions I have and not having things like a drivers licence, knowing how to cook, etc. But I think i'll learn while ""on the job"" so to speak. Chances are i'll also be hours away from family so I can't rely on them either so i'll hope my fellow new dorms-people will be able to help, i'm not good at making friends but i'll try my best. Also haven't been able to get a job for various reasons (due to my condition i'd hate to be working in things like customer service, I want to get a job that suites me and that I woulden't be bad at but those jobs are few and far between and hard to get given at 19 the most work experience I have is 3 days of intern work that I enjoyed like 4 years ago, i'm hoping me studying at university will be enough to get me something but i'm not sure).

I'll also be trying to improve things like start working out and eating better now that what I eat and buy will be a lot more in my control rather then eating and buying what the family wants.

But anyway, about the ""brain fog"". I had depression really bad back in 2016 when I was about 14, I still remember it started about a month after my 14th birthday so in july. I started to realise that honestly, I don't really have any friends, I have a couple but thats about it. To this day I don't really tbh. That made me really doubt myself, I began to spiral down and thought of myself as like a defective human. Everything went down so fast, before I had that I was fine and happy and always one of the best in my class. After 4 months there was this 2 week period where I was sick and it was the worst two weeks of my life. I can't remember much of it but time kind of disappeared, I couldn't think and I felt barely cognisant, what little brainpower I had was pretty much just dedicated to hating myself, the only part I can remember clearly is a period of about 20 mins where I was sitting in my bed with a knife mindlessly wanting to kill myself but not doing it because I don't want to hurt anybody. For years I couldn't remember it without breaking down into tears and being scared that will all come back, i'm still scared it will someday.

Moving on, it took me years to really recover from it, it still lingered for 2-3 years at least. I'm still unsure sometimes if it's actually gone because I feel like it's just sitting in the back of my mind and I tend to have bouts of depression once or twice a month. After that all happened I went from one of the best in my class to barely passing most of my classes and/or failing because of my lingering brain fog. I wanted to get a good ATAR last year so I could go straight to university but even after dedicating as much of my time as possible to studying I still couldn't get into any of the courses I wanted, so I have been doing stuff for the past year to get me into what I want and i'm currently doing my applications right now. Guess just trying to brute-force it to make up for my lack of being able to pay attention and my poor grades for the past 4-5wouldn't years just didn't really work.

But assuming I get any offers, i'm scared I won't be able to make it work. I feel like I have kind of permanently damaged my brain and I don't know how to fix it and that i'll fail university.

I guess the answer to the title is kind of obvious after rereading everything, but I still want to know what other people think I guess."

Job market is hot so could probably just go straight for a junior dev job, but that may be a baptism of fire. With the internship I imagine there would be a lot of support and they would be more understanding (they know what skills the grads have). Obviously no pay for another month after 6 months of bootcamp would be hard.. Any thoughts?"

Are there any colleges on my list that I should probably remove?

Do you know of any full-ride scholarships that I might have a chance of getting?

Should I aim a bit high and apply to T-10s?

Let me tell you that this school is totally what you make out of it. Want internships, work for it, show enthusiasm and you will get one. 

I was at an event few days ago where there was 7 senior students as panelist Vs 3 in the audience , and all of them had some very good full time offers right after graduation. 

Want to make some friends? Go engage in everything you find worth while ! Fuck the haters ! If those who you potentially want to hang out with don’t want to hang out with you, find some other people that are more than happy to. You don’t need that negativity anyways. 

The Rugby team here doesn’t have enough players, Class registration people just sent out an email asking for help. 

There are opportunities galore. Just try a little harder and seize them. I’m not saying it’s easy and will be handed to you, perhaps if you went to Ivy leagues or SMU ! 

And don’t hate on not having a football team. If you want one so bad, go to A&amp;M. It’s a conscious decision on the part of the university. It’s one of the reason why there are so many on the AES scholarship ! 

I’m just saying man. I’m tired of people complaining about university life here and not utilizing what they have. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this. 
Have a good one."

LinkedIn is only giving me 3 days to make a decision, so I don't have so much time to do thorough research and would appreciate your input.

My end goal is a higher TC in the future, So I want to take the opportunity that best sets me up for that, so here are some things to consider:

Both companies are great, but I am worried about return rates. I heard LinkedIn had terrible return rates but also heard that it was a phase cause of the pandemic and they are back to the normal 80% + rate. Is this correct? Also, are these rates for junior internship to full time and is sophomore to junior internship same? and what are Google’s rates for STEP to junior and junior to full time?

Third, what is the career progression like at both places? I can see from levels.fyi that LinkedIn has better TC at almost every level, but is it harder to get to higher levels at LinkedIn or Google?

Also, I am considering HFTs such as Jane Street and HRT for my junior internship and was wondering which would look better on my resume when applying to these places and also if I need to recruit next year which looks better.

Lastly, which has the better WLB and culture?

My thought process here is that my resume is clearly good enough to be shortlisted by larger companies, but I just need to work on my interviewing skills. If I work on my interviewing skills a bit more and tried again at those Big 4 companies in 6 months, I could possibly land an internship there instead of accepting Nuro. 

At the same time, I am also content with working FT at NVIDIA, but I’m afraid if I accept Nuro and never have the chance to interview for a Big 4 internship again, I might regret it. I’m not so open to working FT at Nuro because of the risk they never go public, but I won’t deny it would be a great experience for an internship.

I've been slowly applying for very basic, entry level jobs for the past couple months and have only gotten to 1 coding challenge (which I bombed). I don't know what I want to specialize in, the options are so broad I can't figure out what I want to get into. I applied for internships in school but to no avail.

I'll be honest, I wasn't a great student. I've been working full time or more for the majority of my schooling and as a result not everything I learned has stuck very well. I'm not a wiz kid at programming and I have to look lots of things up because I just can't remember lots of fine details. I enjoy the challenge of problem solving and being creative, which is a large part of what drew me to change careers. I know I'm never going to be the star of any dev team, I just want to collaborate however I can. I don't have much of a portfolio right now, so I don't even bother trying to link it on job applications.

What should I do? I have some personal projects in mind to add to my portfolio. I'm also starting the AWS practitioner course/exam I got through my school. I'm just worried that I'll do all of this work beyond school, and still not be able to find anything. WFH is ideal since that is my goal, but I don't mind my first position or 2 being at an office. The immediate metropolitan area is one of the largest in my state. Its not a tech hub but there are hospitals and warehouses like no one's business.

When you see posts asking if there's any place for average developers, those are my people lol. I'm just feeling lost and looking for guidance"

We came up with a study plan for myself that works with my schedule bc consistency is something i struggle with.

One thing i brought up was that I want to do an internship or research over the summer but have a hard time applying for them because,1. it doesn’t seem urgent enough since summer feels so far away and i have a hard time motivating myself, and 2. i struggle a lot with rejection and i discourage myself from applying for things i may want because i feel like other people are probably more qualified or have better social/interview skills so i should just save myself the criticism. I know this is a poor mentality to have and im working to make it better, but the whole time she kept asking me if i thought point #2 was actually adhd related and if those were just things about myself that are separate. She asked me thing like 4 or 5 time in the 45 mins we met for and never really addressed it at all just moved on to something else. 

I guess my question would be was I wrong to bring that up or to contribute those things about myself to my adhd. The only purpose of having those two coaches is because they specialize in adhd so im sure their very knowledgeable on the subject matter and have met with a lot of people. I don’t know, I just thought that my emotional sensitivity to a lot of things was a byproduct of my adhd.

I was clocked doing 62/45 on W.T.Harris Blvd. To make it worse I was pulled over just before an intersection, where post-intersection the speed limit is increased from 45 to 55. Now I was expecting a simple ticket however the citation specifically noted G.S. 20-141(j1). After doing some research turns out this is a class 3 misdemeanor! I know I was irresponsible for speeding, however the punishment for this could potentially be a criminal record and revocation of my license. 

What are my options to deal with this? 

I read in some cases it's best to call DA office to get a reduction but I don't know what to say. On top of this I'm concerned if I do end up getting a misdemeanor how it'll affect my career chances. This semester is my last semester before graduating college on top of that I'm currently in an internship with a high chance of being able to transition to full time post-graduation. I don't want this simple mistake ruining everything. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I do have the option to request a reduction online. If I do request a reduction and accept will it still be on my record? Will it be counted as a misdemeanor still?"

I tried combing through the FAQs, but couldn't find any posts related to the advice I'm seeking. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read / comment!

I am currently a product analyst at a startup, and I've been in data for \~2 years now. To give some background info, I went to school for biology and learned through an internship how much I enjoyed programming (first time programming). I pivoted to data science because it made the most sense given that I was coming from a research science background. For what it's worth, I also think some of the topics and problems to solve in data are interesting, too. However, I've realized that I would much rather build things and enjoy the somewhat more concrete nature of software engineering (interestingly, data can feel more like an art sometimes). There are also a lot of things about working in data that I dislike, and I believe are pretty ubiquitous in the field. Some examples are:

* an excessive amount of meetings from having to manage so many stakeholders
   * I actually have to juggle more than one product team, but even if I only had one, there's more stakeholders for us compared to the engineers on the team
* tons of task-based tickets
   * e.g., can you ""quickly"" pull this data, build this dashboard...
   * mostly a problem because within data, we are also expected to be more proactive in our job and do additional research / data exploration, which I don't think I will ever be able to do while juggling 10, sometimes up to 20, hours of meetings a week, experimentation work, ticket work, etc.
      * I would actually prefer to incorporate it into my work, but most weeks, it's basically impossible.
* Overall, it seems like on average, the expectations of data folks are higher than other ICs
   * may just be my experience... my sample size = 2 companies, but it seems like others feel the same

I have also been pretty burnt out this year and literally the entire data team feels the same (\~30% of the team has left this year). A lot of it has to do with us being extremely understaffed. The burn out has really been affecting my mental health, and I've tried discussing it with my manager, but it doesn't feels like anything has changed. I also struggle with whether I might be being overly sensitive because I shouldn't already be feeling burn out this early in my career... Throughout the year, I have kept justifying feeling this way and telling myself it will get better, but it feels like there's no end in sight. We've been trying to hire another analyst to help with my product teams for 8 months now... We were also short on management resources, and finally just hired someone after \~7 months of searching. All that being said, I think that fundamentally, as I mentioned before, I would just much rather build things as a SWE (vs. trying to find a different company) and have realized that my initial career switch was primarily driven by how much I enjoyed programming.

Because I'm burnt out, I find that I have very little motivation to study after work. I'm also taking a course in a MS program, which doesn't help (planning to at least take a break next semester). I think I would be stuck in this cycle if nothing changes (finish work day &gt; only have energy to do course work &gt; repeat). Aside from not having the motivation to learn in my free time, I am aware that it might be easier to land a SWE role by switching internally, but since my team is understaffed, it feels like it would be a really long process. We live in a low COL, and my husband makes a decent amount of money, so I am lucky to be in a position where I could quit and focus on studying. He's also a SWE, and I feel like that is an advantage to pursuing this switch (can answer my questions)! I'm curious what others thought about whether it's worth 1) losing my salary ($110k), 2) potentially missing out on switching internally, and 3) if the gap on my resume would be a red flag when eventually looking for a new role. Or should I just try and stick it out and move to a role internally? Something else? I'm so conflicted. :(

I know this was a lot, so thank you to those who took the time to read/respond."

Pros:

* better name (though unsure how STEP affects this)
* I've heard that it's pretty straightforward to get return SWE intern offer

Cons:

* STEP won't do as much as SWE
* lower pay (but I'm not too concerned about this)

Bloomberg:

Pros:

* SWE vs freshman/sophomore program
* good return offer rate (though I would still interview elsewhere)
* better pay and will likely learn a bit more bc it's SWE

Cons:

* not as great name as Google
* I do ultimately want to land a job at a place like google/fb/unicorn

Ultimately, my goal is to land an internship at something on the same level as google/fb/unicorn after but I don't care if it's specifically Google. With that in mind, it seems like STEP may be the better choice, but idk if it would be dumb to turn down an SWE intern offer at a big N.

Quick background before I start - At the time of testing, I was a 19 y/o going into my sophomore year of University, going for a double major in Cybersecurity and Computer Science. I was in my second summer of a cybersecurity internship.

I took the PenTest+ beta exam on Jun 29 2021, and just got the email a few hours ago saying I passed! Does anyone know how to see your score for a beta exam? **Edit: The score is available in Pearson Vue.**

My advice for test takers - know your Nmap switches, and stay calm no matter how bad you feel the exam is going. During this test and my Security+, I felt like I was failing. But I scored an 855/900 on the Sec+, and will update this post when I see my Pentest+ score. If you know your stuff and stay composed, you'll be okay! Besides that, I don't remember much else. Feel free to ask me questions and I'll do my best to jog my memory.

To be honest, this test did not feel very difficult at all, and I didn't study for it specifically before hand. It did help I was studying for the OSCP at the time though...

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I got 780/900, with 750 being a passing grade."

I just finished my senior internship lineup for next year and I'd like to think I've done a good job so far.

I'm a rising CS senior at Tec de Monterrey (in Mexico), and two of the main activities I did during my undergrad time have been hackathons and internships.

I've been on both sides of the scale; winning and losing streaks all across the board.

* 2nd year: Google STEP
* 3rd year: Google SWE, Lyft SWE
* 4th year: Lyft SWE, MongoDB SWE, Datadog SWE, Google SWE

Every single year I did 3-5 hackathons from different colleges. Three first-places, a few top-5, multiple top-10, and several fails.

qh7l50,1,2021-10-27,Advice on project ideas and learning resources,Kwimen,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qh7l50/advice_on_project_ideas_and_learning_resources/,"Hello, I hope this is the right place to ask this question, google hasn't been much help really. So, I'm in my second year at college studying Computer Science, I'm going for an internship for spring at Intel, and while I'm pretty sure I won't get it, I'd rather try and fail then just not try, and hopefully get it in the future once I'm further along. Everyone I've talked to has basically said, focus on personal projects outside of school, and prove I'm a problem solver.

My question/issue is finding quality resources for the type of stuff I'm interested in doing. Most project guides are in python, but my classes have all been in Java or Mips Assembly. I figured I'd aim to start making projects that are affiliated with the same stuff the internship would be, which is Automation, and their asking for people who know OOP and have an interest and experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I've found plenty of resources on machine learning or similar guides on projects for Python, but not Java. None that I've seen have been projects, and more just documentation on Machine learning in Java, and I'm not far enough in to understand that, so do I have to learn python to touch on AI and ML? Or at

One of my project ideas was something like a robot arm that'll play a mobile game for me when it's incredibly repetitive. Granted it seems incredibly difficult, but I figured working towards it would be educational and I'd learn a lot aiming to do it, plus it seems fun. But I'm not sure where to start to do that. 

Basically, I'm asking for advice on resources that could help me with finding projects that relate to a Intel Automation Internship, or any starting points for the project I had in mind. Really any advice would be helpful, even it's to tell me I'm stupid and should start more basic. Sorry if this type of thing has been asked a lot, I couldn't find anything specific to my issue, or at least not the right keywords. Thank you and have a wonderful day!"

qhdgp0,3,2021-10-27,Well... what now?,gar_kais,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qhdgp0/well_what_now/,"I (22 M) was just diagnosed with ADHD, which is... a lot. I'm partly processing, partly asking for advice, so buckle in and I'll try to sum it up into a nice question format at the end.

I started to notice that something may not be right last summer, when I was working a job outside my very flexible and forgiving job in the family business for the first time. Being in high school and college, I knew that I was forgetful and made careless mistakes, but I got good enough grades and had enough stimulation/variety to get through without much consternation. All that changed when I was on a consistent grind with few deadlines and little accountability. I have had 3 different internships since that point, each of which I have absolutely loved, but I kept running into a massive lack of focus and inability to get myself to work. It was incredibly frustrating because I *wanted* to do the work, but just could not do it. Sounds familiar here, I bet. I have the language to describe what has been happening to me now, which is liberating, but also confusing.

It finally clicked for me last semester when I was doing a social work internship and had several clients with ADHD who said things that hit just a little bit too close to home. I relocated twice over the course of the summer, but promised myself that when I was able to settle, I would seek a diagnosis. I ended up moving back home (lots of baggage there, but I am glad to be here for the time being), and broke the news to my parents that I wanted to get some answers. That experience was... less than ideal. My dad was somewhat understanding, as he revealed to me (later, in private) that he suspected he might be in a similar situation but keeps himself in check partly because of his very stimulating job as a lawyer and partly by judicious use of caffeine and alcohol to keep him alert and calm (which I know may sound slightly alarming, but I assure you that he's actually very well put-together, and I know a thing or two about alcoholics from my family history, but we'll get to that). I talked him through how alcohol and caffeine are both unpleasant for me, and he respected my desire to seek out some more help. My mom, however, wouldn't hear it. She chalked it up to my diet, exercise, and social habits, and said that I never had a problem before so essentially I just needed to get over myself. Having expected this response, I was not destroyed, but certainly dismayed.

I ended up talking with her more about how just getting a diagnosis and more information did not mean I was trying to write off my problems and that I did not intend to immediately get medicated, and she reluctantly agreed to let me seek a medical evaluation. Well, after doing intake with a PMHNP and then doing a QB test, she told me that I had ADHD. Again, not a surprise for me (though I was hoping that a diagnosis would help me to feel like there was a clear path forward, ha). After talking the doc through my family history of alcohol and substance abuse, as well as the fact that I know I have addictive tendencies and respond poorly to caffeine, she recommended that I try Strattera/atomoxetine, which is one that stood out to me in my research because it also reduces symptoms of anxiety.

Well, now I'm suck in a conundrum. I have my test results, and I think I want to move forward with medication, but I don't think my mother will be supportive, and my dad won't either until she at least stands by. When I am in conversation with her, she says that I should be working out, eating differently, and out socializing with ""good people."" Never mind the fact that I am in church groups four days out of the week, I regularly talk with close friends from in college who she loves, and I spend lots of time with my high school friends who are some of the best people I know; she is also the one who cooks most of the time in my family, and she does a really good job making sure that we are all given nutritionally balanced (and lovely) meals. Admittedly, I could be doing more to get moving, but I have always found my motivation to work out extremely low. Last summer, one of my online school classes was running, and I did fine because my grade was on the line, but I honestly hated every second of it and didn't experience any pleasure from it (so if anyone has tips on how to make movement more engaging, hit me up, I'm desperate at this point).

It's really overwhelming. I don't think my mom is a bad person, but she is the strongest-willed person I have ever met and I do not think she is aware that other people just are not that way. She has always had high expectations for me, and I have appreciated how that has spurred me to be my best self, but I do not know how to explain to her that this diagnosis doesn't change that I'm her son and that I'm still capable, I just need a different kind of help because my brain is different. It feels frustrating to get through to her because when she brings up these concerns, and I address them calmly and factually, she gets upset that I am ""not listening"" to her. Sure, I could just go around her, I'm an adult, but as I am living off my parents' generosity (and insurance) for this period of life, I do not think that is either a right nor wise thing to do.

So, r/ADHD, what articles or books are out there for someone who is hesitant to address ADHD? Are there reputable and engaging resources to help me get through this process? Has anyone here experienced a family member being extremely reserved about ADHD treatment, and how did you get through it?

Thanks everyone!"

qhft93,16,2021-10-28,Advice on how to get into the market with no job experience?,itshirzz,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/qhft93/advice_on_how_to_get_into_the_market_with_no_job/,"Hello! 

I'm an engineering graduate who's currently working on a masters in data analytics (full time now but can go part time too). This is just my first semester but I'm feeling a little restless about not having work, so I've decided I'm going to start looking. 

The only problem is I have no prior experience. My work experience has only been in engineering and UX and product design. 

I'm currently looking into internships but each place seems to have their own requirements, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me learn 500 skills while I'm already doing a masters. 

The skills I currently have are: basic to intermediate Python, R and SQL, Tableau, Excel, and then the models I'm currently learning at uni (only basics since it's the first semester). I also have a couple of simple python and Tableau projects on Github (data cleaning and data exploration) 

Would these skills be enough to score an internship? Any thing you guys would recommend I add?"

I started to study from December skills related for web. I've been curious about JavaScipt, Python, C, and most recently I'm doing Java which I find really great, because although its OOP I love it's simplicity, and it helps me a lot with understanding things easier than with other languages. Now since I'm interested in Web Backend position specifically, I know I have to learn Spring Boot, Java, and SQL. Is it true that you need to learn Spring first before learning Spring Boot? How can I get involved with a real life-time projects that I can put on GitHub without making my own? Also I don't have a CS degree, I don't have much money to take a school, so I'm self-learner who study every day. What tips you could give me for landing a first job? I assume to work on projects that involves these technologies, but on the most places around my place I see they are recruiting people who have previous experience as interns already. How could I land a job without experience? What are HR team looking for in some individual, besides experience, that could fit me for first job in Tech?"
qhhw3m,100,2021-10-28,The Long Game: Chapter 29 - Show With Force,webkilla,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/qhhw3m/the_long_game_chapter_29_show_with_force/,"Arriving at the television studio, Fred couldn’t help but marvel – this was Hollywood, the real deal… and it looked as fake and as hollow as it was possible. Oh what a glorious display. The amount of human feces on the sidewalks also didn’t help.

Lady Vris didn’t seem to care much, still amazed at what she had seen at the natural history museum. She seemed to be struggling to find words to explain how she was feeling – the revelations of how much humanity had evolved and improved over millions of years… it seemed to be seriously putting the superiority of her own species, a narrative of superiority she had been taught from childhood, to the test.

“You ok?” agent Jensen inquired, having picked up plenty of cues on how upset Fred had become ever since getting unfettered access to the internet on his phone from the museum’s free wifi – the countless hit pieces written about him, as the world’s combined tabloid media had dissected his life and everything he had ever done on the internet and seemingly interpreted it all in the worst possible way. They had not been kind, and Fred was not feeling very happy about it.

“You know why I’m not happy – why wasn’t I briefed on just how much I had been dragged through the mud before we started this? What if the host starts talking shit?”

Agent Jensen put away his sunglasses and showed his credentials to the security guard in the booth, making the utterly awestruck rentacop push the button that opened the gate into the outer studio lot: “We made some very thorough profiles on you. We knew you’d likely respond poorly to seeing what’s been written about you. Plus, we didn’t know if you’d ever return… why waste resources hunting tabloid journalists when we already control what the history book writers will write about you? And we’ve arranged that the host will play nice as a term for your appearance”

Fred’s expression wasn’t pained – it was one of resigned annoyance: “At this point I’m not seeing why I shouldn’t just tell them how fucked Earth is and then fly away, so the silver throne can send its fleet to ash the rest of you”

“Our profiles also told us that you’re a far too nice and upright a person to let that happen without putting up a fight. Do tell me I’m wrong” Agent Jensen shot back, smiling just enough to hammer home how right he was.

Fred wanted to sneer. He wanted to say that agent Jensen was all wrong – but… he wasn’t – and that just made it all the more infuriating. Of course he wanted to save humanity, but the things being said about him? “We’ll address this after the show”

“Certainly. After you”

The studio itself didn’t look like much from the outside – if the signs were switched out, it would all look like a very convincing warehouse. Inside, Fred and Lady Vris were quickly guided to the green room where they were to wait until called to the stage. Enroute they passed a lot of stagehands and gophers, all of which might as well have been human owls from how their heads spun around trying to look at the real-life extra terrestrial going past them in a gallant stride, clad in a gown of impossible jewellery.

Fred’s mood might have been miserable, but Lady Vris seemed quite pleased with all the attention she was getting. The gophers and interns seemed to fighting amongst themselves to see who got to be in the green room in case the VIPs asked for anything specific – and while Lady Vris didn’t understand what they were saying, then she seemed more than able to pick up on their power struggle. The UNETCO agents did their thing securing the building and syncing up with studio security, leaving only agent Jensen and Goldie in the green room with the duo.

A few minutes later while agent Jensen and Lady Vris were stuffing their faces with the rich assortment of sugary pastries and donuts on the snack table, the show host popped into the green room.

“Hi – wow… ok, can I just say how incredible this is? Oh and hi, I’m Charles Johnson, it is such an honor to meet you two” the host said, expending a hand to Fred, who shook it, though Lady Vris didn’t when the hand passed to her, as her attention was focused on the magical marvel that was the glazed donut.

Fred gave the host an appraising look-over. The black man had nicely done hair, his smile revealed perfect looking teeth, and his expression beamed with the exact kind of charisma you’d expect from television show host: “She won’t understand a word you say. I can translate – and I assume you’ve been briefed on the blacklist?”

“Yes – right… of course. Couldn’t dream of wasting this opportunity, trust me. By the way, we figured that with all your alien monster fighting, then at one point we’d like to ‘ambush’ you with some interns in monster costumes – if that’s alright?”

Knowing full well that his foul mood was already clouding his judgement, Fred forced himself to accept the idea and not say anything snarky: “Shouldn’t be an issue”

“Excellent – now, the light up there will turn green sixty seconds before you’re supposed to come on, and there’ll be a buzzer too. The light will start flashing ten seconds before you come in, alright?”

Fred simply nodded. The host disappearing out the door towards the stage.

Similarly, to how the UN headquarters had set up its waiting room, a set of monitors showed camera feeds from the studio as the show started. It took a few minutes, an opening joke and some commentary of current news… that led to talking about Fred and Lady Vris, with one of the green room monitors showing the final feed being broadcast, where Fred could see the graphics added showing a picture from the UN press event.

The host continued on for a bit on that topic, then made a big deal out of how the planned guest of the evening had been cancelled. This made the live audience boo and hiss a bit, as it was apparently some American basketball player that Fred had never heard of, and the host looked quite sad and dejected – but then he spun around, a spotlight coming on to him: “…but you beautiful people are going to love who we got him replaced with. Now, you don’t want to know the kind of hoops that my producers had to jump through to get this to happen, but oh boy you are all in for a treat”

The audience quickly quieted down. From what little Fred had been able to look up about the show, then being an LA-based late-night talk show, it often featured Hollywood celebrities – so the audience probably expected some movie actor to come in and talk about his or her latest movie. The light on the wall in the green room had come on.

“You may have heard about this pair – they just about managed to clear every news frontpage on the planet earlier today. Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present, for their first ever talk show appearance: Frederik Anderson, galactic gladiator extraordinaire, and the very first documented extra-terrestrial alien to ever visit Earth…”

The host paused – and the crowd erupted in absolute mad cheers, the cameras panning around to capture their disbelief, shock and surprise.

“…Lady Vris, of the noble house of Xilas” the host said, gesturing towards the other end of the stage.

On cue, Fred and Lady Vris made their entrance. Fred forced on a smile and waved at the cameras, while Lady Vris mainly looked at people with mild curiosity and a pleased smile. Sitting down in the guest couch, the host joined them behind his desk and greeted the two: “On behalf of all of Earth, Mister Anderson and Lady Vris, welcome back to Earth!”

Fred translated, Lady Vris accepting the greeting and remarking that she found this adoration of her person quite pleasing. Fred chose to only pass on the first half of that: “Thank Charles, she likes it here too – and please, call me Fred”

The chit-chat that followed was surprisingly nice, Fred finding Charles’ personality disarming and easy to open up to: “No, it’s not an Italian suit – I had the ship’s AI look at terran suit fashion and make me something like that, but with a hint of shining one style”

“Wow… real alien fashion – but that’s nothing compared to Lady Vris’s dress. I mean, it looks down right magical! How are those gems floating around behind her head?”

“They have some really nice gravity technology – they can make all kinds of things float or move around. Same way their ships work”

The host looked genuinely impressed: “That is incredible – but then again, you look incredible too! I mean, I’ve seen your… uhm ‘before’ pictures. What have they been feeding you? Super space ‘roids?”

“Nah, no onions for me Charles – I got a shot of their nano-technology goop one day, and then I woke three days later completely hulked out” Fred said, flexing a little in his suit.

The host marvelled at Fred’s physique, but seemed to catch on to the implications of what Fred had said pretty quickly: “Wow… but hold on, does that mean that anyone could get a shot of that stuff and turn into a Hercules-looking person?”

“Probably – but that’s a bit beyond what the orbs Lady Vris gifted us with can do” Fred said, not wanting to give any indication that the opposite was actually true, it was merely impossible to talk an orb into doing it because it wasn’t a form of lifesaving medical treatment.

The host marvelled a bit more, talking about how some of his friends and family had gotten things like allergies or need for glasses cured. Fred looked out at the audience: “I believe you – and I suspect that a lot of people here have similar stories to tell. But hey, at l got used to my new body… I mean, it did come with a few downsides”

“Like what? Do you have to eat sixty pounds of lean beef a day?”

“No, it messed with my digestion – made it… better, I think? I haven’t had a bowel movement in almost three months, or any need to pee” Fred said, the audience reacting with a mix of laughs and shocked noises. The host raised an eyebrow and smirked, apparently appreciating the very human commentary.

The conversation continued along the line of how Fred had changed and what he had experienced, culminating in Fred ripping off his sleeves and taking everyone to the gun show: “Thank god for your second amendment or I probably wouldn’t be able to show you these without getting into trouble”

The audience cheered on as Fred tried to imitate the few body-builder poses he’d seen on random YouTube videos, Lady Vris even smiling, admiring her work.

After that the host switched the topic to Lady Vris and how the shining ones were. Fred was quick to note that he had only had a very limited exposure to shining one culture and customs – so he was probably a tad biased, considering what he was put through. The host acknowledged this, suggesting that Fred ask Lady Vris.

Passing on the host’s questions, Fred relayed Lady Vris’s responses in kind – putting some polite diplomatic spin on any mention of ‘primitives’ or ‘barbarians’: “She says that in her opinion the shining ones are the most cultured and perfect species in the galaxy. Mind you, from what I’ve seen, then opinions like that are more a product of their own internal propaganda. They legit believe they’re superior beings”

“Well – around here, most people who’ve claimed to be the perfect anything tend to have a few skeletons in the closet. Do tell”

Fred told the host of what he’d learned of the shining one’s past, how they had grey goo’d their homeworld and almost died in their orbital habitats out if not for the Allstar having saved them by developing nano-replication technology to give them breathable air and food. The host and the audience all listened along, riveted by the story.

“But after that, when the one’s who had gained control of the Allstar started conquering the other habitats to unite them all under a central dictatorship, they ran into issues about long-term exposure to radiation in space”

Fred told his story of how the Allstar had genetically regressed the species to harden them against radiation, and had a Kli orb display a hologram of how the original shining ones had looked based on what the Allstar had shown him. Lady Vris found this somewhat offensive, but recognized that she didn’t really have any control over what Fred said, though she was not quiet about her objection and rejection of his narrative.

“Yes, she said she doesn’t believe me – but then again, if you’ve grown up being told that you’re a superior being all your life, how likely are you to believe that you’re actually a primal version of your own kind with most of your history erased or rewritten?”

The host nodded, looking quite awestruck at all this information on how the shining ones came to be: “Yes that would be a harsh pill to swallow. Like trying to explain a chimp that knows sign language that its stupid”

Fred was about to go into explaining how the devolved minds of the shining ones, while still intelligent, did think differently, when some noise at the far end of the stage drew his attention.

The host quickly put on an exaggerated expression: “Oh my – what’s this? Have some more aliens showed up to fight you?

Fred raised an eyebrow and looked towards the stage exit where the noise had come, wondering exactly what the poor interns in costumes would look like. That was when five men decked out in urban-camo tactical gear and submachine-guns stormed onto the stage.

“Kli, is the champion shield still on? Ok, good, and Lady Vris is close enough for coverage? Perfect” Fred thought.

Turning to the host to ask if these were his, Fred found the host having disappeared under his desk. The gunmen quickly surrounded Fred and Lady Vris, all the while Fred remained calm and just turned to Lady Vris. As Fred was about to say something about Lady Vris staying calm, the gunmen opened fire.

The audience screamed – and the producers would have cut the broadcast if not for the pair of gunmen up in the control booth forcing them to keep the broadcast going.

It only took a few seconds for the gunmen to pick up on the fact that Fred hadn’t keeled over – and then they noticed the bullets floating mid-air in front of their firearms.

Fred got up, craned his neck side to side, then reached into his suit and drew out one his broadsword designs: “Gentlemen, you brought a gun to a knifefight – you’re not going to enjoy what happens next”

Now, bullet-resistant armor was made to cover vital areas like the chest, groin and head to prevent penetration by small metal objects – it didn’t really work that well against a dirty great sword to the arm or legs. The gunmen learned this in roughly the hardest way possible. With his first swing Fred took off a hand from one joker and managed to lodge the sword halfway into another one’s arm just under the shoulder. They didn’t seem very happy about it, but Fred quickly picked up on them screaming and shouting in what sounded Spanish.

Some of the gunmen tried to fire their weapons again – but that had the same useless effect – and the noise from the panicking audience was very distracting. One gunman drew a combat knife and lunged at Fred, but Fred responded by drawing his double-barrelled hand-canon from inside his suit: “And that’s a knife to a gun-fight”

The blast as one of the two barrels unloaded its steel slug round Fred realized that while he was quite used to the extreme noise, then Lady Vris appeared utterly horrified from the sound of the explosion.

The steel slug tore through the moron with the knife, right through the chest, and the gunman-now-knifeman slumped to the ground – and half a second later the sodium submunitions that had torn free from the slug cooked off, popping the man’s chest wetly like a tomato with a firecracker in it.

“I have one more of those in here” Fred said, drawing a second hand-canon with his other hand: “and two more of you in here – who’s first?”

The two remaining gunmen who hadn’t been killed or injured looked at Fred – well, they probably did, but with helmet, balaclava and mirrored sunglasses it was impossible to see their faces. Still, they lingered for a moment… then leapt back to distance themselves from Fred, and pointed their gun at the audience: “Drop it!”

“Kli, can you extend the champion shield so he can’t shoot anyone else? Fuck… ok – now what?”

Four other gunmen rushed out from the backstage area, two of them opening fire on Fred – one with some kind of automatic shotgun that almost made as much noise firing as Fred’s hand-canons – not that any of it had much effect beyond making Lady Vris scream in terror from the noise.

Fred wanted to drop everything and just hold Lady Vris tight – but… people could get hurt – and some people needed to get hurt. The gunmen started shouting at each other in the same probably-Spanish that Fred didn’t understand, the other gunmen equally turning the weapons on the fleeing audience or the camera men trying to hide behind their equipment.

“Ish, we have a situation here – I need translation. Fuck, no there’s not time to give these guys implants!”

It wasn’t fun prioritizing who he should protect. Fred knew he could move around the couch and put himself between the audience and the gunmen – but that would leave Lady Vris open. Where were the UNETCO agents? Where was the local security?

“Deploy the ship! I need close air support!”

The tense stand-off continued for a few more seconds, the gunmen moving towards a couple of stage-hands hiding behind a camera to grab some hostages when suddenly the building shook. Everyone looked around to see what the hell was happening as small trickles of dust came down from the ceiling above the stage lights.

In Fred’s head he heard Ish: “Gravitic lock-on in seven second – a distraction would be useful”

“Hey banana-fuckers – it’s me you’re after, don’t complicate this anymore than it needs to be” Fred shouted, figuring that if these guys spoke Spanish then they were likely some kind of South Americans – maybe Mexican or Columbian drug cartel assassins?

With three of the new gunmen pointing their guns at the audience – several audience members standing very still with their arms up – one of the gunmen lowered his arms and approached Fred, drawing his knife: “No funny business – you die now”

Fred nodded, slowly putting his hand-canon down – indeed, he made sure to draw out the motion as much as possible, so that as he rose up again he heard Ish: “Lock-on confirmed. Gravitic containment ready”

“If they shoot at the audience, can you champion shield them?”

“It will appear as so – just give the command to fire”

Fred rose up, smiling a lot more than the approaching knifeman liked, pointing his right hand at the knifeman with a well-aimed finger-gun: “This is the part where you surrender”

The knifeman looked down at Fred’s hand – Fred could hear the chuckle from inside the balaclava, even make out the outlines of a smirk: “No gringo, you die now and the whole world gets to see it”

The accent was unmistakable to anyone familiar with the various South American regional accents – but Fred knew nothing of this, so all he did was pull the trigger on his fingergun.

Of all the ways Fred had seen people get killed – be it from slicing aliens in half, slicing them open so their guts fell out, lodging a spear in someone’s skull and see them try to yank it out before succumbing to a seizure and bleeding to death – then Fred hadn’t seen someone crushed to dust with gravitic weapons before. It was very quick, and there was a loud snap as the compression was supersonic, air rushing in to fill the gap left behind from the implosion.

The other gunmen all started shouting, opening fire on the mortified audience, but… nothing happened. Two of the gunmen tried to run – Fred fingergunned all of them. This left the two first gunmen, the one Fred had cut the hand off, and the one with a sword stuck in his arm – they had gone down earlier, and in the half or so minute since the violence started had managed to unpack their medkits and were wrapping up the hand-less guy’s stump, trying to stop the bleeding with a certain type of familiar looking orb.

“Kli, transmit my eschaton key override to their orbs – make them go inert”

The two, having pulled away from the shooting, didn’t catch on to Fred approaching them until he was mid-stride. The guy with the blade in the arm tried to pull his sidearm, but Fred shook his head: “Do you honestly think that’ll work?”

For a tense breathless second the gunman looked at Fred – Fred could feel the man’s fear, even with the helmet and kit obscuring his eyes – but the gunman turned his gun on his hand-less peer, but before he could pull the trigger Fred had gotten Ish to pulverize the fool. This left the hand-less one, who seemed to be… praying? Sure, why not.

Looking around, Fred couldn’t see any other gunmen – oh well, a single perp surviving for interrogation would have to do: “Kli, reactivate the guy’s orb – and tell me if anyone else got hurt”

It turned out that the gunmen managed to jam the phones at the studio, so the jammer had to be found and turned off first before it was possible to inform the outside world of what was happening, for despite the gunmen’s attempt to set up for a live broadcast execution, then one of the producers had secretly managed to cut the broadcast when the control booth had been rushed.

With nobody else really hurt other than the gunmen, Fred was able to focus his time consoling Lady Vris, who was quite upset: “Make him talk! I want to know who tried to kill you!”

“I’m sorry – I told you, I don’t speak his language” Fred apologized for the third time.

The gunman with the missing hand, now but a stump covered in some kind of medical nano-goop that kept the wound closed and clean, had been tied up – not that he seemed to resist much, though it also appeared that the poor soul’s mind had been broken by seeing Fred turn his buddies into dust. He wouldn’t stop mumbling prayers.

The host, having emerged from whatever hole in the floor there apparently was under his desk, seemed to flip around between being ecstatic, horrified and utterly shocked. Police and UNETCO reinforcements arrived ten minutes later, finding a lot of dead security guards and UNETCO agents in one of the waiting rooms.

“No! Kli, can we save them?” Fred said, rushing over to the pile of dead agents, pulling out agent Jensen and Goldie’s still warm corpses.

Kli answered quickly: “No actions are required”

“What do mean? Is there nothing we can do?” Fred said, in his mind slipping into a that dark place where murderous retaliation seemed like a perfectly good idea, the place where torturing the surviving assassin until he talked and then going on a global crusade with orbital gravitic artillery to destroy the drug cartels that had sent these killers, seemed like a really sensible thing to do.

It took a few seconds, then Kli said: “Food. The agents will need food”

Fred had no clue what Kli was on about, but it completely derailed his train of thought, bringing him back from that dark place – and suddenly agent Jensen and Goldie stirred, rising from the dead, despite their very obvious bullet-wounds in the head. Horrified, Fred dropped the two and leapt back while making a very shrill scream, one befitting that of a young woman about to murdered in a slasher movie.

“Oww, do you mind?” agent Jensen said groggily a second or two later, as he struggled to get up.

All of the agents ultimately got up, but it was clear that something had changed: Each and every one of them looked like a starved skeleton! They had somehow been reduced to skin and bones, and all of them quickly began to express great hunger. Zombie UNETCO agents?

Interns were quickly dispatched to fetch snacks by the bucket-load. It was thus, in between inhaling donuts and chugging milkshakes, that Goldie explained that following Fred making that one healing orb cooperate with UNETCO for experiments, they were able to replicate a simplified version of Fred’s bio-boosts.

“You say that… but you look like it set in reverse”

It turned out that the only feature the orb had been able to reliably replicate, first with animal test subjects, but then later human test subjects, was a simplified version of the skull and spine reinforcements that Fred had: “We only had time to test it twice on human test subjects before we had to leave to the UN, but it was decided to roll it out globally to all UNETCO agents as quickly as possible. We carried modified orbs with us and boosted the local agents earlier at the park while you were doing autographs and pictures with Lady Vris”

Looking at the still very dead security guards, Fred sighed: “Neat – I guess that means that these guys aren’t so lucky”

“It’s still experimental – we don’t know the limits of this, plus you can see what it does to you. It needs energy to keep your body oxygenated, and matter to rebuild the damaged parts of you… if you’re skinny and try to do this, we’re pretty sure you still die if it starts recycling your organs to heal you” Goldie elaborated, trying to wipe the blood out of her blond hair with a wet-wipe, and failing terribly, in-between stuffing her face with whatever off-brand snack-cakes that were being put before her.

As some FBI agents showed up and took over the investigation, getting statements from everyone and collecting copies of all the recordings that had been made, the UNETCO agents more or less managed to eat themselves back into regular shape, though towards the end they were scavenging protein powder from the studio’s employee gym and sending out interns to raid nearby delis. Between the dozen or UNETCO agents, almost half a ton of food was ingested and used by their internally stored healing orbs to rebuild their bodies, the kli units ‘digesting’ the food as soon as it was in their mouths and using it to restore their depleted bodies.

“I swear… I don’t think I want to eat until next year” one of the agents complained, looking more than a little stuffed – all the while the guy’s leg muscles seemed to be ‘inflating’ back into shape at a speed Fred had only ever seen in old Pop-Eye cartoons.

“Spinach jokes aside, what happens now?” Fred wondered, all the while Lady Vris amused herself watching what appeared to be an exceedingly melodramatic Mexican sit-com on a nearby flat screen TV.

With the show host not wanting to go for a reshoot, and with most of the audience having fled, the show appearance itself was a bust – but the local UNETCO agents had several suggestions for what the duo could do now: Apparently, since the moment Fred and Lady Vris had touched down in the city, invitations to various parties and events had flooded the local UNETCO office, giving the duo a wide range of things to choose between.

Looking at the list on the agent’s smartphone, Fred marvelled at the list of celebrities who wanted him and Lady Vris to come party – so many of them were actors and musicians he had idolized… but what to choose?

“It’s too hot here – even now that its evening. Don’t you people have proper atmo-controls?” Lady Vris complained, looking oddly uncomfortable in the early evening west-coast heat.

Well that made things simpler: “We don’t have outdoors climate control here – this is how this world is, unregulated – but if you want to cool off, then I have an invitation from a local celebrity here to come to his private beach for a party”

Lady Vris looked at Fred with scrutinizing eyes, all the while agent Jensen chuckled at Goldie’s horrified expression. Ultimately Lady Vris said: “This beach, are the waters around it safe?”

“I’ll make sure they are – I’ll park the ship up top, have it on patrol scanning for assassins and sharks”

“What’s a shark?”

It took roughly twenty minutes for the news to spread – not just of the attack at the studio, but of Fred and Lady Vris attending the beach party. Hollywood had not seen buzz like that in decades.

qhlsrx,1,2021-10-28,Should I leave my job that I love for something more permanent with benefits?,Natural_Caller,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qhlsrx/should_i_leave_my_job_that_i_love_for_something/,"I’m a recent grad (May 2021) and this past summer, I interned for a large Crown corporation . At the end of my summer term, they asked me to stay on as a “Casual” but I still get full time hours (40 hr/week). The pay is actually really good for a summer student/casual position but I don’t have benefits, paid time off, vacay time, etc. 

I interviewed for an internal position recently hoping that I could stay on permanently. I love the people I work with, I love my job and I genuinely don’t ever have those days when I don’t want to come in to work. 

I didn’t get the position because they decided to go with someone else internally who had more experience. I kind of expected this. But my manager said she was super impressed and that my interview went great - just that it all came down to experience level. 

Now my manager is saying that she’s committed  to keep me on as a casual/find me a permanent spot since  we’re going to be losing employees nationally due to our company’s vaccination policy and because of some upcoming retirements/employee transitions  in the next few months/year. She agrees that its a fit for me to stay but its just about timing in order to find that full time position which I still would have to interview for. But she’s also very clear about the fact that there is work for me as a Casual and she is committed to guaranteeing those full time hours. She’s  honestly the best manager I’ve ever had and I do trust her to not suddenly leave me high and dry as its not uncommon for Casual employees at this company to be kept on until they can find something permanent. 

Well I have a couple of interviews coming up, one of which seems to be a good lead for a position called an Operations Assistant that is very similar to what I do now. Its full time, the salary range is similar if not higher to what I make now and it’s permanent with benefits, etc. its also very close to my current job so the location is also perfect. 

The problem is - I don’t know whether to stay at the job I currently love in hopes of getting something permanent or leave. My partner has benefits that I can take advantage of but they are limited. I don’t necessarily NEED the benefits at this time but they are definitely a nice thing to have, in addition to paid time off, vacay time, etc. I also love the culture at work which is rare to find. 

Although I’m a recent grad, I’ve already learnt that pay and benefits doesn’t always mean better. I’m super happy where I am now and I hate the idea of having to sacrifice that happiness in order to “be a responsible adult” since we are also in the process of moving out of my parents house. 

Before my internship position, I actually was offered a full time position at an analyst job that I worked at over the last year, which I also loved but I went with the internship because I knew that I would learn more( and earn more) and have all around better experience. People thought I was crazy turning down a permanent full time position but it’s probably the best decision I ever made for myself. 

I know that whatever career I chose doesn’t have to be permanent and I can always try to go back to the company I currently work for. I feel like I’m also assuming that working anywhere else is going to make me miserable compared ro my current job. 

I guess I’m concerned that nothing permanent will come up for me at my current company and I’ll be forced to leave."

Honestly y'all I'm so stressed out and disappointed in myself rn. I just got rejected from FBU without even an interview with a pretty strong resume and a perfect score on the codesignal. I've literally aced every since OA I've gotten but I haven't heard back after most of them. 

My resume's pretty decent- data engineering internship at &lt;big pharma company&gt;, undergraduate research, club leadership positions, GPA &gt;3.9, decent personal projects, volunteering, decent school for CS (you can tell by my post history)

I would've thought it's because I'm an international sophomore, but not getting an interview from FBU (which is literally a freshman/ soph program by a company that willingly hires international students) really did it for me.

I could go back and switch to Industrial A. next semester , seem to be a lot broader (electronics drive, power, CIM, transmissions, equipment, micro controllers) ; easier to find jobs.

qhqqc0,0,2021-10-28,What classes to take in what order for internships?,throwaway916359,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qhqqc0/what_classes_to_take_in_what_order_for_internships/,"Hi everyone! I’m currently a freshmen CS major at a Community College, and I was wondering which classes you all believed provided the most value, and which ones I need before the others. I’m asking as I’d like to apply to software engineering internships, but a lot of them require familiarity with a lot of concepts that I’ve only heard of, but are things I do have scheduled. 

The CC doesn’t have any prerequisites for most of these classes, and I know the numbers aren’t indicative of difficulty, but this is my current plan:

Fall 2021 (current):
- C++ Level 1
- Python 1

Spring 2022:
- Comp Org and Assem Lang
- C++ Level 2
- (tenative) Python 2?

Fall 2022:
- no CS courses planned (it’s 17 credits with just 4 classes T-T)

Spring 2023:
- Data Structure/Algorithms
- Discrete Structures

This is what my counselor and I had planned out, but I have no idea as to whether or not this is the right order to take these classes. I want to move a CS course into the Fall of 2022, but should I move Data Structures or Discrete Structures? I apologize if these questions are dumb/common knowledge, I’m still learning. Thank you so much in advance!

Also, as a side note, the requirements for a Associates in CS allow me to choose between C++ or Java, and since the University I want to transfer to requires C++, I chose that instead. Should I squeeze in Java somewhere as well?


TLDR: what classes should I take (in what order) to become a more competitive applicant for internships? Are there courses I take in my second year that I should be taking in my first year?"
qhqzrw,12,2021-10-28,From CC to IVY? Is it possible?,xTunsta2244,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/qhqzrw/from_cc_to_ivy_is_it_possible/,"I am currently a Freshman at a community college in VA, while I got into JMU, GMU, CNU, and other colleges in VA, due to personal reasons I chose to attend my local CC. My dream college was UVA and VT and I just wasn't competitive enough. I didn't have the desire to spend 30+ grand at any of these other colleges.

My current plan is to work 30+ hours a week and take 15 credits a semester. Due to VCCS agreements (agreements between my CC and schools such as UVA/VT) I could be guaranteed admission at my target schools if I stay at my CC for two years. However the more I look into it I want to aim higher. After looking at competitive transfer applications for Ivy league students I feel as if I could work hard enough to achieve that.

I have all A's (decently hard classes, would work to take harder classes) and learning Spanish (Spanish class but primarily outside of class).

However to make myself more competitive I have been looking at...

1. Make Student Senate (would apply next fall) (VT/Pres would be the goal)
2. Join Phi Theta Kappa (be involved and take initiative in the group) + work to make leadership in the club
3. Start tutoring (either paid at a private company or unpaid at my CC)
4. Make my own club, either Mock UN, Debate, a community service or a Financial club
5. Look into a academic honor/award I could work towards. Preferably business/finance related since I am a business major.
6. Maybe take up an internship at the VMFA (maybe it wouldn't be helpful though since it's outside of my major? If so does anyone have any thoughts finding an Finance/Business internship at a Freshman)

If I keep up good grades and achieved everything I'm aiming for would I even have a chance of attending Cornell, Dartmouth, Northwestern, or Columbia (my favorite/top IVIES)?

Any feedback is helpful, I am quite an ambitious person and want to know if I should put in my time or if I am being unreasonable. Thank you in advance!"

I am a current sophomore majoring in cs that is contemplating my plans for this upcoming summer. What I want to do is a maymester study abroad program that my school offers, which would be until around the end of June, and then stay abroad for the rest of the summer by possibly finding an internship abroad or just traveling and working odd jobs and being able to travel around Europe. My question is, would not having an internship this summer be seen as a negative to future recruiters? I interned with Facebook this last summer, so I know my resume at least has that going for me. Obviously a recruiter would rather see more work experience, but I just really want to travel abroad this summer. The perfect scenario would be to get an internship abroad that allows me to travel, but I don't want to assume I'll have that option as most companies don't want to hire an American over a local due to visa stuff.

tldr: if I travel instead of interning this summer, will that make or break my future employment options?"

qhwd40,2,2021-10-28,Internship Offers Question,MC-Sierra117,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qhwd40/internship_offers_question/,"I'm currently a college freshman majoring in civil engineering and have been to two interviews since I've started college in order to obtain an internship for Summer 2022. One such interview was for a local construction company offering an Estimating Internship position, as I hoped to get some construction-related experience. I was hoping to get field experience as well, but I believe the position offered is the only one available at the moment. Another interview though was for an internship with the WFLHD (Western Federal Lands Highway Division) in the U.S. 

I am in a predicament right now though because, although I would rather have the WFLHD internship as it more closely relates to the specialization I am interested in (transportation engineering), I actually have yet to officially apply, and it could be months until I actually receive a response about whether I was accepted or not. I was able to hold an interview with them already through a follow-up after a university career fair which I believe went really well, but there is still a factor of uncertainty. Furthermore, the internship itself is located out of state over the summer, which slightly interferes with some of my 

On the other hand, the local construction company is asking for a second interview with the Chief Estimator, which I believe has a high chance of success of at least obtaining it. But, if I continue with a second interview and accept the offer this early, I fear I would eliminate any chances of a WFLHD internship that I think would overall be more beneficial. I'm sure that both would definitely be great experiences regardless, and I'm lucky to have received such an offer at all this early in my college career, but I wanted to get some insight from others on what they believe might be the best course of action.

So my final question is:

**Would it be more beneficial as a Civil Engineering freshman to accept an early internship offer for an Estimating Internship at a construction company, or wait to apply for a transportation internship I am more interested in at the risk of losing the first internship offer?**

And also:

**How beneficial is an Estimating Internship to a future Civil Engineer? Do Civil Engineers work with costs a lot in the workforce, or would the knowledge/experience gained be applicable to civil engineers, or even more specifically, transportation engineers?**

One alternative I could see is just accepting the Estimating Internship first and then e-mailing that I'd be unable to do it later if I do manage to get accepted into the other internship, but I feel like that'd give a really bad impression of me. Have any of you been in a similar situation regarding job offers or internship offers? How do you weigh the benefits?"

What are my options?

I just started my sophomore year after doing an internship this summer and being asked to stay on part-time while in school. I received offers from 3 manga and 1 big (n) and I am going to take 4 quarters off to do them. At this point, I won’t graduate until 2025 and I don’t know if I can bear 3 more years of this.

I have never been good at school. Ever. Remote work solved all my ADHD problems and helped me get a 4.0. Now that classes are in person, I have been unable to focus and have repeatedly missed class.

One of my biggest concerns is that I go to a B10 (bottom 10) school that no one knows and I am being forced to take all the introductory CS classes. I have talked to everyone in the department and they say I just have to do it. Why should I pay 5k per class if they are teaching me something I have been doing for 8 years?

qhy4m0,2,2021-10-28,Early in career switching from web to mobile dev,career_throwaway8933,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qhy4m0/early_in_career_switching_from_web_to_mobile_dev/,"Bit of background, I graduated with a CS degree in 2019 from a standard state university.  In college I had 2 internships one doing web dev and the other more general IT work.

After graduating I got a job doing web dev that I've been working at for a bit over 2 years now. 

I messed around with Android development very, very little in college (not anything I'd want to put on a resume, think todo list, calendar, calculator, etc apps).  While I don't necessarily dislike webdev I mostly just ended up here because the jobs are common and it's what I've done. 

I am heavily looking at switching to mobile dev ideally with Flutter but I am not opposed to iOS or Android.  My main concern is that webdev is seen as less 'hard' than other areas and if I continue down this path I will be shoe horned into web development my entire career.

In short, now is the time to experiment not in 10 years. 

My primary question is about the best approach to preparing for applying for mobile jobs.  I am confident in my ability to pick up new frameworks, but I don't want to apply for an iOS/Android/Flutter job without any 'real' experience.  

So that leads to ok, build an app.  Would it be better to have one fully featured deployed app with one framework or create smaller apps in each? (I don't foresee making proper apps in 3 different frameworks a good use of time).

I don't want to box myself in as just Android, just iOS, etc and lose out to other opportunities because a good company is looking for someone with experience on different platform."
qhyptr,6,2021-10-28,"Life during covid sucks (what a surprise, i know)",tetzugani,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/qhyptr/life_during_covid_sucks_what_a_surprise_i_know/,"This was originally supposed to be about how socialising sucks thanks to covid, but while writing I found several other things to vent about, all related to the big C, so ye, this is messy to read through.

\---------------------

So ever since covid began, I've been in an ever deteriorating state of loneliness. About 2 months into the whole mess i downloaded Tinder, which actually helped me find a GF. Nowadays she's pretty much the only person I get to talk to. I mean, it's not like I'm completely lonely and I know that I'm very fortunate to at least have someone to talk to, but I really just miss the usual stupid daily conversations I'd have on college campus. I'm currently working on my finals, from home, meaning I'll never have that specific feeling again. Jumping into the less personal work environment also feels like a brick wall I was never prepared to climb, I just hate it.

Over the many months of covid quarantine (which has never been lifted where I live, ever since February '20!) I've repeatedly been searching for story-based video games, MMORPGs and dating sims. Never knew why exactly, I just really felt the need to play one of those games, like those would fill some void inside of me. So uh yeah, after some thinking i figured out that I just miss meeting new people and talking to someone outside of my 3-man friend group. Thing is, it's not that easy. Before meeting my gf i exclusively used Tinder to talk to people all around the world (back then, the global feature was still free, idk what it's like nowadays), but in order not to feed her insecurities, I obviously removed that app from my phone as soon as we noticed that we had something going on. Unfortunately though, there doesn't seem to be an app or something of the sorts to just find friends, that doesn't turn into dating shit.

I've also tried discord servers, those just didn't work for me at all.

This whole post has no red lining and no purpose whatsoever, it's just incredibly frustrating to know that such a massive part of my life has been ruined by an event that was supposed to last for 2 weeks. Half of my college life, the best time of my life, has been robbed and ruined, and I lost any connection to the contacts I still had 2 years ago.

All in all, aside from the occasional existential dread, I'm doing pretty well so that's much much better than the depressive episode I started the covid era off with, another problem is just that I feel like a waste of space, in no small part thanks to my parents.

Working on my finals, I still needed a place at an internship to get the necessary amount of experience to even know what I'm writing about. I spent the better part of 5 months looking for new job offers all over my country whenever I had the chance, but to my parents it always just looked like i was playing video games, however the fuck that is supposed to work. My favorite games do look like job centers and word documents, obviously. Even explaining things didn't help, so i've essentially been stuck in a household with people that talked down on me for anything I've done in the past 5 months, despite me finally getting the internship I really wanted and starting with work next week.And then they are surprised about the fact I finally wanna move out to get my life together.

I feel the past 2 years have been a sneakpeek into this world's hard mode when it comes to graduating college and finding a real job, with nobody there to help me out, people constantly shitting on me for anything I do and me not finding a solution to any one of my problems, even if it's just finding a fucking MMO to sink my conscience into so i don't have to think about my future as much.

Well, that kinda went off track.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: little addon but I'm insanely scared that i'll screw up my internship cuz it's an area i don't really have any experience in. Usually you need some basic knowledge to even be accepted but I genuinely don't know what I'm doing this time around, and I really don't want to disappoint my boss for giving me the chance to get out of this hell hole called home office. I mentioned that I know basically nothing during the job interview and they said it wouldn't be a problem if i was willing to study more, but I'm still anxious just thinking about starting work in a field I've literally only ever heard about or seen in videos. I've visited some online classes the past few days to get a bit up to speed but even still it's gonna be rough"

How likely is it that I receive a FT offer after I graduate a year later? (Assuming things go well during the internship)
qi2u55,3,2021-10-28,Career Options,Appropriate-Big-5983,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qi2u55/career_options/,"Throwaway account for anonymity.

I am currently a Junior Computer Engineering student at a non-target school.

Last summer I interned at a software company in NC, 22/hr (remote). I had a really good experience, and I really enjoyed the project that I was working on. I was hired as a year round intern for a different team but same project. I now work about 13hrs per week on top of school for the same company. My role over the summer was as a software dev, and has now evolved into more of a cloud maintainer(not exactly sure my title). The year round intern role is a pipeline to full time usually for interns in their junior year(i was in my sophomore year).

I've explored my options at other companies and was rejected from Morgan Stanley, Amazon, and Microsoft all in the final rounds. I have upcoming interviews with Goldman Sachs, Facebook, C1, and Tik Tok. 

The problem that I am having is that I would like to return to my current company next summer, and potentially following graduation. But, the work I am doing is not worth 22/hr. I have taken on some of the responsibilities of a team member that is retiring at the end of the month, and he was making upwards of 130k. While I do want to see what other opportunities are out there, I mainly want a competing offer to counter my manager with and prove that I should be paid at least 30/hr (on the low end). 

Also, these interviews are extremely stressful and have impacted my study/social life negatively. At this point I just want to focus on school and work, and not worry about the internship search. My career advisors at school suck and none of my friends understand the pinch that I seem to be in. 

When should I start talking with my current manager to see what accommodations he can give me? Before or after I get an offer?"

As in, we have a bunch of open positions we can’t fill because they can’t find qualified candidates so we are forever overwhelmed by the workload. But the pay is…bad. This is the kind of job that is sold as a  “career position” The kind of job where I thought my whole life I would get and then be set and able to support a family… lol. 

But I had brought this up to my parents and had said my new coworker who moved here for this job could only get some of the shittiest housing in town and is living pay check to pay check and is looking for another job because he can’t afford to work here, another coworkers in her 30s told me her and her husband want to have kids and even though her and her partner both work full time, she’ll never have a child for financial reasons. And me? My partner is in school. I have debt because we can’t support ourselves (no kids) off of my salary. My parents response? “Good! That’s how it should be. Get more roommates. No one is supposed to be able to live alone. If she can’t afford a baby, she’s probably just bad with money. And you never should have moved out of our house and tried to play house with your boyfriend” What? They more or less forced me into college and dictated what I major in and now that’s I’ve got that “career office job” and can’t pay my rent without debt they say good? That they agree I should work 40 hours a week in this high stress job and I don’t deserve to make enough to have my own place and go see a movie without overwhelming guilt of spending $30? Rude.

Edit: wow this blew up! A few common things I’ve seen is if my parents are boomers. They are barely boomers when I Google the age range. So technically yes. They had me later in life. Plus, they have a boomer attitude. But take that how you will. Also, my partner does contribute! He’s just in school and hasn’t worked 100% of the time but I am happy with his contribution. Also, I do plan on learning to do hair once my bf graduated! Thank you all for the support of that dream!

Edit 2: to try and provide some more clarification to commonly asked questions. Where I live, I saw that for two people and one working full time, you’d need to make $22/hr. I do not make that. I work for the government. In the kind of job that when I was growing up I would have assumed you could support a stay at home spouse and a kid or two off of, but I know now that is not true. How did I get this job if I’m young and it has strict requirements? Well, I got started a year before I even graduated as an intern and had a personal connection (at a different agency but that gave me a big edge) I will also go on record and say I have made plenty mistakes learning how to manage myself and my finances as an adult. Still learning! My parents were born in 60 and 64. Which Google told me that they are boomers. I apologize if that’s not true. Yes, my dad was close to 40 when I was born. No, I did not move out of my parents house as a teenager. And no, staying at their house was not really a good option. Without getting into too many details, there’s a lot going on there. Sorry for the long edit. I just have gotten a lot of questions regarding these things.

Edit 3: since some of y’all need a reminder, everyone deserves a living wage. Idc if you’re working in an office or the service industry. If you’re working 40 a week, you deserve to be able to pay your rent. And even to go do something fun with friends sometimes. And yes, you should even be able to afford a cat. Some of you guys are doing backbends to justify that you think people doing certain jobs don’t deserve to afford housing or to do anything remotely enjoyable and the fuck is the matter with you? Everyone deserves housing and a living wage idc idc idc. oh and and that applies to young people too since I see a lot of people suggesting you people should be working nonstop but deserve to still be struggling? Also, my parents were born 64 and earlier. They are boomers. They had me when they were pushing 40. Why is this concept so hard for some of you?"
qi9ru4,43,2021-10-29,21yr old(going to be 22 coming feb) Indian male persuing b.tech ranting and requesting recommendations and advice regarding what to do in future.,KINGYOMA,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qi9ru4/21yr_oldgoing_to_be_22_coming_feb_indian_male/,"Warning- Long Post Ahead. Read at your own risk. Completely sfw. The op is not liable for any eye strain caused.

So as the title suggests,  I am from India, born and brought up in Delhi. I am currently persuing b.tech from a tier 3 college. Never had a knack for exams in general, but still performed above average in them and was(and still is) often counted among bright student or a student with lots of potential, even though I feel like an imposter listening to all that praise, because I know I didn't put much effort in clearing exams.
I always had curiosity for science and technology and since the age of 10 when I got my first computer, I often browsed sights labeling scientific wonders and mysterious phenomenons of the world, and often tried to generate rational explanation for them with the bounds of my then knowledge.
After growing up a little, I got interest in technology, especially consumer technology and wanted to start my own company that makes such consumer tech, like blackberry phone (believe it or not when people were getting crazy about iphones, I was crazy for blackberry and when lumia came I was crazy for it and even got myself a lumia 540. I always had this going against the trend mentality, even it ends up causing misfortune in the long run.)
So, yeah I had a dream for making a company and Even created a logo, brand name and tagline for it. I was 12yrs old at that time.
Some more growing up later, came 11th and 12th class and I chose PCMB, even though I didn't want to be a doctor. I got a lot of scorn for taking PCMB when mbbs was not in plans and for making my 1th and 12th difficult. Well as I wrote in the beginning I studied things for curiosity’s sake and never took exams seriously enough. I got 84.6 percent in 12th and was very happy because I scored highest in chemistry in which I never got much marks due to calculation mistakes in numericals. I got 92, even though in test papers I solved for preparation I never got above 50.
So, after 12th my parents, especially my mother tried to coerce me to take medical, but as I stated earlier I didn't want to be a doctor at all. So, she got me admitted in fiitjee, to crack jee. Never got a knack for exams, so gave two attempts and flunked both with ranks akin to landline number. After giving two attempts, I was sitting at home not caring about the world at large and still in my go with the flow, do things at whim approach, when my home tutor called and asked about college scene. I replied in negative and he recommended to try for IP University. Again another exam another month of half hearted preparation, with surety in mind that another landline no. Is in destiny. When exam result came I somehow got 12001 rank, nothing to brag about, but enough to sit in counselling process.
By this time my interest spread to industrial and manufacturing technology, and robotics. Now, I didn't know what will fullfill both of these curiosity and opted for b.tech in MECHANICAL AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING. By combination of my rank and my Frankenstein choice of stream, I got a tier 3 college and hence started my college life, which ended after one and half semester due to riots and then pandemic. The lockdown sort of crushed aspiration and spirit and financial equilibrium of my home leading to very destructive scenarios.
See, I come from a lower middle class moderately orthodox family, where domestic violence and verbal abuses was the norm and it's often caused by our unstable financial situation. My parents especially my mother had to sell every gold ornament to bring money for monthly expenditure. She never saw utility in wearing those and for her it's always was a financial asset. So, discord was the daily drama. Me and my sister was used to this and had are career planned in such a way so as to escape from home as soon as we become financially independent.
Well, covid didn't took kindly to our plan and instead wreak havoc in all our lives by widening the fault lines of our home, by making the financial crunch unbearable. Long story short, my mother died due to covid and late treatment of it, due to unavailability of money and resources in the oxygen crunch delhi witnessed. She was just 47.

And before her death me and my mother had some pretty bad fight that lead to me punching her, which is wrong by every standard and something, I will be guilty of till the end of life.

My sister is 19 and she was devastated after hearing the news our mother's death.  She still wake up crying at night remembering her.
Me on the other hand never had a bond with my parents, for me they were nothing more than puppets of society dancing on its tune. So, I am completely alright neither sad nor its opposite. My father on the other hand now stays outside only and returns late at night. Nothing new here.
So, in all there's not much changed, other than the fact that the house has become silent. We all three are now like unknown people trying to tolerate each other.

Many other things happened in this pandemic, which sort of made me suicidal. I am out of that phase now. If you want to know further click on the links below-
Well, you are in treat to know why I didn't have bond with my parents, especially my mother.

So, my objective for writing this post is to ask for advice. See, I am kind of become indifferent to the world. I have stopped caring for anything as nothing is too important to care. My desire to  start a company is all but vanished, having just little trinket here and there in my subconscious. I now want to earn just enought to have 1bhk flat, pay for electricity, water, groceries, high speed internet and could have resturant dinning or pizza once a week. Nothing more, nothing less. I just now want to live peacefully while embracing epicureanism. I don't have any grand goals or ambition anymore. The problem is I am in 7th semester now and since 3rd semester till now, I didn't understood shit due to online mode. I was never able to learn anything of academic value from internet. Another factor is that I am a sort of slow learner and needs to like the teaching method of the teacher to be able to learn something. I need to be present in classroom to be able to learn something.
An example of this limitation happened in first when I didn't understood one concept called k-maps and how to solve. I didn't understand the logic behind pair making in it and due to this left all questions regarding in all the exams of first semester. Cut to third semester, the topic was again  the part of course and the teacher of the subject gave just a 15 minute explainer of what is k-map and how to solve it and I understood it immediately. She made the explanation so simple and explained the logic behind pair and quad making in such easy manner that I was able solve complex k-map related questions without any problems. Similar examples are littered all across my academic life and shows that I need that physical classroom and a connection with teacher to learn something. Unfortunately that wasn't available due to lockdown, because of which I didn't understood a thing. 

I somehow was able to maintain my grades and have 8.2 cgpa till 6th semester. But skill wise I am just an empty tool box. I neither have workshop skill nor have technical skill nor have communication skill nor have any internship experience nor have any extra curricular achievement under my belt in my whole academic life till now. I tried to upskill myself by learning programming and autocad, from Coursera as our college partnered with it to provide free access to it's library of courses. Again that same issue arose, the need for classroom and connection with teacher, both of which are not an option in these online upskilling platform. I end up bricking my computer while learning programming and after that didn't try to learn anything online because it never worked and caused problem for other people in home who are depended on that single computer.

Now, placements are going on in campus and our college provided many venues of getting jobs. But most of the platforms our college partnered with mostly posts programming related jobs with no mention of mechanical jobs anywhere. And since I know nothing about programming, I don't feel like sitting in them. I am also inept in mechanical due to not able to learn anything during pandemic. Not able to learn autocad and other software due to learning issues caused by online medium and as such I feel like I won't be able to get any job.

I still want to enter in the field of robotics, mechatronics, industrial automation etc. But I don't have any relevant skill to enter any of these fields. As I mentioned earlier, I just want to earn enough to live modestly to be able to pay bills, have a 1bhk residence of my own in delhi, have outside dinning once a week and have have job in these fields.
That's it.
Please provide advice regarding what can I do to achieve this mundane aspiration?

Please don't suggest govt jobs or upsc, because as I already mentioned I  not too keen to give exams, especially if it's for being a servant of some nincompoop in kurta pajama.
I am thinking of preparing for gate, but only after college gets over and if it would help me able to enter the above mentioned fields. Do provide your insight regarding this.
I don't want to go abroad either for further studies or job. It's something I decided due to my chronic skin ailments that's been causing me problem for 10 years now and haven't been cured. My family is burdened with expense of the treatment of my ailment and I don't want to burden them further. Another reason is that my father is an idiot and doesn't know anything about education. My mother was the one who take care of our academics and now she's gone that responsibility is on me. I don't want my sister's academics to suffer and doe that I need to be here in her vicinity, so that my father's antic won't ruin it.
So, please help this fellow engineer, If I could be called one."

So, my objective for writing this post is to ask for advice. See, I am kind of become indifferent to the world. I have stopped caring for anything as nothing is too important to care. My desire to  start a company is all but vanished, having just little trinket here and there in my subconscious. I now want to earn just enought to have 1bhk flat, pay for electricity, water, groceries, high speed internet and could have resturant dinning or pizza once a week. Nothing more, nothing less. I just now want to live peacefully while embracing epicureanism. I don't have any grand goals or ambition anymore. The problem is I am in 7th semester now and since 3rd semester till now, I didn't understood shit due to online mode. I was never able to learn anything of academic value from internet. Another factor is that I am a sort of slow learner and needs to like the teaching method of the teacher to be able to learn something. I need to be present in classroom to be able to learn something.
An example of this limitation happened in first when I didn't understood one concept called k-maps and how to solve. I didn't understand the logic behind pair making in it and due to this left all questions regarding in all the exams of first semester. Cut to third semester, the topic was again  the part of course and the teacher of the subject gave just a 15 minute explainer of what is k-map and how to solve it and I understood it immediately. She made the explanation so simple and explained the logic behind pair and quad making in such easy manner that I was able solve complex k-map related questions without any problems. Similar examples are littered all across my academic life and shows that I need that physical classroom and a connection with teacher to learn something. Unfortunately that wasn't available due to lockdown, because of which I didn't understood a thing. 

I somehow was able to maintain my grades and have 8.2 cgpa till 6th semester. But skill wise I am just an empty tool box. I neither have workshop skill nor have technical skill nor have communication skill nor have any internship experience nor have any extra curricular achievement under my belt in my whole academic life till now. I tried to upskill myself by learning programming and autocad, from Coursera as our college partnered with it to provide free access to it's library of courses. Again that same issue arose, the need for classroom and connection with teacher, both of which are not an option in these online upskilling platform. I end up bricking my computer while learning programming and after that didn't try to learn anything online because it never worked and caused problem for other people in home who are depended on that single computer.

Now, placements are going on in campus and our college provided many venues of getting jobs. But most of the platforms our college partnered with mostly posts programming related jobs with no mention of mechanical jobs anywhere. And since I know nothing about programming, I don't feel like sitting in them. I am also inept in mechanical due to not able to learn anything during pandemic. Not able to learn autocad and other software due to learning issues caused by online medium and as such I feel like I won't be able to get any job.

I still want to enter in the field of robotics, mechatronics, industrial automation etc. But I don't have any relevant skill to enter any of these fields. As I mentioned earlier, I just want to earn enough to live modestly to be able to pay bills, have a 1bhk residence of my own in delhi, have outside dinning once a week and have have job in these fields.
That's it.
Please provide advice regarding what can I do to achieve this mundane aspiration?

Please don't suggest govt jobs or upsc, because as I already mentioned I  not too keen to give exams, especially if it's for being a servant of some nincompoop in kurta pajama.
I am thinking of preparing for gate, but only after college gets over and if it would help me able to enter the above mentioned fields. Do provide your insight regarding this.
I don't want to go abroad either for further studies or job. It's something I decided due to my chronic skin ailments that's been causing me problem for 10 years now and haven't been cured. My family is burdened with expense of the treatment of my ailment and I don't want to burden them further. Another reason is that my father is an idiot and doesn't know anything about education. My mother was the one who take care of our academics and now she's gone that responsibility is on me. I don't want my sister's academics to suffer and doe that I need to be here in her vicinity, so that my father's antic won't ruin it.

qia7wt,38,2021-10-29,21yr old(going to be 22 coming feb) Indian male persuing b.tech ranting and requesting recommendations and advice regarding what to do in future.,KINGYOMA,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qia7wt/21yr_oldgoing_to_be_22_coming_feb_indian_male/,"Warning- Long Post Ahead. Read at your own risk. Completely sfw. The op is not liable for any eye strain caused.

So as the title suggests,  I am from India, born and brought up in Delhi. I am currently persuing b.tech from a tier 3 college. Never had a knack for exams in general, but still performed above average in them and was(and still is) often counted among bright student or a student with lots of potential, even though I feel like an imposter listening to all that praise, because I know I didn't put much effort in clearing exams.
I always had curiosity for science and technology and since the age of 10 when I got my first computer, I often browsed sights labeling scientific wonders and mysterious phenomenons of the world, and often tried to generate rational explanation for them with the bounds of my then knowledge.
After growing up a little, I got interest in technology, especially consumer technology and wanted to start my own company that makes such consumer tech, like blackberry phone (believe it or not when people were getting crazy about iphones, I was crazy for blackberry and when lumia came I was crazy for it and even got myself a lumia 540. I always had this going against the trend mentality, even it ends up causing misfortune in the long run.)
So, yeah I had a dream for making a company and Even created a logo, brand name and tagline for it. I was 12yrs old at that time.
Some more growing up later, came 11th and 12th class and I chose PCMB, even though I didn't want to be a doctor. I got a lot of scorn for taking PCMB when mbbs was not in plans and for making my 1th and 12th difficult. Well as I wrote in the beginning I studied things for curiosity’s sake and never took exams seriously enough. I got 84.6 percent in 12th and was very happy because I scored highest in chemistry in which I never got much marks due to calculation mistakes in numericals. I got 92, even though in test papers I solved for preparation I never got above 50.
So, after 12th my parents, especially my mother tried to coerce me to take medical, but as I stated earlier I didn't want to be a doctor at all. So, she got me admitted in fiitjee, to crack jee. Never got a knack for exams, so gave two attempts and flunked both with ranks akin to landline number. After giving two attempts, I was sitting at home not caring about the world at large and still in my go with the flow, do things at whim approach, when my home tutor called and asked about college scene. I replied in negative and he recommended to try for IP University. Again another exam another month of half hearted preparation, with surety in mind that another landline no. Is in destiny. When exam result came I somehow got 12001 rank, nothing to brag about, but enough to sit in counselling process.
By this time my interest spread to industrial and manufacturing technology, and robotics. Now, I didn't know what will fullfill both of these curiosity and opted for b.tech in MECHANICAL AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING. By combination of my rank and my Frankenstein choice of stream, I got a tier 3 college and hence started my college life, which ended after one and half semester due to riots and then pandemic. The lockdown sort of crushed aspiration and spirit and financial equilibrium of my home leading to very destructive scenarios.
See, I come from a lower middle class moderately orthodox family, where domestic violence and verbal abuses was the norm and it's often caused by our unstable financial situation. My parents especially my mother had to sell every gold ornament to bring money for monthly expenditure. She never saw utility in wearing those and for her it's always was a financial asset. So, discord was the daily drama. Me and my sister was used to this and had are career planned in such a way so as to escape from home as soon as we become financially independent.
Well, covid didn't took kindly to our plan and instead wreak havoc in all our lives by widening the fault lines of our home, by making the financial crunch unbearable. Long story short, my mother died due to covid and late treatment of it, due to unavailability of money and resources in the oxygen crunch delhi witnessed. She was just 47.

And before her death me and my mother had some pretty bad fight that lead to me punching her, which is wrong by every standard and something, I will be guilty of till the end of life.

My sister is 19 and she was devastated after hearing the news our mother's death.  She still wake up crying at night remembering her.
Me on the other hand never had a bond with my parents, for me they were nothing more than puppets of society dancing on its tune. So, I am completely alright neither sad nor its opposite. My father on the other hand now stays outside only and returns late at night. Nothing new here.
So, in all there's not much changed, other than the fact that the house has become silent. We all three are now like unknown people trying to tolerate each other.

qibenc,8,2021-10-29,Advice on leaving a company?,NedTheGreatest,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/qibenc/advice_on_leaving_a_company/,"As the title suggests I'm thinking of leaving the company I am with. But it's not that straightforward.

I started here nearly 4 years ago as an intern. I went back to college for a year and now I've been working here for over 2 years full time.

I was never completely happy here but I liked the people and the work. I was looking for jobs else where but I only had 1 years experience at that point. 

A couple of months ago 2 of the senior guys left and since then 7 others have followed (we only have a little over 20 employees now)...those senior guys were the heart of the company really. 

Since I now have over 2 years experience, companies have been responding to my applications, when I was sending out CV's a year ago I didn't get any responses. I've had 4 interviews this week alone for jobs that I'm far more interested in.

The hard part is my manager has taken over for one of the senior guys who left and he is so stressed all the time. I genuinely like him, he's a great guy and handling the new responsibility as well as he could but how do I even begin to tell him I am leaving too? He's personally trained me up in a lot of things and depends on me for a lot of work at the moment.. 

Sorry if this is dragged out but I'm in a bit of a dilemma."
qic6gl,1,2021-10-29,How to explain a 3 year gap between High School and College for an internship? (more info in description),Better_Research8109,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qic6gl/how_to_explain_a_3_year_gap_between_high_school/,"Throwaway,

To keep it short, I was a straight-A student in high school and got into a top university. For one reason or another without getting into it, I did very poorly during the 3 years I was at my university and I wouldn't have been able to get into my major with my grades. So I decided to get my life back together and transferred to a college for a year and retook some of my classes related to my major and got straight A's again and just recently got accepted to my major at the same university for next year (January) which I think was because of my essay, improved grades, and a good upward trend and the overall redemption story. 

I am now applying to internships and at first, I was listing my previous university experience followed by my college experience, however, I wasn't getting any interviews. After seeing a post on this sub from another user where basically everyone had said you don't need to list your education experience if you didn't get a degree from there (which I don't know if that was good or bad advice), I started to not list it on my resume and instead put the university with an expected start date in January (I have got my acceptance letter and paid the registration fee) and now got my first interview funnily enough at a company I had applied previously a different position and had included my 3-year university debacle and my application was rejected. 

I didn't put my high school on my resume just my college (due to the credits I had from my university, I was able to use them to get an associate degree while at college which will finish this December so I just put that on my resume as well and included the expected graduation). I did however have job experience which I included and dates back to my senior year in high school. 

So they will probably ask me or try to get a sense of how old was I when started working at these jobs  and I don't want to lie. So I somehow have to quickly brush on my university experience and move on from it. I have a lot of good and relevant work experience plus a startup I started 2 years into university so I have a lot of more interesting things to talk about when asked about my background and experience, but I don't know how to frame this. Did I make a mistake by not including it on my resume and should I do so in the future? can/should I play it as a covid thing and if asked say I wanted to be closer to home or something during covid so I transferred or play it as a change of major thing?

Any info is appreciated."

The interesting thing to me is not the shitty lifestyle I have, but it’s the lifestyle my parents have that really fucks me up. 

When I was a kid, my dad worked two jobs (delivering pizzas for Domino’s, and an unpaid internship at a high end law firm) while he was going to law school. After graduating, he got a full time job at the firm he was interning at, but left after a couple of years because it was clear his abusive boss was never going to give him a raise. He found another firm, and after a few years there, that abusive boss was also not interested in giving him a raise. He quit his next job after three days because his new boss was smuggling blood diamonds into the country and he wanted my dad to help him setup shell corporations to hide his income. He then went out on his own and his first client fled the country and skipped out on the literal million dollars he owed my dad. His luck at his private practice didn’t get much better over the subsequent years. After moving halfway across the country to a state with a lower cost of living, he got out of law and got a job working for the state. At 62, he makes the same amount of money I do (I’m 37 and don’t have a great job myself) and he’s just now paying off his student loans from law school. He’s also racked up more than $20k in debt from his multiple neck surgeries (and yes, that’s AFTER insurance). 

My mom has spent 40 years as a cosmetologist, and while she loves her job and her clients, her career has destroyed her body. She has had two surgeries on her right hand, and she’s currently recovering from the third surgery on her left hand. Her hands are so weak that she has to use the edge of the kitchen countertop to pop open the lid on a bottle of ketchup. Still, at the age of 67, she’s going back to work part time as soon as she’s finished the physical therapy on her left hand. 

My parents have always been very frugal. In the last 16 years, they’ve not taken a single vacation. They never go out to eat or go to the movies. They buy all of their groceries in bulk and never buy name brand. They both drive base model economy cars. They own a modest house in a shitty neighborhood. But despite all of their frugal spending, despite the fact that they live in one of the cheapest states in America, they’ve been unable to afford unexpected home repairs (thanks to their shady contractor) and had to pay for them on credit. They’re now about to file bankruptcy for the second time in my life. They will likely never retire.

My parents are good, honest, intelligent, responsible people, and they work extremely hard with virtually zero complaints. But because of bad luck, bad bosses, and repetitive stress injuries, they are at their breaking point. Capitalism is killing my parents, and I don’t know if I’m going to fare any better than they have in the future.

Edit: But on the bright side, I just got a 42 cent raise. I’m sure that’ll more than cover the cost of helping my parents out."

To give a brief background about myself before I jump into my situation, I am a senior who will be graduating in May 2022. I received two offers, one from a well-known banking company for a non-rotational Associate Program, and one from another well-known financial company(but as an intern, not an associate). I did some research on what I'd be doing at the banking company, and it seems like it's related to Enterprise Contact Technologies, which include 'Call Management/Routing/Handling/Recording/Analytics', to be quite frank, that sounds like a back-end call center specialist, and I'm wondering if that position will even be relevant within the next 10 years. The job is also hundreds of miles away. The major pro about this offer is that it pays pretty well. The other offer is an internship for the summer, with the location being 5 minutes from my house. The role is more aligned with my interests, and has a better job outlook since I'd be working with the cloud and security. The only con is that it's an 3-month internship and then I'd be out of work as a new grad. That shouldn't be too much of an issue because I still plan on going back to school for graduate school.

So to sum everything up, should I take the well-paid associate program offer which entails of me becoming a back-end call center specialist? Or should I take the internship that is more aligned with my interests even though I would have already graduated with my bachelors."

There were 120 applicants and they chose 5. The internship is unpaid which is the norm in my country (Egypt).

The problem is that I am currently attending university 4 days a week Wich each day being from 8.15 am till 4 pm. Also there will be a lot of projects that will start in the next week.

The internship expects me to attend from 11 am to 5 pm 5 days a week which I told the person that talked to me that I won't be able to do that and they said I should still come and they will figure it out.

But realistically speaking they probably will still give me a lot of work that I won't manage to properly do because I'll be too busy with uni and its projects.

So my question is should I change my focus from uni into this internship keeping in mind this will drop my grades from the usual A+ to maybe B ? Or is my gpa more important at this point I should just focus on landing another internship in summer ?"

qild67,1,2021-10-29,Background check anxiety,LocalUsual1233,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qild67/background_check_anxiety/,"I got one job offer and now they are doing the background check. There is one thing worrying me so much. I am a fresh graduate, and during the study the school invited company A for us to lead a workshop project for three months. In the project, we as a team solved some business problems they are facing. The experience is quite relevant to my application, and thus I listed this experience under work experience, but I said it was just a workshop experience. At that moment I did not think too much, because I did help the company solve their business problems. However, after I got the offer and it came to the background check, it starts worrying me a lot. I did not list this experience in the employment history for the background check, because I realized that in any way, I am not the employee for the company, and it also overlaps with another internship I was doing at that time. At present, I start to feel it would be much safer if I listed this experience under the project experience or professional experience. However, things have happened, and in my opinion, at least I could say my original resume is not accurate.

Should I really worry about it? Or should I already start looking for other opportunities?"
qimdha,85,2021-10-29,"I’m begging you, please don’t make the same mistake I did.",Shim-Slady,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qimdha/im_begging_you_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/,"Hey all, thought I might share my story here as a precautionary tale - because no matter how blindly optimistic and loyal you might be to your workplace, I’m living proof that they don’t care.

I went to work for a large non-profit straight out of college in 2018. I had worked at this organization previously for an internship and was a huge fan of how cheerful and kind the staff had been to me. Everyone seemed really devoted, and extremely optimistic about the organization’s “mission,” so it was hard not to be excited about a full-time job straight out of college.

When I first started, I immediately noticed how long and how often unpaid overtime was expected. Since this organization often hosted large events, shifts could easily run 10-12 hours per day and sometimes into the weekends. But despite this, there seemed to be a collective understanding among the staff that this was “just how things were!” After all, the non-profit couldn’t succeed unless we all did our part. Sure it was hard! But it was for the mission! Might as well keep a good attitude about it.

I started noticing this trend more and more amongst the administrative roles. A cheery advocacy for what they would call “mission work.” Don’t want to work weekends? But it’s for the MISSION! I’m sorry, but we really need you to stay after hours to help. After all, it’s for the MISSION! In hindsight, it’s hard not to see the red flags. At one point I had even done the math out of curiosity. Over the course of the summer of 2019, I had worked 126 hours of unpaid overtime. But I was fresh out of college, and everyone seemed so bought in!

Besides, what’s one more hour of work when you’re buying good faith with the company? I’ll tell you exactly what it bought me.

In early 2020, the pandemic was in full swing, and it looked like our organization might have to make some cuts. There was a lot of nervous discussion about who might face the chopping block, but we were confident most of us would stay. Some staff had been there for decades - even had kids working there. We’d spent so many long nights and weekends together, it seemed impossible to imagine it might end. We were so wrong.

The news came in an email. Out of the 80+ staff that worked there, only 6 would be staying. Want to guess who they were? The admins. That’s right, they had opted to lose 74 loyal staff members in order to not have to slash their own salaries for the year. No goodbyes, no thanks you. Just 2 years of hard work and optimism down the drain.

You are always expendable. No matter how many late nights and weekend hours you may put in, loyalty is for dogs. Never forget it.

Eat the rich.

TL;DR: Worked for a cult-like nonprofit for 3 years and put in massive amounts of overtime. When it came down to it, the admins dropped us like flies to save their own salaries."

qimw1j,5,2021-10-29,Questions for former Amazon SDE interns,cjpoole2,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qimw1j/questions_for_former_amazon_sde_interns/,"Hello, I was just offered an SDE internship with Amazon for the summer of 2022. The internship is located at their new office in Nashville TN. I am very excited to be a part of this internship, but I have several burning questions that I am hoping some former interns may be able to answer.

What was the situation like with housing? Did you opt for corporate housing or did you find your own? If you went with corporate housing, how expensive was it and what was it like?

What was the work life balance as an intern? Did you feel pressured to work more than 40 hour work weeks, and was it necessary to work more in order to complete all of your assigned work? 

Also, Amazon says that they offer personal time off for interns, but how does this work because as far as I understand there are no hard-set working hours to begin with, so what would taking time off look like if you have no set hours? And how much are you allowed to take?

When you interacted with full time SDEs at Amazon, what impression did you get from them? Did they seem like they were happy in their job roles, or did they seem stressed and overworked as many Amazon SDEs have reported? Is it very common for them to be putting in more than 40 hour weeks?

What kind of events did they do for interns?

Any other information about your experience or about the company would be very appreciated, as much detail as possible, thank you!"
qimwdg,60,2021-10-29,Should I take unpaid internship just to add it to my resume?,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qimwdg/should_i_take_unpaid_internship_just_to_add_it_to/,"Important info, I'm a freshman. Here's my current [resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/q3jvgs/computer_science_freshman_looking_to_get/) .

Hello. I think my situation is sort of unique. I interviewed with the CEO of the company who struck me as a nice guy. He immediately stated that the internship is unpaid, and that if I find a paid internship in the meanwhile he has no issues with me leaving. He doesn't expect me to work a million hours a week, he said that whatever works for you while balancing, school, family friends. He gave me a take home assignment - calendar in vanilla react. The product itself is interesting, they are using React and NodeJs, which I like. Any reason not to take this internship other than it's unpaid? Cause I would be doing projects in my free time anyway, I figured this would look more reputable working for an actual company."

However, I had an internship this last summer, and while the internship was objectively fine I really did not enjoy it. I don't like programming in a corporate environment at all. The idea of doing it forever makes me want to puke.

I have a 3.9 GPA. I wish I did a different major, or took an entirely different path. I'm talking really different, like the idea of being a park ranger, doctor, therapist, stock broker, etc all sound way more interesting to me.

qinong,1,2021-10-29,Just want to graduate,RawMint,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qinong/just_want_to_graduate/,"I need to get a project and paper done by february in order to graduate. STEM degree. Everything is remote. Professors are bad. I feel so demotivated because it will be judged by bad professors... I felt mostly useless throughout the degree, but now that I got this software development internship (loving it, btw) that is not a problem anymore. Dropping out is just the stupidest thing to do, I wouldn't ever do it. I feel it's too easy, I took an easy topic (need to get a project done and write a paper), but even so it is hard (I know it may sound weird) and as I am kind of perfectionist for these things, it gets even harder. I just don't want to not be involved in it like some guys that buy the final paper, but also just want to get done with it. There are so many details but the post is already huge, so I'd really appreciate some words of motivation from you guys."

For context, I'm a junior and I want to work full-time SWE and am wondering which internship would look better on my resume for full-time recruiting (I have 1 data analyst internship and 0 swe internships on my resume currently).

Capital One:

* Location: NYC (\~$10k/month + corporate housing, 10 weeks)
* Actual SWE position
* Heard WLB was really nice

Facebook:

* Location: NYC (\~$7.5k/month + corporate housing, 12 weeks)
* Data Engineering (not SWE, but if I get a return offer I can get auto final round for FB SWE)
* Bigger name than C1 (not sure how much that matters tho)

qipjoh,3,2021-10-29,Tax Associate at KPMG vs Enterprise Risk Staff I at EY vs Boeing Business Skills Rotational Program,xstanloona,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/qipjoh/tax_associate_at_kpmg_vs_enterprise_risk_staff_i/,"I was wondering if you all had some advice. I have a tax internship lined up with KPMG for Winter 2022, and assuming that goes well, I should be receiving a full-time offer in Fall 2023. Problem is, I am a little worried that I won't do a good job, since I have two night classes on two different days that **might** conflict with this internship (It is busy season). Now if the internship is virtual, I don't mind working and schooling at the same time, so nothing to worry there. I also recruited for an Enterprise Risk Staff for EY, and I am well aware that it is internal audit, SOX compliance, etc, but I was wondering - how bad are the hours? Is the job really that boring? Not too many exit opportunities? I haven't gotten much information on the hours, and I was planning for studying for the CPA when I start Fall 2022 but maybe it would be impossible if I worked 80 hours per week at EY. I also received a business rotational program from Boeing but, it is a 3 year program, and I'm hesitant to accept because it is not like I'll get a full-time role after this program ends. About this rotational program, I asked for a change in locations, since their placing me in another state. I'm not really comfortable for this option, since I have to take care of family back at home. I'll ask for a relocation closer to home, but assuming they put me in a closer location, its also a good option on the table.

The biggest problems are the timing/CPA/salary. KPMG told me that I would start at September 2023  (assuming I get a full-time role), which is great that, since I graduate in May 2022, which gives me plenty of time to study for my CPA exams, whereas EY wants me to start in Summer/Fall 2022. I don't think I want to start so soon, especially since I want to complete my CPA exams as quickly as possible. I'm really burned out from schooling and interning, so I want that break just centered for studying. I'm also concerned that this ""consulting"" route is not the best for my career, since consulting roles are expected to get laid off first during a recession (at least, that is my assumption). EY is offering me 80k, whereas KPMG is giving me 69k for the tax role. I'm a little torn on what I like to choose, as I am open to both tax/risk. I'm honestly really surprised about the high salary at EY - Are they expecting much more from me based off this consulting role? Just curious.

What do you guys think I should go for? Go for the winter internship and start Fall 2023? Or sign the contract letter and start at EY with an 80k salary off the bat immediately after graduating? Might as well sign for EY now if I do a horrible job at my KPMG internship. One gives me the option to study for my CPA, whereas the other one does not. Or should I drop professional services all together and go for a Fortune 500 program at 57k?"
qiq7dj,47,2021-10-29,Intern offer at AMD but not sure if I should accept,garrett77,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/qiq7dj/intern_offer_at_amd_but_not_sure_if_i_should/,I’m a CE 3rd year who got an offer at amd for a year long internship doing gpu validation (essentially running tests with proprietary tools to find issues which I don’t think I’d love). I want to get into computer architecture and design roles and have interviews for similar roles at AMD next week but my offer for the first job ends before the interviews next week and they won’t extend. Does it seem worth it to risk having no job there to get something that would be more in my area of interest or take the job I have to get my foot in the door at the company?
qiq8w4,6,2021-10-29,class pairings,coffeeinthedesert,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/qiq8w4/class_pairings/,"I've been lurking this page for a little while now and was just accepted to the program for Spring 2022. This page was a big reason I even decided to apply based on all the support and the fact that I have no experience with this subject. I've spent some time reviewing helpful resources about course descriptions/difficulty/hours required etc and this is what I've come up with for now. I'll be using primarily financial aid so I would rather not take less than 2 classes at a time (with the one exception being during summer 2023 assuming I can hopefully get an internship). I feel like summer 2022 will be difficult but I've tried moving things around and it gets tricky with all the pre-reqs / internship timelines etc.

Background: I have my bachelors in psychology so literally no experience coding and I'm a stay at home mom. By the time I start in the spring, my son will be 9 months old and I'll be hiring a babysitter so I can have a set schedule for studying as one would for a job. 

Feedback? Tips? Words of encouragement from other stay at home parents?

qir3oq,3,2021-10-29,I haven't been the same for 3 years...,boogieoogieballs,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qir3oq/i_havent_been_the_same_for_3_years/,"So much damage and bad events have gone on in my life since I moved out or the house. For  3 months it's actually wasn't that bad. Until the end of the semester in college. I found out my parents stole money from me, but where in denial about it. My family from my mom's side of the family tried to support me but them back stabbed me saying ""I am very passive aggressive and I should ever turn to them anymore"". Because of that moment I wasn't invited to my grandpa's (from my mom's side or the family's) funeral.

I expressed to my parents how much that as hurt me. My mom eventually snapped and said ""all od my siblings told me I was a no good daughter"". I assumed at that point my mom would have cut all ties with her family BUT she was eventually invited to my cousin's (from my mom's side or the family) wedding. A cousin I  thought I was close too until I really found out she was only pretending my be nice to me be cause of my autism (keep in mind my parents kid my autism diagnosis from me until I stumbled upon paper work hidden in the kitchen cabinets.) But I digress. I still don't understand why despite my mom's family telling her she's this awful person they invite her to my cousins wedding and decides to go like nothing happened. But I wasn't invited. I asked my. My mom said I was going to school. 1, this was in the summer. 2. I would have no trouble traveling up north for her wedding. 

Fast forward to September, one of my coworkers/friends committed suicide. I wasn't able to go to the funeral be use I had a meeting with my web design professor. I was waiting for my professor to pick up the call only to find out that he was with another students and ridiculed me for interrupting them. I sent an email right after to the pressfessor that he was being unprofessional. I took it to the head of the department but they didn't do anything. During this time (in the year 2020) I'm already struggling to work and handle new adjustments to covid. That was one or the moments I started losing motivation in school. 

Fast forward to early 2021. I'm still working as a server and I am being bullied at work by a 35 year old man. He treated no one else but me like this. He would yell and curse at me for no scraping every bit of food off the dish. He called me retarded and then to top it off threw a huge container of pancake batter at me. ( I worked at a diner if that gives better context). I eventually told my GM and he basically kicked that son or a bitch out of the restaurant. Not a month later a quit because as a server I was getting paid 2.13 and hour making 45 dollars a day, dealing with favoritism and rude customers that hated me because I wasn't the server they wanted. 

During the summer I moved to a new apartment, did two unpaid internships and did 15 credit classes. It went well but in July I just crashed. I stopped going to classes, I barley got out of bed, and the only out out of bed were to do projects for internships. 

A week before this fall semester starts I get a text from my dad saying my grandma (his mom) passed away. The sweet, strong woman that has helped pay for my college tution and genuinely loved me, is gone. I came up that weekend for her funeral. I unfortunately had to stay at my parenrs house that they forced me not to drive my own damn are up, so I took a shuttle. During my time up there my dad did nothing but poke fun of my weight. I did gain pounds from college, covid ane depression, but i didn't want him or anyone for rub it in. He basically said my depression would just disappear if I exercised. I told my dad there are legit days I cannot get out of bed in the morning, let along leave my house. He then proceeds to throw a fit and tell me that my mentaill illness is the reason why him and my mom don't talk to me anymore. 

So fall semester comes along. I decided to take two classes. But I eventually widrawl from both of them. If I were on track with classes and passing them I would be a senior this semester and graduate with a bachelors.  I don't know I'm going to college is worth it anymore, I literally don't know how my college is even getting paid for. Before my grandma died she said she wouldn't pay for my tution but my parents did. I have no idea where my parents are getting the money to pay for college. My mom is working 3 Jobs and my dad is retired. My cousin from my momside of thr family claim that that make six figures, but from the life style I have grown up in its hard to tell. Some cases they will surge on things, other times they are stingy with money. Any time I bring up my family's money situation my parents get hostile about it. With that being said this makes me nervous to even go to school not even knowing where the money from my parents is even coming from.

As of now I got a new job as a coll operator. It pays well and the job sits self isn't bad. The only down side is, is one the team coaches at work make me feel uncomfortable. I did talk to HR about it. Figures crossed that they will. Work is the only sane thing I am doing rn. I have no clue what I am even doing with my life. I feel like my only direction is to just work there forever until I become a manager. 

These past few weeks I have been nothing be angry. I can't seem to let anything go. My heart is just well heavy. I've been going to doctors and therapist but nothing so far has seem to help make anything better. I feel like a complete looser...."

qirzzi,15,2021-10-29,Finally got a job offer in my career field that doesn't pay peanuts for a fresh grad!,bl4ckCloudz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qirzzi/finally_got_a_job_offer_in_my_career_field_that/,"First, thank you to the folks at r/analytics for the great advice that helped me get to this point ([backstory](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/pxoen7/finally_got_a_data_analyst_offer_after_months_of/)).  

In a nutshell, the first offer I had after months of applying post-graduation lowballed me hard. Spent a month interviewing for a data analyst position, only to be offered $52k (10% below average and kinda bad in LA). I had a feeling they wanted to take advantage of a fresher and milk them dry while paying the bare minimum. I was about to take it out of desperation, but I was advised to stick with my data engineering internship. Of course, a full-time offer at the end isn't guaranteed, but at the very least I would gain more niche skills.  

Fast forward to today, my boss tells me she wants to bring me in full-time and to iron out details with a recruiter later today. Naturally, I'm pretty excited and I'm trying to prepare to negotiate salary. Once I talk with the recruiter, he casually says that the base salary will be $90k + benefits + stock. At this point, I was right about to fall outta my chair. I literally didn't even have to negotiate. This is nearly double the salary from the analyst job I declined.  

Honestly, this kinda feels like a dream. I can't believe there's still companies out there that still hire people based on **potential**. Just wanted to get this off my chest and take a sigh of relief. To everyone still on the job hunt, keep pushing. I believe in all of you. We'll all make it to the finish line eventually."
qit8qd,0,2021-10-29,Accept 55k offer out of college?,System-out-printlnyo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qit8qd/accept_55k_offer_out_of_college/,"It’s been about 2 months since I graduated with my cs degree and started applying and interviewing, and I finally got an offer. It seems like a good place to get some actual industry experience. I had an internship lined up before Covid but it fell through because of the pandemic. So all I have is a degree and a cool capstone. The offer I got was for a completely remote backend job with a pretty laid back company that hires mostly new grads for a few years (55k in Utah.) The problem is that my dad who has worked in software for 30 years thinks he could get me a job at an Air Force base where the pay would be closer to 70k. I received the offer on Friday and they need an answer by Monday so I don’t have too much time to decide. I wouldn’t mind making a bit less to be able to work remotely and not have to have the feeling of being locked in a top secret room with no windows with the job my dad says he could get me. I am mostly worried because he made it seem like taking 55k for a year or two then moving on with a bit of experience would set me back a few years compared to starting out at 70k. 

So I guess I need advice on two things.

1. Would taking a job that pays less now impact my future salaries?

2. Would accepting the job and then looking into this opportunity on the Air Force base be considered “slimy”?

I appreciate any input!"
qiuckq,0,2021-10-30,Job offer rescinded,thehanriver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qiuckq/job_offer_rescinded/,"Ive been working at a remote startup as a software engineering intern for six months. I got an offer earlier this week ,and was really good considering they were willing to work with me as I’m planning to go to grad school. 

I wanted to negotiate the initial salary which was well below the industry standard of a software engineer so 48k to 55k ,but I had a meeting where my offer was rescinded today. The reasons why were they wanted to hire more seniors and working until next year July was too short of a term which sucks because I was planning to start working as a junior starting November and wanted to work part time during school. However, they’re giving me two choices: continue internship until next year or wrap up internship this year.

Im pretty sad and angry about it because they were excited to keep working with me as I was excited to continue working with them and just feels like a stab in the back. I’m now a bit lost in plans as I was trying to move out of my parents house closer to the college I want to attend next year fall for masters. I haven’t been getting interviews even though I started applying to other places earlier this fall just in case.

Is is normal for offers to get taken because of negotiation? Was I being too greedy? Is it too late to apply to other places? Any advice? What would you do?"

My studies covered C/C++ intensively but it's been a long time (took some time to graduate and had to take a year off afterwards because of health issues), and it seems I've forgotten many things. I've done my internship at an application development department and used C#, including some GUI. During my studies I had different student jobs usually some small programming jobs in various languages, Matlab, Java, VB. 

I got a position for a PhD, which was basically computer vision, but got fired pretty quickly. 

Both my theses were very math heavy and focused on mathematical optimization, some AI, some ML. So I realized that the switch to data science would be easy for me, and started another masters program in DS, but had to drop out because of some private issues. I've done one semester, learned some basics and python.

Now I'm urgently looking for a job, absolute deadline March, but I don't know where to start. I know basics of a lot of languages but I'm not a master. I had an interview recently, a software engineer position, which turned out to be embedded SWE. I had a poor performance because I couldn't remember much of C and how memory management etc. works.

I'm eager to learn more or refresh my knowledge, but I'm not sure what I should concentrate on. Where would I be a good fit?

My contract there expired and I want to make a career switch in the field of marketing. I am currently studying for my master's degree in marketing but have zero hands on experience in the field. I am collecting unemployment benefits (3.4K per month) and applying to around 20 jobs per month with no success. I have been recently offered an internship in marketing with a pretty big company. Accepting this internship would mean that I will no longer receive unemployment benefits and I would be earning less (around 2K). It would also mean that if I apply again for unemployment after my internship I will be receiving less than 3.4K, the sum I am receiving now.

I am aware that this internship would help me develop my skills and gain experience within the field, however I cannot be sure that at the end of the 6 months I will be employed by them on a full time position. Part of the unemployment benefit is that I also receive free language courses (I live in a non english speaking country, and unfortunately I do not speak the language), which would normally be up to 3K. By accepting this internship, I would also give up the chance of learning the local language for free. I am just scared that I will never be able to get a job in marketing without some experience.

All the work I did there was genuine, and the people I worked with can vouch for that. What i'm worried about is that a third party verifier will tell Microsoft I worked at a non-existent company. Like would I have to convince them to file to be legally recognized as a company? Also another one of my experiences which I explicitly didn't list as a company was a high school club project. I left on the wrong foot with my advisors(TLDR: they overworked us and would gaslight us if we didn't do the projects they'd want) and I don't think they would 100% have nice things to say even though I did the work listed. Also i'm worried about the legal background check because I got a speeding ticket last Halloween which may sound stupid although it's resolved but i'm really worried that it might make me look irresponsible legally.

Well… Out of all the things that could have happened to me…. A fucking party i MY room is what im subjected too. The game you may ask? Something the humans call 2 truths 1 lie: From what i could tell its a game that tests your judgement of character and your memory of another person. I’m not particularly good at this game… 


“Alright Zel, it’s your turn. Remember; say two true things about yourself and one Lie.” Valerie says, trying to reassure me. I take a minute to ponder what to say and begin my turn in this battle of wits.


“Alright. I Have worked for 7 of my years being alive, I come from a small batch of 10, and I got awarded the most unlikely to lose a limb in a workplace accident.” I said that last one with pride bringing back some good memories.


“Hmmm I’m going to with award. Never heard of bosses awarding their workers.” Jakob said with his signature tone of confidence… or is it cockiness? You can never really tell with Jakob. “I’m with Jakob on that one. No way can you predict who can and cannot lose a limb in an accident.” Mike said though I guess you’d expect that from him.


“Well alright… 7 years, Pretty small for a race that are essentially socially groomed to be workaholics.” Valerie said with Davis nodding with her choice as well. One thing I learned quickly is that Davis and Valerie definitely did their research on my race before I came here.


“Well then, if you two think it’s work, and you chucklefucks think it's being safe. Me and Gary are gonna go Kids… No way 10 is just ‘A small batch.’ I’d go crazy if I had 10 brothers trying to pull my hair let alone 3.” Lizzie said while combing her wild hairdo, though I suppose that was more an instinctive thing after remembering something like that. 


“I don’t really know man… I guess continuing the theme of two, I'm gonna go with Lizzie.” Gary said sheepishly as always. 


Seeing as everyone had their answer in I revealed the lie. “Valerie is right, Delrixxus Start work at age 10 and don’t stop until 100 to live out our last 20 years in retirement. To us work is life and stagnation is decay.” To other races our strict code of work is a bit grim but to us it’s just the way of life. “Valerie’s turn I do believe.” 


“Alright, The first engine I worked on was my dad’s car engine, I got these burn scars on my hands because someone thought hitting an engine with a wrench would fix it, I come from a long line of engineers.”


This one was a tricky one. “Uh… Wrench one?” I say having no confidence in my answer


“Yeah I think it's the wrench one” as I look around everyone seems to nod at me, agreeing with my choice. 


“Wrong.” What?- “I actually come from a long line of pilots. Dad wanted me to be one too but I could never get used to those speeds. Engines just make more sense to me.” The room fell silent, to be honest I don't blame them. Not even I saw that one coming.


“Davis, I believe it’s your turn.” Valerie says, making Davis snap back at attention. “Yes uh... Right, First job was an internship at a morgue, I’ve never broken a bone, Jakob and Mike are my most common patients.” 


As we get our votes in, I look at a small shot glass of “Beer’. No I shouldn’t… Screw it. I take a sip from it. The last thing I hear is Davis saying “trick question, i’ve broken many bones, just not mine.” Before the night goes blanks.


I wake up again, head hurting but not as bad as last time, but still hurts; I even remember some of last night. Ugh my room is a mess, It’s gonna take me an hour to clean this. “... AH HELL TODAYS THE EXPLORATION MISSION!”


To Be Continued...

Sorry This ones a bit short, writers block be damned. But hey i'll sort through it all."
qj5lix,45,2021-10-30,I flunked an interview for a job I did not love... 5 months down the line I still don't have a job and would gladly take it. Should I re-apply?,glipglops4life,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/qj5lix/i_flunked_an_interview_for_a_job_i_did_not_love_5/,"Hi all, 

I graduated with a Bachelors in Geography and a certificate in GIS in May and have been searching for a job ever since. I will be the first to say I am definitely a noob and feel lost and confused most of the time. This sub has been a huge help in developing my resume and skills and realistic image of the industry. 

About 5 months ago I got an interview at a really cool local mapping company as a technician. Most of my experience in college was focused on remote sensing and analysis. So I was not as prepared as I should have been in cartography going into the interview and that was clear. I think I still made a good impression. However, I made really clear that I was interested in growth and finding a place where I could grow my skills and develop as a professional. The pay for the technician job is 15-19$ an hour. Which I was pretty displease with as I currently make 15.40 at my retail job. And 19$/hr is barley a living wage where I am.  I made these two points clear and I think that turned them off to me. For one I think they want someone in the technician position for a while and don't want to rehire and for two I'm sure they don't want to pay me 19/hr with my non-existent experience.  So i got turned down for the job.

Now, 5 months later, I've applied to over 50 jobs in the field throughout my state and the consensus is I need to develop my experience. (FYI there are very few internship opportunities here and I am an older college graduate so that makes getting an internship hard for me too). I've begun to apply for clerical/administration jobs just so I can make some sort of income as my student loans grow. I've been using ESRI's free tutorials to develop my skills and portfolio. And I've read a Python crash course book and Automating the Boring stuff, as well as a Practical SQL book. 

The technician job that I already applied for has now reposted. Although I still am not excited about the pay I would gladly take it as a foot in the door. My plan so far is to use my updated resume, re-apply, and email the hiring manager explaining the steps I have taken since my last interview to grow my skills as well as some portfolio items. I am not sure however, how to show that I am committed and willing to stay at the job and wont just leave immediately (even though I might do that if I get a better offer). Any advice for growing my skills, emailing the hiring manager, getting a job would be so appreciated!"

I know I may be a backup candidate and the probability to get it is very low at this point. However, I do believe in miracles as I have read some people's stories that they got an offer after 2 weeks. This makes me a bit relaxed when I read their stories. In the meantime, what should I do? 

\- Should I send a follow-up email to recruiters again on Monday? So far, I've sent them 1 follow-up email.

\- Should I ask 2 managers who interviewed me? One of them seemed to like me and replied back to my thank you email. They also got a referral email from someone who works there, basically saying that I'm a perfect candidate, my achievement, etc. I'm not sure if it helps.

\-Should I just move on and find any other opportunities?

\- Or any other advice?..

Is anyone in the same boat as me right now?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a junior F1-Visa (International) Computer Science major at UCLA and I'm looking for software engineering internships in the US for summer of 2022, and perhaps a full-time SWE position after graduating in spring 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I have had 1 summer SWE internship experience in my sophomore year summer (Note: not an internship in the US but in my home country), I have worked on almost no personal projects outside of school. I believe this reflects badly so I've decided to get more involved and start building stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read and heard a fair bit about how the job market (probably including SWE) is quite unfriendly to international students aside from the top 5-10 biggest companies. I remember one poster on Reddit estimated that it takes on average 200 applications to get a good job offer for international students. Whether or not this is true, I'm not going to let that discourage me.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I have is about how much I have to worry about GPA. From reddit and elsewhere, I've gathered that 90% of companies do not even look at/ask for your GPA for SWE internships/jobs. But I don't know how much this applies to international students. My GPA is currently more than 3.7. I would like to start doing worse in school and use that extra time to work on projects and do more job searching.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that I'm international and need to start pivoting my time to projects, what GPA (out of 4.0) do you recommend I drop to? 3.5? 3.0? I'm willing to go as low as 2.0 lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you briefly explain the reason for your recommendation?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,"

I interned at a recently IPOd unicorn, and my response rate this year for ~75 new grad apps was ~60% (for OAs or interviews), which was a 2x improvement over last year.

I think for the recent problems I faced in coding assessment I would have solved them if given enough time.

I’m just tired of it all and I don’t see a point in continuing to fight it. 

I’m about to graduate with like 140k debt because my stupid ass wanted to go away from home to a prestigious school. Kicker is I don’t even like engineering very much or at the least as much as I thought when I decided to take this path. I did internships that were great but I don’t know if I want to do that for 30+ years. 

I looked into it and it wouldn’t fuck my parents financially if I were to die the loans get forgiven. I don’t want to hurt them so I should make it look like an accident to somewhat soften the blow. They’re good people and were good parents to me very loving and supportive so I don’t want them spending what time they have left thinking they did something wrong or what they did wasn’t enough. This isn’t their fault. 

I hate school I’m stressed 24/7, the place I live is always gross because the people I live with are gross and don’t clean until it gets atrocious. 

I’ve never had a serious relationship doubt it will happen at this point. Been actively trying with dating apps and blind dates for the last couple years. 

I’ve tried talking to a therapist, getting out there, hell I started a chapter of a fraternity, I’ve tried going to the gym and eating better. It’s all just work on top of my already disgusting workload from classes. 

I’m just wondering why do I continue to put up with it all. 

I’ll graduate get an engineering job and work for 30 years then what retire? Will the planet even be livable then? Will anyone even be able to retire? The world is fucked and no one with any say cares. 

All I’ve got to look forward to is watching the planet and my parents die as I try to pay off the mountain of debt that I got to get a job that I don’t even really want or find fulfilling. 

I don’t think the world will be better without me or that no one will care or miss me there are a handful of people that will be sad when I die. I want to minimize their pain as much as I can, I figure if they think it was an accident they’ll get over it eventually and move on. 

TLDR: My life seems to be headed towards an unfulfilling work to keep existing path but I can’t afford to change course so what’s the point in continuing? How can I stop and minimize hurting the people I care about?"

I am a new grad based in Toronto and I am in the fortunate position to have two competing new grad job offers. One is for SDE at Amazon while the other is as a consultant with Deloitte Omnia AI. The comp is relatively comparable thought Amazon is a bit higher all incentives considered. I have only had one internship prior doing backend development + some data pipelining and management (sql, mongo). As cliche and overdone as this might be, I do want to angle towards a more ml/data focused development role in the future. 

However, I am leaning towards Amazon for a couple reasons. Firstly, I have heard that having a solid sde background gives you the freedom to go into data engineering and exit from de if its not what I imagined in the future much more easily than the scenario vice versa. Secondly, I think amazon is more useful on my resume if I want to aim for more techy-style companies moving forward. Finally, while Deloitte assured me of the technical nature of the role, I am afraid that de consulting wont offer me the level of technical development I would want in a new grad job. 

I just wanted to seek some additional opinions and see if anyone had been in a similar situation before! Thank you all in advance."
qjgids,35,2021-10-30,Cannot tell if my startup internship is a scam or if I'm just incompetent,ImStressedAHH,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qjgids/cannot_tell_if_my_startup_internship_is_a_scam_or/,"Howdy, rant incoming...

So I am just over a month in as a Systems Engineer intern at a startup. Problem is, this is some wild stuff and I need to know if I am bad or if it's just the company. For a quick bullet list:

* First 2 weeks, I am in charge of redoing modules that are based on X11. This would be a breeze if in QT, but unfortunately the entire codebase is in C, for ""some bizarre reason"" (said by the tech lead), so I am forced to learn X11.
* Me, not being aware of the evil of X11 and Xfixes, takes me a while. In addition, there is no mentorship of any regard (the company is half interns), so (per my tech lead) I'm ""on my own"". So, this all takes a while (I'll admit I just suck at this stuff, so it's taking me a minimum of a week to do anything with Systems for the reaserch), and I have the owner of the company on my neck saying to hurry up. This was in the first 3 weeks, where in past internships I'd be writing a design doc instead of being rushed to merge a 3rd PR.
* The above happens again with other obscure bare-metal Linux C libraries where the only documentation online is GNOME mailing lists (kill me). Typically, in past companies, I'd message the mentor ""wtf is this abomination"" (not exactly, but you get the point), but again with this stuff, I am on my own. I was recommended to email the creators of those libraries for help, which I have done (they don't respond), but I am just bewildered that the codebase is designed in such a manner that it forces itself to do that instead of making it compatible with libraries that have actual documentation (the C++ equivalent libraries are infinitely easier to do, would be as fast, have documentation. However, the codebase is in raw C, so it wouldn't work out as far as I'm concerned, I may be wrong here. On the assumption this is true, or else I have no idea why the codebase is in C, as I imagine the speed is the same).

I am at odds, as I am feeling generally incompetent. I did well at my prior FAANG internship (got return offer and boss there said I was ""an obvious hire""). However, I am getting some weird neuroticism that I gotta stay here to prove some vein of competence.

I just feel like everything is against me. There are easier ways to do everything this low level, but I feel the codebase being written as it is prevents us from using well-documented APIs like QT for all of this and now I am forced to learn obscure libraries with no documentation and without any mentorship. This is usually fine with me, but I am putting in 10-12 hour days having barely anything to show for it and the owner is on my behind about going faster. This is overall just getting me so stressed out I cannot even stop thinking about this crap on the weekends.

I've transitioned to doing some backend projects and those go very well and I finish those in like 2 days. I actually think this saved me from getting fired, as the boss was saying how I finally picked up pace. I am still trying to do Systems work however, as my position is a Systems Engineer intern.

Furthermore, I am on the edge of quitting, as I cannot justify the stress while I have accepted the FAANG offer. But again, being a bit neurotic, I am getting some weird anxiety that I gotta prove I can do it. FFS, I am even paranoid of them recognizing this post is from me, which is why this is also a throwaway account.

This probably happened with the other intern, who (according to his prior employment history, was a stud) just quit without notice recently.

I am just unsure if this is just a crap startup trying to use interns as cheap full-timers or if I just seriously need to work on getting better (or some combo of the two).  


EDIT: I'm still in school, I already accepted the FAANG offer. It starts in July when I graduate. Just clarifying that I didn't choose this job over FAANG. "

I am a medical doctor from a small country and am applying to Ph.D. programs this Fall, so I was hoping to get some opinion on whether I'd be competitive enough for many programs out there. I majored in medicine with an overall GPA of 3.58. My GRE was 326, TOEFL 104. I don’t have any fellowship or scholarships yet. 

Much appreciate for any suggestion and opinion, thank you very much.

**Past experience:**   
I have approximately 1.5-year full-time research experience. About half a year of it was spent in a neurodevelopment lab as an undergraduate research assistant, where I mainly performed genotyping and profiling mutant mice's genotype and abnormal neural development. I then underwent a medical internship and residency for 2 years. After residency, I joined a bioinformatics lab as a full-time research assistant since the beginning of 2021. I  helped perform cleansing of sequencing data and build hearing disease prognosis models with R, Linux, and REDcap. I also designed a research project for novel mutations discovery, and I am about to publish my paper in November as the first author. 

Research interest:
I am interested in adopting single-cell sequencing data to investigate the genomic and epigenomic regulation for cell development and differentiation because it relates to what I am doing right now. In my country, single-cell sequencing is not as commonly used as in the U.S., so that's the main reason why I want to do such research in the U.S. Secondly, because of my medical background, I am interested in this kind of research, which may have implications on identifying precise diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.

**Skepticism:**  
Much of the skepticism of my competitiveness stems from having a weak(?) research, quantitative background, and GPA and test scores. I completed calculus, biomedical informatics, and genomic medicine courses in college for one year. Although I did not take any CS courses in college, I am now enrolled in HarvardX CS50x, and I have finished HarvardX's ""Statistics and R"" and ""Introduction to Bioconductor"", both of them were granted certification. 

**Intended program:**  
Posted below are the programs I'm interested in.  I am also considering applying to some master's degree programs of the top schools and then apply a Ph.D. again next year (If I fail to get accepted to any of these Ph.D. programs). 

If you have any advice on how I can improve or have an insight on how admissions will look at me as an applicant, I'd really appreciate it. I'm not sure how to view myself as an applicant, but I'm hoping I'm currently in a good position to get in a few places. 

Really appreciate your help!

I just don’t know how to act around new people and I don’t know how to reach out. I’m afraid of being a creep and being rejected.


I made some friends in high school, and some in college. I even had a long term girlfriend - but all of that was just luck tbh. Every time I go to some place new it feels like a coin flip. Either I get adopted by a friend group and things are fine or I don’t and I become isolated.


Focused on school and career a lot - spent a lot of time doing homework and not going to parties (not that I was invited). Did internships, which often meant just working and being lonely in a new city for 3 months at a time. Lots of painful memories there.


Now I have a “great job” in a city across the country and I’ve been miserable here for the past 3 years. Meeting people is so difficult for me, and 3 years later I have almost no friends.


To make it worse my girlfriend, the one from college who I was with for 7 years, and I just broke up. She was basically my social life here and now she’s gone. I work from home too, so I’m basically by myself almost all of the time now.


It’s Halloween and I live in the city, so I decided to try and go out to a bar or something even though I was by myself. I thought maybe I could meet some people and have some fun or something.


It was okay at first, but I just started feeling lonely in all of the crowds of people and I started feeling incredibly self conscious. I didn’t know how to approach anyone and no one was approaching me, so I just….went home early. 


As I headed home, I wanted to clench into a little ball on the side of the street and just cry my heart out. I walked past the bars and peered through the windows, seeing 100s of people being merry and having a good time - even people who were only in pairs. But I don’t have a pair. I’m just me. And I hate being me. I hate being like this so much.


I’d trade the job and the grades and the money any day to not have this and be able to develop social skills. It all just feels so complicated and demoralizing. I don’t know what to do and I think this loneliness is just what the rest of my life is going to be like. And that scares me so much."

Just my luck that all 3 offers were for embedded type work. Initially I did not apply for embedded but got desperate and started applying everywhere.

I work only with C and python and nothing else. I want to do application work in another language like java, python, js. I actually had done internships with that kind of work and enjoyed it.

I've applied to some junior roles but no luck. I tried to highlight transferable skills but really there is not much I can say about C its not even object oriented. I put my internships in java and js as well on my resume but I doubt anyone counts it. 1 yr of experience in C is not helpful...

Looking for advice? I don't feel like I have a future in embedded as I know nothing about HW (and I refuse to learn about HW as that topic bores me to death). Thanks


Edit: Thanks for the responses. Additionally would like to hear more about the pros of embedded work?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my second year of computer science honours degree in TUD, I'm doing this course because I had taught myself web development and actually worked as web developer for a small company for a few years so I do have some experience, but not on the level of implementing proper algorithms or being part of a real dev team. I'd say I would be in the top 30% of the class, I did quite well in my exams last year and I'm interested in doing an internship over the summer, what would be the best way to go about this? 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've applied to a few internships posted on linkedin and indeed, so far have got 1 codility test which I only managed to get 3/5 questions right and was instantly dropped.

On my sophomore to junior summer I was originally going to do a research project in my college but covid happened and I ended up going back to my home country for that summer, I was able to get to do some part time coding work doing some web development in an early stage start up due to connections that I had in my home country. So I logically put that in my resume / linked in. 

Anyway, the year after I was able to get an internship in the usa for a well known company, I did an ok job and got an amazing return offer for a full time position (which I'll start after I graduate next may).

The problem is that the start up didn't really work and the project sort of stalled (they are probably going to continue with it but it's stalled for the moment). So if you do a google search of the company I mention in my resume / linked in it won't show up or anything. 

I am afraid that this situation will give the impression that I lied and that they will take away my job offer if they look into it. I would just take this away from my linked in since I have lots of other things to show up anyway, but then my work experience on linked in would be inconsistent with the resume the company I'll work for already has in their records (because I used it to apply for my internship).

I'm about 5ish months deep into my job search with around 400+ applications submitted and still no offers. I typically wake up to a slew of emails saying ""Unfortunately, we've decided to go with another candidate."". I rarely get interviews with any company, big or small. I apply to all walks of life in terms of companies. I'm lacking in internship experience because I went through a program called Dual Degree where I would finish an engineering/comp sci degree at another university within 2 years. My only summer for internships was when quarantine hit and my internship offer got rescinded.

At this point, I'm not sure what I can do. I don't want to join a BootCamp since I feel like it would be just going through a ton of material I know and I would have to move at a set pace. I'm worried to join a WITCH company because of their contractual obligations to them. I recently applied to Accenture which is supposed to be slightly better and I'm still in review as of this moment. Should I just talk to a recruiter at a WITCH company?

Here is an [anonymized resume](https://imgur.com/a/nQFlAOy).

qjxjea,4,2021-10-31,Parents using my money. Should I move out just for the sake of mental health?,concernedKoala423,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/qjxjea/parents_using_my_money_should_i_move_out_just_for/,"I'm in my last year of university still living at home with a job lined up after graduation paying $75k. Not to flex or anything, but I received a full scholarship to attend university and have also just come off an internship making $30/hr where total net take home amount should've been ideally \~60k. I only see 15k in my account now despite living at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Based off those numbers, I know I'm fortunate to be where I am especially considering the pandemic. However, some issues with my financial situation make me uneasy:

* Still took out student loans to help with ""family expenses"" despite full ride scholarship
* I don't know where my scholarship money or student loan money went that wasn't paying for school since my parents managed it (""family expenses"" is an obviously broad assumption since my parents managed it and I'm scared to ask out of fear of them thinking I'm ungrateful for what they've done for me so far and that all I care about is money). This fear is compounded by the fact that they often fight (full blown yelling and smashing shit) about money and lots of other stuff and I don't want to be caught in the crossfire if I can help it.
* As far as I can tell, I've been practically paying to live at home since I don't know where roughly 20k of my internship income went (keep in mind this is without knowing where any of my student loans or scholarship money went either)
* Parents are low income due to health problems. Dad does home repairs with most of his days but based on helping him out a few times, doesn't look like it makes much at all. Mom is stay-at-home parent.

&amp;#x200B;

Some emotional problems added to the mix:

* Parents frequently fight (many times about money, but also lots about other stuff like respecting COVID restrictions, and their own emotional problems)
* Every time they fight it's loud as fuck and the aftermath (silent treatment) lasts for weeks so I get anxiety and can't focus on my schoolwork
   *  I remember one final exam break they were at each others throats practically everyday while I was sitting in the living room trying to study for finals. Thankfully did decent on a few of them but holy shit was that stressful... Right before christmas too... :(
* Recently I had enough with their yelling and even blew up at them telling them to shut the fuck up with their stupid ass arguments which created a rift in the family for about a month, during which I couldn't focus on studying for the life of me (out of fear of a divorce happening, contemplating the possibility of moving out to get away from this situation which is actually when I found this subreddit) so now I'm behind on school pretty bad too

&amp;#x200B;

So I have 2 questions:

* What should I do about the money my parents theoretically ""owe me""? Am I ungrateful for being able to live at home during school and should be glad to be able to contribute to our family's living expenses now that I am able to earn money?
* Should I move out for my mental health? How much is my mental health worth? I'd like to keep my TFSA maxed out and RRSP contributions maxed out once I start working after graduation while time is on my side (compound interest or whatever) - but perhaps that is unrealistic if I move out this soon after graduation.

Thank you everyone for your time and insight.

TL;DR: Parents managed my student loan, full ride scholarship and internship income. I don't know where it is or where it went and scared to ask them about it since they fight about money often. Also, parents fighting took a toll on my mental health and I have been considering moving out soon after graduation, but scared of bearing all the expenses on my own, especially given the fact that I don't have as much savings set aside that I feel like I should have from scholarship and internship (plus paying back student loans that I didn't even use anyway)."

Twitter’s problems were so hard to understand and each prompt was so long. I spent like 10 minutes total just reading the problems, which is a lot of time when you have 60 minutes for 4 coding questions.

A warning for young job seekers.,MangoDaisies,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qk1w90/what_professions_should_be_avoided_at_all_costs_a/,"I would like if we could share with young job seekers the professions that are an utter waste of time and money.

For me, I work as a news producer in a top 20 market. For reference, I am a 30 year old woman with 8 years of experience. 

It sounds exciting, but unless your goal is to be a manager, anchor, be in a top 5 market or work for a network directly… just stay away altogether.

It’s an easy as hell job to get in the door. College internships shift to production assistant and then producer, photographer or reporter very easily. 

But the pay is not worth the pressure, the crazy schedule and not being able to take a break.

Especially as a producer or a reporter. Photographers are union in my market, so their breaks are mandated. 

But as a producer, I get paid $55K a year in a major city of California. I rarely take a full break yet I’m always marking I take a break. The reason behind that is the constant new developments, getting the show done on time with all of the limited resources I have to get that done, and have a product that my managers will approve of. If I don’t I will fall behind without a doubt. Get sh*t on by an anchor or manager or production crew member for missing something, anything. You may give me flack for it, but you would not understand unless you were in my shoes.

Meanwhile, I’m working with dinosaurs that have been here for decades and think it doesn’t matter when they’re rude, mean or yell at me. Most of them have bad attitudes. Everyone is bitter about pay, lack of resources, long hours, inconsistent schedules. While managers make bank. 

If I could do it all over again I would take the initial experience and work to move on to another field. No one I know is happy with this job."
