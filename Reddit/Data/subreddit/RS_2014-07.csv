Will moving make a difference in that case?",proginprocess,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29j09m/my_area_flint_mi_is_bad_for_programming_work_but/,"I've gone through my story here a couple times. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems close to 3 years ago. Unfortunately, I did no internships or networking while in college. I had a junior programmer job at a printing company 7 months out of college, but got laid off 10 months ago. Since then, I've been looking for work and learning languages. I have only 2 projects on Github, but I'm looking to put more up later. I've had a few interviews, but nothing panned out. 

My main issue is that I don't have enough experience. Though I'm aiming for programming positions, I only got in a year and a half at my previous job. That was in an obscure language called FoxPro. Also, my degree was CIS. I didn't appreciate the difference between CS/CIS in college. I knew fairly early I wanted to program, but after transferring from Community College, a CS degree would have taken way longer and cost way more at that point. Now that I'm trying to learn all this extra stuff on my own, I feel I should have taken that hit and switched majors. Looking at the FAQ here for how to bridge the gap is daunting, and I don't have the money to go back to college. So, yeah, that's the big thing. I'm trying to bridge the gap, but it's hard.*

The second issue is that I live in Flint, Michigan. Aside from topping ""worst crime in Michigan"" lists every year, there's not a lot here in terms of programming work that I haven't already applied to. Heck, I've been applying to places 3-10 cities over since the start of my hunt, and not getting many bites. Due to meager savings post-layoff and my closeness to my relatives, I didn't want to move at first. Now I recognize I have to at some point. I was thinking of Lansing, because I see plenty of job postings coming from there and I've had relatives who lived there before and say it's nice. Any spot in MI where entry-level programmers are in demand will do though. I'll probably find some temp jobs to save up the money.

However, there's still the main issue. I don't have much work experience in programming. I also have a 10+ month gap on my resume. These things will still be true, even if I was able to move tomorrow. So, does it matter if I move? I think I can get temp work and save money, but the cost of moving will still be huge, and I don't want to take the gamble of moving if the move is ineffective.

*Please note I don't mean to start any war between CIS and CS majors here. I just feel I should have taken the CS degree."

29jwa6,12,2014-07-01,Full-time workloads,pandable,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29jwa6/fulltime_workloads/,"Last year, I interned for a Fortune 500 company. I created a plugin for one of their products. But I was actually spending very little time working.

My day usually began with a 2-3 hour nap. I got to my cube, checked/answered my email, and promptly went to sleep (I'm not a morning person).
Follow with an hour or so of coding--probably the most work-concentrated and the most productive part of my day.
Lunch for an hour.
Another 1-2 hours of coding scattered among regular internet breaks.

At the end of the summer, I presented the plugin, and they were pleased to the point that they decided to ship it with the next version of their product. They were shocked I could make a plugin like that in a summer, saying that it was something a full-timer might accomplish.

I'd been under the impression that I was only having such a relaxed work life because I was an intern. This summer, I have a similarly light workload (at another company). Is working full-time actually like this? Is it any different at companies like Google/Amazon that give the impression that their employees are always being productive?


EDIT: When I say I have a similarly light workload this summer, it's a little different--I don't sleep at work and I'm coding more (40% of the time most days)--but it's awfully light compared to my perception of a ""full-time"" workload. I expected to be coding at least 6 out of 8 hours, but I only hit 4 even on my most productive days (usually right after something is assigned or after I have an epiphany about how to do something)."

I am a recovering systems engineering manager, back on the architecture side of the house after that stint.  I have inherited a summer intern who is very young (18) and doesnt know much about IT in general.  I showed him how to install VirtualBox, and walked him through some CentOS builds manually.  He doesnt really know linux at all.  My question is, now that he has a couple systems to play around on, can anyone recommend a good tutorial site or book?  I take so many things for granted (stupid things like subshells, and command redirection), so I think I may not be the best day to day guide.  I have him compiling apache and openssl this week, but I want to have him do some messing around on his own.

My plan is to get him up on Linux better in the next few weeks, then we are going to cover SAN/storage type stuff.  Vsphere after that.

Thanks for any sites (preferred) or books for learning Linux!

*Edit* When I was learning linux 10 or so years ago I read the books by Nemeth and company, not sure if  they are still considered the goto books or not.  Thanks!"

I go to college and in my area there is an Apple Store in a mall and I would love to be able to work there as a retailer. I checked their website a couple of times and it seems like there are positions but I don't know if they'll take me since they don't mention anything about the kind of qualification they are looking for. Here is why I'm questioning whether they'll take me or not, as far as qualifications on paper, I don't have that many. Never worked before, a rising sophomore in college with a computer major which arguably may or may not contribute to my job as a retailer and I'm not 18 yet but turning 18 very soon.

I would love to work in the Apple Store. It would be almost like a dream coming true. But not only is it gonna be a job that I would enjoy but also it would help me have the ""past experience"" and plus, I think it would qualify as a reason for me to move to the better summer dorm (for interns) as opposed to the summer students dorm which sucks.

I'm most likely gonna want to work on the summer, so nothing after the beginning of the Fall semester since I don't plan on working during the school year, only in summers.I would still work though if I had the opportunity and its not a loaded schedule. 

So my question is, for those of you who applied to work at Apple as a retailer (nothing higher), what was it like exactly? what are the qualifications they were seeking out for? I mean I don't see why I would really need a degree to work as a retailer there and most of the employees there don't seem to be college students just like me. 

And also, if you guys don't think this is a great idea, what would suggest to do to have some work experience and also get the benefit to moving to the intern dorms.

Thanks in advance"

It seems to be very difficult compared to something like web development which has more positions available than mobile. I have no software development internships/work experience. The state I live in is TN and I have been applying to non-local positions because there are no open Android positions where I live. I have gotten non-local interviews but never get past the engineer stage, even when there are no coding challenges. I also have my fair share of resume rejections. It seems that MOST of the job listings require 2+ years of experience, which I have, just none working for others. As a result, I've tried to look at internships even though I already graduated. I've only come across an unpaid internship where he wants me to sign a NDA with 6-month non-compete after the internship and he wants to develop an app in ""stages."" I've also tried Elance thinking it might help me get a full-time job as I can put the contract positions on my resume but that website is ridiculous for software engineers and it is very difficult for a person from USA to get a job on there. I have 4 Android applications I have done as side-projects on my resume already, 3 of which are on Google Play. They are mostly apps that I solely developed, but I have been told that companies only care if you worked for someone else (not about projects that you solely developed). As a result, I am considering on doing the unpaid one. Is this a bad decision? I wish I could get something paid on elance but it seems that most of the jobs there want iPhone as well which I don't know. I wonder if learning iOS is a necessity these days for so-called ""Android Engineer"" positions. I believe I am pretty good at what I do as I understand how Google stock applications work (ex. contacts, calendar) from reading the source code and have coded multiple applications, but no one will give me a chance. Would taking a regular back-end software engineering position help me get a job in Android development even if it is not a responsibility? What should I do?"

I recently just graduated with a bachelors of electrical engineering in Massachusetts. I got hired as an intern mid way through my final semester and got hired full time. I currently work in the power field as a distribution engineer. I can already tell that this is not the field for me, but I plan on staying for a while to gain some experience in the real world.

I was considering r and d or maybe systems engineering, but I'm not sure which one would suit me best. I love designing circuits and designs, designing anything at all, coming up with different solutions for problems, trial and error, making things from scratch etc.

On the flip side, I'm kind of like a hybrid computer/electrical engineer. I like to program as well, am very interested in cyber security, cryptography, penetration testing and that field as well. Programming can be a lot of fun. 

I don't want to be limited to only programming like a software developer, maybe a penetration tester or something along those lines would be very interesting to me though, even though those jobs are far and few to come by.

Anyone have any ideas? Maybe some alternatives other than something I listed that might work well for me? Open to all options!

[Clicky](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/29m7ve/magic_order_machine_is_apparently_running_low_on/cimgq9f) for LtM's story.

This was back in the Small Business Server 2003 days.  It was a terrible time, I assure you.  For those that have no experience (count your blessings), SBS is a horrifying all-in-one server that attempts to encompass Exchange, AD file &amp; print, SQL, and SharePoint on one box.  It worked as not-well as you would expect.

Anyways, law firm client (LFC) uses this for their everything.  They also have a firewall handling their spam filtering, etc, all on site.  Was not uncommon for us to get the ""hey we're not getting mail from ____@thisothercompany.com"" and a quick whitelist add would get them on their way.  The firewall would show the bounces and usually a few retries, no big deal, so I'd at least be able to see that they were in fact getting bounced by the spam filter.  Usually the other company was on some crappy server that was listed at least once on spamhaus, but their wish was our command.  So be it.

So we got a message from LFC that appeared just that simple.

&gt;LFC: We are not receiving mail from ____@crappyserver.com.  Please correct.

I kick it over to our intern as a good lesson in spam filter log checking, with instructions to check for bounced messages first, and then add the domain to the whitelist and notify the client.  About half an hour goes by, and I'm curious what's taking so long.

&gt;makenosense: Hey [intern], you having any luck with that firewall?

&gt;intern: I don't think I'm looking in the right spot, I don't see any bounces.

I look over intern's shoulder and see the all-too-familiar firewall screen.  Actually, he's in exactly the correct spot.  We spend a few minutes searching together, unable to find any bounces from crappyserver.com.  I get a third pair of eyes on it and we're all in agreement.  Time to call the client and let them know they're actually not broken!

&gt;makenosense: Good afternoon LFC.  We've been checking out this request for the difficulty you've been having with crappyserver.com email.

&gt;LFC: Thank goodness!  I hate when we have email problems.

&gt;makenosense: Well, actually, the problem is not on your end.  We've been going through all the mail and firewall logs and it seems that their mail is never even getting to any of your equipment, so it's very likely the problem is on their end.  If you'd like, you may provide my contact information to your contact at crappyserver.com and as a courtesy I don't mind helping them troubleshoot.

&gt;LFC: NO.  We can't involve them in our email problems.  Just fix it.

&gt;makenosense:........

In the end, our owner had to contact the managing partner and explain, over about a fifteen minute call, how we were literally unable to fix someone else's equipment, and the original caller was told to follow my directions to help troubleshoot.

My counterpart at crappyserver.com (another contractor, and crappyserver was another law firm) didn't need our help.  They'd had some Exchange issue on their end but apparently the attorney at crappyserver attempting to send mail to LFC didn't understand that even though it was in his Outlook Sent box, it still hadn't left the mail server queue.  Fair enough.

Furthermore, I hate Exchange.  That is all.  :)

EDIT - I should be fair.  Exchange isn't really the issue.  I just dislike the model in general of businesses attempting to host their own complex applications on their own equipment and getting upset that they require maintenance and repair that cost money, but expect 100% uptime and 0 issues.

A properly configure mail server that is being maintained and monitored regularly, and is life-cycled correctly, and isn't hosting a bunch of other applications on it, is fine with me.  Sadly, my exposure to Exchange has almost entirely been: 1.  It's been installed by somebody other than me, as cheaply as possible, which means it's also not configured properly.  2.  It's running on a 7 year old server, but ""why is it so expensive to replace?""  3.  It's running a whole bunch of other applications on it too.  And on 2Gb of RAM."

I am in no way an expert in Excel, and I have a project to do for my internship. In this project, I need to find an easy way to keep track of weekly inspections of equipment in a manufacturing plant, mostly inspections of fire extinguishers. I've come to the conclusion that using barcodes would be the simplest way to do this. We would print out a 1D barcode for each fire extinguisher and apply them, then use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of what condition they are in and when they were last inspected. I will also print out three barcodes that have a value corresponding to the condition of the fire extinguisher: good, needs repair, and needs replacement.

Now what I need help with is how can you make it to where once a barcode for each fire extinguisher is scanned, the cursor will automatically move to the next cell to be filled. For example, I want the serial number of each scanned fire extinguisher to be in column A, the condition it is in to be in column B, and the time and date it was scanned in column C. I already know how to create a time stamp for when a certain cell is changed, so I'm good on that. What I need it to do is start in A3, and automatically move to B3 for me to scan the barcode signaling its state, and then move down to A4 for the next extinguisher. 

Is there a function I can type to make this happen, or will the inspector need to press enter/tab to get to the next cell like normal?

For reference, the inspector will be driving an electrical cart with a laptop with the spreadsheet open and a USB barcode scanner."

I need some advice on moving out of my parents' house. I've been on my own before at college and I know I'm capable of taking care of myself. I need to get out because it's getting to a point where I can't stand living with them anymore. I'm 24 years old and I think I'm about ready to be independent. I also kind of have to be, because I have to be out by September 1st.

The two biggest issues keeping me from moving out are transportation and my job situation. I am currently participating in an unpaid web development internship for the summer. It's been a good experience, but I wasn't told I'd be hired on after the internship. I know I can't hope for a job, so I am starting to look for work. It could happen, but I can't count on it. I also talked to Red Hat about an enterprise support position and I'll hopefully be getting some face to face time with them soon. I haven't really started my career yet. I've only had jobs in retail and a couple months assisting with a WordPress site, so I don't have as much professional experience in my field as I would like.

I can drive, but the car I use isn't mine. If I can find a decent job, then maybe I could afford to make payments on my own vehicle, but then I would still need insurance. I haven't dealt much with insurance, since I have been covered on my parents' insurance. I don't think auto insurance is typically a benefit when you're working for a company, if you get benefits at all. I might be able to get away with not having a car depending on where I have to work, but I need to have a job before I can really determine if I can go without a car.

I'm not as worried about finding a new place to live or some roommates in a new place. I know I'm capable of that and moving, I'm worried about the other requirements that come with living on your own. I haven't moved out already because I feel like I'm stuck because I don't have the resources to live on my own. I know I'm not actually stuck, but I am unsure of how to proceed in this situation aside from looking for a job, roommates/a place to live and hoping to get lucky.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."

So, I'm at my last year on my Bc. in Information Systems and Computer Engineering (that's the official translation to english, it's pretty much Software Engineering). 

I got myself a summer intership at a large bank and finantial services company. This is their first year doing summer internships, if that's relevant.
So, I thought I would get an internship with the IT staff, but I didn't. They put me together with a team of people whose IT knowledge consists of Microsoft Office and asked me to create ""something"" that solves their problems - I'll list said problems below. 

Now, I know that people with consulting jobs to this for a living, but I have zero work experience and absolutely no clue how to handle this situation. I'm at the firm's headquarters, across town from the IT team! I have no one there to give me the support I need, tell me which technologies the company usually works with, how I should start to look at this list of requirements... So, I need to come up with the right questions to ask these people who, though lovely enough, have no idea how to explain their problems in the best way for me to deal with them. After that, I need to come up with a solution for said problem that's easy to use. I was hoping you could help me out, give me some hints.

First, let me give you the same checkpoint they gave me. These are the things I am expected to do in the next two months:

1. Processes visual mapping - create a visual process mapping by feeding an Excel file.
2. Data model for processes cartography - Create a processes catalog.
3. Create and facilitate the reporting - Create a data model to feed automatically a powerpoint document.
4. Indicators for data analysis - Create a model to analyse a set of data according to criteria.
5. Data model for delayering - Create a quarterly report for central PMO (from Directory extraction) with automatic indicators.
6. Data model for contracts maintenance - Create a database to issue contracts for the locations and other entities.
7. Data model for invoicing - Create a database to calculate the cost and detailed description of the cost according to to the operating model.

I would subdivide this into four ""categories"": 1+2, 3+4+5, 6 and 7, based on their rough explanation on the first day (tomorrow will be the second). Now I need to figure out exactly what do they want, and for that I need to ask questions, so... what questions should I ask in order for a ""client"" with no IT knowledge to give me the information I need, regarding those points?

From what they said, they work mainly with MS Excel. Their processes list is exactly that: An Excel spreadsheet with two columns, one for the process name/ID and other with its description. They also have some calculations that they need to do, with Excel formulas, and they want to me to automate that (via macro, I guess). So, this will be mostly extracting data from Excel files and treating that data. Also adding, modifying and removing stuff from those files. 

Those points are so abstract that I don't even know if doing this will require programming at all. I don't know if I should get rid of their Excel files and just build a program that interacts with some SQL databases, or if there's a way to do this using only Microsoft Office tools, such as Access or something like that - they kept mentioning Access.

So, mainly, I'm asking for guidance regarding what questions I should ask tomorrow in order to be able to start designing a solution and, from that vague list, what tools do you think I'll need to use. Do you think I'll even write a line of code or will I just take advantage of tools already available?

If this isn't the right sub to ask this question in, please indicate the ones you feel would be able to give me some guidelines. 

Also, I'm using a throwaway as a way of keeping my professional problems and my leisure separated. Thank you very much in advance."

29olg2,0,2014-07-02,I think my friend placed a curse on me,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29olg2/i_think_my_friend_placed_a_curse_on_me/,"I have this friend who has been my childhood friend for years, Kylie. She has been my friend through thick and thin and now things have really escalated...

This started about a year ago. It all started that night where we had this road trip with a bunch of friends of ours. Zack and I had just got into a relationship about 6 months before and we decided to have a nice road trip with some of our friends on an island near our city. With some connections I managed to get a whole floor for my friends and I. 

Everything was going well until the night came and Zack got drunk, which wasn't unusual. But for some reason, I had this sudden burst of anger. This sudden burst of emotions that caused me to cry and yell at him. It was our special night. We haven't had sex since he was constantly working and I was doing an intern-ship in a law firm. This was going to be the night we did 'it' and now he's lying sprawled out on the bed, drunk. It was supposed to be romantic. 

I came back down to talk to my friends, and my bestie, Kylie stared at me and asked me what's wrong. I don't know why but it self insincere but I just told them what happened. My other friend Sharon told me she has to go back to the room soon. It was 4am and even HER boyfriend is fast asleep. She told me she'd walk me back since our rooms were connected and side-by-side. She managed to stop my tears and suddenly I was alright. However the moment I entered the room, my anger began to raise again. 

Zack finally woke up, still a little drunk, but all i can remember from that night was that I was yelling and screaming at him. And next thing I knew, I was awake beside Zack as the sun laid on his face. I woke him up for breakfast and asked him to tell me what had happened the night before, but he just told me I had a psychotic breakdown and a few of my friends saw. He wouldn't say anything more.

I managed to get a hold of Sharon. She woke up even later than all of us and she had a tired look on her face. I told her I remember nothing and asked her to explain. She stared at me wide-eyed and started. 

Apparently, after she sent me back, she also had a discussion with her boyfriend and that had a small fight, but I had banged on her door screaming and her boyfriend, Ders opened the door. She told me I ran to the door connecting to her room and started yelling,

""ZACK IS DEAD. ZACK IS DEAD""


Non-stop. I couldn't remember anything... 

She then told me that after that I ran out, threw my bag against the wall, everything fell out of my bag and my phone's battery even fell out, and started crying on the carpeted floor. A few of my friends from the floor who were still awake walked out, but Sharon was there to hold me up and kept asking what happened. I cried continuously, according to them, and even fainted for a few minutes. They managed to check my pulse and my eyes were dilated. I woke up after that hugging and crying my knees still thinking Zack was dead. 

The weirdest part was when she told me Zack came out of the elevator, looked at her, and walked into the hotel room. Sharon asked Ders to check on Zack to find out what's going on but Zack just told Ders he doesn't know what to do and apparently during our fight, I ran out the hotel and had thrown my keys on the road. 

Firstly, Zack would've never left me there crying about his 'death', and I would have remembered that I walked out of a building, into the middle of traffic, throwing the hotel keys. 

Sharon looked extremely tired and took a long drag of her cigarette. I apologized to her, told her I didn't remember anything. She told me she wasn't done.

After the whole thing, Zack managed to sit beside me and tell me he's alive. I didn't believe it at first, but he managed to convince me and bring me back to the room. After that, Sharon said she heard more yelling and choking in the bathroom. A lot of banging and yelling and suddenly, I screamed in high pitched and said that Zack has fallen. I stared into Sharon's eyes, wondering if these were all lies.

She looked calm and exhausted, as if telling the story was just as stressful as the night before. 

She said the doors connecting us unlocked and they ran in (Ders and her). They found Zack on the floor. He's conscious but his eyes were darting left and right. Sharon said her hands started to freeze and she was so scared, her teeth were literally chattering that night. No one would offer her and Ders an explanation. Zack even told them it's fine and all he needs to do is calm down. Sharon and Ders left after, and she told me yet there was a weirder part.

She heard the both of us giggling after that, having sex as loud as anything. 

I have never in my entire life lost memory of an entire 3 hours of crazy events. I can't believe that after all that, we would even be having sex. What was Zack and I thinking? I apologized again and again to her. Weirdly enough, Kylie was staring at us from afar with the creepiest look on her face.

Now why I found this weird was because after that event, Kylie has been getting pretty odd and my mental state has become even worse. I just started on lithium a week ago, so I'm trying to track back as much as I can from memory and help from Sharon. I feel really tired and explain to you how weird Kylie got after the trip, what happened, and what has led me to take lithium.

But things aren't changing and I need sleep.

I still see her. 

------

Sharon here, writing this for Renee. She was pretty tired after re-living that night from a year ago. Hell, I'm pretty tired too. I had to explain to her again what happened, and at the same time write it. She wants to chronicle this before her mental state worsens. She told me if she ever loses her memory again, at least these posts will help her remember. I told her about /r/nosleep and I told her every time she told me the story, she'd give me shivers. So I figured to give you guys a few shivers of her. This is just the beginning. Trust me when I say it gets worse. I'll have to talk to her again to recall what happened the following months. I think it was something to do with her house party. But I'll get back to you guys on that soon.

Oh and just to add. Ders, me, Renee and Zack weren't the only one having a lover's spat. There was another couple that we heard a few months from then that they had fought the same night too. Part that makes me believe Renee more was the fact that Kylie had been distant with all of us, only talking to us if we were separated from our partners. And when we were together, she would just give us this creepy/angry stare that freaked all six of us out..."

Is this a bad internship? Have the engineers misunderstood the intern's skill levels? Or is this an adequate challenge and a good experience?"

Can anyone review this as it obviously needs polishing, and can you explain to me the changes you did and why?


The test prompt:

&gt;You are serving an internship with the traffic court in the city where you live.  The clerks in the traffic court office want a simple application that will allow them to enter the offender's name, the actual speed limit, the speed at which the offender was travelling, and how many previous violations they have received.  The application should calculate charges and display how many miles over the speed limit the offender was travelling, the cost of the speeding ticket, and the court costs.  The program should calculate a charge of $20 per each mile per hour over the speed limit, and court costs beginning at $74.80 per each offense. The output should be the offender's name, their speed, and the cost of the ticket. 

My code:

    package moneymaker;

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Moneymaker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
                double RECORD_VIOLATION = 2;
                double SPEED_LIMIT = 25;
                double COURT_COST = (74.80);
                
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    System.out.print(""Offenders First Name: "");
	String firstname  = input.next( );
        
    System.out.print(""Offenders Last Name: "");
	String lastname  = input.next( );
        
    System.out.print(""Speed limit in Zone: "" + SPEED_LIMIT );
    System.out.println(""mph"");
        
    System.out.println(""Enter speed of offender in MPH: "");
	float offenderSpeed = input.nextFloat();
        
    double overMPH = (offenderSpeed - SPEED_LIMIT);
    double totalCost = (overMPH * 20 + COURT_COST);
    double totalCostFees = (totalCost * RECORD_VIOLATION);

    System.out.print( firstname + "" "" + lastname );
    System.out.print("", was driving: "");
    System.out.print( + offenderSpeed );
    System.out.print( ""mph"" );
    System.out.print("", that's "");
    System.out.print( + overMPH );
    System.out.println( ""mph over the speed limit."" );
    System.out.println( RECORD_VIOLATION + "" violations inluded in fees."" );
    System.out.println(""Total Cost: $"" + totalCostFees + "" USD"");
       }
     }
Output

&gt;Offenders First Name: George

&gt;Offenders Last Name: Bush

&gt;Speed limit in Zone: 25.0mph

&gt;Enter speed of offender in MPH: 

&gt;30

&gt;George Bush, was driving: 30.0mph, that's 5.0mph over the speed limit.

&gt;2.0 violations inluded in fees.

&gt;Cost: $349.6 USD


I already submitted the test, but I just want feedback and how I can clean and improve this code so I can obtain knowledge on future projects, thank you!"

29p49d,1,2014-07-02,WordPress: Transition from temporary domain to permanent domain,splendidoblivion,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/29p49d/wordpress_transition_from_temporary_domain_to/,"To preface this request, you need to know that I'm an intern and walked into a bad situation that I'm trying to fix so there might be some issues about the problem at hand that I have no control over, and therefore I have to perform some magic to get things working.

So, the client I'm working with had a website using GoDaddy's Web Builder. They did not like it and requested that I switch the website over to WordPress. 

In order to do this I would have had to wait a few hours in order to begin working on the site in WordPress (because I was switching the platform from one thing to another on the same domain/URL address). I wanted to get working on it right away so instead of waiting, I set up the WordPress account (through GoDaddy because that is what the client wanted) using a temporary domain. 

This is when the issues began. For some reason I couldn't switch the domain name from the temporary one to the old one we had been using with GoDaddy's Web Builder. Every time I tried I would get a 'Site Not Found' error and was unable to work on the website in WordPress. 

It wasn't until I used the whois search (I apologize if that's the incorrect way to say it) I found out that the domain was not registered with GoDaddy but with someone that no one I worked with knew. Long story short, I was finally to contact the guy and got him to direct that domain's IP address to the temporary domain's because I needed a quick fix due to the time sensitive issue. (So www.correcturl.com technically contains nothing and points to www.temporarydomain.com which has everything I need.)

I know that this was not the best/correct solution but with the problem being completely out of my realm of understanding and being pressured to get the website up ASAP, it's what I did.

**I want to know how or even if I can switch the temporary WordPress domain over to the actual company URL rather than have one direct traffic to the other.**"

And so far I'm highly unsatisfied.

The manager seems to be very busy with other things and hasn't given much thought to my intern project. Most of the time I'm working on some really easy task or just sitting around with nothing to do. I pretty much see him once a week. Their code base is also pretty damn messy, with the majority of it in Perl/CGI along with the some Java, C++, Ruby, etc. They insist on continuing using Perl/CGI just because that's what's already there. I am willing to learn Perl, but I kinda wish I was learning some language that would be more marketable on my resume. I also don't really respect the other software developers as engineers due to the asinine suggestions and bad design decisions they make during meetings. It's as if they were shipped in a time machine from 2004. However, I have to say that they are all really nice people and I do enjoy them as friends. The pay is average, but most of it goes towards the apartment that I had to find and rent on my own.


To summarize, I'm feeling that I'm just wasting my time and not learning much. This is my first internship, so I don't know much. Is software development always like this? What should I do?"

I've completed an IT Academy program at my high school that covered Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, programming (basic Python), hardware, Adobe Photoshop and Premiere, web design, and even a summer internship last year. 

I loved the web design and video portions of the academy. I could always come up with some creative things to do on camera and then edit them well. Web design came easily to me, I'd always be doing things a couple chapters ahead of the rest of the class because I found it fun. 

I also have a huge passion for gaming. Not sure if this could ever lead me anywhere. I play a lot of the same games, really. Just a bunch of Fallout 3 and New Vegas (RPGs/Shooters), and I absolutely relish in the lore of it all, knowing an abundance and even writing out my own situations using it whenever I have free time. Fan fictions and such.

Now I'm preparing to attend Eastern Kentucky University and major in Computer Information Systems. Beyond that, I have no clue where to go. I know where my passions general direction is, I just don't know where to go after the first step. Some advice would be great, perhaps some outside opinions on what would fit me best.

On the phone, Bob comes across as a seemingly normal guy, and the work he describes seems like something I could enjoy. I get the job, and accept, I've now been on the job for a month, and I can see I'm pretty unhappy. Bob is a total weirdo who lacks the most basic social skills. Awkward, rude, disrespectful...you get the idea; not exactly an easy guy to work with. This makes the DevOps work, which is pretty new to me really unfun. I've tried to be as positive as I could this whole month and really try to enjoy working here, but this team is just not for me. I would quit if this was a full-time job, but since this is an internship I'm going to stick it out and just build that resume at the least. I'm realizing there is another option: Request a team switch from my manager. The reason I'm hesitant to leverage this option is because I interviewed with Bob and I was meant to work on his team. Our floor has around 40 developers, and most of them are much much more tolerable than Bob, and they are also doing work I find a lot more interesting (I'm finding that I really prefer WebDevelopment work to DevOps). Would I be a terrible person to request a team switch given my circumstances?"
29puwu,1,2014-07-03,How did you start programming for fun?,newprogrammer92,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/29puwu/how_did_you_start_programming_for_fun/,"I just finished my second year in my comp science major and recently had an interview for a software engineering internship. One of the questions they asked was ""what do you do in your free time?"" And I couldn't really tell them of any projects or programming I've done in my spare time -- partly because I'm clueless where to start. I've heard people say ""program something that will be useful for you"" or ""work on an existing open source project"" etc. etc. but those suggestions still seem vague to me. All the programming I've ever done is in the Netbeans environment, writing Java code to solve homework assignments. I really want to start working on projects for my own enjoyment, but besides writing simple Java classes/projects in Netbeans, I'm at a loss as to how people just ""program for fun."" I've tried sites like codeacademy, but I'm not specifically interested in learning a new language, but in ways to implement a language (Java) that I'm already familiar with into projects that I can learn from and potentially use in the future. From my classes, I've loved programming, but I'm not sure how to just start doing it on my own without a set problem to solve. So what I want to know is: how did you take the first jump from programming in classes/for homework into programming in your free time/for your own enjoyment? 

**TL;DR** How/what did you first start programming for fun/in your free time?

29qusu,1625,2014-07-03,21 day quarantine,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29qusu/21_day_quarantine/,"I’ve just returned from Africa, Guinea to be specific. I was there interning for the CDC in cooperation with the WHO. If you haven’t heard what’s going on in West Africa right now…then I’ll give you the quick and dirty; there’s a massive Ebola virus outbreak. I worked as a tech assisting with incredibly ill patients. Most of them didn’t make it where I worked. The few that did survive were in bad shape and would probably carry traces of their struggles with them for the remainder of their lives. It wasn’t pretty.

I have a degree in biology and microbiology and have been working towards a masters in epidemiology. I plan on eventually getting my doctorate…but that’s neither here nor there right now. One of my professors invited us to apply for a summer internship with the CDC working with the WHO in an attempt to find a vaccine for the Ebola virus outbreak that’s been ravaging West Africa. I put my resume in the mix and was rewarded with a spot on the trip. There were four of us in total and we all went to separate “hospitals.” They weren’t really hospitals…it was a series of tents set up to hold the ill until they either got better or died. I know it sounds harsh, but when someone’s veins have deteriorated to the point that a nurse can’t even get a needle into them without them catastrophically failing then the chances are they aren’t going to make it.

The reason this disease has been spreading so quickly in the area is quite simple; the method the indigenous peoples use to bury their dead. They insist on washing the corpses before they put them in the ground. This puts them in direct contact with bodily fluids contaminated with a virus that has at least an 80% mortality rate and can remain dormant for up to twenty-one days. Someone could basically be dead on their feet for three weeks before symptoms begin to manifest. Death from internal bleeding comes quickly to those who it decides to take mercy on. Others linger for weeks.

I’ve been quarantined for the last three weeks to ensure that I was safe to return home. It was standard procedure; anyone who was leaving the facility that had been in any sort of contact with the patients, even while wearing hazmat suits, had to wait a minimum of three weeks before leaving. No exceptions. One of the other assistants, a local man, was informed that his wife had succumbed to an unrelated illness and that he was required to stay for three more weeks before going to be with his family. It was strictly enforced. We planned our trip accordingly and collected our data and samples in May, having last been in contact with the patients or samples a little over three weeks ago so that we could return at the beginning of July.

The doctor I was working with was a somewhat local one who seemed to have delusions of grandeur…not to mention a death wish. He was originally from southeast Nigera, he didn’t act like the rest of the doctors, and seemed to have his own bizarre agenda the entire time I spent with him. He behaved like a normal enough person, but he would frequently disregard the strict safety rules and, on occasion, nearly expose himself to the virus. I watched in horror one afternoon as he removed the helmet to his mask to wipe a bead of sweat from his face. There was no earthly power that could’ve convinced me to remove my mask in such a situation; if someone sneezed from across the room the microscopic beads of water could travel at upwards of thirty miles per hour infecting him before he even had a chance to get his mask back on. We were burning bed sheets to prevent the spread of this horrible virus while he’s removing his mask in patient’s room because he’s uncomfortable. It amazed me that he hadn’t taken ill yet. I reported him to the WHO rep onsite. The WHO rep promptly told me that no one in their right mind would do that and I received a verbal reprimand, but otherwise nothing happened.

If he didn’t care that he got infected that was one thing, but I had no such desire; I took great care to avoid this man outside of the ward. He lived on the other side of the city, and kept mostly to himself when at the ward outside of patient’s rooms. It wasn’t hard. I had to have one interaction with him that I can remember. He was required, as part of our assessment of the working conditions of the healthcare providers in the facility, to give us a cheek swab. I took this swab with the utmost care, and made sure to wear a full hazmat suit. I treated him as if he were a patient. I had an excuse all prepared in case he asked; “this was my standard procedure, the suit’s clean, and I don’t like taking risks,” but he didn’t…he simply smiled and stared at me with eyes that seemed to look right through me. His eyes seemed off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I never got a really close look at them. I burned the suit like the rest after decontamination. His sample was checked under a video microscope and placed under observation like the rest.

Finally, over three weeks ago, my group had our final decontamination. We stayed quarantined in our respective facilities and studied the data, tapes, and recordings. The data was going to make a fine thesis that would probably help me greatly in the pursuit of my doctorate. Each of the four students had to provide a sample as well, and as we were nearing the end of the three weeks, all had been deemed clean showing zero signs of infection. Everyone was healthy, which, even with the precautions we’d taken, was a fantastic relief. 

The healthcare workers, for the most part, had remained unaffected by the virus. Only one of the workers became infected during our stay and that was a known accidental breach; she’d been unfortunate enough to stick herself through the suit with a contaminated needle. Mercifully, she’d actually survived her infection and lived to give us a second sample of someone who’d beaten Ebola. 

We had recorded enough data and videos of the various samples we’d taken to last for months, but we were on a time schedule, so some of it waited until we got back home. As we were leaving the facility I noticed that the WHO rep was a different one than the person who’d verbally told me to basically keep a lid on it. I questioned her and she informed me that she’d only been assigned this post that very day as the last WHO rep had been killed in a botched robbery a few days prior while in Sierra Leone. I questioned her as to what she knew about the doctor who I’d been working with and she claimed that no one under that name worked under the facility. As she flipped through the pages, she did remark that a patient under the same name had passed away very early on in the outbreak. She described him and showed me a grainy photograph of what appeared to be a man near death lying in a bed. That was him. That was the doctor. I could see it in his eyes and I figured out why they looked odd; there were small capillaries that had burst from the infection in his eyes. The man in the picture was cremated less than six hours after the picture was taken as he died before they could even try to treat him. I told her of this and she made a note…but mostly told me that I was probably seeing things as this man was long dead.

I told my professor and he seemed more worried than I; he’d had a similar experience during the Ebola outbreak in 1976. He began to ask the man’s name, but then stopped. We were sitting in a transport when he walked by. We both caught sight of him and as the transport wheeled away we could see the “doctor” board a separate one headed offsite. As part of our journey we were headed to sea for a ride to a neighboring, unaffected village before heading home.

My professor contacted the WHO rep when we arrived on our ship. She sent us his picture and my professor turned pale. He wasn’t a tan man to begin with as he was already in his sixties, but what color he had drained from his face when he saw the picture; It was the same, seemingly dead, man who’d impersonated a doctor back in 1976, he was sure of it. As best we could tell he was already long gone. We had no way of knowing where exactly, except that the transport he was on went directly to the airport.

We didn’t know what to do so we turned to analyzing the samples and the data we’d collected before our quarantine. The samples had long since been discarded, but the video recordings of the samples under a microscope still needed to be analyzed. I went directly to the mystery doctor’s sample. Doctor Akachi, as he was called. I put the recording of his sample up to analyze and started to research his name. I couldn’t find anything aside from a few mad scientist types in various anime genres. I did a search on just the surname, as that was all I had to go on, and found something interesting; his name roughly translates to “the hand of God.” When I thought of that it explained a lot about his demeanor; he would frequently refer to himself as “the one who does God’s work.” I’m not sure he was talking about healing anymore.

Suddenly my computer began to light up with alerts; the good doctor’s sample was off the charts infected. I’d sped the recording up a great deal and by the time it neared the end he went from perfectly healthy individual at day twenty to living zombie at day twenty-one. He had enough Ebola virus in his system that I thought at first someone had merely switched the samples without anyone noticing until I checked and double-checked the records; the sample dish hadn’t moved once. According to the logs, kept by aids who weren’t always medically trained, his blood PH dropped from 7.4 at day twenty to less than 5.0 by day twenty-one.

Immediately I contacted my professor who told me not to call anyone else. We reported it directly to the highest ranking person we could find at the CDC. That was our mistake. They told us that such information, if unfounded, could cause a global panic. They told us that it wasn’t possible that his blood could be acting like this and he still be walking upright, but we saw it. They told us we weren’t to contact anyone else on the matter. I returned home to find my apartment ransacked, my computers gone, everything I’d taken to the CDC was gone. I keep a hidden hard drive under my bed that stored basically everything as a backup, and even this had been fried. My email accounts had all been hacked and wiped, and I basically had to start over my master’s thesis.

I’ve done so by taking a look at cases resembling hemorrhagic fever outside of Africa. I noticed a trend in a few developed countries, mostly in Asia and Russia, but before I got too far I was shut down again when I thought I found a case in North America. It looked like a Canadian bush pilot had come down with something resembling Ebola after flying a man from a remote area in the Yukon into Yellowknife. Another bush pilot from Alaska had died in a similar manner, but he’d been in the field so no samples had been taken and the body had been unceremoniously burned to prevent spread. This was as far as I got before I was attacked by two large men and robbed at gunpoint. Again, I lost everything. I returned to my apartment to find the door kicked in and my newly purchased laptop gone. That evening I was informed via a close friend that my professor, the one I’d been working with, had died of a heart attack during an attempted robbery. I couldn’t even go to the funeral because he had no living relatives, and his body was taken by the CDC owing to his close proximity to the virus…even though that wasn’t what killed him.

I know I should stop, twice in three days I lost basically everything of value that I owned, but the man the pilots had given a ride matched the description to a “T,” right down to the blood-red eyes. The CDC and WHO are afraid of a global panic because Ebola has no cure; it’s the perfect humanity killer. If an outbreak hit the United States it could take 60-80% of the population within weeks, months at best, and even with all the healthcare we have…there’s nothing we could do to stop it. 

They don’t think it’d be possible for this disease to spread to North America…I think it’s already here.

29qwfb,20,2014-07-03,"The Gribble House Of Savannah, Ga: My Very Real and Life Changing Ghost Story",t8stemyrainb0w,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29qwfb/the_gribble_house_of_savannah_ga_my_very_real_and/,"Hello everyone. I decided to make an account today, so I can share with you an amazing experience I had while on vacation last year. Before you start reading, I'd like to say that I have always been into watching the ghost shows and reading about the paranormal, but I was about 99.9% sure that this stuff was all just for fun and in no way real. I just thought that the whole concept of ghosts was very exciting, but at the same time I never saw anything that truly convinced me this stuff was real. I felt and heard some cool things during this experience, but it all could have easily been a hoax. Except for the last 10 seconds.

I am a college student at Rutgers University and I major in finance. I even have a summer internship with a very prestigious financial group in PA. I'm not the type of person to automatically believe things without properly analyzing all other possibilities first, but I must say I am still very confused about what happened to me.

I went to visit the Gribble House Paranormal Experience in Savannah, Georgia on August 7, 2013. This attraction is literally a real life ghost investigation, with all of the same equipment as the TV shows. The violent history of this sight began in the early 1900's, because it was the scene of a triple murder. Since then, the house itself was demolished, and a large warehouse built during WW2 was built over top of it, but over a much larger area, an entire historic city block in fact. My mom and I were greeted by our guide Willie, who was very nice and explained the equipment in a very basic, but easily comprehensible manner. We received a spirit box, a laser thermometer, a flashlight, an EMF (electromagnetic field) detector, and a digital recorder. I will explain the other occurrences later on, but for now I will jump to the best part of the entire investigation.

In the last few minutes of the investigation, I was by myself in the southeast corner of the warehouse, which was swelteringly hot inside. This was to allow everybody to feel a spirit's presence much more easily, because they emit a very cold type of energy. For some reason, the spirits felt much more comfortable communicating with me at this moment. On the spirit box, I asked ""How many soldiers are here with me?"" The box replied ""3"". I asked ""Are you all confederate soldiers?"" Someone answered ""yes"". Soon after, my EMF detector began to light up, which indicated the presence of a spirit very close to me, and I remember somewhat feeling the energy from him or her, but I thought this could just be psychological so I ignored it.

I asked, ""Were you alive in the 1800s?"" The EMF detector blinked once, indicating that they were in fact alive during this time period. I asked if they were alive during the Civil War, and received no response. Then, I began to ask, ""Did you die in a major battle during the war?"" and as I said the word ""die"", the spirit immediately left my presence, allowing the EMF detector light to fade away. I asked, ""I'm sorry, was that a stupid question?"" and received an answer of yes on the spirit box. I then apologized for asking this question, and stated that I did not mean to be disrespectful.

About 10 seconds later, my EMF detector began to light up again, showing that there was in fact a spirit with me again. I asked, ""Were you a soldier during the Civil War and the light blinked once. I asked, ""Were you a confederate soldier?"" and the light blinked again. I said ""Are you standing in front of me?"" and received no response, but the EMF detector remained illuminated. I asked ""Are you standing to the right of me?"" and the meter blinked once. I turned to the right, and asked, ""Am I facing you now?"" and the EMF detector blinked once. I said ""Could you move closer to me so I can feel you?"", and on cue, this soldier literally walked right up to me and through me. I felt his cold energy all over my body, literally starting right in front of me and ending behind me.

Right after this moment, my mom came to tell me the cab was here, which followed by the honk of the cab's horn outside of the warehouse (I'm not sure why he honked when he knew we were coming; I guess it he was just in a rush or something). I tried to explain to her what had just happened, but I think I only gave a jumbled description because I was so confused with what just happened to me. I told the spirits, ""Thank you for taking the time to talk with me, I really appreciate it, but I have to go now"". A female voice replied through the spirit box ""goodbye"".

As I was walking out, my meter began to light up again, and the light remained illuminated in the briefing room. I set it, along with the spirit box, down on the table and received a spirit saying ""Enter"" through the box. I guess this indicated that he wanted me to come back and talk more, which unfortunately was not possible, because our allotted time had run out (it was 1 am).

Other odd occurrences:

Before the soldier, I was in the northeast corner of the building, and felt a presence standing behind me. I thought that someone might be there due to the cold air that was stationary behind me. Right after, my mom happened to place the meter behind me, and it lit up. I asked if this was Paul (our guide gave a few names of the supposed ghosts), and the spirit responded with one blink of the light. Right when our guide began to walk over, Paul left our presence immediately (I assumed he maybe does not like black people, or this was just a part of the hoax).

In the same area, I asked the spirits to do something for me on the count of 10. A voice in the voice box responded ""yes"". I started to count, and right after the number 6, a voice came through the box and stated ""7"". I continued to count, and received nothing at the end of the counting. I guess technically, they did do something ""on"" the count of 10.

While I was close to the southeast corner, but about 20-25 feet away my meter began to light up. I asked if there was a spirit there with me, and the light blinked once. I asked if my mom took a picture on the count of three, would they show themselves, and the voice on the voice box responded ""yes"". I began the countdown, and my mom did not take a picture on the count, but rather one too soon, and one too late. The voice on the box said ""late"", and about 3 seconds later, they stated ""very"".

These are the main highlights, aside from another couple odd things that occurred. I can understand skepticism from all who were not present, and I can honestly say that up to the last couple minutes, this could have been an elaborate hoax.

My mom decided to step out about 10 minutes before the end, and based on what she felt with me, I understand her skepticism as well. (She still does not believe I actually felt something, but rather imagined it). Unfortunately, she does not understand what actually happened to me on my own, only I do. Maybe some guys were watching with cameras and listening, and then responding to you in disguised voices. Maybe the EMF detectors were going off with the push of a button, and then responding with a blinking light by means of a person hiding on the other side of the warehouse. But I promise there is absolutely no way that the feeling of this presence walking through me was fake or imagined. I was way too far from any type of vent or window, let alone an open window, and this was not the same feeling you would receive from that type of occurrence anyways. I do not believe it was my own body, because usually when you feel cold like that (from being creeped out), you get a chill running down your body and goose bumps along with it. This cold ""energy"" was eerily similar to the presence that my mom and I felt at the Old Charleston Jail, which you can read about in my other story. The absolute only way to describe it is a cluster of chilly air moving together in one solid mass, and even this description is mediocre at best. It is something you MUST experience to 100% truly understand.

I left my house for vacation on Saturday, August 3, 2013 99.9% sure that there are no such things as ghosts. I am now almost certain that there are such beings from times all but forgotten, roaming the earth after death for reasons unknown to anyone but themselves.

Maybe human consciousness is much more complex than we currently believe it to be, and maybe you don't need your body to indeed be a conscious being. Maybe your body leaves behind a little part of you whose only objective is to reach out to others and in a way say, ""Hey, I was here. I existed, and I just want you to know"". I am still extremely baffled as to what this feeling truly was, but the only answer that I can pull from this mystery is that this was in fact the spirit of a man, a confederate soldier in fact, who for one reason or another, felt comfortable enough around me alone to give me a clear sign of his company.

If you, the reader, ever get a chance to go to Savannah, Georgia, make it an absolute priority to visit the Gribble House Paranormal Experience. There is something going on here that cannot be explained by a common haunted house prank."
29r14f,3,2014-07-03,Dating A Succubus Update 1,MKA42192,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29r14f/dating_a_succubus_update_1/,"Sooo, I have quite a story to tell about what happened to me last week. I am a recent college graduate
(guy) who went to an expensive, private four year university in the Northeast (New York to be specific), with a
degree in chemistry. I am, therefore, quite a rational, scientifically minded person. I don't believe in the
supernatural, nor the occult and whatever other crazy, ghastly things conjured up by people who wanted to be in
power over others or cause a stir in their communities...

However! I do believe in really strange occurrences, because lets face it, I have so many stories about
strange things happening to me. This is one of the strangest though!
Like so many other college guys and girls, I liked hooking up with my occasional co-ed. However, as the
years progressed, I found myself more interested in classes, for some odd reason, and less on shacking up with
“sorostitutes” and that cute library girl who always gives you a glance or two whenever you're typing a research
essay at 3 in the morning. (Quick tip and aside: if anyone has this girl in their next all-nighter session, 
JUST GO
UP TO HER!! AND ASK HER IF SHE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE STUDYING OR
WORKING ON! Even if she doesn't know anything at all and is a complete airhead, boom! You just started a
decent conversation about what you do! It works with guys too, girls.)

So when I was close to graduation, things started to lighten up. I had gotten into medical school,
senioritis was full gear, and senior week was excellent. I drank a ton with my friends, flirted hard (to no avail
other than confidence boosting), and celebrated the last few days of my undergraduate career with no regrets.
But that Thursday before I went home, I really wanted to hit it off one last time, especially before med school.
So, I spent the day hanging out at Starbucks and our college student center, desperately trying to run into old
flings or girls who I befriended, who we all knew might be on the same mission that week.

No luck, sigh... So I went last resort. I got to my apartment, and starting Tindering. Yes, that half ass
college hook-up application that I had on my tablet. About 30 minutes of “Yes” and very little “No”, I still had
no success. So that week, I graduated, no tail, but a 200k piece of paper with my name on it saying “I DID IT” in
invisible letters.
Fast forward two months, its now June. Completely forgot Tinder, been working in a medical free clinic,
reading a ton of fantasy and Lovecraft, and hanging out with my friends. I get a call to shadow a successful
neurosurgeon at a local hospital, so I decide to pull my tablet out of it's moving box, and charged it to carry
around and type notes while I shadowed. About 2 AM that night, when my tablet turned on from being fully
charged, I wake up to a ton of buzzing (Missed alarms, e-mail notifications, my tablet waking up after a two
month dormancy). After swiping off a dozen of update reminders and emails, I get to a tinder chat request!

Smiling to myself, secretly really interested to see who it was, I opened up the dating application and checked
my chats. I ended up have a few requests. One was a really cute blonde girl, the other a brunette with really deep
blue eyes. The third was this “alternative girl” (I'm really into that), who had a few well done facial piercings,
small gage earings, dirty blonde hair, and green eyes. She was like a “Suicide Girl”. Like that gorgeous!

WOWWW! I was dying in my bed that this girl sent a request, and it went “You're really cute! Do you
really metalwork and study chemistry?” (I minored in metalworking and jewelcrafting; it was really expensive,
but do it to expand your interests haha).” The brunette was a general “Heyyy whats up?” and the other blonde
was a bot, “Come check my cam!!” I dismissed that one, said “Nothing, how about you?” to the brunette (mind
me, it was two months later, I should have said something else). I caught myself with that, and replied differently
to the alt girl. “Hey! Yea, I really love art and sculpting. Oh and sorry for the long wait :( I haven't been on my
tablet for a while.” I didn't get any responses, but I didn't care. It was 2 in the morning, a random night two
months later, and undergraduate girls were away from my scope at this point.

I crashed and woke up the next day, did my routine of free clinic volunteering, working out, and playing
Dark Souls off the steam sale purchase I made (I'm stuck in Blight Town, these damn fat trolls are so hard to
kill). About 9 pm, after a heated World Cup debate with my brother and dinner with my family, I retire to my
room to watch whatever is on TV and cram in a little more Dark Souls. Buzzzzz, my tablet is vibrating and
sounding off. Tinder Chat Reply!

I check the app and find that the ALT GIRL REPLIED TO ME!!! “ha its all cool, I've been busy too and
haven't been on this in a while”. Excited, I send back “Yea, this is such a convenient and inconvenient app... so
whats up? Are you an undergrad student at ************** University,” and what do you study, etc etc (Those
are just some random symbols, it doesn't correlate to my school's name. I want to keep anonymous). Turns out
she graduated in the communications school in a media management program, we have an awesome
conversation, and she's staying in the area for an internship. I live about 30 minutes away from my school, and
my med school is close to my previous undergraduate campus, so I take a leap and try to set up plans. 

She doesn't reply :(...

I go on with my night, spend two hours in Blight Town, and crash. I spend the next couple days working,
and when the weekend comes up, I decide to meet a friend who's working on his PhD at my old University while
I check out a new apartment for med school. After checking the apartment out, I made my way back to campus
to meet my friend, and made a quick stop at Starbucks for a frap. AND THERE SHE IS! Working on her laptop,
the alternative girl was deep in her zone, and I didn't want to be a weirdo, so I gave them my name, and walked
to where I had to wait for my drink, inconveniently next to where she was sitting. I think she noticed me when I
said my name (My name isn't that common at all), and she was looking over at me every now and then while I
was waiting for my fricking frap.
Please oh Please, I was pleading to the non-existent heavens, just make it quick. But then I thought, oh
hell, and looked at her when she looked at me so obviously. She smiled and said “Hey! What are you doing
here?”

“Just visiting my friend doing his PhD here, and scoping out a new apartment for med school” I explained.

“Sit!” She urged and she gestured to the chair across from her.

I texted my friend to meet me at Starbucks, and drank my frap with this delightful and gorgeous girl. We had
such an awesome convo, and she apologized for not replying to my Tinder chat, she never got a notification (she
even pulled her Tinder up to prove it to me). My friend came in about 15 minutes into the conversation, I
introduce the two and they chat, and I give her my number.

Now all you redditors are probably like, WTF? Why is this in /nosleep... this is why.

I've been texting this girl a lot and last week, she told me about how she thinks she has a mental disorder. She
told me she thinks she's histrionic, or hypersexual, sensual, and overly charming/alluring. Okay, now this is the
creepy part. That is my take on it. What she actually told me was this 

(Let's give her the name Jade, for her eyes
and her own anonymity).

Jade: Hey, so I have something to tell you.

Me: What's up gorgeous?

Jade: :)

Jade: OK, no more play. I'm a succubus.

Me:... ?

Jade: Do you know what that is?

Me: Do you?

Jade: Really! I'm not lying or being weird, I know it sounds like I'm fucked up, but please give me the
benefit of the doubt for these few minutes.

Me: A Succubus as in the Sex Demon thing?

Jade: Yes! But it isn't just sex. Succubus demons are old old souls that live in young girls for life force. They
possess girls and women in order to experience life, and allure powerful men with the hopes of gaining equal
power.

Me: Isn't that like a gold digger? Haha

Jade: No Seriously!Gold diggers want money. A succubus wants everything!

Me: So, let's say you are a succubus... how did you come across this discovery?

Jade: When I was a teenager, I was into occult stuff and that. My friends had this wicca club, and we used to do
little rituals with each other. One night, we had this summoning, and my friends said I blacked out and woke up
that next day with no memory of what happened.

Jade: So after that, I really became reserved, did a lot to change my physical appearance to look like a little slut.
The last few years of high school, I slept around, hung out with popular girls, left my friends, and became this
little bitch.

Me: Ok, so you decide to get wild in high school, a lot of girls did that back then. I doubt your a succubus.

Jade: Well, there are times I don't remember things, like when I sleep or eat meals, or talk to my friends. I once
went through a whole week as if it was a blackout. I woke up that weekend with no memory of the last week.

Me: Jade, you need some help. This isn't healthy. It sounds like you are going through massive psychological
trauma, mixed with violent blackout experiences and personality disorders.

(Yes, I'm a pretentious medical student hahaha)

Jade: No! I thought about it, but it doesn't help. Something in my head really sways me from it, its a different
soul. But when we talk, I have more control, and I feel like this presence inside me accepts it to!

Me: So you're calling me powerful ;D

Jade: Shut up lol. I'm just saying, I feel like I'm not human, and I think its because of that demon summoning in
high school. I never told anyone about this, not even my parents... Can you just stick it out with me for a bit? I
really like talking to you and hanging out, and I'll try the psychological stuff if you can help me, Mr Doctor!

Me: haha, yeaaaa ok wierdo.

Jade: SHUT UP!

Me: :)

Jade: ;P

Sooo, Idk. It's a little weird. Well really. Obviously, this girl is histrionic. Has some personality disorder. Maybe
an STD? Lol.... What should I do? Should I stick it out with this “Succubus” or should I chuck and go to
something else. Med school's starting, I don't want a psycho girl friend, but at the same time, I feel bad about her
situations and she needs some form of support group. Other than this text convo, she is so likable and with my
friend that one day, she was really amiable and conversational when he met her. Who knows haha! Maybe cases
of “Succubus” possesions, are actually, histrionic. These texts were last week by the way, I spent Saturday with
her on campus and at the movies (no sex yet), but she's really into me. She held me at the movies, we kissed and
held hands and such walking around the mall... Just no sex.
Advice on how I should approach. Anyone been with a “Succubus?” hahaha oh god.

29rcz0,4,2014-07-03,Graduating with zero experience...,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/29rcz0/graduating_with_zero_experience/,"Hello Reddit,

I could really use your help and advice. After July 30 I will be getting my degree in Business Administration with my option in Finance from a California State University, upon completion of a summer course. Between now and then I will be applying nonstop to as many places as possible hoping to land interviews. My final GPA is 3.6 (cumulative) and 3.77 (major).

My issue is that I have no relevant experience dealing with anything finance related. I haven't worked in more than a year and I admit that I've sort of dropped the ball. To be honest, I don't have any work experience that looks good on a resume really at all which puts me at a huge disadvantage. Because of this, I have struggled to even land interviews for internships and I feel like my resume gets ignored most of the time. I interviewed for a couple internships in June, but got rejected because they were looking for someone who isn't graduating.  How can I stand out and get a real entry level job with absolutely no relevant experience?

I am interested in working somewhere in corporate finance possibly becoming a financial analyst, but I know with my resume I can't be too picky. I am honestly desperate to gain any type of relevant experience I can leverage.  I'm open to career paths in anything business/finance related. My goal is to get my foot in the door somewhere and even if it's not my dream job, it will help me build my resume. I do have some student loans I’m going to have to start paying, so realistically I’m hoping to be making at least 40k in an entry level position.

So how can I get my foot in the door and break into finance with no experience? To gain an analyst or other corporate finance role, what skills should I hone? (I'm decent with excel, give me specifics to master in certain roles). How can I frame myself in an interview as someone with a decent GPA but no experience?

Thanks for your replies; any input is greatly appreciated!!

I have an interview next week for a web development internship that I don't feel super comfortable about. While I'm excited to work in the field, it's been a few years since I've been out of school and used the stuff and I feel VERY rusty. I was wondering if anyone has any tips or good books they know of to help me refresh myself. I caught on very quickly before and it shouldn't take too much for me to re-learn.

The job requirements focused on HTML, XML, CSS, PHP, as well as relational database systems like MySQL. It also pointed out knowing some stuff on SEO, Web programming, and the web application development process. Any basic interview tips would be good too ( I haven't had very many interviews in the past ).

Any help would be appreciated. I'm new to the sub and already started browsing around to help find some answers to these types of questions. A good book for these things would be great though.

Thanks!"

29ruli,11,2014-07-03,Annual Raise Negotiation,bop_alloy,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/29ruli/annual_raise_negotiation/,"Hi all,  
  
I am coming out of my first year as a consultant with a mid-sized IT firm. I am curious as to what has been everyone's experience with raise percentages throughout their career? I have a meeting next week with my Partner to discuss a raise coming out of my annual review (the review discussion will be had a week or two later in person). I'm aiming for a 10% increase, however I imagine that that is too generous and I should be more realistic. Does anyone have experience negotiating their annual raises, especially coming out of their first year as a consultant?

To give you some background on my performance, my firm has a four scale system for reviews, with a 1 being below expectations (worst) and a 4 being above expectations (best). I've had three interim reviews prior to this annual review. The first one was coming out of our training program and was a 3, but at the same time it was mentioned that I had the strongest performance out of the group. The second was about five months into my first engagement and was also a 3, but with a different set of criteria. My most recent review (one month ago) was a 4. I am involved on internal projects and on the more administrative side of my current client engagement. I should also mention that I have an additional year with my firm as an intern on the operations side of things.
  
  
  
Edit: Received a 10% raise. Definitely pleased with the number."

I think she might have had tears in her eyes when that thing worked again, she was so happy and relieved.
She tells me then how scared she got and that she will never ever open solitaire again, I laughed and told her its all well...

And before she hung .. She said ""Mera Chottta Computer Engineer ""
Translates to ""My Little Computer Engineer "" from Hindi..

But I don't want this to happen again in Summer 2015. I'm a pretty good student, with a pretty solid GPA (3.97). I've had a HS internship at Microsoft, and a web development company, and right now I'm working on a startup with an ECE professor at my home university. I mean, [here's my résumé](http://kirmani.io/files/redditresume.pdf) if you're actually interested. I've made a list of companies I want to intern at, and I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to land an internship at at least one of them. 

(In order of preference)

* NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
* SpaceX
* Google
* Facebook
* Microsoft
* MIT Lincoln Lab
* Dropbox
* Amazon
* Wolfram Research
* Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab
* Twitter
* Quora
* IBM
* Tumblr

Is it just as impossible to land an solid internship as a sophomore? What should I do?"

[How did you become a NPR foreign correspondent? Was the position extremely competitive? Does NPR provide a good salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwna6?context=5)|I'm on the record as a 17 year old saying I wanted to be one! For me, it was a combination of work and luck. I studied Russian in high school and college, I was interested in the world, I liked asking questions. I did a bunch of news internships during college summers then worked at a community radio station. A couple years after the Soviet Union fell apart, I felt like I wasn't getting enough information about what was happening there in the newspapers (this was pre-internet). So I went there sans job and got work as a researcher for an American newspaper and did some freelance. Finally the company that I'd been bugging for a job hired me and I started doing radio and TV for lots of programs, including US public media. Eventually I came back, and a few years later got a lucky break pitching a freelance piece to NPR. I was hired as a temp on the Washington desk and applied for the Berlin position a couple years later. Voila! 
[As a female, and a professional how do you find the Middle East? Are you generally accepted everywhere you go, and have you ever been denied access based on your sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw4fp?context=5)|I've not been overtly denied access to anything based on my gender. Although when I did a story on ultra-Orthodox males in the Israeli military, the IDF press people wanted me to bring a guy because I wanted to record ambi around the base and they weren't sure that would be okay. (They brought people to interview into a certain room - and that was okay with them.) But I didn't take a guy and nobody actually on the base cared as I walked around recording. More generally: in conservative societies being female can give me better access than being male - I get to talk to the women bc I'm a woman, and to the men because they are who talk to people. Then in certain situations, I feel like as a western female reporter, I am akin to a creature from outer space. :-)
[What if anything has been the thing that has most questioned if you are in the right profession? for instance witnessing extreme cases of violence of that sort of thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw2pa?context=5)|Well - sometimes in my little room in Jerusalem talking into my mic to myself then sending audio off over the internet it feels like I'm speaking into the void. So I guess one hard part is feeling a bit disconnected from the people I'm in conversation with - you. Violence is a different subject. It can be very wearing. I used to go back to Berlin from Baghdad and look out the window driving home and think about the issues Germans were passionately debating and think: ""you people think YOU have problems???"" Like many reporters I have struggled in situations where I'm there to report, not to help. 
[How much is Israel a religious state? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvry9?context=5)|Hey that's complicated! Clearly it's religious - the rabbinate sets lots of rules about social issues (marriage, etc.) that affect any Jewish person no matter how religious they are individually. Saturday traffic is way, way, way down - more in Jerusalem than Tel Aviv, as it's the Jewish Sabbath and many people don't drive. There is a wide range of how strictly people practice their faith. And there is a strong stream of secular society. And that's just skimming the surface of the Jewish sector of society (about 75%).
[What have you noticed about the public sentiment in Israel regarding the advancement of ISIL, and do you think they expect some sort of U.S. intervention in order to quell the problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvnhv?context=5)|Hi ghawk15, I did some reporting on this a week or so ago. Generally speaking, I found that concern about the ISIL/ISIS/IS in Iraq just ramped up the general concern in Israel about turmoil in the neighborhood. There's a feeling of just keep it out of here ... but in the case of Iraq in particular, it ramps up concern in Israel about the influence of Iran, which is broadly seen as the main potential threat to Israel in the region. I don't think there is a deep expectation in Israel of US intervention, in part because of the US approach in Syria so far. 
[Will this wave of escalation cease or does it feel more like the worst has yet to come?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwvrr?context=5)|I'm not on the ground there right now, but I'll quote what an Israeli friend said to me today: ""It's tense but not out of control yet.""
 |The year I've been there has been relatively calm, but I can count a half a dozen times where at least journalism colleagues and I have wondered if ""this"" will be the trigger to a sustained flare up in violence. Most Palestinians I have talked with in the past year say they don't want a third intifada and don't feel united enough to sustain something like that. 
[Emily, much American coverage of developments in Israel seem to focus on big picture policy. Rarely do I have the opportunity to read pieces that let people speak in their own words about the realities and feelings on the ground. In your work, what do you feel are the average person's perspectives on a two-state solution, and/or the constant state of violence? Thanks in advance. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw6gn?context=5)|Whether the two-state solution is the right solution is being debated among Palestinians and Israelis. Of course, the visions of a one-state solution can look very different - many Palestinians who support one-state envision one state where everyone has equal rights. Some Israelis propose annexing parts of the West Bank that aren't Palestinian cities. Others propose a unilateral withdrawal - a different way to get to two-states than negotiating. But generally polls still show broad support for two-states as the best solution. I'll pull some of my stories that might get at what you're looking for and post them later.
[How does reporting from Jerusalem -- as opposed to, say, Ramallah or Amman or Gaza City -- affect the way you see and cover regional issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw6kt?context=5)|Well, I go to Ramallah, Gaza and Tel Aviv all the time and many other places when stories take me there. (Plus of course I go around just to hike or eat out, etc.) I like being in Jerusalem as opposed to Tel Aviv because it's really where more of the passion for place is and it's right next to the West Bank. I could walk to Bethlehem (that's in the West Bank) for example. So while anywhere you live certainly affects your basic daily experience, getting around is key.
[Big fan!!! What is the most frightening situation you have been in while reporting and how did you mentally deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvnt7?context=5)|That was back in Iraq. I was walking across a bridge outside the Green Zone - going home from an interview. I started imagining what would happen if someone drove up and shot me. (The chance of that was extremely low, by the way!) I wondered if I could survive if I jumped in the river - and then should I swim toward the Green Zone - or would US soldiers shoot? Or away, where I would emerge alone, wet, and bloody? How did I deal with it - just kept walking! 
[Hello Ms Harris. 1st time caller, long time listener. 2 part question. Firstly-do you feel actions that the Presby Church is undertaking in divesting in companies that may support illegal settlement bldg will actually have an effect, or would it be similar to giving sanctions? Secondly-I was in Jerusalem last year and negotiated with a vendor for a rug made of alpaca hair. The price was rather high, but we haggled down to a reasonable amount (60% discount!\). By the end of the 30 minutes of back-and-forth, I opted not to buy the rug as I felt it was an impulse purchase. The man was irate. Would you apologize to him for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwoaj?context=5)|Hi aintnosanityclaus - the divestment/boycott issue is one of those slow trickle things. I've interviewed one person who has been working to lay the legal groundwork for European labeling from products made in settlements, for example, for years. Although the direct economic impact appears quite minimal, I definitely hear Israelis concerned about the potential political impact and Palestinians convinced that this is their next key step in pursuit of statehood. Not sure about comparing divestment to sanctions. As far as the rug, I doubt anyone could win his forgiveness for you! Haggling is fun - but it is a relationship! And those take care anywhere. 
[Is it as violent as the media says it is? How often do you find yourself in a dangerous situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw5xi?context=5)|It can be extremely violent and deadly and much of that is very localized. Meaning if you're not there you don't know it. Some of the confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians are relatively predictable - Fridays is often a day when confrontations happen - and often in the same place, for example. So you can go find it. But other times - all bets and predications are off. 
[Are there stories about Israel and Palestine that go unreported or maybe lost in the overall narrative of the reporting that comes out of there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw9zd?context=5)|For sure there are. Here is an interesting piece I hadn't realized before I went there though. Many Israelis and Palestinians want to stick to a basic narrative they see as advancing their ""side."" So one challenge is actually getting beyond that - getting deeper in an interview - finding the cracks in their own shells of narrative threads.  
[What do you think about the situation about those three teenage boys and what do you think is the resolution to the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvsg6?context=5)|This is the first serious flare up in tensions since I moved there a year ago. One thing very interesting to me is the emotions around it; also how political agendas are folded around an event like this. I don't know what the resolution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is. Sometimes it seems really simple, other days, impossible! 
[Hi Emily! Could you speak more to the struggle reporters have with being there to tell the story rather than be a part of the story (""there to report, not to help""\)? I've always viewed public service and public media as partners in promoting a common good, and I imagine many at NPR feel the same way. Yet as a journalist you separate yourself from the story in order to report it. How do reporters deal with wanting to promote positive change, but not being able to in a direct way? Do reporters ever come in and out of public media from policy/grassroots activism positions? Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimxfpv?context=5)|Actually, I am not sure all or most or maybe even many reporters want to promote anything specific, or that they would agree on the common good. For me personally, I think the best thing about this job is the chance to try to understand and illuminate where and why people disagree on things and also where they agree (even if they may not realize that themselves.) Also explore new ideas. Some reporters do switch to advocacy work. My former colleague Sarah Chayes did that in Afghanistan after reporting on the war. 
[Are you related to Ed Harris? What flavor of ice cream is the best in Israel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimw39a?context=5)|Ed Harris - maybe! There are a lot of us Harrises out there! Most interesting ice cream I've had is the chewy ice cream in Ramallah. Best topping - shredded halva. Available on any Israeli grocery shelf!
[How is the Israeli public sentiment about an offensive against Palestine right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvxst?context=5)|I'm not there right now - so I can't give you first hand reporting on that. One interesting thing about Israeli public sentiment is that it is usually split on anything.
[Ms. Harris, given the recent development of Israel importing Kurdish oil through Turkey do you see the possibility for a triangular relationship that could bring some stability to the region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimwwcl?context=5)|Stability - not sure. Israel has long been supportive of Kurdish independence, which others in the region strongly do not support.  
[I know it is a basic tenant of ethical journalism, but how do you report on issues without personal? I would think this must be very difficult especially considering what you have seen and experienced firsthand.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29oc9i/i_am_emily_harris_nprs_jerusalem_correspondent/cimvtdp?context=5)|My main goal is to get the voices of the people I interview heard clearly and in context. Excellent bonus to work in radio!

But I truly need some help here.

As stated in the title, I am looking for a strong gaming laptop that is at or above a 17 inch screen, kept within a $2000 price range. I'd like to not spend all that on a laptop but I will if there's an extraordinary good one. Now for some details.

I've always been a gamer, but as of a few months ago, I sold my MacBook in order to help pay for a new laptop, the new msi gs70-stealthpro -024. After roughly a month of use, I am finding that I am having trouble with drivers and what I believe to be the graphics card. I've gotten two errors, one with the graphics card taking a crap and the other with drivers not cooperating with each other pretty much. Also, I had ano issue with charging it the second time I turned it on and after talking with an msi rep, he suggested returnin it. After paying $1799 for this, I thought it would be everything I was looking for and more. Oh and also if anyone is wondering, the laptop is pretty nice except for these issues, and my only nit pick is that the TouchPad feels super cheap. 

Anyways, sorry for the paragraph, but I'm looking to play graphics intensive games such as watchdogs, skyrim, far cry 3, etc. Games such as those. I want a laptop because I need it for portability to friends houses and to college. I would like 16gb of ram if possible, and aside from that, I'm looking for quality and performance. I know laptops get excessively hot, but if one had a great cooling system, that would also be appreciated. 

I've heard good things about msi and this almost made me be finished with them, but if they are a suggestion, I'll try once more. 

Please only have serious answers as I am also looking myself, but I'd like to get one ASAP to be able to play and communicate with friends during my internship. 

I thank everyone in advanced! "

I currently have no college experience, live in Texas, and have had a few jobs here and there. I initially wanted to be a police officer, but have decided to aim a little higher(joke) and would like a position within the FBI(preferably, but that could easily change). I figure if I am unable to get into the FBI I could always fall back onto being a police officer or something else with the education I get.

My current plan is to go to my local community college and then transfer into a better school after I have knocked out all the prerequisite stuff. I plan on getting a degree within an IT field as I generally enjoy pretty much anything that involves looking at a monitor. I am also going to join the military as it will be very valuable for my resume(more humor). 

Now for the questions:
The biggest one right now is: when and how should I work the military into my timeline? Should I join now? Go to school first? Assume there are no conflicts outside of what's optimal.

Would a degree within IT be optimal for getting a job as an ""agent""? Is there another degree that would be more beneficial? More than anything I appreciate the flexibility of this type of education.

Are there any schools I should be looking out for in terms of getting internships with the FBI?

I appreciate any and all answers, thanks guys.

EDIT: I was using the FBI(or again, similar positions) as an ultimate goal, but it seems many people think that it is not a good one(as some believe it is unreachable for me). Taking it a back a step further, what is a reasonable aspiration? Should I reign in my goals?"

More info below",Jordanfr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/29ut0l/i_need_reddit_help_to_accomplish_my_dream_i_am_a/,"Hello dear fellows,

I am here today to tell you my story, and I am not hoping for anything incredible, but just some help ! Even if you can't help me, reading this message is already great, so thank you in advance.

Ever since I was a teenager, I've always dreamt of begin my professional life and career in America. My parents took me to the west coast, and I already fell in love with it, I felt ""at home"".
After this trip, I had some hard time trying to know what I really wanted to do in life : I wanted to be an actor, but it eventually didn't work out the way I thought it would, so I asked myself a very serious question :

What do I want to do with my life ?

I thought about it for weeks : the only answer I could come out with, was : I want to do everything to settle my life and future family in the USA.

So, I began searching for the best options, how could I get there since the country is really closed for foreign people. 
And I came out with this answer : If I go to college, I'll be able to do some exchange, and maybe have an exchange in the US and then stay there ! Yeepee !

So, I began college, and followed course in Economics, and Management. My first two years went well, and on my third year, I asked to go abroad : Unfortunately, students with better results already took the place (there is a ranking setting, so you can't go if you're not the best). I eventually did my Bachelor in Brazil, in São Paulo, where I learnt Brazilian Portuguese.

After this experience, I was fluent in both English/French and Brazilian Portugese and got my Bachelor degree in economics and management (yeepee x2)

Coming back in France after a year out of my country, I began a Master degree in Management-Marketing option, I did it in Aprenticeship for an American company that I'll not name here.

Then I began my last year (the actual) of Master degree, with a Communication/Marketing and new tech specialization.

I already had some results, and I am the major in both English/Marketing-Communication and Business (I am waiting for other results but I think it's gonna be more than alright !).

I am actually doing an internship, when you end college in France, you have to do a last internship (6 months). And I am doing it in a small start-up which is very different from my last experience since the previous company was a very big.

This internship will end on september the 30th, and then : I am willing to do everything I can to begin something new in America.

This is why I am on reddit today asking for your help : could you help me, by any chance, trying to find a job in the US ? It could even be an internship, I don't really-really care about money, I care about an opportunity that could result in a long term contract.
I already send between 2 and 5 resumes everyday to different companies (I use Indeed and other jobs website, I have faith in trying hard !), that's why I also try on reddit.

I am willing to give everything I have, I have a solid background and experience in Marketing/Communication and new technologies, and speaks 3 different languages (french native).

If by any chance my profile interests you, or could interests someone you know, please, let me know at jordan.malalel@yahoo.fr or on reddit by message : I'll send you my resume !

Again, for those who read, even if you can't read me, a thousand thanks.

PS : I am willing to work in ANY state, from north dakota to new mexico :)

Cheers

I’m currently in a very odd situation, at least for me, which I will try to explain in detail. If you would like to know more about me please let me know. Also, I’m not reddit savvy so I apologize if I didn’t find a more fitting subreddit to post this.

So I’m a computer science student on my third year at a community college and will have to do two extra years at a university (if I do everything right).  I was able to obtain an internship a couple of months ago where I rarely do programming, which is what I truly want to do, but get paid a bit better than my old retail jobs. Realistically I never had to worry about money as I’m not a social person and don’t spend a lot on myself, but recently a bunch of bad stuff happened. I have to help my mother to pay house expenses as she is temporarily out of a job, I also found out there’s no longer going to be financial help to pay for college and I’ll have to pay out of pocket.

Now before this “bad-stuff” happened I loved to code on my free time for fun and loved to design small desktop and iPhone apps. I truly did it for the sole purpose of fun and definitely thought it would help me to get a job in the future, but there was no purpose of monetary gain attached to it. Sadly the financial worries have led me to think of a second source of income and I thought I could do this through my programming skills, which appears to be very possible. However, I’ve focused on trying to release something that will yield me large amounts of income, or rather dream of developing a similar thing to compensate for my situation. It’s obvious that with my way of thinking it’s not going to happen so I wonder how should I start to think?

I’ve started to play with the idea of developing apps for other people through either freelancing or funding a small company.  The problem is that I have no idea of how I would fund a small software company and have heard bad things about freelancing. So as the title states how do I remove my focus on making money, although it’s needed, and go for what I really want to do.

I'm a recent EE grad and I'm looking for some advice from those more experienced than myself.

I've been offered a 3 month internship with a small company, but I had a good second round interview with a larger company a few days ago, and the role pays more, has a longer contract, and generally seems like a position I will learn more from. However the deadline for accepting the internship i've been offered is basically immediate, and thus is before I will hear back from the larger company.

My question is this:
If I accept this internship, is it possible that the larger company, if they decide to make me an offer, would be willing to allow me to start 3 months from now so I could do the internship. 
The hiring process seems to be an ongoing thing, rather than a group hire of many grads at once. 

I really don't like the thought of accepting the internship and then quitting very shortly after if I get another offer. Burning bridges is never a good thing and they seem like a great company.
However I also would be very dissapointed if the other offer came through and I couldn't accept it.

Any advice is appreciated!"

First of all sorry for my bad english, it isn't my main language.  I'm a 3rd year Electrical Engineering student in Canada and I'm at the point in my degree where I have to find a research group and fill the required paperwork to get a grant, which is a pre-requisite for a lot of the research groups.

I'm interested in three groups in particular. The first one does digital signal processing, machine learning and deals with neural networks. The work would be math-heavy and mostly in Matlab. 

The second group works on control theory applied to the aerospace industry. The professor would give me a project that fits my interests, which would most likely end up in robust control theory.

The last group works on scanners for the medical industry. I'd mostly implement digital signal processing in a custom IC, which means I'd learn ASIC/FPGA design. 

If I'm 100% honest with myself I believe the first two research groups interest me a bit more, but the work is mostly math heavy and pretty much theoretical. The last group also interests me but it seems like learning ASIC/FPGA design would be a big plus when it comes to being employable later.

So far I had 4 internships (I'm in a COOP program) and mostly all of them have been C/C++/Python programming. I don't hate programming but I'd prefer working on stuff more related to pure EE. 

Does there exist such a thing as ""digital signal processing guru"" or ""control theory dude"" jobs? I feel like I'd end up finding a standard programmer job if I go with either of these two research groups. 

What would you guys do in my situation? Follow your interests 100% of go for a slightly less interesting topic that would actually end up being employable later?"

I am attempting to build a workbook for my internship that will calculate turnover costs. So far, the template is in place. The only thing that's stopping me from moving forward is a particular level of functionality I want it to have.

Specifically, I would like to have a cell where a user can input specific designated criteria such as a certain year, quarter, or month as well as a specific division, department, career level for the organization. For example, in cell 1 ""2014"" and in cell 2 ""Operations."" 

Doing so would have excel index a specific worksheet and then autofill specific cells with a turnover count that would be ""Individuals turned over in 2014 within the operations division."" 

I understand this will most likely involve some level of VBA macro, but I am wholly uninitiated with vba. I've also considered using access instead, but that's another learning process as well.

29yv42,0,2014-07-06,My story,robodylan123,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/29yv42/my_story/,"For those that have seen my other post: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/29vdeu/must_read_kids_cant_use_computers/. I am going to give you my side of the story. First let me try and better explain the others point as some of you seem to be confused. The thing is many adult think that our generation is tech savvy. He is saying that most kids have no idea how it works, just that it works. If something were to go wrong they would be lost and get upset, unable to fix the problem and run off to there parents or a repair shop for help. A tech savvy person is someone who understands, even if vaguely, how something works. I like the authors analogy of a car, most people know how to use a car. But, most people, if the car stops working, would be absolutely clueless. The author says you have no need to know how to fix it, but be able to understand what is wrong. It's also great not to be ripped off by repair shops, this is true for computers and automobiles. Another clarification is that the author is not saying that this needs to be fixed or is a problem. he is simple saying that many people don't understand how completely clueless their child is to technology. With that said, I am going to share my own personal story. I got my first computer when I was 11, after being selected to participate in a program run by RIT(Rochester Institute of Technology). Where we participated in a variety activities including the assembly of a computer, which is incredibly easy even though some think it takes a genius, learning what each thing did and how to install it. Taking it home I of course jumped right in, downloading games and browsing the internet. I of course, like any kid at the time, bought and downloaded Minecraft. Later learning that you could mod it, I downloaded MCP and watched tutorials on how to use it. At this point there were little no tutorials on how to actually how to make the mod, so I, using Eclipse, modified clearly marked variables, playerSpeed = 1, and doing things like playerSpeed = 5. Looking at the code I had a great understaning of how a program worked and eventually, after getting a book from the library, taught myself Java. Everyday I would get mod requests from classmates that wanted their own mod. Now I wanted to make my own game. I jumped around to every language possible, never being able to find a good tutorial on how too build a game from scratch. Eventually I found Python and an amazing eBooK, http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/. I made some very simple, and looking back very badly written, games. I then went on to learn about the ludum dare. My first contest went well, I learned tons, and actually published a game. Available Here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&amp;uid=30057. One of the things that I learned was that python is great, if you have it. Most people couldn't play the game and  it was very buggy. Also, I managed to make a friend from Germany, I was streaming my warmup coding and he jumped into the chat and we chatted eventaully connecting through skype. We talked for a couple hours and later throughout the ludum dare.Now, wanting to make game that anyone could play I looked into HTML5, Javascript(Canvas), and PHP. I saved up my money and went and bought a raspberry pi. http://www.raspberrypi.org/ I then installed raspian and setup a webserver following a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgcNBjIJNYs. I then watched some tutorials and read books about HTML and began making a website. I looked very blocked and colorful at first then I brought it done to just shades with a simplified look. It looked pretty good, if I do say myself. Then going back to my original plan I started making HTML5 games. Most weren't that good. My main problem and something I couldn't quite understand was how use objects and instances of an object. So most games just had a player and one enemy. I then started talking to my German Teacher, who I am greatly thankful for. We talked about making a website. So I went home and within a week I had a complete website on my hands. I started making a place for her to upload a gallery and added a part that generated JavaScript games. Soon I lost interest in the project and changed the website to my own personal one. Later in the year we were talking about having classes in the school for programming. She talked with some people and she helped setup Project Lead The Way and STEM in our school. The programs allow kids to get college credits and get internships in High School for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. She even set it up so I could teach a class in the MS, HTML5 and Javascript. The class was after school and only for a select of students. Coming up was the ludum dare and had no idea what language I was going to use. Talking to the kid in germany I decided to learn C#, which he used. Now this was only 3 days before the contest and I needed to learn it. I looked at tutorials but to avail. eventually the kid for Germany ended up teaching me. And then we had a great idea to join up and enter the Jam as a team. With the theme of Beneath the Surface. We spent many long hours. He did most of the code as I was still learning so I only wrote about a fifth of the code. The game out quite good and we published it. http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&amp;uid=30057 . Though there was some bad feedback the game was actually something and distributable. Since then I have made more games and programs. Which you can view atleast the source of on GitHub https://github.com/robodylan. Everything from Games, to a simple AI, to a DNA Visualizer. I am currently 14 and am entering HS this year. I am hoping to make something this summer. I am seeking to enter RIT, and Not just because their food is awesome! I hope someday I will be able to make a post about how this lead to me being some success story from a small town. My view is that programming is essential, not only for a job skill but also a life skill. learning how to do things efficiently and using problem solving skills.

I know certain video cards work better for gaming and some work better for doing my work. I want a balance that excels in both areas. If anyone has a spec list or some advice I'd appreciate it. The last time I did any sort of computer building was in high school 03' under the direction of my friend who the computer was for. The only thing I've had since then was a personal laptop cuz I'm from the hood and had no money so throwing in some safe ways to go about building would be extremely helpful. Please stay on topic. I know where everything goes but am ignorant to what's going to get the job done better than anything else.

Let me first explain that I’m currently on an apprenticeship (some of you may know this as an internship) I am 9 months into it (out of 12) and possibly have a job interview next week for IT Technician. I will be able to complete my apprenticeship if I am to get the job. 

The interview process requires me to submit a letter of interest for the job and I’m not sure how/what to write for it. As you may be able to tell my writing skills aren’t fantastic but I really want to impress and hopefully succeed and get the job. The application process needs to be completed in the next 2-3 days and there’s a possible 3 guys that are going to go for the job (all being apprentices like me). I applied for the same position about 4 months ago and lost out to another apprentice who is now qualified and working there full time. I really want this job, love working there and enjoy the environment a lot. But I have been working at another site for the last 8 months so I’m very new to this site so don’t know as much about this system as the other candidates so that puts me at an immediate disadvantage. 

As I am only an apprentice I am not qualified and don’t have many skills in IT but to all of my friends and family I’m known as the ‘IT guy’ and very good at trouble shooting etc. At home I have built computers and we now have a full automated Plex media server running and also a full CCTV set up running. I have good knowledge of Android OS but I know this isn’t useful at work. At work I use programs such as Active Directory a lot, veeam, PXE (imaging) and other programs.
If anyone has any tips/advice for me for my application letter or interview I’d really appreciate that.

Edit 1: I work in a school.

TL:DR - Applying for IT Tech job, currently an apprentice, need to write an application letter for the job + need advice for my interview. 

Thanks

I first got into python about two years ago after having to make a very small task automate itself in ArcGIS. I recently figured that it might be a good skill to have to further my career as many departments of my internship company are using this.

At the moment, just for fun and learning, I'm trying to build a small application using wxPython and postgresqlite to save information about cars. I previously used a SQLite file as my way of storage, but wanting to learn more complex things (allowing multiple computers in the house to get information from one database) a friend recommended I try postgresql and so far I've been able to transfer the code from the sqlite database with no trouble. I definitely see many useful tutorials out in the web and would like to know if you have found certain pages useful or have any recommendations for me?

It's 2001/2002, I was in High School. My school had normal high school (HS) in the morning and the afternoons were dedicated to a ""technical school"" (TS) which high school students could do in parallel with HS. I did the IT TS and we used the only computer lab that the school had: a room with some 40 PCs with windows 98 at the time. This lab was used by each class (from 1st grade until the end of high school) one time per week for computer-related activities.

As part of the mandatory internship for the TS, a couple colleagues and I were responsible for the maintenance of this lab, under the supervision of an IT teacher.

One morning a 5th grade teacher comes bursting to my class (the high school class closest to the lab) asking for anyone from the IT TS:
&gt; Teacher: I need to know what the IT TS people did to break the computer!  

I immediately stand up and say that I'm from the TS and I'm one of the maintenance interns, she shouts some thing like
&gt; Teacher: COME WITH ME, you guys *misconfigured* the computers and now we can't do anything  
&gt; Me, (*to my self*): This is going to be good!

We go up the staris to the room full of clueless 5th graders.
&gt; Me: What are you trying to do and what happens when you try it?  
&gt; Teacher: We are trying to write an essay about our neighborhood and you did something with the computer that does not allow us to do.  
&gt; Me: What *happens*  when you try? Can you try in front of me?

And she opens IE, browses to some geocities-like webpage about the neighborhood and tries to copy the text. Instead, a javascript  dialog box appears saying stuff like: ""You can't copy from this webpage"".

&gt; Me: It's not us, it's the webpage author. He added a script that prevents right clicking.  
&gt; Teacher: Why did you do that?  
&gt; Me: We didn't.

Then I proceed to show the page source with the javascript code and teach her to do the left+right click trick.

When i come back to the class, everyone (specially the TS people) is looking at me with a big question mark on their faces, to which I reply with
&gt; Me: She doesn't know javascript.

Laghter ensues.

I'm looking for some advice about an internship I accepted for the Summer, and any kind of advice or perspective you guys can offer would be much appreciated.

I am a 20 year old girl, and I am bilingual, speaking Mandarin Chinese and English. I am currently a Double Major at a prestigious university in Canada who gets decent (although not perfect) grades and participates in extracurricular activities. As I am a Chinese major, I decided to look for an internship on the mainland, and with months of work I finally found one.

The internship sounded great, it was a company I was familiar with, fortune 500 and in the MedTech industry. I had even had a successful internship with them two years ago, after I graduated from high school. When they signed me they agreed to pay for my plane tickets to and from China, and a small daily stipend for food. I wasn't so happy about the pay, but I was thrilled to be working for them again and couldn't wait to be back in China practicing my Chinese in a local environment.

Then, the trouble started. On my first day of work, a date they had given to me, my supervisor seemed incredibly surprised to see me. However, I was given a task: learn all about the company's products, and I happily plodded away on my computer through both the Chinese and English versions of their website. The next week, I was told to work from home and that I would be receiving emails as to some new projects to work on, as my supervisor would be on a business trip in Macau. I was unfazed, but as the week dragged on I didn't receive a single email as to what I should be doing. When my boss got back, there was no mention of more work. I continued to browse their website, finally reading both the user and medical manuals (hundreds of pages each) for nearly every product on our line. I have completely exhausted the website. 

Since then, I have been in limbo. I have not received a new project to work on. My boss has invited me to attend 3 meetings, for which I have been asked to take minutes twice, and have only been given prior notice once. I have also booked him one set of flights for another business trip and an currently corresponding with a colleague of his in the states to set up a business dinner. This is close to 6 hours of work total since the ""research"". I have been here for over a month.

I only just received my work computer (before I was expected to bring my own on my hour and a half long subway commute) and email last week, and I still have no card to get into the building, so I have to wait for my colleagues to let me in, which makes for a large problem because only 20 people work in this office and the bathrooms are located outside. I literally have to wait for someone to let me back into the office if I wish to go out to use the restroom. I don't know what to do. I feel as though I am not being treated fairly by my manager (I have no problem with the company, they are very good at what they do and two years ago I was completely enamored with the corporate culture). I have asked him to increase my workload twice now, and each time he promises that there will be and there isn't. I am very frustrated and am starting to feel as though this won't even look good on my resume, because I don't have anything to tell future employers that I worked on. I am just trying to get the most out of my summer, but I traveled very far for this internship and am incredibly disappointed that I am living as far away from my family as is possible and having my time wasted. If I knew this internship was empty words I wouldn't have upset my mother so much by running off for the few months she gets to see me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you,

I've been looking for a placement (or internship) for over 6 months now and been to quite a few interviews and they felt like they went really good but none of the companies took me on board. By saying that the interviews went good I'm meaning that it's my personal opinion plus the interviewers seemed like they were happy with my performance during the interview (that's just my personal opinion as well). 




I've been to a careers centre in my uni (they help people prepare for interviews, give you tips regarding your CV and covering letter) and the various people that I've had meetings with said that my CV looks sharp and the covering letter's great.

I'm all for the regular commitments and affairs that the reserves involves, however I found out that after some time I would have to go do full-time training at a camp right after my second year for 2 months.   

I'm conflicted as to whether I should still join the reserves or apply for internships. If I work as an intern it would help with job prospects in the future (while you pretty much get paid to learn which is awesome). If I were to join the reserves I get to do other things I want to do, but it feels like I would be sacrificing my career potential. I can't think of places that would hire students for just two months.  

Would joining the reserves still be a good idea? Or, would my time be better spent in a software development position. I guess I'm just looking for some advice."

As currently I am the only person doing IT and software development at this company, which was supposed to be an entry level job.

&amp;nbsp;


**Preface**

___

At my current job I currently have many duties ranging from whatever software development is required, to solving issues my co-workers have with their computers. 

Some time before I was hired here full-time, and even before I was a lowly intern at the company my boss decided they were going to develop some software. Along they went, hiring a contractor whom I later would work alongside on this project. The project's goal, to be an all encompassing solution to an outpatient Substance Abuse and Drug addiction center.

Over time, the constant changing of requirements,requests for new features and lack of feedback from my boss led the contractor to quit. By this time I had been working on the project for a while, and it began to seem like the project was barely held together like a house made of duct tape and twigs. Each repair done to a bug would lead to nearly 2 more tasks to be necessary.

&amp;nbsp;


___

**The Hydra Releases its Wrath**
___

Today it seems, the duct tape beast from development hell finally released  its wrath. I walk in to work this morning, immediately being called over by one of the clinicians that my boss forces to use this software while it's mid development, for work. The clinician can't access any client's chart. This being interesting, as no updates had been released as things planned for the next update were still being implemented. As well it was reproducible on multiple machines, and even the copy I had been working with on the development machine I use.

After speaking to the old contractor, as the new one my boss found, wasn't brought on to replace the old one as a senior developer (yet the deadline that was estimated to be 6 months with a new senior dev + myself, was changed to 1 month forcibly by my boss), thus they weren't of any use. I learned a bulk of the issues came from a custom binary library used for quick simple SQL queries. There seemingly no reason for this one function used all over the project to be giving issues unless being done asynchronously. So today, and continuing after I type this up, I am stuck fixing wherever the library is giving issues. Which is basically the whole project at this point.

tl;dr Project from development hell with bugs that act like a hydra releases its wrath, breaking every feature in the software.

I am currently in school and pursuing a bachelors in computer science.

I applied for an internship at a small local web dev company (about 70 employees) who uses mostly php, javascript, html and css to build all their projects.  They liked my resume and sent me a series of 9 online tests, most of which were php, 1 javascript, 1 html, 1 css, 1 linux.  I scored roughly 76% to 82% on each exam except for linux, css and html.  I got a 43% on linux, 67% on css and html. I know html and css pretty well I thought but the questions they were asking on the exam were for some pretty obscure tags.  A lot of the questions were about handling audio and video files which I rarely have a need to embed and when I do I just look up a quick reference.  

**TLDR:** So I am not a master web developer, but I think I am decent enough to get by and figure things out.  Well I got denied after I took some online php,css,html,javascript exams and the company said I was unqualified at the time based on my scores (76%-80%).

EDIT: 

Cover letter I wrote to address the specific points of this position. I welcome your feedback to what I wrote.

&gt; Dear the team at SAP.
&gt; 
&gt;    My name is HoldCToCrouch. I am a pre-Junior pursuing a Bachelor Science degree in Computer Engineering with a minor concentration of Computer Science at Some School. I read with interest the job posting on the SAP Jobs website for a software developer-in-test internship at Vancouver, BC. Please accept this letter and the enclosed resume as my application for a six month internship for this position.
&gt; 
&gt;    As a Computer Engineering student of Some School, I have solid knowledge of a variety of programming languages such as Java and C#, as well as a year of practical experiences in the software development industry. During my cooperative education, the tasks handled by me included successfully researching, developing and testing several Grasshopper 3D components using C# for the firm’s architects; in fact, I had to devise creative ways to unit test the graphical programming elements, uncommon with what is typical of a software developer. 
&gt;
&gt;   When I found myself hitting the limit of my and the Research Group’s knowledge on this project, I reached out and engaged the head developer of Grasshopper 3D through the forum and e-mail. In addition, I found that my problem-solving skills and the initiative to learn new skills were enhanced by working as part of a multidisciplinary team and by considering other people’s ideas and needs.
&gt; 
&gt;    SAP is an international leader in developing enterprise and business objects software, while at the same time helping companies of all sizes and industries by providing solutions in the front-end and the back-end, desktop to mobile devices. The qualities of this position at SAP - the opportunity to challenge myself with a role that combines development with testing, and to be able to work with testers and developers to find creative ways to hack, break, demolish, and rebuild a piece of software, appeals to me greatly.

My girlfriend suffers from anxiety and has episodes of depression (nothing terrible, but it's something I have to be careful about). Anyway, today Debbie went all out and made my girlfriend cry, all while she was saying things like 'should I find you a mental hospital, lemme ask siri' and 'I'm sorry you feel this way (in an exaggerated voice)'. I decided enough is enough, her parents wont do anything about it, or she will do it when they aren't around. Even if something is said about it, she will always turn it around for it to be her fault. I sent her a lengthy text saying how she needs to cut out this behavior and stop causing stress for the family. She immediately shows her parents and now they are mad at my girlfriend and I. I know I shouldn't have done it, but at the time I was so frustrated and felt I had to do something. I don't know what to do. Do I apologize to her parents or let it go? Keep in mind these will be my Parent-in-laws. I am home in about 17 days and will be seeing them then. I am very nervous as to what may happen. Please help me out Reddit, I am desperate to fix this.

So, a little background on myself. I am a upcoming Senior. I have about a 3 semesters until graduation. 

My goal is to get into non-profit work. The jobs I am looking to get are Director of Community Programs and eventually Executive Director. 

I am currently looking at different non profits, trying to choose which one to work for. I hypothesize that my position will be non paid, as most internships that I have seen are. I still need money to get to and from work. 

I want to work with someone higher up, and intern for the for money on the weekends. How do I go about asking them this? 

OR

What is the weekend job to get that leads to an actual career? Mind you, this job would only be on the weekends. I would be interning for free during the week, and would prefer to be working at something which also gets me to my goal during the weekend. I can't do another food service job. It is depressing to stand in a room knowing it is not getting you anywhere. 

My reason for using these two different approaches is that both can lead to a secure career. 

So things I am looking for. 

Weekend Job
Paid
Has future or Gives skills to create a future. 
Or, advice on how to contact people for this job. 

Below are some of the qualifications which are needed for my career goals. 

Broad understanding of business financial matters, including planning and budgeting, accounting systems and controls, financial reporting and analysis.

Experience in successful nonprofit development, fundraising and planned giving campaigns.

Demonstrated success in managing, motivating and developing office and maintenance staff.

Experience in facility administration, outside contracting for services, and negotiations with vendors, contractors and governmental agencies."

I was instructed by my IT manager to implement MAC address filtering on the wifi. So I sent out a memo to everyone telling them this with instructions on how to get the MAC address and to give it to me. I then left work early for a doctors appointment, turns out after I left someone in billing told everyone that using that address I can ""hack into your phone and steal your banking information and emails"".

Rumors spread and now everyone thinks all their stuff is hacked.

UPDATE: She played it off today saying she was joking when confronted and then gave me her MAC address. But I heard from someone else in the office that she was still saying that later on in the day. I pretty much calmed everyone down and explained what it actually is. My IT manager had a good laugh about it. Also I'm aware MAC filtering alone isn't good security but we're using it in combination with other methods. We just need it to keep certain devices off the network from employees and none of the employees would even know how to spoof a MAC address.

2a48zq,5,2014-07-08,I'm sick of this podunk little white trash town. I'm sick of retail and being treated like trash. I see no way out of here and I feel like I'm going to die in this place.,i_poop_more_than_u,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2a48zq/im_sick_of_this_podunk_little_white_trash_town_im/,"I moved to this shithole because I had nowhere else to go. I was suicidal then with no home, with my mother constantly berratting me about money, on a cocktail of various medications. I dropped out of college and my friend let me move into her mother's house in a trashy little farming community with no jobs. I stayed there a year and slowly managed to work most of my shit out, but now shit is hitting the fan. 

I loved my career. It was the only place I've been happy in the last 6 years of my life. I had a 6 month unpaid internship working for a game company in Seattle. I'd come in sometimes before anyone else in the office, and there were multiple times I stayed way after everyone else had gone home. Even unpaid, if I could have continued to work there for the rest of my life I'd be happy. 

I want to get back to that. It was the one thing that really made me happy, the one thing I miss out of all the experiences in my life. But it's been over a year since I've done work in that field. My portfolio is out of date and no one wants to hire someone who lives 4 hours away in a farming town when they can get people locally. There are no jobs even remotely resembling anything I have experience in here. Even going to my therapist and trying to get a job gives a resounding ""go work at safeway"". I'm so fucking sick of retail. Day in day out with me getting the minimum wage sitting there at home looking at my cash that's barely enough to pay rent and I wonder what the fuck am I doing?

A man shot himself behind my work a couple weeks ago. Stuck a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger, blew his brains all over the car. The only thing anyone said about it at work was ""how sad, that he had nowhere else to go but to shoot himself behind a goddamn &lt;retail store name&gt;.""

All I can think is how sad, all I have to look forward to in life is a god damned retail store. 

I've been turned away for not having enough ""experience"" to work in an office. I've been told I can't ""cherry pick"" my jobs just because I went to college for a couple years. I got called pretentious because I said I wanted to try to get an office job somewhere. 

I even though maybe I'll try and power through my degree. Maybe I'll get an internship again. Maybe I can go back. Now I'm being told I can't go back to school because I have no one willing to cosign loans for me. I'm 3 quarters from graduating and I'm told that I'm fucked because I dropped out ""at the wrong time"" as if I could fucking choose when I was standing on the roof of my apartment complex wondering how badly it would hurt if my skull fractured on the pavement below. 

Am I stuck here forever? In this shithole of a town? Where I was asked ""what for?"" by a therapist when I said I wanted to change genders. Where I was asked by a mental health professional if ""LGBT"" was a type of sandwhich. Where I had a man in my workplace terrorize me because I wasn't a teapartier. Where everyone undermines everyone else and my IQ drops by  25 points every time someone tries to talk to me about how they are having their 3 child with their abusive husband who was convicted as a child molestor. But I'm pretentious if I get excited about a movie with good special effects because god forbid I talk about the thing I wanted a career in.

I used to tell myself I'd kill myself if I didn't have my career, because the rest of the world was such a fucking shitty place. Now I'm being told that I fucked up my life at the age of 23 and can't even finish what I started. The very idea of going on another day in this place makes me sick to my stomach. If I wasn't living with my best friend and the only person I care about in the world, I'd have already spent my last paycheck on a gun so I could go out behind my work and make it a two for one special."
2a4fi1,27,2014-07-08,There is something wrong on my street.,sidewalkend,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2a4fi1/there_is_something_wrong_on_my_street/,"There is something wrong on my street. Things have been off for a while now but it was only recently that things have gone from “Strange but Fairly Harmless” to “Fearing for my Life.” I just want to get my story out there so that, when something happens to me, there is some available record (no matter how unbelievable) of what has transpired.


To be quite honest I want to get this over with as soon as possible, as I’m paranoid enough as it is, but I figure it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t take a moment to jot down some quick back story. My roommate, Laurie, and I moved into our apartment about seven months ago, at the beginning of our college’s “spring” semester. We chose the apartment because we had friends already living in the neighborhood (a street over from our apartment) who had nothing but good things to say about the area. Of course, being college students, we were just happy that the rent was cheap ($250 per person per month with all utilities included, can you believe that?!!) and the location was close to the college. 


Anyways, Laurie was going to be a senior next year so she was all stressed out studying for grad school admissions and signing up for internships and things like that, so I got into the habit of walking a street over to hang with our friends at their place. The only downside of this was that most of the time I stayed at their place until night fell (and where I live this happens very early, especially in the winter) and so to get back to my place I had to walk back in the darkness. Obviously as a young woman in a fairly poor neighborhood I had my share of worries about this. It’s kind of funny because, out of all the various terrifying scenarios I had imagined (rape, murder, etc.) the one that actually ended up happening was something more horrifying than I ever could’ve imagined. But I got over my fears and most nights I ran home as fast as I could, mace in one hand, keys tucked between the knuckles of the other. 



It was during these late-night dashes home that I noticed the first strange thing about my street- there are no streetlights. It is very strange. My street is in a well-populated neighborhood and, in fact, comes right off of the main street going through the (small) city in which it is located. The streets on either side of it have streetlights, as do the streets intersecting with it, so it would make sense for us to also have streetlights, but alas, there isn’t a single light on my street. No porch lights either. There isn’t even light coming from the windows of the various houses and apartment complexes, including our own. I found this particularly strange because I would look up at the windows of our apartment as I was coming down the street and I would see that the lights were off but as I entered our complex and made my way up the sloping steps to our third-floor apartment I would realize that our lights were indeed on. For some reason I didn’t really register this with anything beyond mild curiosity. I mean, every street has its quirks. Maybe our street wasn’t publicly owned due to some long ago land settlement or something. I didn’t really think about it too hard, and maybe I should’ve.



I noticed the second strange thing about a month after we moved in. My friends had come over to my place for a change and we were all drinking and playing truth or dare (perhaps a little childish for college students, but we aren’t exactly the most mature bunch around). After a bunch of the typical truths and dares (do a strip tease, crank call your grandma, talk about your crush, etc.) Laurie dared me to go to our neighbors and ask for a cup of sugar. Thinking back on it now that dare was stupid as all hell but at the time we found it genius and couldn’t stop laughing. “Who actually asks their neighbor for a cup of sugar?” Laurie slurred, “I mean like it’s a stereotype and all but how many people do you know who have actually ever asked their neighbor for a cup of sugar.” (If you know anyone please let me know) Anyways, I (rather unsteadily) got to my feet and made my way down to the apartment below us, on the second floor. I knocked for about a half hour (at least it felt that way, anyone who has been drunk before knows that after a certain point time takes on a funny sort of quality) and when no one answered I made my way up the stairs and reported back to my eager drunken friends that no one was home. 



Well, of course, they wouldn’t take that. “Go to the next one!” They urged. “And if no one is there, move to a different building!” They were really hyped up on this dare at this point (and to be totally honest so was I) and told me they would not let me in unless I had a cup of sugar to show for my efforts. So I went to the first floor, knocked, and got no reply. I was determined to see this dare through so I went to the apartment building to the left of ours and rang every single doorbell. Nothing. So I moved over to the house across the street from the apartment building to the left of ours and knocked and hollered and banged on all the windows. Still nothing. I honestly do not remember how many buildings I assaulted in this fashion but I was at it until the sun began peeking over the horizon and I began sobering up and realizing that I was tired and nauseous and 150% done with this dare. And thus I made my way home to an apartment full of passed out friends and empty beer cans and pizza boxes. 



Actually, now that I mention the pizza boxes I’ve suddenly remembered something else. We have never been able to get a pizza delivered to our apartment. Not once. The drivers either get lost, despite our best directions, or just never show up, leaving behind no record that we had ever tried to order pizza. So I have no clue where the pizza came from that night. Maybe my friends had got it delivered to their place? Maybe they drove to get it before becoming intoxicated? I have no clue, but one thing for sure is that it was definitely not delivered to our place. 


So far everything I’ve shared has been pretty mild. I mean, yeah, all this stuff was pretty weird, but there was never any indication to me, or to Laurie that our lives were in any danger. So when the first scary thing happened I honestly did not see it coming.  



It was four months ago, three months after we moved in. I was doing my nightly dash-home-from-my-friends’-place when suddenly I was lost. I mean honest to goodness, lost. It is a quick route from my friends’ place to our place- walk down half a block to the main street, take the next right onto our street, pass two houses and one apartment complex and you arrive at our place. I had done it dozens (maybe even one hundred? I don’t know, I’m too lazy to do the math) of times. It was pure muscle memory but somehow I managed to fuck it up. 


It was a clear night with one of those moons that looks full but isn’t actually full and you can’t tell why you know this because it really does look full, but for some reason you can tell that it isn’t. So I could see a little bit. And I knew it definitely had to be my street because my street is the only street in the whole city that doesn’t have streetlights. But for the life of me I could not find my apartment building. Not only that, but none of the buildings around me looked familiar. There were no numbers, no mailboxes, no gardens or lawn decorations, nothing to distinguish one building from the next.



I tried walking until I found an intersecting street in the hopes that I could reorient myself to where I was (by this point I knew the neighborhood and surrounding areas pretty well) but I never came upon one. This was probably the strangest thing. I ran, and then jogged, and then walked for what must’ve been miles and miles. I counted hundreds and hundreds of indistinguishable houses with no end in sight, the moon staying straight above my head the whole time. Eventually my legs gave out. If you’ve never exhausted a muscle to the point of total fatigue- it is really something. No matter how much effort you put in there is no chance of moving for a while. So at that point I gave up, laid down on one of the identical front lawns, and fell asleep. 



When I woke up I was on the lawn of my apartment building. I thought that maybe it had been a dream. Maybe I had passed out from exhaustion right on the doorstep of my apartment and dreamt what had happened. Then I tried to stand up. You know the scene in Bambi where he learns to walk? That’s how I felt. I gritted my teeth through the pain and stumbled through the front door and called up the stairs for Laurie to help me. After getting no response I figured she must have left early for her class and so I began the grueling task of dragging myself up three flights of stairs to my apartment. 



It took a herculean effort but I finally made my way inside of my apartment and what I found enraged me. Laurie had been there all along! I completely lost my shit. “WHY DIDN’T YOU COME HELP ME!” and “PULL YOUR TITS OUT OF YOUR EARS AND LISTEN TO ME YOU BITCH” and a bunch of other increasingly angry and nonsensical things. She adamantly claimed that she did not hear me and, in fact, did not even notice I had not made it back last night. She mumbled about exhaustion and stress and about how no matter how hard she studied she couldn’t remember anything.



I was way too angry to listen to, or consider, any of this and so I limp-crawled my way to my bedroom and collapsed onto my bed. I think maybe if we hadn’t fought (If I hadn’t gotten so angry) things might have turned out differently. I’m trying not to dwell on it though, because it brings me to a dark place.


And so a rift grew between Laurie and myself. We talked less and less and she spent more and more time in her room. The times I saw Laurie grew further and farther between. Two months passed like this until Scary Thing Number Two happened.



Two months ago I woke in the middle of the night to Laurie screaming. It is a miracle I woke up at all because the screaming was far off, like she was out on the street. Sure enough, she wasn’t in her room or the bathroom or the living room or the kitchen. I ran out into the street to look for her because, fighting or not, she was still one of my closest friends. The moon was the same as it had been that first night- full, but not really full. I stood on the street and called out to Laurie. It was strange because, no matter how loud I screamed, my voice sounded hollow and subdued- no echo and definitely not as loud as it should’ve been considering the deadly silence of the street.



After about the third or fourth time I called out for her I heard Laurie scream again. Even though I thought I had gotten closer to her, her screaming sounded just as faraway as it had in my bedroom. Still, I ran in the direction that I thought it was coming from. I ran and ran and ran and every time she screamed it sounded no louder and no quieter. Even worse, after pausing for a moment to catch my breath, I realized I was lost again- in exactly the same way as before. 



Actually, it wasn’t exactly the same. Although before my street was wide enough for two cars to drive on, on that night the houses were closer together, and the street was narrow- only big enough for one car at a time (had there been any cars, which, of course there wasn’t). After hours of fruitless searching I tried to lay down in one of the front yards and fall asleep but this was hard because I could still periodically hear Laurie’s screaming. I lay awake looking straight up at the full-but-not-full moon that never moved from its spot dead center in the sky. I don’t know if it was hours or days later (I had taken to telling the time by Laurie’s screaming- it had been 347 screams by this point) but eventually I fell asleep. 



This time I woke up inside the entryway of my apartment building. I don’t know if that has any meaning. I don’t know what has or does not have meaning anymore, but that is the way it happened. I ran up to my apartment and went straight into Laurie’s room. At least, that was my plan but when I got inside I found that the room that had been hers was completely empty.



It seems like I always end up furious at Laurie after these weird getting-lost spells. This time I was angry because I thought she had moved out and played some weird prank on me. I was so angry that I marched right over to my friends-one-street-over and launched into a rant immediately as I walked through the door. And that is when one of the scariest things of all happened.


As I was going on and on about Laurie and her selfishness and her departure and her pranks my friends watched with concerned faces. When I took a breath one of them put their hand on my arm and asked me “Who is Laurie?” 



I thought that they had to be in on this. I mean how could they have forgotten Laurie who had been our friend for years and who they had seen mere weeks ago. I frantically swiped through the photo gallery on my phone trying to find a picture for evidence but there were none. After I realized the fear and concern in my friends’ eyes was real I played it off as a practical joke and ran back home. 


Last month I “got lost” again. It was pretty much the same as before but now the street was about the width of a sidewalk. And this time instead of chasing I was being chased. I screamed for help- again and again, but nobody came. I couldn’t help but wonder if I was about to meet the same fate as Laurie- and if this was how she felt in her final moments. I think that whatever it was got me, but my memories are really hazy. All I remember is falling and pain and a moon that isn’t quite full. I woke up outside the door to my apartment.



It isn’t just my memories of collapsing that are leaving me. While the events of the past few months are as vivid as though they happened yesterday, I am losing more and more of my childhood. I lose more and more each day. My earliest memory now is from when I was seventeen. I can’t remember my mother’s name or my birthday. I don’t know if I have any siblings. I don’t know where I was born. 



Last night was the most recent time I got lost. The houses were so close that I had to edge my way sideways to move forward. I don’t know why I even decided to move forward. For some reason it felt safer than staying put. Things were lurking in the shadows. I kept catching glimpses of them out of the corners of my eyes- dark and writhing and like nothing I had ever seen before. I considered entering a house but the darkness inside was pressurized and I knew that if I tried to open a door or window everything would explode and I would drown in the dusty shadows that kept threatening to spill out from the chimneys and mail flaps and from behind the not-full moon. I woke up in my bed. 



I don’t know if this is all a delusion or a prank or what but I am scared and I fear that I may not have much time left. I don’t know who I am anymore but all that remains within me is the desire to not be forgotten. Please don’t forget about me. I don’t know where I am or where I am going or what is happening but strangely enough my biggest fear is that my existence will be wiped clean from this planet. Please remember me. And please spread the word: There is something wrong on my street.

2a593p,3,2014-07-08,Sit down with boss on compensation or start looking for a new job?,DeveloperDrew,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2a593p/sit_down_with_boss_on_compensation_or_start/,"I am thinking more and more about moving on from my current job.  There are 2 main components to why I think I should at least have a discussion with my boss:

1.  Compensation.  I have almost 8 years of experience, a proven track record and I even will be heading my own little Frontend team soon.  My boss has said on multiple occasions that I am the best dev he has worked with.  All that and I am only being paid about 54k a year.  Before my last raise I was making about 46k.  
2.  I have to teach myself everything.  Everything I learned about new technologies, new methodologies and new tools I have had to teach myself. I have done this by asking people, reading, going to user group meetings and conferences and through good old trial and error.  I worry that I am losing the ability to be part of a team or take direction from others.  

The reason I stayed up to about a year ago is a family matter and I wanted to be close to help.  Thankfully that is no longer the case and a move to another state would be okay.  The reasons I now stay come down to pretty much one thing:  my coworkers and my boss.  I have been the main developer for 4 years at my company (probably 80% of the development gets done by me right now) so leaving my current position would not only cause a potentially big problem for my company, but certain clients might have a problem with it too (no legal issues with me leaving just a big loss of knowledge for my company).  I would also worry that I am screwing over guys I consider friends outside of work by damaging the company.  

I am leaning towards a sit down with my boss about developer compensation (mine and my intern's if he decides to stay on).  I know I can make a lot more money elsewhere, but I am not sure my boss knows that.  I got an offer 3 years ago for 65k, but the job description sounded crappy, plus Google has been reaching out to me, although I figure Mountain View is a long shot.  This is part my fault for not pushing harder on my boss.  

I had a sit down with my boss last year about compensation, but while I got about an 8k raise, I don't think he got the message that I have been very underpaid for most of my career.  I think I should tell him I need a pay bump to something I could plausibly get out in the market (at least 70k plus bonus by my research and asking on this subreddit) and work with him to figure out a respectable offer for my intern should he decide to stay on.  

Any input is appreciated!"

I'll make 1 post every day during the work week for this series, so stay tuned for some pretty great stories, some sobs for stupidity, and some rage at relentless attempts to destroy my poor, poor computers :(


Let's start with the basics I suppose. I'm Carl, CarlTHEELlama, or CTL for short, chances are I'll never use that short form though. I'm the 'Vice Sub Manager' or something like that, can't remember all the stupid titles everyone gets. My job is to sit in a chair, tell people what to do sometimes, browse reddit often, and occasionally take calls and emails on the helpdesk from other employees, mainly all the weird / unbelievably dumb ones. 



I have a few Sub-Sub Employees (some sort of weird fucken tree system going on for these naming conventions, i think) in the IT Dept, not too many, as followed (with a little background info) :

Brainiac: Smart beyond belief, only in his late 20's, generally always knows the best way to do things but lacks motivation to do them, is much happier being left out of group projects. Majorly dislikes all other co-workers, minus myself and HeadSubManager or HSM (will use this one a lot).


Slowpoke: Always behind the curve, mid 50's, knows a little about a lot, but not a lot about pretty much anything besides when to be here and when to leave. Nice guy in general, our most senior employee, but somewhat lacking in brain cells what he makes up for in effort given.


Intern: For all intents and purposes, he's an intern. We treat him nicely for the most part, but he is an intern, and generally just sits near me and shadows what i do until i get annoyed or busy, then he goes and shreds paper in the corner.


NewGuy: An early 40's guy who I just hired, not great, but not useless either, more of a meat shield in case of zombie apocalypse kind of guy, since I like my other employees, but he's alright. He knows some stuff, most not relevant to what we do here, but he's a sort of normal paced learner, and he's great at taking the heat from the executives.


HeadSubManager: Quiet, keeps to himself mostly, really just deals with executives, tells me what they want, I relay it to the small task force of programmers / network assistants. That's really all I know about him other than his name, which I'll keep private.


Anyway, so we all work for company AutoProblem, which is fairly accurate because we always have problems here. If the network isn't down, it's either slow, or someone is pissing in the server room to make it go down soon. If a computer is slow, it's usually infected with more viruses than how many blinks you've done since birth. If the power goes it, I guarantee nobody hit the save button once while working on those super important reports for profits and margins, or made a backup, and then lost everything. It's always something around here. 


Welcome to the Helpdesk Blues Series."

2a5nq8,6,2014-07-08,[Advice] How much is too much to spend on rent?,frugaltoronto,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/2a5nq8/advice_how_much_is_too_much_to_spend_on_rent/,"I recently graduated college and took up a job that pays 50k + bonus. Let's leave bonus aside. From what I've read I need to be spending 50% of my salary on essentials (housing and food), 30% on lifestyle and 20% on finance.

Apparently that 20% includes loan payments and stuff, so what does the person actually save? 10% ? 5% ? 

I am not saying that I am going to be doing the exact same thing. Thanks to my Indian heritage and a well paying internship I cleared my student loan before graduation. I have around 3k in credit card debts which I am going to pay off in the next 2 months before I even start living properly.

After years of living the frugal life I really wanted to start living well. I will be taking home 3.2 k after deductions. Is spending 1000  on living expenses a lot ? (Rent, Internet, Phone, Metropass). I generally spend 200 on groceries and another 200-300 on lifestyle. Around 1500 or so in total living expenses with 1600 in savings. 

Is this good enough savings? I want to save enough so that when I decide to go to grad school in 3 years I have money to fall back on. 

My question is that for someone whos taking home 3.2 k a month is 1000 a lot to spend on living expenses without food?"

I am in dilemma. Currently, I decided to learn Rails and nothing else, it is interesting and takes a lot of effort to learn well. However, two months ago I had a workshop with local start-up that gives out small tasks to students and we will get paid on completion of the task, they give us some mentoring as much as they can and will have a lot of work in DJANGO in the future. The problem is that I cannot learn both. I have full time internship and I try to learn Rails in the evenings but the offer that was proposed by the start up guy seems good especially when they offer code reviews. 

I was also told that Django is gaining a lot of popularity and the guy from startup advised me to choose Django over Rails because that is what he's done and he's glad he did. 

What do you think? I ask because I really do not have time to learn both."

2a6adh,3,2014-07-08,Difficulty focusing when reading documentation and other people's code.,orelon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2a6adh/difficulty_focusing_when_reading_documentation/,"At my internship, I've noticed that I seem to have trouble concentrating when I'm reading through other people's code, or even documentation. It's like my eyes glaze over the words blankly and my mind doesn't retain anything. I find myself re-reading the same things over and over, and I even tried installing a Chrome addon that makes things (supposedly) easier to read.

This is an issue for me during the semester, too. I've managed to maintain a high gpa (~3.8), but it's only through practice and repeatedly reading the same sentences until my brain decides to accept the information.

Does anyone else have this issue? I originally tried just drinking some coffee, and it helps sometimes, but other times not so much. I've found that my most productive hours are late at night. For some reason, if I take my work home with me (or study) late at night (say, 10PM-2AM), I will be able to concentrate very well.

Any suggestions?"
2a6bti,1,2014-07-08,Volunteering to gain experience? Input please,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2a6bti/volunteering_to_gain_experience_input_please/,"Hey folks. I'm a BSME who just passed the one year mark working for a relatively large EPC firm (first year out of college complete!). For foolish reasons, in college I didn't pursue a career in the field that I'm truly passionate about. Instead I chose the “safe"" option, snatching up my first offer given to me, for the job I had interned the previous summer (an extremely regrettable and idiotic decision on my part). It took me little time to realize my mistake, but I told myself I would give it a year, because attempting to leave sooner would have likely been seen as a red flag. In the meantime, I've busted my ass studying to become a CEM (certified energy manager).  For those that aren't familiar, it's a very respected and valuable certification in the field of energy efficiency. The job market for CEMs is excellent. They're in very high demand and aren't easy to find. Since my senior year of college I've known this is what I *really* want to do career-wise.

Along with my desire to change career paths, I’ve also been going through a heavy load of personal problems.  No need to go into detail, but the problems have become such a burden that I absolutely need to take a temporary break from working full time, somewhere from 4-6 months off.    It may sound risky to some, I’m sure, but I have full confidence in my abilities as an engineer.  I have no doubt that I’ll be able to find a job and excel at it, when the time comes.  My reasons for taking off work are personal and not professional. 

So the obvious thing to do would be to start applying and interviewing for jobs.  The reason I hesitate to do so is because I think it’s going to be near impossible to get an employer to push back my start date by several months.  Correct me if I’m wrong on this.  It just seems like a slightly offensive thing to ask of a new employer.

I’m leaning towards reaching out to smaller companies overseas and asking for a shert-term apprentice/volunteer position performing facility energy audits.  I’ve been able to find several companies online that sound like great fits, located in Southeast Asia and South America.  This would be appealing to me for a couple reasons. I’d have flexibility with the start date and with working hours to be able to safely take the time off from work that I desperately need to take.  I’d have the opportunity to live overseas, which I’ve always wanted to do (never studied abroad in college, d’oh!), without feeling stuck.  I’d gain some extremely useful and relevant hands-on skills (energy auditing), things that employers will want applicants to have and things that will help me be successful in my career  After, say, 4 months of volunteering, I could decide to go back to the U.S. and get a full time job, or I could choose to  work full time at the place I was volunteering, if I end up loving it there.  The flexibility that this option offers is hard to beat, in my opinion.  

Now, I’ll freely admit that this sounds a little, um, wish-washy to me, at least on the surface.  I have no idea if a company, even a small one, would go for something like this.  Would a company take a volunteer with an engineering background?  Will they see anything to gain from giving me experience without an official job?  Any advice on how I should go about contacting them and asking for something like this? These are things our school counselors don’t really mention, because it’s so uncommon I’m sure!

I should also note that this option surely sounds “risky” to some, going several months without a steady income, health insurance, etc.  But it’s really not worrisome to me.  I didn’t take out student loans in college and I’ve been diligent in saving in my year of work + summer internships.  I’m fairly frugal, so the idea of living in southeast Asia for a few months without an income isn’t daunting to me.     

In summary

* I want to change career paths to a different industry.  I’m certified to work in this industry but lack relevant experience.

* I absolutely need to take 4-6 months off from working full time for personal reasons.

* I have the option of either:

A) Taking a job now and negotiating my start date to be 4-6 months from now.

or

B) Apprenticing on a volunteer basis with a smaller company overseas for a few months (which would give me the flexibility I need to deal with my personal stuff, while also providing me with useful skills and experience).

So, if you're still reading this, what are your thoughts reddit? Anything that I haven’t thought of or need to know? Any input is appreciated."

2a6pks,0,2014-07-08,Sort of freaking out in terms of Career path I am on at the moment...Please help me out/ give me some insight..(Long Read ahead),Turin_Giants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2a6pks/sort_of_freaking_out_in_terms_of_career_path_i_am/,"**I apologize if this is in the wrong sub Reddit as well!**

Okay, I will try and calm down but i am sort of having a panic attack at the thought of this but I will try and explain my background for everything as clear as possible. 

**Background:**

 I have a bachelors degree from GMU in VA and I just graduated in May of 2013. I am 23 if that matters. I received a PSYCHOLOGY degree. I had always wanted to help people with their problems and, me being my ignorant self, decided ""fuck the money, I wanna help people and get a job right after college ends"" well that didn't happen. Fortunately, my Dad works for the county government and was able to get me an internship two years ago. I didn't particularly enjoy the internship, but being a poor college student, I wasn't going to turn it down or the cash. In the end, I graduated and was offered a full time job there straight after graduating. I took that opportunity as soon as it was presented to me because, I figured, who wouldn't take a job right out of college. 

A year later, I have saved up some money to buy a house in the future, as I am living at my parents house trying to save up money as best as possible. Realistically, I don't see myself moving out until next summer as I need a little more money for a down payment. 

**My current predicament:** 

This afternoon my dad slapped me in the face with reality. Honestly, deep down, I knew this job wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. My boss even knows that but she is still preparing me to take over her job when she retires in three years, unless ""she wins the lottery and gambles on cruises for the rest of her life."" That being said, sure a promotion is good. A promotion means more money but I am still stuck in a field (civil engineering (Public Transportation Planning). 

**What I want to do:** 

I have always loved videogames. I started out with xbox360, then wanting better graphics and cooler games, then progressed to buying a crap laptop to play said games, wasn't satisfied, decided to build my own pc, fell in love and the rest is history. 

I want to get into information security or some sort of IT field. Honestly, I would prefer something that pays well too (who wouldn't).  Also, being that I live in Northern Virginia (very high income median), the cost of living is extremely hard. 

I like the fact that information security is sort of like a detective work but in the cyber world. The fact that you find a hole created by someone, you then try and find out how that person made the hole, and then try and prevent it from hopefully happening in the future. I remember hearing a story, not sure if it was true or not, of a kid who went to my highschool who was extremely into computers. I remember hearing that he hacked the school's databases or whatever, was able to change his grades, etc. I remember he designed this chat room feature that could be accessed by students on all the school's computers. In the end, he was caught but instead of being disciplined, he was given an opportunity to work for some tech company trying to stop people from hacking other systems. They basically hired a ""hacker"" to help stop other ""hackers"" from doing what he did to their systems because he knew what to look for and where the weak links in the system where. 

Anyways, I got off topic. Bottom line is: I HAVE NO CLUE WHERE TO GO FROM HERE. I have a fucking psych degree, man. I can't do shit with that. I wasted four fucking years of college for nothing. I wasted four years of college studying something I ended up doing nothing with. Now I want to go into a field, which I actually have an interest in, but now I have no prerequisites. I have no prior experience in computer science other than building my own gaming PC (if that's even considered computer science). 

I have done some research into the field, and also heard a little from my neighbor, who works for Symatac, as a information security employee(? lol) and he said the key is in certifications. So for the past hour or so I have been looking at some of the top certifications that are desired by professionals for 2014 and they all sound so advance. 

Then I searched a little more and found CompTIA certifications. This site gave me a little hope because it was more user friendly and pretty much up my alley in terms of what to do if i want to get into this field. I am still a little confused on how to go about the whole process but I will learn in time. 

I guess the reasoning I am writing this short novel to you guys is for help/insight/personal experience if this happened to you. I know I am only 23 but I don't want to go back to school and get another bachelor degree and finally graduate and get a good job by the time I am in my 30s. Look I know things don't come easy and I don't expect people to spoon feed me jobs and opportunities and that I have to go out and find them myself. I would like a little guidance on how to go about this though. 

If anyone takes the time to read this long post, I really appreciate your time! Seriously, it means a lot. 

**TL;DR: Got a Psych (Bachelors) degree in college. Got a job after college. Gettin' paid. NOT SATISFIED WITH LIFE. Want to get into the IT field (particularly informational security). Unsure about what steps I should take to purse that career path. Help!**"

What Happened: I screwed up, and parked on the wrong side last night, thinking that was the Wednesday side. I come out to my car to go to work this morning, and see a ticket on the windshield: $73. 

Going Forward: I'd like to not pay this. I know I deserve it, that's not what I'm arguing. What will happen? I read on LADOT's site that they do not tow or boot until you've had at least 5 unpaid parking tickets, and I do not intend to get another one. Also, the ticket states that the cost eventually doubled if left unpaid, so I figure worst-case scenario I'd have to pay $146 sometime down the road. Should I be concerned about a bench warrant?

2a7dxi,2,2014-07-08,The Tape Recorder,rdgard,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2a7dxi/the_tape_recorder/,"I am posting this here since you have to take me seriously.  I don't know what to make of it and i need some advice.

  I've been working with the town’s museum in exhibits for almost 12 years now, and my boss is ambitious, I guess.  She always has a million projects going on at once, and with all of the interns coming in and going out all the time it seems like there are never-ending projects just left open-ended. For almost 6 months I worked tirelessly on a project to create placards for a display on local grasshoppers and other insects, only to have it scrapped completely just as I was wrapping it up. During that time I was basically an apprentice to our etymologist. I was so engrained in it that Petyr, our bug guy, offered me a permanent position.  This is the kind of all inclusive work that my boss expects from us.  It's tiring, but really challenging and I've never gotten bored.
About two months ago, I was assigned to determine whether we could protect three buildings in the town hall district.  This would call for me to do a survey, and to pull up all of the history of the buildings, and take pictures.  Sharon, my boss, wanted me to compile all of this and get it ready for a presentation to the zoning board so that we could zone these buildings in the local historic district so that we can restore and preserve them.  (She had gotten wind that these buildings will be open for demolition in about 3 months) So, I have been working on documenting everything about these buildings.  They were originally created in the 1830's as a stop for local traders making their way through our town on the way to bigger cities.  One of the three buildings was purported to be a brothel at one point, and the middle was a physician's quarters that was home and office to Dr. Pike.  Pike was supposedly a student and fervent fan of Dr. Benjamin Rush, but so far in my research I can't find much mention of him.  He was a urban legend in my town as he basically bled to death countless traveling townsfolk with his misdirected passion for bleeding as a cure-all. There’s still a song about this guy that I have used once or twice as a kid.  It wasn’t ever Bloody Mary in my town, but Bloody Liam.  People used to refer to the building to drunkards corner, although the town saloon was almost a quarter of a mile away.  People would stumble out of Dr. Pike’s shop, out onto the streets and along the way to trade their goods, they would perish.  It’s said that he loved blood so much that he would store it in jars in rows the main office to impress people upon entering.  
Years after Pike had died in 1901, people tore down the rickety wooden building and put in it's place the building that is there now. They didn't leave much of the original structure, but they did keep the fireplace and the stone basement that was used for cold storage.  I haven't dug more into that, but I am almost positive that it was used as a mortuary of sorts. Don’t' quote me on that, I'm not done with that part of the research just yet. After the building was completed, it turned into the local newspaper's editorial house.  The first printing press of it’s type in our area was just down the road, and this is where the local newsmen created their stories.  It's big, but I still am not convinced that it's historical district zoning big. 
At this point, I am torn with what I have found.  I don't know if I should intentionally bomb the presentation and see this whole thing come to a glorious, destructive end, or if I should keep pushing forward.  I did my physical survey a week and a half ago. It was kind of how you'd expect, dusty and old, as the buildings have sat empty for the last several years.  Everything was pretty straightforward, the buildings weren't in terrible disrepair, but the center building, the newspaper place, hadn't been touched since what seemed like the 70's. The style of the rooms, and one broken, leftover typewriter sat in the middle of the open floor on the second story.  While things were covered in dust and grime, it really wasn’t bad.  It could probably be fixed up in a few months with the right *ahem*rich* backers.    
I didn't take my camera that time, but it was only going to be open to me for 30 mins to an hour, and I could already feel the real estate lady downstairs getting impatient right as we got there. I stepped over a fallen ceiling tile on the first floor and was about to make my way out when I noticed an abandoned desk in the back corner.  It was butting up to a door that was closed, and I would have missed it completely had I not almost tripped over the tile.  Old, and perfectly centered on the desk was a grey/green  tape recorder. It was one of those handheld ones that a reporter might have used for documenting a conversation. It was covered in a thinner layer of dust, almost as though it had been placed there more recently, as though it was the last thing touched in the office right before they closed up the place.  I don't know what it was about it. I don't know why I had to touch it. I keep thinking about it and it makes me so mad. I wish I could have just left. I wish anything in the world would have happened but what did.
I went over to the tape recorder and, like an idiot, I picked it up.  Without a thought, just like that.  I pressed the rewind button, expecting nothing to happen, and i was surprised that it started reeling the tape inside back.  Slow at first, as though it was stuck, and then faster. 
 “Neat.” I thought. 
I pressed play and two thumps beat out at me.  Then I didn't hear anything.  So I tapped it twice, and heard nothing and then a weird scrape. I bent down closer to listen to the tape recorder and my shoe slipped on a piece of detritus on the floor.  It was then that it started to dawn on me.  The scrape sounded like an echo. For a second I thought that the recorder was malfunctioning and that it was in some kind of weird record/playback mode. Just as I thought this, the recorder jostled, as though someone had run their fingers across the mic. I flipped the recorder over to see what buttons were actually depressed and slowly, so so slowly realized that my finger had touched the mic.  I quickly pressed the rewind and listened to the sounds again. They didn't change, but now I came to realize that it was as though I had pressed record instead of play.  In exactly the same time I began hearing the two taps as I banged the player, the foot scrape and the mic rub. I let it keep playing. Nothing for a moment or two, and then the speakers made sounds of jingling like keys, and then there was a plastic sounding scrape.  On the tape player I heard the voice of the real estate lady say,"" How's it going in there?"" a pause, and then there was a jostle. I stood very still.  I waited for it, and then, sure as all hell, there was a jingle of keys and the lady called out.
 My voice began to come out of the tape player at this point. I sounded thin and tinny, and was obviously nervous. ""Everything's fine."" As my voice came out, I jostled the tape player. It scared me.  I couldn't help it.  I stared in disbelief.  My voice, disembodied. Then I noticed movement ahead of me and I saw the lady's head peering through the open door with her eyebrows raised questioningly. 
 ""Everything's fine."" 
She pulled her head back and closed the door soundlessly.  My mind reeled.  Literally reeled.  I was so confused and everything wasn't making sense that I have no idea what to make of all that.  I could feel my eyes get bigger and I searched the room looking for something that would ground me, that would make this make sense.  Some wire, or mic or something, anything.  The tape player started sounding one more time, and what was on it is what I can't stop thinking about. It was quiet at first, but I recognized it immediately. It was me. Whimpering.  Bubbling soft moaning noises from far away in my voice.  I instinctively pulled the thing away from my ear to look at it, and my cries started to get louder, the bubbling and moaning turning more desperate sounding. It is the most frightening thing I have ever experienced in my life.  I dropped the recorder and began to run, slipping again on that damn piece of tile, and as I was on the ground, I heard my voice unmistakable, begin to shriek and wail. I have never made those noises. I know it.  I have thought about it a lot since then. 
As I threw open the door to escape, I heard one final thing.  And I’m not sure about this.  Not sure at all.  But I think I heard wet noises.  The screaming was muffled and it almost stopped abruptly but the final noise was red, and wet.  I think. 
Maybe. 
 Maybe it's just my mind. 
Maybe I'm obsessing and none of this is real. I know about psychological priming, and even though the place was pretty straight forward, I did do my research on it, so maybe my mind was just primed to think of this place as a horror house. But, I don't think so, I don't know. And I'm scared.  So I'm putting this here so that maybe you can help me make some sense of it before I have to go back and document this place in its entirety. Help me figure this out.  I don't know, is it possible that maybe the recorder was so old it malfunctioned? 
Could that have happened?
I'm really scared.  
I have two days.

I don't want anybody to code this for me, but if you can point me into the right direction which resources to use and where to look that would be extremly helpful.

As far as I have found out so far, this is how a lot of programming is done anyway: Ask for general help.

What I did so far:

* 1/3 through the Javascript tutorial on codeacademy.

* Started with the learnyounode tutorial from node.js, but I think you need more basics for that.

* Accounts at SO and github

* freshened up my math at Khan

* ...

Any tips or hints would be great. I have also finished the faq of course, but right now everything is still so overwhelming I don't really know where to start."

But if you aren't sure about that sort of lifestyle, you can play it more conservatively.

Now does anyone have any objections to attending Umass Amherst for CS instead of a most prestigious school such as UIUC, UT Austin, U of Michigan ?


Okay from all of your feedback i was able to compile a pros and cons list

Pro to attending top 15 CS School:

Better Connections, 
On Average more competitive/motivating/ talented body of students
Better University Setting (this is personal to Umass Amherst I am not impressed by the campus at Amherst)

Con:
20k more per semester (Generally the top 15 CS Schools are 40k While Umass Amherst is 20k instate)

Other Gathering include: The actual college that you attend has no barring on the hiring process, however prestigious schools provide the intangible items (refer to the Pro's list above)."

I finished school in 2010 with an associates degree in Computer Information Systems.  Shortly after school I received my CCNA and began working as an intern.  From there on I met so many people in the field that had only an associates degree - if anything at all.  The word on the street was experience and certs will get you where you need to be.  The years have went on and the jobs have changed. I'm currently a systems engineer at a fairly large corporation working with a small team of guys.  We manage 3 data centers and I primarily deal with HP physical servers, VMware clusters, and various EMC SAN / DR products.  I enjoy my job, but know I have more potential to make better money.  I don't foresee myself ever being able to enter the management realm without having a 4 year degree.  (The CCNA has expired and I do very little to zero networking anymore.)

Fast forward:  My past school is now offering a bachelors degree that I can just tack onto my associates.  So basically I go back for 11 more classes and call it a Bachelors of Science.  It's more of an organizational supervision type of degree and is highly geared toward the business side of things.

My questions are pretty vague, but is this really worth the time and money?  I'm already paying for school debt and would really not want to take on more.  However if this is truly something that will eventually help me make $10-$15k more a year then its completely worth it to me.  Anyone else in this same situation?"

Recently, I was hired to create and control computer animations for the scoreboards at my Division 1 school as well. This won't be a big time commitment but I figured it would be a really interesting and valuable experience to have.

Furthermore, summer 2015, I hope to have another CS position to broaden my experiences. My dream is to eventually have a career within the theme park industry, through some branch of CS, and I'm considering applying for a seasonal IT technician job at nearby amusement parks for the summer (as an industry-relevant position).

Would it look bad in any way to potential employers if I have a variety of different CS work experiences without a specific specialty (i.e. Dev/QA/Graphics/IT)? I am just concerned that they may think I am not likely to commit to their company or able to specialize in a certain area of CS.

As a post bacs, financial aid is really limited. I really regret my first major, but nothing to do now. I will have enough in loans to cover the tuition, but other than that, I am SOL. I can't even get a work study because I ended up applying so late. I can't even get other loans because I don't have a cosigner. I am a female so I'll be applying to a lot of STEM scholarships. Hopefully my second year will be easier financially but this first year will be rough.

I don't know enough about programming to get any sort of coding job yet and because the region the school is in, I am wondering if I would be setting myself up for failure if I were to get a 20 hour per week job waiting tables or something like that? I worked all through undergrad about 35 hours per week and I had an easy major. I got decent grades there, but I wonder about the CS work load. Anyone work while in school? I am prepared to be poor for the next year or two, I just need to get really good grades, as I only started to code when I was 25.

I am also concerned about the opportunities for internships at a lower caliber school. I would be applying for internships in the city closest to me- about 4 hours away. As a post bac, how can I best represent myself to get any internships, and would I need to have the cost of getting to the interviews when I did start to apply? That would be a real hardship for my first year in school as my financial situation is looking now.

Any sort of pointers for how to survive financially while in college would be helpful."

2aaaj3,2,2014-07-09,Business student being interviewed for a project manager intern position at a software company - please help,Feylin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aaaj3/business_student_being_interviewed_for_a_project/,"Hey guys, I understand that this is primarily for CS students but I currently have an interview for a project manager internship position at a major business enterprise software company as a business major. 

It isn't the role I originally applied for, but since I have technical knowledge, they funneled me into this role for an interview. The only issue is that while they don't expect me to be a programmer, quite frankly I'm unsure of what to expect in the coming interview. I have experience working with MySQL, I'm familiar with the logic involved in programming and a lot of the technical acumen, but when it comes to actual programming I have no experience. They're preferably seeking somebody a computer science major with a business minor or something similar so I expect they need me to be at the very least, able to effectively communicate with software engineers and developers. 

I've looked at other interns in the same position at this company and they seem to have some degree of experience at least MIS with knowledge in either programming languages or SQL. 

Any advice as to how to prepare for the interview? They scheduled me in for a slot in two days so my preparation time will be minimal. Primarily, the big question is to ""Truly understand a program (and not just follow the steps)"".

Also, what do you think is most important for a project manager to you as a programmer and in what way could I be able to make your life as easy as possible?



Am I in way over my head? Please help :("

I bought this [Y50](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K6ZIMPE/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and I got it today. Despite its 15"" screen like my current laptop (4:3), it is an 1.5"" longer (due to the numpad addition and longer screen). I didn't think this would be too bad in person, but it is really starting to bother me. I spend a lot of time traveling - to and from college and to visit family in other states - which means I have my laptop on the move a lot. I have a nagging feeling that this 15.24"" length laptop is not going to be as portable as I'd imagined.

I'm thinking about returning and downgrading to a Y40 - probably [this](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y40/?sb=:000001C9:00012260:) one however if you can find a better deal from another website so I don't have to deal with Lenovo shipping I'd be much obliged. My concerns with the Y40 is its AMD graphics card and downgrade in processor (still i7 but slower performance). I do like its better chassis and battery life which works better for my traveling. 

I plan to use the laptop for some gaming, but mostly college and intern work (heavy multitasking programs). Games mostly limited to WOW, LOL, Skyrim, portal, but not a priority to play on high settings. 

In your opinion, will this processor/graphics card change significantly affect my needs? I specifically went with this Y50 for the great processor over the much cheaper dual i5.

The $$$ difference is not the issue, although a plus if I get the y40. "
2aanz5,1,2014-07-09,Doing my first internship- is what I'm experiencing normal?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aanz5/doing_my_first_internship_is_what_im_experiencing/,"Almost halfway through my first internship. It's been a ride for sure. Confusing, exciting, frustrating, I'm sure that's all normal. But what I wonder constantly is whether my tasks/experience are also typical in this field?

When I first got here, I was told what my team was (i.e. ""we handle this part of the business""), handed my team's codebase and told to fix things (tests and bugs mostly). Ok, I can give that a shot, maybe was expecting more training, but whatever. After a few days + some frustration, I fixed some of the bugs. The others, I didn't know enough about the system/code to fix, so I was told just to document them. My team didn't seem too pleased, though.

Fast forward a few weeks, and its much of the same story. I'm still working on bug fixing and miscellaneous things for a codebase I don't understand too deeply (those who are available for questions are friendly, but very busy, and are not often familiar themselves since they haven't worked here long either.) I'm able to fix most of what's given to me, but not quickly. Completely fine with the job, learned so much, but my manager/team don't seem very satisfied with my performance. I have a good GPA and did well during the interview, so I wonder if they were expecting more?

The other interns (different teams) are doing pretty much the same (bug fixing), but their teams seem to be happy with them. The company isn't known to be that demanding or anything.

So what I really want to ask is: 1) Are my tasks pretty typical for software engineering and/or SE internships? 2) How can I improve? I want to keep working for this company in the future, and they initially told me that as well. But the more time I spend, the more they seem to not go down that route. They seemed disappointed from the start when I couldn't fix things right away. So if you have any intern/job experiences or and info, advice to share, I'd be so glad to hear it! This is my first internship and I would be so happy to hear anything that might help! Thanks!!"

2abllj,0,2014-07-10,My car is haunted,Rin_Takahashi,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2abllj/my_car_is_haunted/,"I've always wanted to get my car fixed up ever since I got it. It's a 2003(?) Black Lancer which my dad gave to me on my birthday. It was the best thing I could ever ask for my birthday.

Strange thing is that the car has an auto break system which it shouldn't have. There were times during my first month with my car that my car suddenly braked. By *itself*. 

One particular rainy night really freaked me out. I was on my way home when I noticed that my car was having trouble trying to accelerate. Suddenly, the car braked without me doing anything. I had my foot on the freaking gas for goodness sake! Anyway, I freaked out for a moment but felt myself suddenly get scared because as the rain lightened up, I noticed the blinking lights in front of me. There was an accident between two vans and it looked like I will be the third if my car didn't brake by itself.

Another weird thing is that, my mom scolded me in the morning because she used my car before I was awake to get something from the grocery and she noticed hand marks all over the windshield at the passenger side. As if, someone was trying to push out the windshield. I thought she was just joking and that the hand prints were outside but it turned out to be *inside*. I tried to clean it out but the marks are very hard to clean out all the way. This made my blood run cold and I asked my mom if I can use the other car. Thankfully, she relented.

I didn't use my car for a week but after that, I figured it was safe enough for me to use it again. Guess I was wrong. Throughout my drive to and from the university, I kept on hearing this weird water sounds coming from the passenger side. I investigated it but there was nothing amiss. This kept on happening for about two weeks before I broke down and went to a mechanic who looked beneath the glove compartment and the water just poured down. It freaked out the mechanic and asked me if I drove in a flooded area. I told him no because the only time that I used the car when it was raining is the time when I almost got killed. Anyway, he fixed it and charged me nothing since he's an old friend of my dad.

The water is gone for about a month before it started again. I didn't want to use it again because I think that the aircon is broken. 

Ants are a problem too. It used to be a really clean car and now ants are suddenly appearing on the headboard of my car. Mind you, i don't eat in my car. I think something died in my car but I wasn't able to find any smell or remains. But my best friend has other ideas. 

He thinks my car is haunted. With all the hand prints, the sudden automatic braking system, the water and the insects. He even brought up a dream I told him about a year ago. (which I regret telling him now because he's so sure that a ghost is in my car)

The dream is about me and a friend who is a girl, (Who I know now as my new classmate whom I met at january and now i'm giving her a ride home) driving home. I asked my friend who is sitting beside me in my car where we should go next and she told me that we could hang out at her apartment. A little girl behind us suddenly spoke up and I looked at her. I saw her eyes turn dark as night as she grinned at me. ""I wouldn't do that if I were you."" She said in a playful voice and I glared at her before snapping. ""And why not?""

The demon girl just leaned her head on my friend's shoulder and told me. ""Because a demon is obssessed with you and if you're not hom in a couple of days, he'll be maaaad."" That's when I woke up.

I only got my car last january as an early gift and I only met my friend last february. The dream happened last *year* september. I'm just looking for a good explanation for all this because I drive home alone now after my internship ends by 11pm and I seriously don't want to imagine a ghost or whatever invisible it is sitting beside me in the dark. If it really is a supernatural problem, help me know what and why it is haunting my car."

I'll have some good experience when I graduate (software consultant and research assistant intern) so it won't be all shit, but I'm worried it won't be enough to get my foot in the door of top places (IBM for instance).

Also a bit of a random question - is a degree from a lesser university worth as much as a degree from a top 10 uni? Say I were to transfer to a place where the course is easier would they still accept my degree when applying for grad schemes?"

Thanks everyone for all the advice. I went in to the meeting and pretty much dominated the conversation with statistics etc. Listened to what they needed from me and visa versa. Went away with a few action items, and felt generally pretty well about how things had gone. 

For a few weeks, then walkin's started again, and I decided I would log them, and get them done so I can show what's happening. Then got hit with another random out of the blue request from my superior. I'm supposed to meet with each department head, do all their tickets until they are done before moving on. Give weekly updates, and do an inventory of all equipment, phones, printers, etc by the end of the Month. (not too bad)  I understand the weekly update thing it's something I've been trying to get done for a while. Just the whole way the email was put together and out of the blue, without even asking me about how things are going is what irritates me. 

So this leads me to my next topic. I have now got an Intern, he's an older guy through a program to get people who've been in prison back in to the work force. He used to be a software engineer, and worked on various contracts until he ran into a spot of bother. So my question here is, I need to bring him up to speed on things with servers, routers, etc. He's got the right mindset for troubleshooting so I'm looking for some websites/tools that he could use to get up to speed to learn. 

The other thought I had was to train him to take over my position whilst I look for something else but I don't know if that would be possible. Thanks again for all you're help I'm glad to have this as a resource.

Edit: Thought I better add this bit of information since /u/sdmike21 asked. Looking for training focused on desktop/server support. Maybe something like Khan Academy but for windows server stuff. My goal is that even if we can't hire him full time it will give him a leg up on his situation. As he is currently homeless."

Didn't take but 7 minutes for an actual problem to arise after that post. 

Phone is about to ring, Intern has already answered the phone, (no idea how he knows when it's going to ring.. maybe he's cut out for this after all, no one really knows)

&gt; Intern : Helpdesk, this is Intern, how can I help you today?

&gt; Employee QQ : I can't get my system to work , my computer is really loud, my keyboard isn't working, I can't get to my emails, everything is frozen, sometimes my mouse doesn't work, I can't get anything to work, come help me.

Intern looks at me, clearly distressed with the load just dropped on him by this guy. He hands me the phone.

&gt; Carl : What's your PC Name?

&gt; QQ : MISLoaner45

MISLoaner45? The loaner PC that we gave him like, 3 years ago? That can't be right.. that PC is from ancient times, it was a temp while his new one was being set up, so I thought..

&gt; Carl : MISLoaner45? Did you say that correctly? What happened to your actual assigned desktop?

&gt; QQ : Oh, well someone said they needed it, it was better suited for their programs than mine, so I gave it to them instead.

A nice thought, though all of our computers are literally the exact same.

&gt; Carl : Well seeing as we don't buy different models or versions of any of the pc's that would be false. What employee did you give it to, I'll go get it later on today.

Haha, yeah, and by that i mean NewGuy or Slowpoke will go get it.

&gt; QQ : No I brought it home and gave it to my niece. She said it was a really good computer for her programs for school..

&gt; Carl : YOU DID WHAT?!?! You understand that is stealing work property, don't you? Are you crazy?! 

&gt; QQ : Oh.. no I figured since you gave it to me, I could do what I wanted with it.. Still, this computer isn't working at all..

&gt; Carl : I'll be down to look at it in a few minutes, in the meantime, I've got a few things to take care of.

Hung up after that, although I think he was going to ask I don't email his manager about it. Yeah ok, I'll call him instead.

Pick up the phone, Intern seems confused, he doesn't know what is going on currently. Will let him read this, he'll figure it out. Dial his managers extension, sit and wait for the phone to ring and hopefully be answered.

&gt; QQManager : This is QQManager in Quality Control, how may I help you Carl?

&gt; Carl : Are you aware QQ brought his work PC home and gave it away, very likely without a system restore on it, and the fact that it's WORK property and not his means he stole it from the company?

&gt; QQManager : I did not! That is ubsurd! What is he even using to do work?!

&gt; Carl : MISLoaner45, that vintage 10 year old 'thing' with about enough life left in it to flop over and die.

&gt; QQManager : Well I'll be damned, no wonder he barely ever gets anything done around here. I'll go talk to him and in the meantime, send an email to execs, they'll want to know.

Great. This is what I get for doing the right thing. Gotta bring in the Execs now. Well, I'll work on sending them this email, we'll see what happens but it's looking like it's not going to be pretty. Execs don't handle bad news well in my experiences..

Will keep you posted, but I may drop in an EDIT to explain what happens with the meeting. This is going to be very interesting..

Oh, and Ill let you know what is going on with MISLoaner45 too, It's probably has more viruses on it than I can imagine, not having run a scan on it in 3 years since I've given it to him..

UPDATE #1 : Meeting is set for this afternoon, after my lunch break and all that. Will do another update for what takes place at that meeting.

I went and looked at Loaner45. I spent all of about 4 minutes. It was literally 100% full no space. This guy was deleting information about products on a cycle, so the oldest was deleted to make room for new stuff. He didn't back up ANY of it. The company is now missing over 23 months worth of information on quality issues with products we've shipped, all of which we are still manufacturing. Fantastic. Can't do a scan on it without fear of the computer breaking down, so when it's finally given back and the files are transferred (assuming they even can be), I'll do a scan.

Oh, and also, the computer is literally being held together with Tape. Like, generic clear tape, not even like, duct-tape. There's gotta be 8 full rolls of tape on that computer / monitor to keep them from falling apart. Poor thing just needs to be put to sleep forever with all the torture it's been through. :(

UPDATE #2 : Hooolleeeeyyyyy sheeeeettttt. So, I'll start with the most important stuff, QQ and QQManager and QQManagersManager are all suspended for 3 weeks without pay, not fired at least, yet, i guess.

QQ will be getting the PC back. If any records show the data has been tampered with or copies or anything, he's out of a job and has to pay the cost of the PC.

I didnt get yelled at, nor did anyone in ID thankfully. We did have another ""How do we prevent this"" talk, to which i replied :

&gt; If you want this to stop, start hiring people who have common sense or you could just stop having job fairs at the mental hospital.

Then I got yelled at a little, and a dirty look from QQ, but it was worth it.

The actual meeting consisted of simply this on a loop :

&gt; QQ : I didn't mean it, im sorry, please dont fire me, i didnt think i did anything wrong, the guys in IT can get all the data back, my niece isnt working for a rival company and will not have shown anyone anything, i thought it was ok to give her the computer

s^o^o^o^o^o^o^o^o where does that leave me?

Gotta go get Loaner45, going to snap a pic of it and add it in tomorrows post, going to run a scan on it and tell you what i find in tomorrows post, and I'm going to go get QQs pc from his niece, and im sure that won't be terrible at all, ^amirite? Probably not. We'll see I suppose. 

Final Update : All things considered, a few more meeting having been had, and some group oriented 'brainstorming' ^because ^these ^execs ^think ^they ^have ^brains ^h^u^e^h^u^e^h^u^e^h^u^e

Sorry got a little off topic, brainstorming was to figure out a way to prevent this, when someone mentioned,

&gt; Exec : Hey, lets dedicate someone in IT to managing the loaner PC's.

&gt; Carl : Slowpoke has been doing that for the last 5 years .. Where the hell have you been

All hell broke loose after that. Now we have more meetings tomorrow for Slowpoke to better learn to 'manage' the loaner / rental PC's, and maybe execs think it might be a good idea to start charging money to employees if they don't return the loaner PC by a certain period of time after the reason they had a loaner pc has been resolved.

That's the smartest thing they've said in years.."

I have been stuck in my current position on a project team for a few years now and can't seem to find a way to move up. I have no idea what to do next. Background:

- Went to college and blew it off/didn't take it seriously. Got a Bachelor's Degree in Communications - Theory &amp; Rhetoric. Didn't take my internship seriously and used hookup my uncle had at a radio station to intern there which wasn't even appropriate for my degree since it was a mass communications internship but my degree was meant for public relations/advertising. Couldn't find work in that field out of college and abandoned hope of ever doing so. No desire to even try now. Only went for that degree because I couldn't pick a direction and had fleeting interest in public relations.
- Worked as a personal banker for 2 years.
- Have worked now at mortgage company for 6.5 years; first few years were underwriting loan modifications. I was good at it and the pay was alright at the time (30k + monthly bonuses = 48k my best year). However I got bored and decided I needed some experience working with management to try to move up in the world, so I got a new position working on a project team. It was considered a lateral move but it actually pays LESS because it's just the base salary without the bonuses I had before (although because of yearly raises I am now up to 36k a year). I work in the bankruptcy department and I assist upper management in all sorts of things, but they won't promote me. I don't do anything too complex; I take spreadsheets and make updates to them in Excel and make Powerpoint Presentations. I feel my skills are stagnating. I'm not learning anything new to make me stand out. There is ONE huge perk to my current position, which is that it's work-at-home.

Where do I go from here? I don't really want to go back to school, at least not right now. I am 31 and married and own a house that I just bought a couple months ago and can now barely make ends meet. There are a few things I am interested in:

- Management within the financial industry: This is what I've been currently telling myself my career path is. But I'm stuck. And I'm wondering if it's even all that lucrative. Maybe I'm wasting my time.
- IT job? I would have to go to school or at least get some technical training, maybe through a free website like alison.com. I was thinking of learning SQL since I work with some people who use that a lot. Maybe I could be a database administrator? Even if I go to night school for the next couple years and get some little degree, though, not only will I not have any free time the next two years, but even if I get a better job I'll have student loans to pay for (I have no student loan debt currently as my parents paid for my Bachelor's Degree).
- I often daydream of owning my own business. I dream a lot about owning a bar. I have no business plan or investors and no savings, nor do I have any equity built up in my new home yet to get a home equity loan from. Is it even possible for me to get a business loan? Would it only be possible if I partner up with numerous others? This route is such a long shot that I'm just wasting space typing it, but hey, it's a dream.
- Also sometimes dream about being a teacher, but I'd have to go for a teaching certificate and I can't substitute teach to build up experience in the meantime due to my day job.

I know this post is super long and few people post here but I hope someone has read this and can give me a suggestion. I'm hopeless. People younger than me are passing me by and I can't take it anymore."

And today I saw just how mindless some workers are. We have about six people working the phones, 3 of which are interns including me. We have a Citrix server that host most of our applications for users in the plant. The server had gone down that morning due to an insufficient amount of memory error.I shut it down and configured the virtual machine to allow more usage of the memory as I was trained to do. Then the real shit storm happend.

There is only 2 of us in the office today and I just got back to my desk when I get the first can.

Me:""It support center how can I help""

Drone1:""Hi I am trying to access my Citrix application but it it's prompting me for a user name and password""

Me:""Oh so you need a password reset""

Drone 1:""No my password works fine""

Me:""okay so what's the problem?""

Drone 1:""What do I put in?""

At this point I realize he hasn't even attempted a login yet.

Me:""sir you just have to enter in your user name and password you use for everything else""

Every thing we use Syncs to our Active Directory so logins are the same for anything we use.

Drone1:""Oh, yep that worked thanks""

He hangs up and I look over and see we have 12 calls waiting.

I pickup the phone.

Me:""It support center what seems to be the problem""

Drone2: ""Hi I'm trying to use Citrix but it wants a password and user name and I don't know what to do""

Me:""Have you tried using your username and password""

Drone 2:""Um no will that work?""

Me:""Yes it will work""

Drone2:""Yup it seems to work now""

What happend was and auto logon feature needs to be configured by the net admin after ever shutdown. That's no good because the net admin is on vacation "

I started at IBM in June and am wondering when I'll be able to work on something substantial (I.E. not doing learning that feels like it is not at all related to what I've learned and done at college and an internship). I'm in the AIS group if that matters. Most of my experience is in Java, with a functional knowledge of C/C++/C#. 

With all of that, I was hoping there might be an opportunity to do development involving one of those languages. Currently they're pushing mobile/web on me, which seems odd since I emphasized my Java experience during the interviews. 

I'm seriously hoping that things get better once I have a bit more time in the company."

Our high school had a program to have ""tech classes"" for 5-10 students as basically help desk slaves. Which was awesome actually, and is how I started learning about technology beyond installing and playing Quake3 and Halo PC.

I get a ticket to go to the middle school, and take a look at the English rooms computer lab. Generally, the middle school teachers were pretty tech savvy, but this one, oh boy.

I enter the lab and ask what the problem is.

&gt;Teacher: Well, we got all these computers over the summer, and now we are ready to use them, but they won't turn on!

&gt;Me: Okay, I will take a look.

I assume that the power strips might of been flipped, or something similar so crawl under the tables and look. No power strips. In fact...no power cords or anything that looked like power.

I get up and look at the back of the computers on the tables. No cables. No power cables anywhere.

2adpsd,5,2014-07-10,I'm worried that being honest with my doctor will prevent her from taking me seriously.,bluestreak27,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2adpsd/im_worried_that_being_honest_with_my_doctor_will/,"I'm a 22 year old senior in college and am becoming more and more concerned that I may have ADD/ADHD issues. I've always been a very active and social person, high school was a breeze, and my college grades have been in the B-ish range for the past couple years. However, the older I get the more I'm realizing that I work differently than most people, and am afraid with more life responsibilities coming my way that I may not handle them well.
 
 There are many reasons why I'm worried I have issues:
     
-I've never been the type who can knock out homework in a few hours. I can never keep focused enough to knock out whole assignments at once. I have to start work way in advance and work on it for maybe an hour or so at a time multiple times.
   
-At work I'll have an idea to work on something, but always burn out and lose focus after 10-15 minutes and have to move on to something else. That or I'll get caught up in a detail and forget why I started the project in the first place. There have been times where I'll start a project and forget that I had started the same thing a few days ago and never finished.
   
-I've always been someone with a lot of stress and anxiety. I have mood swings, get very irritable with others, and have moments where I just need to get away from people. I think a lot of this comes from a constant sense of underachievement that leads to a big lack of confidence. 
     
-When it comes to reading I can get through maybe 20 pages and lose all focus even on a book I really want to read. 
   
-I bounce around from checking my phone, email, looking around and needing to walk around all the time which leads to a lack of concentration. I often start things and then think of a million other things that I want to do (clean, go to the gym, cook a healthy dinner, practice guitar, read) and then give up because I don't think I'll ever get it done. This is much better early in the mornings but after lunch it goes downhill quick.
  
-I do like to work out and eat healthy most of the time which has helped me mentally, but still I end up drinking a lot of caffeine (~5 cups a day) and consider myself a heavy drinker.  I have read from this sub and other sources that mood issues and overuse of other substances are a sign of adult add/adhd.

I mentioned some of this casually at my last check-up but my doctor basically shut me down immediately and wouldn’t give me the time of day because I had done pretty well in school. I really want to talk to a professional but here’s the kicker…Around junior year of college I would casually take my friend’s adderall when studying for exams, writing papers, and have an overwhelming amount of school on top work. This isn’t something I’m proud of but I can’t say I regret it because it made me feel more in control and I actually starting getting A’s which I felt my work ethic deserved. I’m afraid to tell a doctor this because I don’t want to seem like some lazy drug seeking college kid just trying to get a prescription. I don’t really want to be on medication, but I’m terrified that I might actually have an issue and what that could hold me back from in life (I currently have an internship which I’m worried they may not make me a full time offer for some of these reasons). I guess any advice on how to overcome this anxiety/if it sounds like I’m just being overdramatic would be much appreciated.

TL;DR I am a fairly successful college student with increasing fears of ADHD issues, however I am terrified to seek real help because I’ve casually used a buddy’s Adderall during times of high stress.

How should I go about asking for this?,indoordinosaur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aeez0/i_feel_like_i_needdeserve_a_raise_but_im_an/,"So I've been working in this payment processing/e-commerce company as a helpdesk guy since November, it's basically an internship to become a sysadmin. Anyways, since I'm about to graduate with a CS degree in 6 months I asked about a position doing what I really wanted to do which was .NET programming with their software dev people. I performed well as a helpdesk guy and the engineers and managers I will be working with all know me and I feel like I've made a pretty good impression. I've been making $15/hour and was expecting a raise to $18 (that's my peers got after working 6 months or so) but our Director of the internal IT services department left the company right around the time I would've been getting mine so it never came around.

Now my my friend/coworker who started at helpdesk a few months before me and getting $18/hour a few months ago moved over to being a software dev intern exactly as I will be soon. He has been doing real QA work for the group and will soon be writing code. When he moved over he tried to ask for a raise but they wouldn't give it to him and just kept him the same as what he was making already. I wouldn't mind $18/hour but $15 seems low to me and I'm worried they'll just try to keep me at the same wage. A few months ago I went and interviewed with a different company (before I knew I'd be getting to do software dev here) and was offered $22/hour to intern but I didn't take it due to commute distances.

Should I tell them that I was offered $22 somewhere else? Should I let on that I know my co-worker is doing the exact same thing as me at a higher wage? Or do I just have no bargaining power as an intern?


**TLDR: Moving from IT Helpdesk to software engineering intern, worried they'll try to keep paying me my current wage of $15 if I don't ask for a raise.**"
2aeomo,53,2014-07-11,The Hump Day Labryinth,SilentStrike6,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2aeomo/the_hump_day_labryinth/,"My first post ever, it is long (I know), hope you enjoy!

Some background: I work for a small company that troubleshoots energy monitoring systems connected to home networks. I am a computer science student that worked this summer IT job due to my lack of motivation to get a stereotypical internship at large software company X. Saying that my job of setting up wifi adapters, power cycling hardware, and being the omniscient being of tech knowledge for an office ‘easy’ would be the understatement of the decade… It pays well so w/e

So I arrived at work the other day only to find that I had nothing to do until 2pm. As I was starting my daily ritual of creating an epic playlist to listen to while I entered an endless pile of forms into our database, I received a call from a customer who needed help connecting his system to the cloud. I breathed a sigh of relief as I knew I could go out to an easy service call and escape an office filled with a plethora of PMSing females. I grabbed my backpack of troubleshooting goodies and dove into the nearest company vehicle.

As I arrived on site, I knew that going to the front door would be difficult since I had no clue where the hell it was. (Sidenote: I live in a  part of the world where houses are so old, so heavily modified with single wall add ons, and are used by four generations of family members that houses become a labyrinth of gates, patios, dog runs, yards, car ports, sheds, and decks. Needless to say, finding the main entrance used by the residing group of homo sapiens becomes a feat of human ingenuity. It's times like these when I laugh my ass off when people ask me where the bathroom is in my two room apartment.)

After cleverly unlatching 3 gates, shimmying a side yard, and crossing a dogshit filled slab, I could only deduce that I had arrived at the front door as evidenced by there being a pile of shoes on the ground in front of the door. Unsurprisingly there was no doorbell to alert the customer that I had arrived at his fine place of residence (not that they ever work anyway when they are there). I then resort to the trusty knock that humans have been using for hundreds of years.  Knowing the immense size/complexity of this house, and the distance it spans, I start off with a very firm three pound knock. After waiting as long as my patience could stand, I gave the door a shattering trio of knocks that would wake up even the deepest of sleep behind three closed doors. After hearing only the buzzing of flies encircling the mounds of dogshit behind me, I could only conclude that the customer was not home even though I told him I would be there only an hour previously.

I then pulled out my phone and gave him a ring…

&gt; Derp: Hello?

&gt; Me: Hi this is tech herp, I am outside right now, could you let me in so I can get access to your router?

&gt; Derp: I am on vacation right now but you should be able to get in.

O god please don’t make me break into your house…

&gt; Me: I don’t think I can help you since you are not home.  Could we reschedule when you get back?

&gt; Derp: Arggg!! I installed this system blah blah lots of money blah blah can you just fix it?

&gt; Me: Ummm, fine…, how do you want me to get in?

&gt; Derp: If you go around back you should be able to get into the unlocked laundry room. Blah blah blah

So to shorten this monstrosity of a post I end up talking with this customer on how to break into his house. As simple as he made it sound in the beginning, I ended up having to:

- Retrace my steps out three gates and side yards
- Unlock a combination gate by trying a dozen codes
- Scale a rusty sheet metal filled backyard
- Disable a home alarm system
- Search a bunch of pots for a key
- Ram open a jammed door
- Scale piles of shit filling nearly every room in his house
- Find his network hardware that had changed rooms so often he didn’t know where it was…

I should have stopped at him not being home, but my unconfrontational nature and good will to help my customers got me screwed this time. 

TL;DR Troubleshooting a labyrinth-hoarder house when customer is not home.  Lab rat maze mode ensues…

Happy Teching

Unfortunately, some previously-undiagnosed learning disabilities and anxiety disorders really slowed down my progress in school until just the last few years. But, now that I'm being treated, I've worked really hard to get up to speed and get things done as quickly as possible. That said, I don't have much 'official' work history in the field apart from freelance work and a brief internship (where I felt mostly overwhelmed). I currently work part-time as a mobile-device salesman/tech. Because of this, I can't help but feel that I'm at a severe disadvantage and I'm not sure what would be the best next-step.

I really have a passion for it, though. I run my own home-lab (pfsense, Linux servers, managed/unmanaged switches) which I've used to experiment with so many different server and network technologies that I've honestly lost count. I've covered basically all of the CCNA and CCNA security level material during college and worked hands-on in their labs (but, I haven't gotten any certs yet). I know three programming languages, including assembly language for several CPUs, and have a deep interest in computer engineering alongside IT. But, all that still seems like it's never enough. 

I know the opinions on higher-education are mixed here, but my current plan is to go for a bachelors. It seems like it will be, overall, beneficial in my life (and it's something that will last my entire life). There is a state university here that offers several degrees relating to IT. But, partially because of some of the issues above, I may have to spend an extra year there just fulfilling the prerequisites for the program (which have to be taken consecutively). Leaving college at 27 with only a bachelors just seems like a bad thing, I suppose. 

Another option that caught my eye was to go with WGU. They look really appealing, especially since you earn a bunch of certs during the course and that I can work as quickly as possible. But, I know other online 'universities' have really poisoned the water for the rest of them. I feel like the school and it's program are legit, but I don't know what the consensus is on them. Right now, on paper, it seems like the better option. Do you or your business have an opinion on them?

I guess I'm not really sure what I'm asking for. It kinda feels like the only thing I've learned after all this time is just how much I *don't* know about *anything* and that I have no barometer for this field in the 'real' world. And I wonder if any decision I make will be based more on the, probably irrational, fear of failure of becoming miserable or 'unhireable' than anything rational: whether I take too long to get in the field, or get my degree, or if I get a worthless degree, or if I regret not going for a degree, etc. Maybe I'm looking for direction or perspective because it feels like I'm walking in the dark, bumping into everything (which, I suppose isn't abnormal).

I know you guys have probably read things like this a hundred times before. So, if nothing else, thanks for reading."

Okay, so I got the computer lab plugged in, and power on, logged into a machine, and called life good.

A few days later, I get a ticket about the computer lab being slow to login, slow on the network drives, slow internet, and some won't even get logged in.

I assume this is standard PEBKAC again and head over.

I sit down and login to the first system fine, but it did take minutes. The second system would not login, and the third was slower than molasses. I try to login to a few more with similar results.

I head to the wire room and grab a fluke toner and tester to see if the cables might of been cut/mangled/etc. This middle school was actually brand new, so I figured cables might of been crushed in the roof/wall during installation by the ""expert contractors"".

I tone a few lines and get nothing, or nearly nothing. Next up, fluke tester.

&gt; Fluke: BEEP BEEP! Fault at 10 feet.

10 Feet? What in the world, that would be in the wall. I trek back to the computer lab and pop the tracking panel on the wall off.

Our tech intern boss was here with me and almost started crying

&gt;TechBoss: Oh no. They didn't. What in the world? WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS!?

&gt;Me: Uhhh, is this spliced cat5?

&gt;TechBoss: Yes. Go back to the tech office and grab a few boxes of cable..

We ended up having to rewire the entire lab of ~20 computers. The buidling contractor folks ran 4 lines, then spliced them to the rest of the computers.

Moral of the story: Don't assume the users are always wrong, but always assume the non technical building contractors who have never ran data network cables might be. (No offense guys.)

Because of this initial mistreatment I then decided to complain to HR where I was asked to supply the email confirming my placement, after doing so I was told that I was not sent that email. Essentially what I had discovered happened is that the email confirming my placement had been edited by someone so it looked like I was never offered a placement and I was essentially accused of lying by the person i was complaining too.

Fortunately I knew someone who already worked at the company who then managed to organise a meeting with a head engineer and another person in HR, a meeting which I still haven't heard back from even though it happened two weeks ago. My friend tells me they took my side and an engineer says he is looking into it but it seems to be going nowhere as its a HR problem being dealt with by HR.

I'm wondering if that is enough for an internship.

When the fall is over I will have taken Circuits 1, Mechanics, A CAD class and an intro to MATLAB class. Should I wait until after these classes as it will probably look better?"
2aft67,1,2014-07-11,Should I choose a different technology during an internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aft67/should_i_choose_a_different_technology_during_an/,"   I am a summer intern, working as a java developer  at a mid-size company. The internship's duration is 6 weeks. I'm also living somewhere in Eastern Europe, and I'm studying something which can be described as a mix between Computer Science and Computer Engineering. In a few months I will be starting my last year, and I plan to work as a part-time developer.
         At the internship, in the first 2 weeks I studied/ worked with Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and in the next week I should start using Spring and Hibernate. I am somewhat familiar with these technologies, as I implemented a few projects using them during the last semester. Now after 2 weeks I have a much better understanding of these technologies, and I enjoy working with them.
    A few hours ago, someone from the company announced us ( the java interns) that there is a position available for android development, and if we want to, we can switch to that. I was also interested in android a few months ago, watched a few tutorials, implemented 3 or 4 simple apps, but I never got the chance to work more with Android, as I had a lot of projects to implement for uni, including the ones in which I implemented java web application. So basically, I was and still am very interested in learning android, but I don't know too much about it, while I also like implementing web applications, and I know  a little about the technologies. Also, I don't know any details about what I'll be implementing if I switch to Android. 
    For my current position, the mentors are passionate developers, and help us a lot, and I can say that I learned a lot during the last 2 weeks. After the internship ends, there will be an evaluation, and if the result is good, I have the possibility to stay at the company for a few more weeks. After that I can get hired as a part developer. 
     I feel that I have a good chance of getting hired if I stick with the current technologies. I understand them and I enjoy working with them. So I'm curious about what do you think I should do. Any advice is welcome, especially from people who worked with both mobile development and web applications."

Our users all run higher end business class Dell laptops configured to use these technologies both on and off the network.  

We upgraded a suit's laptop recently.  We allowed him to keep his old laptop for a period of time to back up and transfer things off that he needed because he insisted on being able to use it for personal use when we originally gave it to him(less than 2 years ago).  About a month or so after the upgrade, we need the other laptop back to re-purpose it for another user.


&gt; IT: I’d like to get your old laptop back from you sometime next week.  I’ll take care of formatting it when you turn it in.  Thanks.

&gt; USER: I would hope to put this off a bit longer.  I have continued to use it at home a lot and (shamefully admit) I haven't done the inventory of apps I've been meaning to before surrendering it.  What will happen to it afterwards?  If it goes to an employee auction, I would probably bid on it, in which case I'd much rather not have it reformatted in the event I end up owning it.  

&gt; IT: I'll be adding it to our loaner inventory.  We're running very low on computers at the moment due to new hires and summer interns.  It's still useful to us from a business perspective so I wouldn't expect it to end up in the auction.  I don't expect we'll have any laptops for the auction until 2015.

##About Me:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My name is Alex, I am an engineering student (electrical engineering, planning to transfer into computer science) moving into my 3rd year at a university placed within the top 10 engineering schools in the world. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During my senior year of high school, and much of my time spent at university, I had *no* idea what sort of career path I would want to take - going down the path of engineering because I had very high scores in the math/science sector and generally being technologically savvy. However, I also had a great love of graphics/design; I can remember spending most of my time in elementary school drawing comics and distributing copies to other kids, they were huge hits, in fact I had several popular series circulating the classrooms!

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ahem...getting back to the topic at hand, I'm here in /r/forhire today due to the fact that I believe I've found something I'm truly passionate about/enjoy and wanted to be able to apply myself in the respective fields listed in the title in the hopes that I can learn something useful as well as growing professionally.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(And yes, I realize they maybe a ~~bit~~ lot different, but the heart wants what the heart wants, I suppose.)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Most of this information, hopefully, gives a better idea of what kind of person I am, what sort of work ethic I possess, what I can contribute, and what I expect to gain from the experience.

2agm8x,0,2014-07-11,Should I try to graduate early?,roup1,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2agm8x/should_i_try_to_graduate_early/,"Hello!

I will try to be brief. I am currently an 18 year old student beginning my second year in Mechanical Engineering. I have read through my degree plan and have figured that it is possible to graduate one year early. This would be possible by taking 15 credit hours per semester for four semesters and 6 more hours online or during the summer. The only problem is that next summer would be my last summer as an undergrad, leaving a small window for an internship if I were to take classes during that time. In addition, even though it may be early, I have considered graduate school so I can study mechatronics/robotics. I live at home right now and I think it would be interesting to live away from home which is a reason to go to grad school, on top of my interest in the subject and desire to work in that field. I have a few questions about my situation:

Would there be an opportunity to get an internship during grad school or is undergrad the ideal time for that?

Would it be best to minor in CS/EE and graduate on time?

Would graduating at age 20 be detrimental in any way to my future career or well being?

I'm sorry if my questions seem scattered and if they overlap, it's just that there are many options I can take. Right now, the best option seems to be to graduate on time with a minor and an hopefully an internship,but really, I just wanted a second opinion. Thank you in advance!"

So I'm two years out of college, and after two internships in my field, have been in my ""dream job"" for nearly a year (ad agency). I've dealt with anxiety/depression for a long time unknowingly, but it really hit me when my dad passed away several months ago. I started getting panic attacks and wasn't able to do my job effectively so my employer allowed me unpaid leave. It was tremendous in my recovery and am feeling much better. 

I returned to work three weeks ago and the feelings are coming back. But only at work. When I get home, despite being miserable from a long day I feel relatively happy. There are just too many memories and associations with being unable to do my job here. It is slow torture being at work and mostly miserable, doing just enough to not get fired.

Basically, I need a change of scenery. I just started looking yesterday but don't know how long it will take. Fortunately my experience has given me a pretty solid resume and am confident I can find a similar job. 

My question is if it's worth it to apply for unemployment in the mean time as a backup plan in case it takes me a while to find a new gig. I have documentation from my psychiatrist about my medical health and reasoning for time off. What do you guys think? Do I have a case for ""good cause""? "
2ah6i9,7,2014-07-11,My goddamn roommate,StolenAphrodite,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2ah6i9/my_goddamn_roommate/,"Backstory: I am a female college student who got an internship 8 hrs from school for the summer. Internship fucking rocks, but I had no clue where to live, office is in the far sprawling suburbs of a major city. A co-worker suggested I live with his girlfriend's brother, because he had a spare room, and the perks (A/C, laundry, own room+bathroom) for the price were better than anything I saw on craigslist. 

Fast forward to living with the jackass: Meeting him, he didn't seem so bad. He'd be super chill about telling me where amenities were, etc. About the only thing we had in common was Game of Thrones. He's a 26 yr old finance dude who just works out excessively and I'm a 20 year old nerd who goes to concerts in basements. We're different people. But whatever, right, we can find some common ground on something eventually? 

Well, every time we'd converse (read: he'd yell over anything I had to say) he'd steer the conversation to how much money he's making/going to make or how hot the women he dates are. And it got worse from there. He'd get into his relationship past and current which I quite frankly, didn't want to hear about. 

He's on every dating site known to man. He rotates through girls like crazy. And, he's miserably sexist and won't even consider that as fact. His family is incredibly wealthy and I get the feeling he's never been told he's capable of doing anything wrong. Here are some actual quotes that he's said:

 * After telling me about a ""6/10 attractive"" tinder date he met who was checking out other guys at the coffee shop, he said, ""I don't get it, I'm the best she could ever do""

 * Ex girlfriend story: ""She was bat shit crazy, and SHE dumped ME"" Right. because only a crazy person could ever dump you.

 * ""Well, she was at least cute facially""

 * After talking about a girl he dated who was ""just a waitress,"" he finished the story with, ""yeah, I got tested after her""

 * ""It's so obvious I'm not the only person she's seeing."" He routinely dates 3+ people at a time, so I said, ""Wait, does that bother you?"" and he said, ""Well, yeah!"" like it was obvious or something.

 * ""If my mom looked like a dumpy housewife, my dad would divorce her so fast"" Ok, good, so we at least know where your awful sexist and shallow tendencies are coming from.

 * ""She's really pretty and she seems smart, usually girls are one or the other"" I just stared at him in awe after that one. Like, what the fuck

 * ""I just don't understand women"" fucking obviously

 * ""Do these shoes look homo?"" This is one I fucking called him out for. There is no damn reason people should still be using these phrases. I was like, ""Dude, there is a whole thesaurus, why go with that word"" and he tried to rationalize it, saying, ""I don't mean it like, homosexual, I mean it like, that's gay bro."" ...the fuck? 

 * ""I don't get offended by things"" YOU ARE A HETEROSEXUAL WHITE MALE WITH AN IMPOSING PHYSICAL PRESENCE. OF COURSE NOTHING OFFENDS YOU. WHEN YOU OFFEND PEOPLE, YOU LIKELY DID SOMETHING WRONG AND YOU SHOULD FIND OUT WHAT AS OPPOSED TO DEFENDING YOUR SHITTY POSITION. GO FUCK OFF AND WATCH MORE TOSH.0 YOU ENTITLED ASSWIPE.

After he started a conversation with me about which of the girls he's seeing he should call up that night, I got super fed up of his shit, broke my silence amidst all this, and called him a sexist, and he asked why I thought that. I said he objectifies women and doesn't see them as people. He responded that he objectifies everybody, he's just not trying to get with the dudes.

I responded by saying, ""You know, it's sometimes hard to have a level conversation with you when your ego is the biggest fucking thing in the room.""

Perhaps the ""fucking"" was inflammatory and excessive, but he didn't talk to me for 3 weeks after that. And it was wonderful. If we were in the same room, we were silent. He wouldn't even make eye contact with me. I was ecstatic.

He decided he should start talking me again last night. Fuck. The conversation was benign, with hints of his ""appearance is everything and I am the greatest person""-ness about it. Like, he was talking about how it's important to have a nice DVD collection because people are impressed by it. Dude, nobody is impressed that you have a copy of I Love You, Bet Cooper collecting dust on a shelf. Nobody.

I know a lot of people have had shitty roommates to an extreme (stealing and selling their shit, overall being unsanitary, being stalker crazy, etc.) so I guess things could be worse. But this is probably the first person I've met that I genuinely hate and have to deal with regularly. It's a weird feeling. **Advice on how to deal with assholes like this is much appreciated.**

I'm only here for 1.5 more months. That is my mantra.

Me: ""Um OK let me take a look at the ticket."" I look and see that it was a basic cable swap and that I did it. ""Sir I see that I replaced the cable but can you tell me whats wrong?

I ping his PC and nothing is out of the ordinary so I don't exactly know what to do since I am relatively new at this. Then he said that the cable was the wrong color. It then clicked that we are latest shipment of CAT6 cables were gray instead of blue.

Me:""Sir the cable is the same it is just a different color, our newest cables were just gray instead of blue.""

User:""No it is slower that the last one I am positive.""

This past semester, I missed my easiest chance to get an internship, my school's career fair. So here I am now working for a casino that I had been with for the past 2 years. I work in a department that is not inside the casino because I am not yet 21.

At the beginning of the Summer I was asked to come to the HR office to fill out some forms, and I got to talking with one of the higher ups of that department. We talked for a little bit about school and such, eventually the topic was brought up that the public accounting department was looking for an intern. She told me that I seemed like a good candidate and would pass my name to them.

I waited about a week and didn't hear back, so I went to her office where her receptionist said she was busy, she said she would pass my number to her. One week later, she saw me passing by and said that I was in for sure, and that I should expect a call soon to ask a few questions/get my resume. Two weeks later, after not hearing anything, she passed me by again at work and told me they were going to put me on the accounting schedule. I told her that I was very eager and wanted to get started as soon as possible, she said she would tell them to hurry.

It is also might be important to note that she asked me before if I was 21 or not, because their largest accounting department is in the casino, but there are a couple smaller ones for the other buildings they own. This could possibly be why they've been holding off, because they only need an intern in the casino. But I do turn 21 next week so that can be fixed.

So what I wanted to know is what should be my next course of action and how should I approach it? Is there any point in bothering her still? Summer break ends in 5 weeks, should I just give up? 

Thanks for the advice everyone, I really appreciate it.

My options at the moment are:

A) Transfer to a small-ish UC this fall, finish a B.S. (Applied Math, focus on CS), possibly get some research experience, and apply to grad school, or

B) Possibly continue to work as an intern, take more community college classes, and pick up 2 classes at UC Berkeley through concurrent enrollment, and reapply for UC transfers next year.

All there software is written in C++. I am fortunate in that I look 10 - 15 years younger than what I am. In school the people I made friends with all thought I was 26. So, I know this is to my advantage. When I sent out my resume I only put down a job that I had previously for 3 years, and then my college. So, from 2006 on. I didn't want to put down too many years of non related experience as it would more likely show my age. I am thinking this was a mistake. I am starting to freak out and have second thoughts about going to the interview. I am starting to feel like I am too old to get into this field and what was I thinking? I had a phone interview with them last week. This is an entry level position. I feel like I am just as qualified as someone 25 coming out of college. Do you think employers will think i am too old and not hire me. It scares me that there are so many articles online that say over 40 you are too old for programming. What advice can you give me?

We recently hired someone, let's say ""Dave,"" with no experience or internships to start taking on some of my responsibilities so that I can take on some additional projects.  Though I'm not his manager, I'm almost solely responsible for delegating work to him, training him, giving him feedback, etc.  We both report to ""Rick.""  Dave is a career-changer, so although he is in an entry-level position, he's about twice my age and has around 20 years of experience in another industry.

Dave's been here three months, and he's not very good at his job.  He seems eager to learn and interested in the industry, but he isn't really picking up he technical skills, and he seems to either disregard or be unaware of deadlines.  He frequently doesn't read his email, or maybe just forgets about it - I'll send him an email like, ""Can you call so and so and ask about this issue by the end of tomorrow?"" and I'll follow up later and he'll have no idea what I'm talking about.  His work has been laden with mistakes, and he tends to make the same mistakes repeatedly.  I have documented processes extremely clearly, and he'll often make mistakes or be clueless about something I have explicitly explained in the documentation or discussed with him multiple times before.

It's beginning to reflect badly on me and making it seem like I'm not giving him enough direction/documentation or not checking his work enough.  It's also becoming extremely stressful - he was hired with the expectation that he would be taking over a lot of my work and I'd be taking on new projects.  But now I'm taking on new projects and also spending a significant amount of time checking and rechecking or redoing his work to get it out on time, and I've been working really long hours.  (He has been leaving at 5.)

Our manager Rick has noticed an issue as well on a few projects they have worked on together.  He approached me about it and asked my opinion on how Dave's doing.  I was honest and expressed some of my concerns - is that a dick move?  If it was just my coworker and not someone I was trying to delegate work to, I'd never bring it up with his manager, but it's at the point where it's significantly affecting my own work.  And Rick seemed to notice the problem as well.

Honestly, I don't see Dave progressing too far in this profession.  It feels like it's going to be a very very long time before he is able to take on what he was hired to do.

I was patient for the first two months, but it's at the point where I feel like he should be improving at a pace much faster than he is.  I get that starting in a new industry is hard, but the ignorance of deadlines and the making the same mistake multiple times thing is really concerning.

How long is reasonable to expect someone to get up to speed?  How open about the problems should I be with our manager?  Any advice that you think would help him improve?  How much of the blame should I put on myself?  I feel like as the person training him, I bare part of the responsibility."

What can I do?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ajeaz/i_wasted_4_years_doing_absolutely_nothing_what/,"I will go ahead and give detailed information because this is a throwaway account. I'll try to make it as easy to read as possible.   

&gt; I graduated High School in June of 2010. I had a 2.8 GPA and an ACT score of 19. According to the ""guidelines"" that would give me a very low chance of being accepted to the University of Utah. I didn't have any scholarships and I didn't worry much because my dad has a business that is successful and could help me pay for school. I figured I would just go to Community College. So I did just that. I applied and they accepted, which they always do. The school I went to was Salt Lake Community College. I declared a Computer Science major because I want to program. I've always wanted to do that since I got my first computer when I was 10 years old. I took a semester and dropped out because I wanted to work. So I got a Full Time job and dropped out of school. Two years later I joined again, and once again dropped out because I was depressed and couldn't sit through a class let alone go to work. I also lost my job and just sat at home and played video games all the time. I dabbled here and there over the years with HTML, CSS and some Java. I know basics for Java and I'm mediocre with HTML and CSS. That's just website development so that doesn't matter to me. I decided it was time to get my life back in order. I feel better about myself and I reapplied to school. I'll be going back to Community College hopefully this fall. I have $1,000 to pay for the tuition I had back in 2012 that I will take care of this week. I just have a few questions I'd like to ask to hopefully get a better understanding, some words of encouragement and some tips if you will. Hopefully someone who was in my situation can help me out here.

1. Is Community College frowned upon? I read the FAQ and it doesn't give much information.
2. I have to start with Math 0990 which is Elementary Algebra pretty much and have to finish Calculus II to be able to transfer over to the University of Utah. So that means that I will probably have to take 6+ semesters to be able to catch up. Does this hinder me in any way? Is there a faster way to get through these math classes?
3. How do internships work if you go to a Community College? Will people still take me? When should I apply? First or second year, or should I wait to get into UofU?
4. I have to work Full-Time. Go to school at night. I bought a $700 a month car, with a shitty APR. Has anyone had to do this? Is it possible? Juggling school, work and homework seems like it will be near impossible to have a social life let alone be able to do my own side projects. My dads business isn't doing that amazing anymore so he's kind of strapped and I work so I can basically pay my car. 
5. Is there a way to get into a State University even though I didn't have the grades for it and have been out of school for pretty much 4 years now?
6. Should I take back my car... don't really want to do this... and find a part-time job to focus more on my projects and school. 
7. Is it worth sticking with Java or should I first learn something like C++ or Python?
8. Is the University of Utah a good school to get a bachelor's in Computer Science in? My goal is to be a Software Engineer.


I'm still learning Java and so far it's coming along great. The community college focuses on Java programming, not sure what the State University focuses on. I'm willing to put my all into this. I'm sick of wasting time and my life. I have friends who are in there 3rd year of college and I'm not even in my first. I'm so much better than this and everyone tells me this. I was just depressed for so long without telling anyone anything that I just sat here and dreaded living. It's going to be a hard and long journey, but I'm excited and willing to make the effort to succeed. I'm only 22... I'm still young right?

Thank you all for taking the time in reading my post. I would do a TL;DR but it doesn't seem possible since I have so many questions.

2ajecr,3,2014-07-12,How can I get an idea of what I would be working on in a real job?,doortomore,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ajecr/how_can_i_get_an_idea_of_what_i_would_be_working/,"I'm currently a first year CS student transitioning into my second year. I would say that I have a moderate grasp of C++, and I am trying to improve as much as possible. I have a very high GPA and I study as much as I can. I'll be taking some more advanced classes and I will be covering some important topics for SEs, such as Data Structures.

Though I've been quite worried lately. Every time I feel like taking a break or just relaxing, I can't because I'm worried that I don't know enough for when I go into an internship and eventually a job. Some of these things people talk about for side projects I would have no idea how to start. I've tried working with a framework for C++ called Qt, and it felt like a whole other language. I really don't know what I should be learning. Should I be trying as many APIs as I possibly can? I've never really had a decent side project to show off and I'd really like to make one but I have no idea what to do really.

I think I'm in that transition stage where I can understand the easy stuff but I don't know what to do for the intermediate/hard stuff.

Does anyone have any experiences they can share?"

Around two months ago, I started a new job with a ton of enthusiasm. I love the company and the people...but the workload is killing me and I'm apparently not even up to a full workload yet. While this is only my second ""real"" job (but my first new position since finishing my BA), I am not new to time-management and task prioritization; I have worked two jobs (one full-time, one part) and gone to school (6 credits) at the same time and been less stressed out than I am now.

I'm continually having new things added to my plate before I can even make a dent in what's already there, especially since I'm still learning things. It's very frustrating to plan out how I'm going to spend my time for the week only to have something huge thrown at me on Monday afternoon and having to force it in with everything else I'm already doing. The only way I'm truly managing to keep my head above water is by working on things in my limited free-time which isn't a sustainable strategy given some circumstances in my personal life. I've mentioned my stress level to my manager and, perhaps I haven't been assertive enough about it, but my concerns have gotten brushed off for the most part.

As someone who has lived their life as a perfectionist and is generally able to stay very much on top of everything, it's really difficult to accept that I just might not be cut out for this job in the long-term. I've already turned to upping my dosage of antidepressants and using low-level doses of anti-anxiety drugs (under a doctor's supervision) as the stress has exacerbated previous depression and anxiety issues, but I'm starting to think it isn't worth it.

If I start looking for another job, do I include this short stint on my resume? The only other resume-worthy jobs I have are a 4 year stint at the job I left for this one and a summer internship. Will I look like a job-hopper trying to find something else so soon? Should I try to stick this job out for at least a year to see if I eventually adapt to the stress? The thought of being a quitter really bothers me, but so does the thought of being so anxious for another 9-10 months. I'm getting a lot of valuable experience from this job, but at what cost?"

EDIT: Looks like PMs are a problem. I went to school in Oklahoma where I signed the terms of the scholarship and I relocated to South Carolina.

Hello /r/legaladvice I am glad you are here!

Starting at the beginning, I accepted a scholarship that left me in dept to my current employer i.e(I got my tuition paid for and in exchange I work for them for two years). After graduating (Early May 2014), we agreed on a start date at the beginning of June. Later I received at tentative offer of ~60K in salary for the duration of my employment. Then the Friday before I started work I received a phone call stating that the initial offer was in error and I would only be making ~40K. The real problem is that I was also obligated to work as an intern during the summers I was a student (wording is bad sorry)... the pay that I was making then as an intern is what I am making now not the 40K salary. I have been waiting for them to get this changed for over a month. I am a full time employee as well, but I was told by HR that until I have an effective start date at the higher pay scale I wont be able to receive benefits. We made no agreement on salary when I accepted the scholarship, but surely they can't legally require me to work for them for two years and keep me at barely above minimum wage with no benefits. I have looked over what I signed and they didn't mention in the document how I could pay them back i.e(interest rate or time period) if I were to breach the contract.

//RANT 
So confused by what is going on and my employer has irritated me to the point that if this doesn't get resolved within the next month I might consider relocating back home. I could easily move back home and make more than I am making now. My parents have offered to pay off what I owe(I am really lucky. Not to mention if I had no savings I wouldn't have been able to pay my bills last month). This seems, so f###ed up. I mean if this were someone else with no family to support them or money to fallback on they would be screwed and it pisses me off to think that I may not be the only one to have been put in this situation. Also, the only job I have ever held is a part time computer tech job. If I am being unreasonable in having expected this to not be an issue i.e.(expecting my first pay check to reflect a 40K salary, having benefits, etc.) please just tell me I am being a brat and need to give them more time. I'll admit I am ignorant of a lot of the laws and terms I should have made myself aware of before accepting this scholarship. Any advice legal or otherwise will be appreciated. Hopefully, my employer will have this resolved soon.

//QUESTIONS 
How fubar would I be by any repercussions for resigning(Not sure if resigning is even the right word given the circumstances)?
If they make an unreasonable claim for compensation what can I legally do to counter it? Would that mean court?
If I pay back the tuition and stipend how will that be reflected in taxes?

Thanks for reading.

Do you think there will be some opportunities for a computer science major at such low-ranked school like UCR? I had a 3.8 gpa all through out high school and I plan to keep it that way through college (i know college is different) 

I planned on going to Cal Poly Obispo or UCI, but there WAY to far, and I'm trying to keep my cost of my education down. What do I need to do to, or what would you do to increase your/my chances of earning internships and employment opportunities at bigger companies?"
2amqw3,3,2014-07-13,"feel like shit lately, trying to nail down my actual issues",Yqa,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/2amqw3/feel_like_shit_lately_trying_to_nail_down_my/,"well, I am a talk-thinker. If it's really important, I gotta talk about it to think. I am literally gonna vent and I don't care if you answer or not, but i figured I'd do this here since writing in an online journal, nobody could possibly comment with suggestions and I don't know who else has as much time to sit around and listen to my problems as my good old laptop.

I just got back from what I'd call a pretty good weekend. But once again, I keep having these little near-romantic-occurrences where something happens where I'm getting very close with certain girls and later on I regret not moving in faster, then I also have times where I move too fast and regret acting like such an idiot (most of these occurrences happen when drunk) and then I wonder about the girls who I have basically fucked it up with by acting too forward with them. Part of me says, hey, Don't give a shit about it, if they were worth it they would stick around. But sometimes the friend circle I'm in seems smaller and I feel like people know me as an asshole who everyone either does or eventually will hate. I also need to learn the golden rule, don't shit where you eat. 

Problem is, I really care about this stuff. I try not to, I read all the time that the literal worst thing you can do when you're trying to get a girl is to...try to get a girl. Then people say shit about how it's like fishing. Well every time it's happened for me, which has been enough to say I at least sorta get it, I had to stick my hand in there and pull it out. If I sat on my ass, it was gonna pass me up. Shit doesn't just fall in place for me, ever. Like as if either the people who apparently it does for are lying or I'm literally just doing everything wrong. I'm the guy that puts a quarter in the gumball machine and the gumball won't come out cause I turned the crank one too many times. That's okay, I've learned to appreciate working for what you get, but it gets on my nerves to see people who just have everything they'd ever want apparently just straight up handed to them. 

Now with girls it's the same shit as that, I work my ass off just for the 1% that stick around that honestly I don't even like that much. The girls that I really like just don't really seem to like me that much in that manner. Not sure what I can do there, but I try my best to partly learn how to fix that and partly learn how to accept it. If I stop caring completely, I know I'm gonna regret it. I'm in fucking college and I always hear from people how easy it is to hook up and here it is literally almost never happening for me. Certainly never hooking up but even the dating is blah. I partly wonder if I am just not changing my social circle enough, but that's hard to do. I don't have a friend that's literally into the same stuff as me or anything. Most of the time I make a best friend at school, they fucking graduate before I can even do anything with them. I need to make younger friends really.

All the while, I do have a sort of a love interest. But we rarely talk and she's basically been overseas since December, though I did get to see her once in May. She's a damn sweetheart, and she really is cool but I just get irritated by her somehow. There is literally nothing wrong with her, we just sometimes have personality clashes. And partially I also just don't dig not being really in LOVE with her. I just don't want her to not be around, I don't sit around pining for her which I have absolutely done for girls before. I really do want to be in love again.

Honestly that has been an issue as well lately, is that I haven't been with a girl that I really care about that much. It's really fucking depressing. I mean, I know that it could be that I'm looking for something that I don't really want... I am not really sure. If I knew the answer, it would just fix it. But I am sort of getting tired of waiting on the situation which does not seem to be 'clearing up.'

Part of the problem I saw was that I was physically unattractive. I looked like a scrub. And I went to /r/malehairadvice and /r/malefashionadvice and just became more conscious of that stuff. I did /r/keto and lost like 40 pounds. I started lifting, I started trying to make things into systems and just care more about myself, my life and keeping shit in order. Reading self development books. Really just worked on a lot of shit. And as far as I'm concerned, it had nothing to do with the girls. It had to do with me. I wanted a better life so I just started making it happen. Yeah, it's not perfect yet but I just look at me and I am either totally who I want to be in some aspects or I am at least on the right track, mostly anyways. But why does it feel so fucking boring here? Like as if it was easier when I didn't give a shit, and logically can't convince myself to stop giving a shit. I don't mean like I worry, as if I worry about my hair for instance. But I can't convince myself to go get it buzzed or stop doing anything with it. Although I do hear, if you keep doing what you're doing, you're gonna keep getting what you're getting, which for me currently is almost nothing I want. But I don't want to change everything and blow it. Not to mention, I'm not fucking 13 anymore. I know 20 is still a pretty young age but I can't go around whipping around life changes like they're nothing. I mean I could, but I feel like my friends would see me as a joke. And as it is, I already feel like I keep it around my limit. I do shit totally differently very often...if I did it much more I think people might think I was insane.

That said, most of my old friends don't really bond with me much anymore. We're still sort of friends but they've all gone to church together. They are super Christians now and I am the kid in college who drinks and smokes pot and makes money and thinks that this is most of the people in the world and the church going friends have just gone weird. But it is shitty. I just don't have anything in common with these guys anymore, as most of the stuff I do just might turn their stomachs (I.e. fucking random girls (every once in a while), trying random drugs, drinking to get drunk, being an asshole in general for fun) and I really don't dislike the way I live and I have no intention of changing that.

You think you don't have to be much like your friends, and that friend-'love' will guide you through. I call bullshit. My friends and I really think the others are cool but we rarely hang out because they go to church LITERALLY 3 FUCKING TIMES A WEEK. Apparently some churches hold on Saturday and they go there too so literally no day is safe. Ironically, they don't have jobs and they don't have money. They're always a lot happier than me but it's happy like a dog is happy when you throw a tennis ball. I actually value certain worldly things which they don't seem to understand but it's whatever. I am just sad not to have the old guys around anymore. My area is also very secluded, graduated about 125 kids in about 80 square miles of a district. Well I had about 5-10 friends I hung out with and literally every single one is now a full-time church goer, moved away or has a girlfriend. I don't even know where to go to meet people cause I'm fucking 20 which is the lamest age cause I'm just too young to go to bars (which may be no better, fuck if I know) and I'm too old to have hookups from high school who want to hang with new people or something. Home is fucking boring.

At school things always seem pretty good. Things move so quickly there it's hard to even keep track of shit so you stop worrying. I currently spend about 2 hours 30 minutes driving every day. 120 miles a day. I work very far away from home and all of that time behind the wheel really gets you to thinking. I analyze all the fun I'm not having during the time I am doing what is preventing me from having the fun. I wake up at 6 am to get to work late every day, drive 60 miles, do whatever I can to make work less shitty cause I'm just bored there (intern) and after I'm done, I leave. I always worry about how they might actually look at my punch-in/punch-out times and yell at me for it, but it hasn't happened yet so I guess we'll see. 50% of the way through but who knows.

At this point I'm sort of out of breath. There's more shit to say but I am sufficiently out of stuff to talk about for now. I don't know what I need to do but I'm really waiting on shit to stop sucking as soon as possible. And I'm kind of tired of being told by people that it has to suck and that's life. Fuck that. Maybe it's just being 20 or something but I really think it's bullshit that I literally have to be miserable and nothing work out for me for the rest of my life. That's stupid.

Once again, told you the length for this was gonna be unreal. If you read all this or even half of it, you're pretty fucking cool."

In short: I've had alot of stress over my past roommate since the last week of June. July 10th I moved out and I have a new roommate (she's nice and I'm comfortable with her for now.) I went to the councilor's office the next day, telling her my problems and she suggested that I'd get away from the dorms. So I goto my friend's place for the weekend and I enjoyed myself and all. I was still feeling down, but adleast had some time getting away from the dorms. 

I come back and I feel awful. No inspiration to do anything, every negative thought ends up in me crying my eyes out or just random crying in general, and my appetite is off. I eat a meal and I immediately feel nauseous but I don't vomit or anything.

I'm in college right now (about to enter my 4th year), working 3 days a week in an internship. Most of my friends are gone for the summer and my roommate has a life of her own so I feel lonely not doing anything with anyone and I feel frustrated that I don't have the inspiration to do anything!

2ankzr,1,2014-07-14,Is debt worth experience and happiness?,ironyinabucket,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ankzr/is_debt_worth_experience_and_happiness/,"I moved to the UK from Canada for school in September. Prior to coming here I assumed I would go back to Canada at the end of my degree (a 1 year Master's program) and look for work there. Slowly, as I spent more time here, I came to the conclusion that I don't want to go back to Canada for many reasons, the largest one being there are MANY more entry-level jobs in my field here.

I started applying for jobs for post graduation in London, the city I currently live in and where I want to stay, and came to realise that even recruiters wouldn't look at my CV and portfolio until I had at least a couple of months commercial experience. My school had an internship program which extends your degree by a couple of months (instead of finishing my dissertation at the end of September I will finish at the beginning of January) but obtaining an internship is on yourself. My student visa accounts for potentially having an internship already so I don't need to worry about extending it yet (only if I find a full-time job). I decided, because of what I learned through my job search and having heard nothing back from the full-time positions I've applied for and only negative responses from recruiters, that getting an internship is a must, either on the internship scheme with my school or after I graduate.

Here is where the problems start to arise. I applied for both paid and unpaid internships, because I felt I am going to need to have one either way so a few months without wages isn't that big of a deal. I'm not working right now anyway, having covered all expenses for this year using loans from the Canadian government and my parents. But, I've come to realise that once my lease in student housing ends (at the beginning of September) if I extend my degree my housing and transportation costs are going to be at least £600/month (and this is living an hour commute to the school, renting a room in one of the less expensive areas of London). I also know, from experience, that I can probably live off £400/month in expenses (food, bills, etc). I can probably get this lower, but this is me living comfortably and still able to go and do some things I enjoy. Now, £1000/month isn't too bad of a sum. But this cost would be for September, October, November and December, and all my loans are in Canadian dollars. All future loans will be in Canadian dollars, meaning I'm adding another $7400 (converted from £4000) at least to the $80000 I already owe (rounded up, but it's close to that).

If I don't take an internship during my program I will likely go back to Canada and try and find an internship in either country. It's more likely I'll find an internship in London but it will still be expensive, although probably a little less so because I wouldn't consider flying back for an unpaid one. My job hunt is going to be much longer without the internship, and even more so if I go back to Canada. It might be months before I actually get to work if I don't get some experience first. 

What I'm trying to decide is a 3 month internship and a 4 month extension on my dissertation (which would be a huge help in it's completion), plus getting to stay longer in a city I love worth putting myself in that much more debt? Having the internship will give me the experience I need to get an entry-level job and pull me from a salary bracket of about £0-£12000 to £22000/year (or $0 to $45000 if I were to go back to Canada, the difference is from internship pay to entry-level pay), but my debt is still going to take years to pay off. 

I know for the moment I'll be happier here than back home, but I don't know how long that happiness will last if I'm paying off an unmanageable amount of student debt. Based on my calculations I'll only be able to pay back $4000-$5000 a year at first, until I start making more than entry-level wages. Most of my debt is from my parents, so it's interest free, but this will extend my bank loan from something I can pay off in a year or two to something which might take five or six (if I don't get a raise before that). Are there other things I need to consider? Is living with debt really as awful as everyone makes it seem?

tl;dr: Internship will give me experience so I can get a job, plus I will get to stay in a city I love and will get more time to work on my Master's thesis, but I might have to put myself almost $10000 more in debt (where I already have almost $80000) to do it. Worth it?

2aov94,1,2014-07-14,turning down 2 offers from the same company - a bad idea?,csjob_account,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2aov94/turning_down_2_offers_from_the_same_company_a_bad/,"summary:

I've received two job offers from the same company.  If I turn down both offers, would that harm me if I applied to the company again in 3 months?

details:

I've been on a job search for a few months now.  I really don't want to relocate, but I will if I can't find anything in my current city.  I've applied for several positions at Intel; I had an intense interview process for one position, including them flying me across the country for an onsite interview.  I was given an offer, but I decided to decline it for several reasons - the location was the biggest one.  At the same time, I was contacted about another position I applied for at the company, and had a phone interview with them.  It's similar work on a different but related project.  It's also located in a different state (in the same region of the country).  They skipped the rest of the interview process, and gave me a nearly identical offer, based on how I was evaluated in the previous interviews.  Since the cost of living is lower in this new location, the offer is very respectable.

With all that said, I still would prefer to stay where I am, and I think there's a good chance I could find something here in another couple months of searching.  However, if I do have to move and work for a megacorp, Intel would be my best bet - I've had several internships with them, I know how to have a good interview performance, etc.  If I didn't accept the second offer, would this hurt my chances if I decide I have to abandon my job search in my current city, and I start applying to new job listings with them later in the year?"

Originally I was here as an intern, later hired full time to work on the same project. Slowly I have grown to hate my current position, as well as the stress and anxiety that comes with it. 

The project itself causing all these feelings, was originally described as an electronic medical record system, but turned out to really mean to be a software web based solution to all their problems. None of the requirements or goals seem to ever be concrete, if not get things added constantly. Additionally, being the only person working on this that is physically in the office, all the stress and questions come down to me. Technically I have 1 contractor working on things I can't, and had one previously whom started the project but later quit. 

On top of working on this project, managing it, all of which I feel should be a more senior position, as I have no experience doing anything with the technologies used in the project, I as well am stuck handling all IT issues within the office. 

As well no standards are actually followed as I am stuck working on this. People working on the software as it is in an alpha state, still being developed. All while it is expected in this state for it to be done quickly, without errors while having high functionality without the necessary effort, nor time to be put in.

All of this has been causing me severe anxiety, making me extremely uncomfortable in this job. As besides the issues following actual procedures, I feel like my current job is nowhere near entry level as it was described. I have been looking for a new position to escape this place.

I have somewhat been thinking of leaving this job before finding a new one. As I feel all of this is adding way too much stress &amp; anxiety to my life currently, and that I'd be better off starting from scratch looking for a new job.

Living arrangements at the moment wouldn't be an issue as still for now, living with my parents until I save up money to get an apartment.

Generally I am not sure if it is worth putting up with the anxiety the overly high expectations had, the lack of actually following procedures for things,or lack there of despite the best efforts to create them or sit down with my boss and create some. So I am not sure how bad it would affect job hunting for a new position, if I quit this one before finding one. Or if I am better off jumping ship first before running myself into the ground."

I was accepted to cal poly, ucr, and uci, (not trying to brag) but I may not go to Cal Poly Obispo or UCI because of the distance, and the extra cost of a dorm. If I stay at home I have a 35mile drive from home and I dont know if thats such a good idea.(I live in Riverside over by the Tyler Mall) I'm trying to keep my cost of my education down, but If UCI is worth it then Ill deal with it.

2apn4m,1,2014-07-14,"Graduated with a 1st in Biomed, but what now?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2apn4m/graduated_with_a_1st_in_biomed_but_what_now/,"Hey, so here goes:

So I'm 20 years old and I've just finished my degree in Biomedical Science at Nottingham Trent University. It's not a great university but it's one of the better non ""red brick"" universities in the UK I suppose. After completing  my final year research project I've decided I don't really want to pursue a career in biology, as I think I'd go insane working in a laboratory for the rest of my life. I also don't feel like I actually learned much (other than how to cram successfully and write essays) and feel as if I wouldn't have the knowledge for a biology related career.

So what now?

Throughout my whole university experience strangers would always be impressed by my degree title (due to the fact it has medicine in and they obviously assume I'm going to become a doctor). I've been told countless times how highly regarded science degrees are due to the skills required. But are they really regarded that highly? Perhaps chemistry or physics but biology?

I've been researching all kinds of graduate schemes to help me decide what career I'd like to pursue but it's not helping me at all. Many of the graduate schemes here require a 2:1 degree, ok great. But the majority of them, particularly the decent ones also require 300 UCAS points. If you're not from the UK; UCAS points are determined by the grades you received at A-level (I have no idea what the American equivalent is, APs perhaps?).

Anyway, my A-levels were pretty disastrous. I got a B in biology, C in physics and D in chemistry. This was primarily due to my absolute hatred of organic chemistry which resulted in me spending hours trying to learn chemistry whilst neglecting biology and physics as I could do those at an acceptable level without much effort. I also studied at my schools sixth form which is probably one of the worst in the country (they no longer offer A-levels surprisingly), but I'm not going to go on with some form of sob story, I could've done better or gone elsewhere, what's done is done.

So the combination of my awful A-level grades and not knowing what area of career to pursue I'm stumped. I'm particularly worried about getting a job for the summer whilst living at home with my parents just to earn some money (and avoid their constant nagging) and getting trapped in this city forever (Birmingham, I hate it).

I've always liked the idea of business and big cities like London. I think I'd enjoy working in a business environment as I'm extremely competitive and I'm sure the chance to move up the career ladder would be a great incentive. I'm also extremely interested in the opportunity to travel and would love the chance to migrate; although this is probably just some kind of dream job that I have no chance of getting.

Last year I had a summer job at a finance company doing data entry which was fairly well paid, despite being incredibly simple. I really liked the office environment and learning about the company during my introduction was pretty interesting. However, I never studied business or economics or anything like that at school as I was always good at core subjects like English, sciences and maths so I stuck with those. I also don't think I know enough about each of the areas in business like sales, accounting, finance etc. to make any kind of decision. 

A relevant summer internship would probably be extremely useful if I decide on a career path, but the majority of graduate schemes just filter out applications that don't meet the grade requirements. It never really occurred to me people would even care about UCAS points after obtaining a degree. Particularly when you consider that you could pick 3 or 4 ""easy"" subjects (I'm looking at you media) and get the golden 3 Bs required for the majority of schemes. Re-sitting A-levels isn't an option either as companies only take the results from your first attempt. 

I'm currently attempting to learn Excel out of boredom and in hope that it might be useful when applying for jobs, although I'm not sure how useful knowledge is without a certificate to say you can do it nowadays. 

*Thanks if you somehow made it to the end of this.*

**TLDR: I got a 1st in my degree but my A-level grades suck and may hold me back from a decent graduate scheme. Am I screwed?**"

2aqe8i,3,2014-07-14,I want to change my life direction so I'm thinking of getting a 2nd bachelor's in IT...have a master's in communications...,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2aqe8i/i_want_to_change_my_life_direction_so_im_thinking/,"So I have a B.A. in English and recently M.S. in Communication. I am a walking cliche of the late 20s millennial dissatisfied with the job market and not having any ""real"" skills to contribute to it. I work as a marketing assistant and I really don't like it or my future prospects. It took me hundreds and hundreds of interviews and a few internships to get this job, and it mostly sucks. I've been there a year and continue to apply for other jobs and get nowhere.  Not only is the pay poor, but I wish I was doing more technical-minded stuff instead of writing cheesy blog posts or trying to convince news outlets to write about us. I think the field is just too crowded, competitive, and not in demand. I also consider myself a computer geek that should have majored in something computer-related, but I missed the boat due to immaturity in college. Of my work, I find that I love the web editing in html/css the best.

So I really want to break into IT, and I am considering doing a 2nd bachelor's in it. I found a program that I can do this for only $11,000, and it is from an accredited state school close to me. I have no school debt, and although I would be taking out loans for this, that's not bad at all. The program is particularly cool because I can choose my own path. If I want to focus on programming, I can essentially take almost all programming language courses. If I want to focus on network technologies, I can just focus on those. I think I want to be a database admin, which would have a bit of both.

Now a master's seems like it would be better, but I am wary because of three things: 1) I hear of discrimination against those of us with master's in the job market (people assume we're pretentious/entitled/expect more money/whatever), so I can only imagine the discrimination I would face with 2) I really don't feel that I have a knowledge base to do computer science of information technology at the grad level and finally 3) grad school is a lot more expensive ($18-25k more depending on what I do)

I don't care about the idea of having another master's, I am fine with a modest B.S. and I intend to work my way up in the field.

However, I am worried that this will look damn weird on a resume, having a bachelor's degree listed after a Master's. Like, is it weird to have a Master's sandwiched in between two Bachelor's on a resume? I also could just replace my BA English with it on the resume, but then it might look like the IT degree is stale.

Also, some people have mentioned that doing this would look like a step backward, and that I might as well just get the master's.

Finally, I know with IT that you don't need a degree, but I am thinking long term. Maybe you WILL need a related degree in 20 years. I already see some jobs that request a related degree. I am embarrassed enough with my two current degrees that I KNOW I want to get some kind of additional degree in IT or CS...it's just a matter of which one and where. I also know that a CS degree is better than an IT degree..and I am considering that too, but it will be an even bigger investment since i'll have to do pre-req classes for any master's program..and it will ultimately end up costing like $30k

 My plan is to get the degree while studying for certs and pursuing internships. Right now I just don't have the knowledge/skills to get into anything.

So what does reddit think...do I have the right idea for my future? I'm so confused on what is the right idea for me to do and it keeps me up at night looking through different programs and options.

Also keep in mind I'm not trying to make a money grab..I just want to make more than I currently do. If I had a $40k/year job that I liked...I would be insanely happy. Life is more than money to me, I just want stability."
2aqnxw,8,2014-07-15,"In the beginning, there were twelve of us: Week 1",[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2aqnxw/in_the_beginning_there_were_twelve_of_us_week_1/,"When me and the 11 others first arrived, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We thought we had signed up for a summer camp, our rich parents were all eager to send away their kids. My dad was recently promoted to CEO in a company that will remain unnamed. This gave him the money to send me away the summer before my Junior year. When I first heard about their plans to send me away, I was infuriated. They usually sent me to my Grandparents when I was ""in there way"". My name I guess is Alex, I don't think I'll bother with an alias at the rate things are going.

I guess I should introduce ""us"" now huh? We 12 were the ""lucky ones"" selected to attend the private camp out of the *hundreds* of other entries. I arrived first at Persephone Island, after taking a plane to Los Angeles and then a private plane taking me directly to the island which is a good distance from California's coast (so much for swimming home). Being the first one to arrive, I was also the first to meet the four counselors, Shane, Mercedes, Zak, and Iris. They all looked like college students taking some sort of summer internship. Shane was tall with shaggy hipster hair and a tattoo his shirts sleeve concealed.   Mercedes was tanner and shorter compared to the others, she had guy-short hair and a bunch of earrings scattered along her face. Zak was twinkish looking, and I would've assumed he was gay if he wasn't romantically cradling Iris, who looked the most normal amongst them all with a kind smile. I got a brief look at the surrounding buildings before they led me to the cafeteria where I waited for the others to arrive. 

The cafeteria was indoors with nice tables except for the one in front of me. It had graffiti scratched on its surface and I surreptitiously switched seats. There were two things, the first was a line that read ""Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,"". I knew immediately that this was a quote from one of my favorite poets Poe. Since then I reread the poem and tried to link any of its lines to our situation to no prevail, so its pretty irrelevant. The second was of a strange symbol whose origins neither of us have discovered yet. I redrew it in my notebook because I didn't think to much of it at the time to take a picture. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/IVaoqry.jpg) (Sorry, I'm not an artist). Anyway, if anyone knows what that means we'd be grateful if you enlightened us. 

Continuing on, students started arriving and filling up the empty seats. We were all pretty spread out, only glancing at one another sizing each other up. A black kid  had a TMNT shirt on and huge Steve Urkel glasses that made me smirk. Another girl who I would discover is a real bitch (pardon my language), was staring at everybody with a look of distaste. I classified her as the pretty rich white girl. I classified correctly. I also noticed another guy that was shorter than the rest of us and was whispering to himself. An Asian guy was scribbling in a sketchbook, another girl was whistling a complicated tune. And yet another girl was looking around at invisible stuff like she was stoned or something.

Soon enough 12 kids filled the room, and that's when the counselors walked in, lunch-ladies served us lunch and after we feasted the counselors announced a sort of game to break the ice. They would throw a squishy ball to someone and that person would catch it and introduce themselves. Naturally, I attempted to blend into the wall and Shane must've noticed this because he threw it to me first. I sighed, not sure whether to be modest and appear like a nice guy, while underestimated in my abilities, or to entail my strengths and appear as a threat. Or to be honest. I went for the latter. ""Well,"" I began, ""I'm Alex, I'm 16, my parents sent me here against my will,"" a few others nodded their heads in relation. I also the noticed the stoner girl had a giddy smile on her face. ""I'm fairly athletic, I love to write, and I'm very strategic."" I stated which was all entirely true. Iris nodded and instructed me to throw the ball to another camper, which made me feel like a dick because I would be forcing this person to introduce themselves against their will. 

Luckily for me, Stoner Girl raised her hand. I threw it to her and she caught it clumsily. She had on a dark purple shirt,  faded jeans, and red sneakers. ""My name is Phae,"" she began, ""and I have [Synaesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)."" The counselors nodded in approval as she further elaborated. ""It means sound for me is a bunch of colorful fireworks."" This intrigued myself and most of the other campers. She stopped there though and sort of relished everybody's new found interest in her (Later, when I told her my first impression was that she was on drugs she got mad, lol) . The ball continued to be tossed around. Bernard was the kid with the TMNT shirt, and had an interest in graphic novels and superheroes. Samantha was the rich girl who had everything to complain about. Hiromi was the Asian kid who had some amazing artwork he showed off. Bianca, the whistling girl,  was Italian and a musician. Humble, (his real name) is an athlete that didn't come off very humble imo. Stacy was a poet, and she stood and told one of her favorite poems ""[A Dream Within a Dream](http://100.best-poems.net/dream-within-dream.html)"" (By Poe!). Dakota, the kid mumbling to himself, was some sort of genius and already in his senior year of high school (He's 14!). Compassion was some sort of child model and worked with huge clothing companies. Serenity was a singer who sang the national anthem in a pretty amazing way. And Joseph... was just Joseph, he didn't display any unique qualities. So we all had our strengths (except Joseph) and the counselors took our bags and let us mingle before the afternoon activities. I went over to Phae, Compassion and Serenity chatted with Samantha, Bianca and Stacy talked about different songs. Bernard bombarded Hiromi with questions about anime and manga. Joseph wandered over to Humble. And Dakota continued mumbling to himself so me and Phae invited him over after a bit. He explained how he was socially awkward and didn't like to talk much and we nodded that we understood. After talking to Phae a bit, she further elaborated how Synesthesia works. I would be lying if I said I didn't envy her. It seemed like a really cool thing, she described my voice as a relaxing blue, and Dakota's as a sunset orange. By the end of the day we were in normal high school cliques. Granted, they were tiny, but we managed. 

The rest of the week continued like this. We were assorted into two cabins, one for boys and one for girls. Our luggage was unpacked and we made ourselves at home each decorating our individual areas with personal items and what not (I just spread out a few books I brought). After that day we started our classes and got to know one another better. Eventually Humble sort of abandoned Joseph and started hanging out with Samantha and her friends. I learned more about Phae and Dakota too. Phae's originally from Michigan but she had recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Dakota was from Wisconsin and the only one between us three who had siblings. I also learned more about the other guys just by hanging out with them before lights out. Humble was from a small town where he was practically worshipped by peers, and Hiromi replied snidely not to expect anyone to bow down anytime soon. Bernard and Hiromi grew pretty close and I hung around them more as the week went on. Bernard was a huge fan of anime and they were playfully creating a Manga loosely based off Attack on Titan (an anime/manga they highly recommended). We took our Wilderness Survival Classes as usual and learned basic outdoorsman skills. We were gradually liking the place and genuinely getting along. On Thursday, some stuff went down in Samantha's clique and Serenity started hanging out with Bianca and Stacy, which made a lot more sense to me. 

Then Friday came. I probably wouldn't have noticed Joseph was even missing if we didn't share a bunk and I wasn't use to his snoring. I woke up and noticed he wasn't on his bed. At first I assumed he was in the restroom but in the five mornings here he's never woken before me. I didn't think too much about it then and I picked up my novel and continued reading (Battle Royale by Koushun Takami). When more than an hour passed and everyone was awake we started questioning where he could have gone. Dakota who had been in the restroom stated he wasn't there. Bernard and Hiromi decided to go talk to the counselors at their lounge. They returned more than half an hour later stating that Joseph was ill and flew home. We didn't think too much of it at the time. As harsh as this sounds, none of us were really going to miss him anyway. I did notice during our classes later though, that none of the jets were gone and Hiromi specifically stated that Joseph ""flew"" home. 

Right now we have more questions than answers, even now things are getting weird and we only have so much time until... well you'll find out soon enough. Sorry if this isn't a sufficient place to stop for now, I've written more than I intended. I'm just curious as to what the symbol meant and if that could help us in anyway. Thanks for caring ~Alex"

I played up the relevant position as much as possible in my CV and cover letter, and I do indeed spend more hours on this job than the others.

Within a few hours of sending my application, a representative of the company contacted me to ask about salary expectations. I went with what I considered to be a low number since I am just trying to break into a full-time office job for the first time. Shortly after that (same day), I received the ""we just opened the position and therefore the [selection] process will take some time"" response.

The job posting was about a week old when I responded, and the message exchange was also almost a week ago. The same representative just recently viewed my LinkedIn profile. No interview invitation yet, though.

**Am I being quietly snubbed, or do I have a chance?** I don't know if I messed up with the salary expectations. The quickness with which they responded and their follow-up on LinkedIn have to be good, right? Are they really operating on a longer time window and want to collect as many applications as possible?

**(How) Should I follow up again?** I've been thinking about asking what ""some time"" means. I'm starting to get interviews for positions that I find less desirable and I'd just like to know where I stand with this one.

I was wondering there was anyone out there who could help me out with advice on a future for me. I'm 26, currently studying towards a degree in History through the OU, and unemployed at the moment. I have several years of experience in various administrative roles.

I was wondering if anyone out there knew of any NON graduate training schemes available to me? It's really difficult to find online in a web search, as pretty much 99% of everything I see is 'graduate', and I'm not currently there yet. I applied last year for M&amp;S retail management scheme, and got invited to the assessment day, but I picked London as my location with the intention of moving there, but it all fell apart and I had to withdraw. Now I really regret it. It seems to be the only non graduate training scheme around? I am very interested in retail btw. I also need something that will pay, as past mistakes mean I need a constant income to pay off debts every month, and also be able to live - although I would love the luxury of being able to do unpaid internships as a foot in the door. I am willing to move to alot of different cities for opportunities.

I'm sorry if I have rambled, and if there are any questions please shoot, or if I have missed anything out please let me know.

&gt; **M :** Excel won't open, get error *random error message that i'm not entirely familiar with*, tried on multiple pc's with my account so it must be a user issue and not a pc issue.

Wait.. did this guy ACTUALLY submit a ticket with info?? Praise be to the TFTS Gods.

&gt; **Carl :** I looked at your user settings, seems there are some local settings on your Citrix account that aren't working very well together. Where is your desk located, I'll come check it out.

&gt; **M :** Near that new girls desk which is near the accounting cafeteria which is near that one loud printer you came to fix 3 weeks ago.

Welp, I guess they can't be useful at explaining everything. I'll hold onto the fact that he submitted a proper / nice ticket :)

We go through the whole 9 yards of explaining where his desk is located, I'm going to head over there now and see whats up. Shouldn't be long, will update when I'm back.

**15 Minutes Later**

So I'm back, man that was interesting. Nice guy, a little understanding of his explanation now, it was literally as he said it, couldn't miss it, near the new girls desk near the caf near that printer.. huh..

So looking around, his local settings are pretty good for the most part, seems it's just his Citrix webpage shortcut for excel is all screwy. Literally as easy to fix as recreating a shortcut, but that's not his fault, he doesn't really have much access, that's something I will have Intern do so he can get some experience with these issues later.

I notice M is returning with a drink from the caf.

&gt; **Carl :** Alright so it's just a little issue with the shortcut, I'll go back to my desk and fix it up real quick and I'll email you when it's done!

I even said this politely, which is rare, but he was nice, so I tried to be.

&gt; **M :** I CANT BELIEVE IT, GOSH DANGIT!!!!! THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!!!!!!!! D:&lt;

He  was red faced and fuming and for some reason pissed off. This caught me by surprise, I don't know what I had done wrong, and everyone was looking.

&gt; **Carl :** I'm.... sorry M, not sure what I did wrong? :(

In a much calmer voice :

&gt; **M :** Oh, no you did just fine. I was just informing the accounting office that the cafeteria was out of straws. 

He flashes me a smile and I can hear everyone chuckling softly to themselves. 

&gt; **M :** April fools, and happy birthday Carl!

Wut?

&gt; **Carl :** We're in the middle of July, and its not my birthday, uh... so, you know... yeah...

&gt; **M :** WUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTT?!?!?! THIS IS TOTALLY THE LAST STRAW!! 

Again I hear everyone chuckling, one guy couldn't contain it apparently, and started laughing uncontrollably. It was contagious, as everyone joined in after that. Everyone but poor me, who was still in shock and slightly confused.

M, noticing my lack of laughter, patted me on the head :

&gt; **M :** Sorry Carl, just playing a little joke on ya, didn't mean to make you all flustered. Go fix that excel shortcut, and here.. have a cookie.

He hands me a cookie. I walk out of the accounting dept with all those people still laughing. The cookie was nice, made me feel a little better. I will also note that the head-patting was quite helpful too.

As I got back to my desk, i sat down and started typing this up and beckoned for Intern to come over here and fix the issue. He seemed pleased that I asked him to help out and fixed the issue properly and went back to Reddit browsing on his PC, *Loaner45 II* :D

With the issue fixed, I emailed M back,

&gt; **Carl :** M, fixed the shortcut, try now please.

&gt; **M :** I don't see the shortcut anywhere.

&gt; **Carl :** Oh, sorry, forgot I renamed it ""THIS IS THE LAST SHORTCUT!!!!!!!!"". Have a good day M !

**Final Thought :** So, a weird morning ended with me getting a free cookie and making a new friend as well as me being nice to Intern (cookie may have been drugged, can't confirm or deny). Just a typical Tuesday morning. 

**UPDATE #1 :** Also, in case anyone was wondering, I did end up having that stupid ""How can we prevent this"" meeting, last night via conference call from my house. I read a comment from /u/Osiris32 about him being ok with even stocking it in the Server Room. I suggested that to the execs with the explination that ""It would be easier to keep an eye on and take inventory of"" and they liked the idea. I did too, as it meant that GenericEmployee would have to walk a loooooooong way to get the paper, and I mean, why wouldn't we want him to get some exercise before taking another hour long potty-break :)"

I usually meet or exceed the criteria for the positions I apply for, but without experience it doesn't matter.

Now I'm seeing unpaid internships advertised requiring a degree and 1 year experience with specific skills (Network intrusion systems, cloud encryption and things that they don't teach undergraduates). This is fucked, why do I even bother?

Then the media talks about all these ""unfilled IT positions"" as if it were true. Programming is going to be a minimum wage job by the time I graduate(If I ever do pass Electronic Engineering).

I really enjoyed discrete mathematics when I took it in college so I thought CSE would be a good major so I can take a couple more algorithm and mathematics classes.

I was wondering, how much do I need to love programming to find a successful career in CS? I have had 4 internships but they have all been on more of the hardware side as opposed to software. In the end, I want to live in the Bay Area, CA (I go to university in Davis, CA).

I see a lot of my friends constantly attending those hackathons and whatnot and I am wondering if I need to love coding as much as they do to find employment in the silicon valley after I graduate. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy programming, but I don't want almost all my free time to go towards hackathons and other CS events!

I'd love some input on anyone who made the switch to CS/CSE from EE/CompE, and anyone from the Bay Area!"

I really want to do a coop but hope for a 50-100% raise. How do I ask for this?


Probably too much info/backstory:

I got hired by a small company rapidly growing company to develop web apps and backend web stuff in general. Now I hadn't really done all that much with web but the experience so far is amazing. I'm the only real programmer for the entire company everything so far has been outsourced or programmed by my boss or the owner who have no time to do it anymore.

By chance I randomly applied an instantly took the job without regards to pay out of desperation. The experience in my opinion is by far worth taking the position as I only have 1 semester left with no previous internship experience. I get to nearly completely design how the system will work and implement it. I am given insane amounts of freedom and it's really enjoyable. 

Tomorrow is when I meet with my boss the owner to discuss what I've done and talk about where to go from here etc. On top I that I mentioned doing a co-op and he said we'd also talk about that at the meeting. I'm wondering how to go about doing this when I would need double the pay I'm currently getting to just be average for my uni. How should I go about asking for such a large raise? I don't honestly think they know I'm so severely underpaid as the only other interns they have are like social media and similar positions who are as happy as can be just to be paid. 

Should I mention the average pay for cs interns/my school(uni has info on their site for each years average intern salaries) or not. I hear vastly varying opinions on whether or not to mention typical pay for a position when discussing salary.

 I would really just appreciate any advice/thoughts regarding my position."

I've held coordinating and liaising positions in multiple, incredibly relevant, organizations and teams (all of which my interviewers were very interested in and impressed by).  
My gpa is horrible at a 2.2.  

I have held an IT and Marketing internship and a Business Analyst internship (total of two years experience). I recently had interviews at Fannie Mae for a Jr. Systems Coordinator/Jr. Project Manager contract position.  
The recruiter is offering me 50k.
I also have an offer from a less known company for a Jr. Business Analyst position, with 55k +benefits employment.  
Are these good salaries based on my track record? I'm incredibly thankful and don't want to pass this opportunity up but don't know which offer to take. Which would lend to a better career path? Would it be better to take the contract position so I can look for another job with that experience in the bank?"
2as9z3,2,2014-07-15,"Getting a ""real job"" after failing at being self-employed?",FailedSolopreneur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2as9z3/getting_a_real_job_after_failing_at_being/,"Graduated in August 2009 with a degree in Finance.  Didn't bother to participate in on-campus recruiting because I had been promised a job with the place I had spent the last 2 summers working an internship for (municipal gov't).  Got whacked by a hiring freeze, though, so no job.

Had thought about joining the Army (OCS), but found out I couldn't pass the medical after I had spent more than a year preparing for it (dropped from 280 lbs to &lt;200, but nobody told me eczema was a prohibited condition).

Eventually got some money together and started my own business in 2012 (had been kicking the idea around since late 2010).  Things have not gone well, frankly.  Had some decent success earlier on, but I'm just going deeper and deeper into debt, and my family is no longer able to support me financially.

How do I get a real job now?  I have no references (haven't had a boss or co-worker since 2008).  I have some decent domain-specific expertise/knowledge, but I don't have much (tangible) to prove that.  My main issues have been managing my supply chain (got tied to an unreliable vendor - switching is expensive, and wouldn't generate revenue before October at this point) - which means I am severely behind on shipping what orders I have generated, and none of my customers are particularly happy with me, so I can't use them for references.

Am I just completely fucked at this point?  The thought of accepting a &lt;$30k/yr job is incredibly depressing, though I realize that some income would be better than no income - and even if I did apply for those, I'm not confident that I would even be able to get them!

My knowledge and experience should qualify me for pretty good jobs (probably $55-65k/yr), but I have no idea how to sell myself to companies.  My resume says I've been self-employed since 2010 (because that's when I started working on my business plan).  I really don't know what to do at this point.

tl;dr - Graduated college, got hit by hiring freeze, started my own company, which is failing; how do I get a real job?"

Hey there! My name is Chris and I'm a grad student and full stack dev that's worked in research as well as on real world products. I could tell you that I'm a go getter and how I've got a great work ethic or I could sit here and rattle off all the projects I've worked on and what I've done for them but you can find that in my resume [here](https://my.indeed.com/me/ChrisManess). Instead I'd just like to take a moment and highlight two projects that I'm particularly proud of and detail what I did for them and maybe there's a need for someone like me at your company.

CoNNECT - Initially destined to be a project that everyone would forget about CoNNECT had a rocky start and it was the first project I worked on as an intern at Oak Ridge National Labs. CoNNECT was meant to be a  way for people to look at their energy usage and compare it to people in their neighborhood, zip, and city. I was given the project about a month in to my internship and told it's probably all I would work on for the remainder of the time. I developed some visualizations using Protovis.js(now known as D3.js) along with a web application that fit the bill. During this time I also worked with some energy usage experts to figure out other metrics that could be added in to the visualizations in order to help users better understand their numbers. What I developed over the last two months of that summer would go on to secure more funding for this particular project and today this project is being licensed to a company in the Knoxville TN area for further development. 

[Article 1](http://www.wate.com/story/16619405/new-ornl-technology-to-help-kub-customers-with-their-bill)

[Licensing Press Release](http://www.fiveworx.com/uncategorized/fiveworx-licenses-ornl-energy-analysis-tool/)

Twitter parser - This project was proposed by my boss and I was given free reign to see what could be done with the public 1% twitter stream. What insight could we obtain from tweets if any insights at all. We started up just in time to examine the 2012 London Olympics. From that large event we were able to determine the flow of people from event to event as well as catch a glimpse of the night life in London (unintentional but it's interesting none the less). As time went on I further developed the project to where it was a real time processing engine of tweets that could handle up to 1k tweets per second. I also developed an application that one could look at individual queries of tweets and used that to watch and predict the 2012 presidential election as well as look at other events such as the appointment of Pope Francis (There was quite a large following of people that believed it would be Angelo Scola). Eventually I created a pipeline that would allow anyone to write their own analysis algorithms and plug it in to check things like sentiment, grammar, and other interesting metrics. 

Anyways that's all I've got. You now know what kind of projects make me excited and some of the things that I can do for you. Again if you'd like a more comprehensive list please check out my resume. Feel free to message me on Reddit or use my personal email on my resume."
2asp66,6,2014-07-15,Account in Collections due to previous landlord who claimed I was driving his truck. What can I do?,ThanksLyingLandlord,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2asp66/account_in_collections_due_to_previous_landlord/,"Two summers ago, I had a summer internship across the country, and I rented a house from a person in Washington state. I moved back to Tennessee in August after staying at his house that summer. Last week I logged into a credit score website to find a mark on my score due to an account in collections that had recently been associated to my credit score account. After some investigating, I found out that my landlord signed a 'declaration of truth' that I was driving his vehicle at the time that he received a camera-issued traffic citation. The court then assigned the ticket to my name and attempted to contact me at the previous address. I moved two months prior to them sending the letter, and I had my mail forwarded through the postal service. However, the letter was sent to the previous address and returned to the court. I never received any documentation until seeing the collections account and my subsequent investigation last week. 

I spoke with him notifying him of the issue and that he would need to clear my name. Of course, he sounded dumbfounded that he had 'made that mistake' and he would take care of it. I am going to send him the collections information, and tell him to go to to the court and/or collections agency and clear my name through their records.

I have credit card receipts and papers from school that will be able to help me prove that I was living in Tennessee and did not make any transactions in Washington around that time period.

However, I am hesitant to believe that he will go to court and admit to perjury, which was the penalty for making false claims on the court's 'statement of truth' document. From my searches, it seems that perjury is a felony and has some harsh consequences.

What is the best thing for me to do? If I take him to court, what am I legally able to recover? I would have to pay for flight tickets from Detroit to Seattle, rental car or taxi fare, hotel room, food, lost time at work, attorney's fees, court costs, etc. Would I be able to recover all of this?

Please let me know any and all 'legal' advice!

**TL;DR**: Previous landlord falsely claimed I drove his car during camera issued ticket. I was never notified until last week. Account now in collections. How do I clear my name and recover all costs associated with doing so?"

Currently:
~3.55 GPA (3.5 in just math courses).
Math club participant (future president hopefully)
Eagle Scout with 100s of hours of community service
Econ minor
Business Analyst internship at John Hancock
(Another internship next summer)
All math classes I will graduate with:
Calc II, Calc III, Lin Alg, Ordinary Diff Eqs, Real Analysis, Group Theory, Probability and Stats, Stats and Stochastic Processes, Topology, Fourier Series &amp; PDEs and Numerical Analysis.
Planned GPA for graduation: ~3.65 (3.55-3.65 in my math courses).
I also talked to a professor and planned on doing research my last year along with my capstone.

Should I try and do anything else? My goal is a PhD in Math from Brown (easy commute for me). Can someone also tell me from personal experience the life of a PhD student? 60 hours work week then maybe working part time? Just want to try and plan ahead! :)"

I did no coop's or internships throughout my degree (which I somewhat regret), the only relevant job I had was working for a robotics professor at my school. The work I was doing wasn't web and it barely was Computer Science. That is about all my work experience that is a even a bit relevant. My other jobs that I took instead of looking for internships/coops were at a iron ore mine,  I worked for a full salary every summer. This allowed me to go to school with no student loans and now that I'm graduated I owe nothing to nobody.

Throughout my schooling I learned a lot in class, but most of the stuff I learned was stuff on my own. I learned IOS development in school, so I decided to go home and learn android. I learned python, so I decided to go experiment with Django. Then I found node, and so I dug into that. My final project for school was wrote in node. I can’t think of big projects to work on, but when someone gives me an idea then I can sit down and code it out in no time. I was in the top of my class with coding, I did well in the programming competitions held at school. I know data structures and algorithms very well. My problem isn't coding, it is coming up with ideas to do and staying focused. When I'm doing work for someone else, I barely ever take breaks, but when I work on my own projects then I'm always distracted.

So my problem now is that I can't get a job. I apply for about 10-20 jobs a week and never hear back from any of them. My resume and cover letters seem fine to me and everyone else who reads them (If you want a read I can PM them to you). My lack of real world experience is what is holding me back. So my question is, how should I go about getting a job/real world experience? 

TL;DR Have a Computer Science Degree, I have no experience, my fault, took higher paying job every summer to keep loans down. How do I get into the workforce without real world experience?"
2at2ip,1,2014-07-15,I feel like my application is exactly the reverse of everyone else's- what are my chances?,speakerlegs,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2at2ip/i_feel_like_my_application_is_exactly_the_reverse/,"It seems like all ""Will I/you get into graduate school?"" posts don't fit me, and I'll explain why. 

I go to a highly prestigious undergraduate school, especially for my field (the life sciences). I have considerable research experience for an undergraduate. I have essentially 4+ years of lab experience, strong personal connections with a few PIs, a research award, an internship, and a good summer REU over the years. Long story short, I will be able to list about 8 publications, about 3 of which I'm first author on, when I apply this year.

I've taken interesting and hard classes in the sciences, about 5 of them were graduate classes. I also have extremely good programming experience and a github account to show for it. My GRE scores are top 10%.

and the kicker is my GPA is a 3.0.

I feel as though I'm at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to graduate admissions. My school is extremely challenging, subject to grade deflation, and filled with the brightest students and I cannot help but feel that it would be trivial to maintain a 4.0 at other universities which aren't as challenging. Honestly when I see graduate students or REU students coming from unknown small liberal arts and unknown state schools, I feel as though I was utterly lied to as a high school student when told to go to the best school I could get into.

I just wonder what graduate schools think about applicants like me. Is there any weight given to undergraduate prestige at all? Does obvious research excellence override a lower GPA?"

I am currently on summer break, but am about to begin my 2nd year of University. However, while on break, I began to wonder how much the difference is in cost from US to Sweden, in terms of University and day-to-day. 

So, my questions are as follows:

* Which Swedish University is best for Information Systems/Computer Science?

* If you think this is a poor idea to do now, how long should I wait?

The initial idea is that I finish my 2nd year and then apply to Halmstad University, Stockholm University, or Blekinge University. 

As for details: 

* I do have a passport

* I have ~a years worth of actual experience in the field of IT, specifically in Help Desk/Server Management and Upkeep as both a Intern and a Part-Timer for the same company.

* I have about 30,000 USD that I can gather from my accounts and stocks to get a start somewhere, if that helps. Almost 35 if I sell things.

I don't know where I'd like to work, just that I want it to involve computers (though I'm leaning towards software development), and to pay well (life goal is to exceed £80k salary). I'm currently going into college (that's UK college; A levels) and looking to take Maths, Further Maths, Physics, Computing, and Music Technology at AS (with the possibility of dropping Music Tech if 5 AS levels prove to be too much work). Following on from that, I'd like to go to university (ideally Cambridge) to study Computer Science - to be completely honest, I'd like a PhD, but the FAQ suggests that this is less than wise.

Is doing a UK Master's worth it? What are these company-funded Master's degrees I've heard very briefly about - how can they work if you already have a job? I've also heard about internships that take place in the Summers between years of education - this seems like far too short a space of time; is that related to the differences between UK and USA?

I really have a lot of questions, but for the most part it's just confusion, and I don't even know what my questions are.

I read up on technology and have taken training classes / cert classes but I'm looking for something that I can implement or work on that is low cost or free. Last year I put together our monitoring system using Cacti and Zabbix. It was well received and we use it all the time to check on network heath and to monitor clients. Things are pretty much well documented here as well. 

To give you a brief overview of my organization. We use Spiceworks for our help desk and inventory. SEPM for antivirus and antivirus management. WSUS for updates. Cacti and Zabbix for monitoring. Most of our servers are virtual with Hyper-V. Production workers out in our plants, and 50% of the office users use RDP to log into their desktops from thin clients. The other 50% of office workers that include upper management work off laptops and desktops. 


When I first started there were a lot of problems, but now everything is running smoothly and I rarely get calls or have anything to work on. So with a bunch of free time on my hands, what is a project I can work on? "

2avrfk,69,2014-07-16,"I'm tech support, even when I'm not.",freakmn,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2avrfk/im_tech_support_even_when_im_not/,"Background: While in college, I took a part time job as an engineering intern for a Fortune 500 company. Even with no experience in the field, I had family that got me in the job. The division I worked in made parts that were used in the military and had to meet certain specifications. Each part was tested, and bad ones were discarded. My job was to take data from the database and make graphs that showed the quality of the parts that my boss could show off at meetings. I wasn't tech support, though had been a PFY in high school before that, so knew my way around a computer.

Being an intern, I was given a leftover computer. While 95% of the company was on Windows 2000 or XP, I was shackled with an NT4 machine. It was enough to get my work done, but the speed of the machine made me glad I was paid hourly.

One day, the company decided to roll out their new, custom-built, computer inventory software. This took inventory of the computer and added it to a database so IT could determine what computers need to be replaced, upgraded, etc. This was rolled out by sending out a link to download and install an IE6 activex control that needed to be installed and run on each machine in the company.

On my ancient NT4 machine, I first had to upgrade to IE6, then attempted to install the activex control on the machine. Installation seemed to go through successfully, so I continued on with the instructions and the control wouldn't run. The instructions contained a support e-mail in case of problems. I e-mailed the support, asking if there was a solution for this, gave all the relevant info, etc. A reply came and said that I was the only person having this problem, and that they will eventually send someone out to look at it.

Time passed, and I was eventually getting daily reminders that I hadn't run the inventory on my computer, and that I needed to ASAP. I eventually got fed up and investigated. Looked through the relevant registry entries and found a path that was hard coded to somewhere in ""Documents &amp; Settings"", which didn't exist in NT4. I found the correct path, updated the registry entry, and it worked! So, I sent off an e-mail that I got it figured out, and that they don't need to send someone out to work on it. Pleased with my work, I went home. End of story, or so I thought.

As an intern, I had flexible hours. I didn't come back to the office until 5 days later. When I returned, I found that my voicemail box was full, so I started listening:

First message, within an hour of my e-mail:

&gt; Hi freakmn, this is George from IT. We have found a few more people who have had the same issue as you. Could you let us know how you fixed it? Thanks.

Next message, the following morning:

&gt; Hi freakmn, this is George again. It looks like we have a lot of people with that problem. Tell us how you fixed it, so we can finish this project!

Next message, a couple hours later:

&gt; This is George again, how did you fix your issue? Call me.

Messages 4-10 each increased in panic. The last 5 or so messages were just heavy breathing, waiting for me to pick up the phone (I'm not sure that George understood how voicemail worked). I also had a couple dozen e-mails from him. So, I called back, explained that there was a hardcoded path in the registry entries on install, and that they wouldn't work on any NT4 machines. He sounded like he was jumping from joy, and upon hanging up the phone, I never heard from him again. A week later, we got an e-mail that the inventory project was complete, and thanked those who cooperated. No credit for the engineering intern that allowed the IT department to finish the job. Oh well.

TLDR: Tech support said I was the only one with a problem, until I fixed the problem, then they wanted the solution.

I'm having trouble figuring out a difference between the implementation on the demo page for the Telerik PivotGrid and the way other parts of my website are working (I didn't write the site, I am just updating it and adding some new stuff). In the demo, it is asking for a SQL DataSource, however I have not done this before in the .aspx page, only on the .vb pages.

So I've struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide for the majority of my life. My earliest memories of thoughts of suicide are as young as 7 or 8, later on (early teens) it became a regular thing and has existed continuously (now in my mid 20s). I know a large part of it is chemical. I was recently diagnosed with bi-polar 2. However, before things took a turn in the last year it was something I had a handle on. I would have a bad week every month or so and thoughts of suicide would be sprinkled here or there, but it was always something I was able to push past.  

I'll cover the contributing factors real quick. My parents have always been a negative factor. They were never and still are not emotionally supportive at all. At the worst of times I was a massive disappointment and there was something wrong with me, and at the best I was simply invisible. This has gotten worse since I left my job and was unable to find a new one. It's not that they care enough to be particularly disappointed it's more that I am interacting with them more now that I am unemployed and I feel massive amounts of shame when asking them for help in any regard. 

Speaking of my unemployment I have definitely hit a low since I left my job a little under a year ago. It became impossible to work there for a plethora of reasons I wont get into here, but I left expecting to be able to find something else considering my history (high performance in college with multiple very competitive internships and a full time job in my field before I graduated). However after about 5-6 months of looking and being rejected, including for positions that would traditionally lead to the job I had once had, and my wife being promoted to full time at her work I gave up on the job search. I realized how foolish I had been for not just sucking it up at my job and how I threw away the only thing in my life I could truly say I was proud about. 

Finally the biggest factor is my marriage. About 5 months ago things fell apart with her. Things have been simultaneously becoming better and absolutely unbearable. She doesn't love me and would prefer being a single mother of two (the children are really the only reason I haven't done it yet) than being with me. This is all my fault as we had children before we were ready and a lot of my stress associated with that manifested itself in ugly ways and I ended up blaming her for a lot of stuff. I deserve the pain of loosing her love. Anyway in the past 5 months of talking and marriage counseling we've both gotten to a point where we are less stressed by the whole situation and are learning to live with each other with absolutely no intimacy, emotional or otherwise. However, the flip side of that is that when time goes by and she has made tremendous efforts to heal but no progress is made it agonizes me. I have gone from believing it to be a temporary thing that will be healed with time to worrying that she will never feel for me the way she once did and I will be stuck in this. To cap it all off I she tells me at least once a week how she doesn't want to be with me and she would rather be alone and how the only reason she hasn't left is because she knows it would devastate me. 

So all of that brings me to the point I am at now. Between the lack of any emotional support and the continual fuck ups on my part and now the fact that I know that by existing I am preventing the woman I love's happiness I am edging closer and closer to pulling the plug. In the last couple months as the fact that I have destroyed my relationship with this woman, yet another great thing that I didn't deserve in the first place, seems more certain I've gone from my occasionally easily brushed off moments of suicidal thought to researching different methods (my primary concerns are that I want it to be nonviolent and not leave a mess for anyone while also having a quite high percentage of success) and now to waiting for the right time to do it where I know I won't be interfered with and that my daughters won't be the ones to find me. I've already put so much pain into her life and I know I couldn't live with separation yet she wants nothing more than for me to not be in her life. I feel like to set her free is the only way to amend for all the pain I've already caused. The sooner I let others start dealing with my inevitable departure from the world the sooner they can heal and the sooner I can move on to being nothing but a distant memory. "

So, I just finished my sophomore year at a state school. I am a Mathematical Science major. My GPA is 3.85.

Problem: I don't want to graduate school.

I was recently told/read in a couple places that if you are the least bit unsure of it, you shouldn't go to graduate school. I really don't think I am cutout for grad school. I love math, but I don't think I want to go to school for several more years. Plus, I can't see myself doing research/academia. I just want to finish undergrad and get a decent job.

I did some reading on /r/math and the consensus seemed to be to learn how to program. Now, my Math Sci program has a couple pertinent courses to CS: (1) an intro to programming class (intro to Python), (2) object-oriented design and problem solving (intro to C++). From high school AP Comp Sci, I have a bit of experience with Java. I'm a bit rusty on all three of these though. I've read that it's recommended I learn R and a couple other languages. I have taken a course in applied algebra (Hamming codes, BCH, RSA, etc; FWIW, I really enjoyed this class), and I'm about to take an introduction to combinatorics/graph theory and numerical methods (CS focused; put this off a bit).

But, down to my main question. I'm a tad concerned from reading around /r/math that this degree alone, as in Math Sci, will not be enough to get a job. I'm fairly far in with this degree. I just have to complete my foreign language core and one more sociology class (wut). I could try to add CS as a double major, which I expect to take another year on top of the rest of my full-ride scholarship time (meaning 3 years; I prefer to take a normal class load, and the CS course load at my school is pretty much an engineering course load). The other options would be to start studying for the actuarial exams, or join the military in some capacity (family tradition). 

I'm just unsure this would be enough either. I haven't done any internships (didn't think about it). On top of that, the part-time job I have doesn't really come close to pertaining to math or computer science (was first a favor to a friend; complicated). I just have no idea what to do.

Do you think I should get a double major, or am I just paranoid? Is programming/software developer a viable option? How would you go about getting a job in my shoes? Thanks.

PS: Sorry if this is redundant. I searched for similar questions on here, but none of the answers were of depth I would have liked to see."

I'm a local currently residing in Singapore and planning to make a jump to the other side of the world. Its kind of a long term plan so not in any rush because I'm still a conscript in the military here at minimum wage in a country with high cost of living and heard that the grass is greener on the other side (note that this is from my point of view). Would like to move to the US to further my career after I'm done with the military.

I'm a Diploma holder in Information Technology (Game Development) and have since moved into Front-End development self taught with some experience under my belt. Planning to work for the experience and save up for a few years or so first to settle financially before making the move and here goes the list of questions.


I'm not a degree holder and not sure if I'll be taking one so which work visa should I be looking at?
 
And how do I go about finding the job in Singapore? or should I be going over to do the job hunting?

What state should I be looking for? I heard Manhattan has many IT startups when my friend went for his internship, but I'm open to suggestions.

I know the cost of living varies from state to state but hopefully somebody could break it down to me in terms of food, necessities and rent etc and possibly getting a place to call my own.

Will I be able to convert the work visa into a PR in the future? Anything else I should take note of?

These are long term plan so I'm in no rush to make the move. Maybe I'll travel over and get a feel of the environment as well (: Thanks for listening and sorry for the long post! (:"

2ax4zp,4,2014-07-16,Should I interview for an internship if I just barely accepted a non tech job less than a week ago?,csThr0waway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ax4zp/should_i_interview_for_an_internship_if_i_just/,"So a little over Two months ago I applied for an internship at a couple of local tech companies, but after not hearing from any of them in over a month I decided to apply to other non tech jobs and about five days ago I got hired at a non tech place. Then about two days ago I got an email from one of the companies i applied at saying

&gt;I'm not sure if you're still in the running for the internship but we would like to set up a phone interview for sometime this week.

I'd much prefer an internship and gaining some professional experience as a programmer over my current job, but the way they worded their email saying ""**I'm not sure if you're still in the running for the internship**"" and the fact that I don't have a lot of experience in Rails (I'm more familiar with Java than Ruby) and some the other languages/frameworks they use, makes me wonder if it'll even be worth interviewing. Also the internship is only 3-4 months where my current  job is for as long as I want to work there and I'd be making about $15/hour both places.

So I guess my questions are, is it normal to not hear back from a company until several months after you've applied and also what do you think they mean by ""**I'm not sure if you're still in the running for the internship**""? Shouldn't they know since they're recruiters at the company, and why would they want to interview me if they don't even know if they're looking for an intern. What would you do if you were me?

I guess I have nothing to lose by interviewing and if nothing else I'll get experience interviewing for a programming position, which I've never done before since I'm only a freshman. It just sounds like they're not really sure if they will hire me and I don't really want to continue to stress out over this internship and possibly risk losing my current job and end up not having a job again.

tl;dr I applied for an internship and didn't hear back until after I had already accepted another job. Should I keep my current job or should I interview at this tech company even though I might not get hired and if I do get hired I would have to quit my current job during my training and most likely never be able to work there again?"

I apologize in advance if the username is confusing. I made this account to have a bit of fun with the typos people make when talking about /u/airz23.

This is my story. To make things easier, I split the chronicle into what I consider to be the different chapters of my life. 

**Disclaimer:** I will tell these tales *exactly* as I remember them. I will only change names to protect the innocent. Nothing else (including vulgarities) will be obfuscated. If you can't handle the occasional f-bomb, close the fucking tab.

----------


###The Saga Begins
This chapter is where everything begins. It contains the tales of how I first began my adventure into the world of technology (and support).
####Arc 1: Slow Beginnings - The Innocent Years
These tales document the last years of my time in junior high (middle school). In this arc, I start learning about technology, and supporting the townsfolk and close family.
####Arc 2: Rise of a Bastard
This might be the longest arc in my story. These are the tales of how I became the unofficial tech department and BOFH of my high-school. 
####Arc 3: The Freelancer
A continuation of Arc 1, this story arc is a bit different than the rest. While it *does* take place during the Arc 2, it's and ongoing tale that spills into the Dumbing of Age. 

###Dumbing of Age - The College Years
Named after one of my [favorite webcomics](http://www.dumbingofage.com/), this chapter tales is all about life at the university and in the dorms. 
####Arc 4: Gizmos and Gadgets
I was going to become a computer engineer, until I met the other students.
###Arc 5: Soundcheck One-Two, Soundcheck One-Two
This arc is about the people and technology in the world of broadcasting. Everybody wanted to be famous, but no-one knew how.
###Arc 5 1/2: The Scoop
All about how I met a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor, became a journalist, and learned to be nerdy again.

###Arc 6: The Internship
This is about my most recent foray in data-journalist. I moved to Washington, D.C. and work at a publication focused on international affairs. Oh, and I became unofficial office tech support.

----------
**Note:** I am currently living in Arc 6. There aren't quite as many stories, but there should be more in the coming weeks. The continuity of my story will *not* be linear. The numbering system will be more like the Dewey Decimal System than a chronology.

And because this is /r/talesfromtechsupport, here's a short story that happened just a few weeks ago.


####The Internship #1- ""We don't need any plugins!""
The company I work for has both a regular print publication and a website. The website has a *lot* more content than the print edition, and it's my job to make the data-visualizations look nice.

One of the mapping tools I've been reading up on is QGIS. While QGIS is fairly straightforward. My supervisor, Kim, wants me to deploy QGIS to a few of my data-viz coworkers. Like most things with her, it can't be a simple or straightforward. I have to document everything (with screenshots) that needs to be downloaded and installed. Every freaking step, including dragging-and-dropping files to different folders. Argh.

As with a lot of UNIX-y software, QGIS has a couple dependencies to install before the main package. On my machines, it's a simple

    sudo apt-get install qgis

Nice and easy, right? Wait, no. Every other dev has a Mac or Windows computer.

So, I make a list of the packages (including external libraries that needed to be installed. After reading through it, Kim didn't look too happy.

Kim: Ariz23, I told you we *don't* need any plugins. You need to get rid of these (points to dependencies). 

Ariz23: I remember, there aren't any plugins on the list. We need those files for QGIS to work.


Kim: But we don't need any plugins

*Internally: You're been learning to program for over a month. You should fucking know this by now..*

After ~15 minutes of explaining, the idea of dependencies finally clicked.

 I couldn't be too upset, though.  On my first day, she bought me a $10 burger and fries. Kim is one of the best managers I've ever had. She's just a bit slow when it comes to programming... and software installation.

But also, I have so many ideas and the boom of Android is getting bigger and bigger and there is SO MUCH you can do with it, that I am not sure if I should simply dig into it right now! (Specially with the new [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) course. (Although would have to catch up with some java ....maybe...or not really. 
I also love the fact that almost anything you can think about you could build an app for it and literally change the world (or sell it to Facebook for $1B)

|

My questions are, (and I know it is broad and it depends on a lot of things):
  *what will help me more in todays market? Is pursuing a deeper understanding of C++ really awesome or is Android Development really needed today.
  *considering future classes, would it be worth it to do Android Dev now (and during the semester) and let C++ take its course with the curriculum?
  *For people who work with Android, is it as cool as it looks, can you get good (useful for a company) at it enough for an internship or to build interesting products? (in  let say 4-6 months)

|

But yeah, sorry for the long post and thank you beforehand for any help. I know its maybe a bit weird of choices but I think I should stick to either one of those for now, since I am not a genius coder or anything but I do really enjoy programming so that is a plus.....right? haha

I'm wrapping up an internship this week at a large national corporation. I've been offered a spot in their rotational program starting post-graduation. 


That being said, I'm highly passionate about starting off my career off as a consultant. Recruitment for that begins in September (well after this job offer expires). 


My credentials are decent but nothing MBB-worthy:

-3.6/4.0 GPA

-Solid EC experience (leading multiple clubs) + 1st place awards at case comps

-Good work experience at a large Telco + an international tech consulting firm


I'm gunning for Big 4 consulting arms, as well as OW/Accenture etc and have been networking extensively over the summer at cocktails and firm tours


I've been practising case interviews all summer and believe I could have a real chance at securing a spot at one of those firms. At the same time, I don't want to turn down this job offer just to be unemployed. 


Reddit consultants, what would you do in my case?

Would I hinder my career if I went to said smaller company compared to the well known brand name that  I currently have on my cv. I'll get paid more staying here, (couple of £ks) more but the other company has better personal benefits.

2b18cg,6,2014-07-18,The Campus Gardens Project,LMSamara,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2b18cg/the_campus_gardens_project/,"It all started with a patch of grass.  That's all it was – a circular dried patch of dried grass that drew my attention one late afternoon in early July.

But to back up from there, I've been around reddit for a while.  Some of the stories and lives people have shared here are downright tragic.  I never once thought I would have to contribute something to a place that would actually listen to me, however, and wouldn't just think I'm babbling crazy.

This month in particular has been a harsh one, with personal issues and relationship problems across every board I'm playing on, so I threw myself into my practicum work for my degree. I decided to strike out into bold waters, and instead of getting an internship or TAing for a class, I would volunteer up at my campus gardens and run a blog about it throughout the summer. Things were rocky at first, given how run-down and underfunded the whole program is, and how the director, Michelle Harsh, recently quit so there's a power vacuum, but I ended up just clearing a plot of land for myself and running my own personal garden. It wasn't what my intentions were at first, but it's what I had to work with.  Better yet, I had no one to report to except myself, and I had thrown the metaphorical direction manual out just like I had when suggesting the practicum.

Brave little pioneer in a new world.  Anyways, I have *such* tendency to ramble, so I digress.

The garden plots are located just a mile away from the main campus, but given how they're in an overgrown, neglected meadow with a dirt road leading to the greenhouse, and that it rains mostly everyday here, I opt to drive.

And so here we begin, with a patch of dried grass.

It was still overcast from the rolling thunderstorms in the area, but I risked the rain since it would be cooler outside without the blazing sun on my back.  The routine was an easy one. I locked the car, pocketed my keys, and walked through the mid-shin grass around the length of the greenhouse till I reached the end where the young plants were stored.  Outside in this area were several metal tables, racks, sinks, and tools.  The plants here were free for anyone who owned a plot to take.  I had already rescued what I could, nearly half and either potted them or put them in my plot. Everything left would most likely die, since no one but me appeared to be watering them or putting them upright after a heavy storm passed through.

I wheeled out the only working wagon left, and entered into the greenhouse to get the standard tools: rake, shovel, hoe, and gloves.  I had already entered the building on several occasions, and it was always the same as when I had left it.  Truly, no one ever came out here unless one of the RAs brought a group of students out for volunteer work.  Even then, I always tagged along, hopeful to snag a few quotes or interviews for the blog.

So of course I noticed the open door leading into the actual part of the greenhouse.  The thing is, that area was out of bounds for students this year, since a Bio professor was doing an experiment in there this summer.  And before you jump to conclusions, relax.  It's just testing which watering methods work best with which grapevine species.

The tools were hanging on the far side of the wall, running perpendicular to the open door, so I could look over and see inside.  I froze and hung the hoe back up, venturing into the main area.

Every single vine was dead.  And there had been a lot of vibrant vines in here last time I checked, about fifteen in every row, and there were six of those.

""Shit,"" I muttered, taking one leaf between my forefinger and thumb as gingerly as I could, only to have the whole thing fall apart.  ""Oh damn, that's not good.""  A quick look around told me nothing seemed amiss, and the doors in the greenhouse itself were all locked.  It's a greenhouse, I figure.  The water must have broken, and it's so damned hot in here, no wonder they fried.

I leave, close the door, and decide to email the director of Civic Engagement about it when I went home.  I resumed gathering up the tools and head outside to the plot.  The day resumed as usual with watering, weeding, and taking pictures for growth comparison.

It was as I was getting into my hot as hell car that it struck me as odd that the greenhouse was actually quite cooler inside than out.  There were fans running along the length of the building, so noisy they became white noise to the songs of the meadow birds.  The plants had been fine yesterday, to my knowledge, but I hadn't really checked, you know?  Maybe if the professor was keeping up to date on her project I wouldn't have to feel so guilty about having her vines die.

It was as I was pulling out that I saw, on the far end of the greenhouse and just beyond one of doors the tanned, brittle patch of circular grass.  Which, of course, I thought nothing eerie there whatsoever.  One of the vents must be positioned right there, which is part of the problem indoors.  Another thing to email the director about.

He never got back to me. He still hasn't gotten back to me about any of this. I stop by his office at the CCE and am told he just stepped out.  This would make me suspicious if I wasn't so freaked and simultaneously pissed.  Having worked alongside the CCE for my four years at this institution, no one ever answers a god damned email, not even when I really really need them to.

The plants outside, a few days later, were all dead, and those I *was* keeping a close eye on.  Racks full of young pepper, tomato, and broccoli plants were dried to husks.  The basil, thyme, lettuce, flowers – all of it was dead.  More than freaked, I felt upset, like I was a failure.  I had failed to keep the most simple things alive, and I actually cried at the amount of death for plants.  Sure, I felt silly about it, but this was like the outdoor center at Lowe's with the amount of plants I was keeping care of here, and for all of them to just die overnight?  Especially when it wasn't so hot out?  This area isn't going through a drought by any means, and we've already had several flash flood warnings from the major nearby river.

At least the plants in the garden plot were alive and kicking, and I took care of those for a few more days until I went home for the weekend.

When I came back to the greenhouse that following Monday, there was a heavy silence through the air.  The place was always filled with bird calls and bees, thunder threatening in the distance.  Now, when I cut the engine and radio and stepped outside, I could feel my muscles tense and teeth on edge before I really could understand why.

I was a little freaked at this point, jumping at the slightest brushes of grass, checking over my shoulder. I had been coming out here by myself for hours, every day for the past two months, and now, suddenly, I was afraid. The sky was darkened by the storm cell that had just passed through, giving the world that sickly grey-green wash of color.  The grass and weeds in the meadow loomed over my head now, though around the greenhouse it kept itself down to a manageable state. I could just see the crest of my school's chapel, which was the only indication that I wasn't alone for miles and miles, in wilderness.

In the greenhouse, the atmosphere was worse because of the *smell*.  It was dank, and musty, but also rotten.  The door was open again too, which freaked me out since it had been closed Friday night.  I tiptoed into the room, checking corners and expecting someone to jump out and grab me, a lame jump scare.  I picked up a hoe and held onto it as I entered into the greenhouse.

The lights had gone out and wouldn't turn back on, but that was fine since enough light was filtering in from outside still.  The professor had never gotten back to me either – the story of my summer life – about her dead plants, and the water system was apparently still broken.  I walked the length of the building, past the crumbling plants, to the now unlocked back door.  You can see the locks from far away.  They're like the size of egg timers, and when the nozzle is up, that means they're unlocked.

I could also see something black and distorted, just beyond the door, right in the middle of the patch.

I took a breath, or tried to as the smell was overpowering at that moment, and held my hoe like a little scared girl from the country would, and opened the door.  I screamed and jumped back, letting it swing back shut, and began to back away, checking nothing had heard me.

A dead cat.

I know, reddit, dead cats, not a good mix, but believe me.  It was a dead tabby cat, and it was gruesome, kind of dismantled, but not, like, eaten.  All the bits were *there*, just gone wrong somehow.  I only caught a glimpse of it really, but the smell was even worse now that I had wafted it in, and I was trying not to vomit as I made my way back to the grave of dead plants.  I still can't get the image of its face out of my mind.  Its lips were fully pulled back, almost like it was grinning, but the grin was too wide for a cat, like someone had ripped its skin fully off.  And its whole body was arranged at odd disjointed angles, right there in the middle of that patch.

Needless to say, I hurried through my watering, let the weeds have their pass for today, and didn't bother with an email.  Tuesday, I walked into the center for Civic Engagement and met with the student intern of the summer, the one who always covered for the director.

""Hey LMSamara,"" she said with a smile.  ""What can I help you with today?  Jay is out – Res Life meeting.""

""Yeah, I don't need him.  Hey, Becky, up at the gardens…have you been up there recently?  Anybody been up there recently?"" I asked.

She gave a petite frown, and looked away, continuing to do whatever work she had at her computer.  ""Sorry, a little busy. Give me a moment?""

""That's fine. I got time,"" I said, crossing my arms and leaning into the doorway.

A little pause drifted between us before she looked up and smiled.  ""No, I haven't. Why? Anything wrong?""

I shrugged.  ""The water in the greenhouse is broken.  All of Doctor Willard's stuff is dead.""

""Oh yeah, shame about that,"" Becky replied, looking shameful enough.  So someone had at least gotten my email and passed it along.  ""She hasn't gotten back to me either. But what else?"" she probed.

""There was a dead cat up there,"" I said.  I didn't mean to be blunt, but I was starting to panic.  ""And like, some weirdy type of stuff is happening…maybe,"" I continued, losing my resolve.

All I wanted to hear was- ""Oh? Poor thing.  Well, it might have been a fox.  We have a lot around here."" – exactly that.  A rational reason for those small little incidental occurrences happening up there.

I remember the feeling of buying into that secure notion.  It's a shaky, tender kind of peace that you buy with a lie, especially when it's a lie you've told yourself.  ""Yeah, that's possible.  All right, thanks! Just thought you should know,"" I said, attempting to leave out the door then.

Becky stood up a little bit to stop me.  ""You said something about other 'weird' things though?""

I hesitated, and the peace trembled.  Irrationality crept back in as I stepped back into the cramped office.  ""Dried grass outside, is all.  Like the plants.""

Becky frowned.  Ah, she really hadn't been up there in a while then, which I thought was funny given how she was the student in charge of it all.  ""Which plants?""

And so I explained to her the other little incidentals, alluding to the atmosphere and the mood up there some days.  In broad daylight, how a chill will creep down your spine at the same time the whole world there in the meadow stops and grows quiet, a hushed whisper.  How the greenhouse smelled a bit, and not the comforting earthy scents of soil, damp earth, and manure.  I didn't say these things like I do now, but when I was done, give or take three minutes to explain and tiptoe around what I really wanted to say, Becky had sat back down, her mouth drawn into a frown, and her brow furrowed.  She didn't interrupt this entire time, and I appreciated her for that.

""I'll stop by there tomorrow morning,"" she said with finality.  At that point, I wasn't sure if Becky believed me in the slightest, and I'm not sure I'll ever really know or not.

Because Becky went missing the next day, and I don't mean to be blunt or anything, but I'm the type of person prone to panic."

I'd really appreciate some insight.,crisis0fconfidence,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b1j4m/advice_wanted_im_seriously_second_guessing_my/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm a CS student that will be graduating this year. Throughout school I've done fairly well for myself. I will have around a 3.5 cumulative and I'm wrapping up my second internship right now. My first internship was a normal three month over the summer gig, and I learned more there than at any time in school. It really helped me gain confidence as a developer and look forward to getting a real job.

My second internship has been much less productive. I was taken on as a web dev with zero experience in web. The problem is that the office is much smaller than my previous internship experience, and as such there wasn't nearly the same kind of infrastructure aimed towards making sure the interns were educated and could contribute alongside full time devs. I fell behind, got embarrassed, and feel like I've learned nothing. 

Now I have this, what I feel to be, black mark on my resume. I don't have the skills in web that would correlate to the amount of time I spent at this company. I have learned a whole lot about the business processes behind designing and implementing production level software, but not the nitty gritty of creating web apps.

The jobs I'm looking at will almost all be web dev. They will be with bigger companies who are focused on making sure their new grads are learning. Rationally I feel like I shouldn't be so down on myself, but I can't help it. I am almost completely useless at this, and I hate myself for taking this position. 

How should I approach these next few months to get over this hurdle? Should I be brutally honest with companies that I apply to? How can I get past feeling like a failure because of this internship? I know I can't be the only one to have gone through an experience like this or felt similarly to how I do now. I really need some advice to help get me back on track because right now I feel completely inadequate for the jobs that I want to earn.

1. Join Air Force ROTC
2. Major in Computer Science
3. Use the Air Force as a stable job/income while I get my feet on the ground
4. Start a business/find a high paying job and leave the military.

Basically I want to make a lot of money in my life (And don't worry, I enjoy CS and I'm not in it just for the money.) I have been told that I should intern and get hired at the company right out of college, but I was told that if I do ROTC and join the military then I won't be able to get hired for a few years so I'll lose job opportunities. But I was also told that companies like to hire people with experience in the military. 

Am I hindering my chances to find a high pay job/start a nice business by joining the military right out of college? I just want to make sure I choose the right path in order to reach my goal in life:

So I'm going to be a senior in college next year studying Computer and Information Technology and I have an internship right now doing some Business Analysis work and some other random IT stuff but I'm not really sure it's for me. I didn't do a Computer Science major because programming all day is not really something I enjoy (I do enjoy programming I just wouldn't want to be programming in front of a computer all day), however I think finding and searching for bugs seems like something that I would like. I have never done any QA before so I don't know where exactly a good spot to start is. I'm sure there are popular tools out there that people use but I'm not sure if jumping straight into a tool is something that I should do.

Any suggestions or tips as to where to begin? Is QA something I should avoid if I'm not a great developer?

Thanks!

Also is being a QA a job that someone does for a career or is it usually something someone starts at to get them into a software dev. job?"
2b2nw0,12,2014-07-18,How weird would a 2nd bachelor's look after having completed a master's?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2b2nw0/how_weird_would_a_2nd_bachelors_look_after_having/,"Hey reddit, I'm hoping some people (who look at resumes) can give me some basic advice.

Basically, I have a B.A. in English and an M.S. in Public Relations. I am dissatisfied with my education, direction in life, and career options (being a professional liar in marketing). I feel like I didn't push myself enough in college, and I am running out of time to just ""self-study"" my way into the field.

I have no debt and inherited a bit of money from my grandmother (not a ton, but enough for more education). I have already decided that I am going to get another degree and don't want to be talked out of this...I am going for it as a long-term investment. Maybe a related degree doesn't matter now, but what about 10-20 years from now when the world and economy is more tech driven? I feel like this is one of the best possible ways I can actually invest my grandmother's money. It is also in part a personal quest for me, since I am not proud of my degrees at all, and would like at least one that isn't completely eye-roll inducing.

For $11k I can get a 2nd B.S. in information technology from a good accredited state school, only 10 classes required. The interesting thing is that although it isn't a CS degree, I can do what is essentially a computer programming-track, where I take a data structures class, database class, java, C+, C, etc language classes, and networking technologies of my choosing. I don't have to take any additional non-related classes. This route just seems really practical and would get me off the ground to meet ""related degree"" requirements and catch me up in the skills.

I should mention that I do have html/css/javascript experience and do some of that stuff at my job, but it's just at a lower level and just from codecademy/other online learning resources. So I am not just considering programming on a whim. I feel like i've hit a wall with the online learning stuff.

I am also considering the master's in CS route, but it would be at least 2-3 times as much money and also would take more time as I do pre-reqs and can only do a few classes a semester. The classes also seem to not be exactly what I want: I just want to have a solid foundation in programming. I am worried that another master's will make me less desirable, as though I expect tons of money (I don't). I may still do this option, but I am looking to see if it's the only way.

**My biggest concern is how this will look to employers. Will they see a 2nd bachelor's sequentially after a Master's as a logical thing (like ok, this guy had a lib arts degree and then got some technical knowledge at the undergrad level). Or, will they think it's bizarre/weird/alienating that I would do undergrad classes after doing a grad degree?** I honestly don't care about the master's...I consider it a mistake I wish I could trade in for a worthwhile bachelor's.

My other idea is simply to **not include my past education on the resume and only include the IT degree**, but I am also not sure if this ""lying"" is a liability that could get me in trouble?

Yes, I plan to continue my self-study, do personal projects, quit my job and do some internships, and pick up certs etc, but I don't want to be limited to just that."

My wife is pursuing her doctorate, and after a lot of hard work and time, she was able to get an internship this year. We had hoped to connect with a site that didn't require us to move, but, we ended up feeling lucky to get an internship at all once it was all said and done. It's extremely competitive out there. 

It was about 3 months before they told her exactly where the site would be, we knew would be one of two places in Missouri, we currently live in Arkansas. During this 3 months we find out we're pregnant, it was unplanned. The internship starts in early September, the baby is due in late November. The site is willing to work with her on maternity leave, no problem there. The problem is, I'm the breadwinner in the household. Having to quit my job and find a job in this specific place has been quite an undertaking. I've always moved from one job to the next, knowing well ahead of what I would be doing, this time, things are different. The goal is to find a job in x town...

Insurance is my biggest concern right now. I have decent coverage, our first child was born last year (planned), and it was something we were able to plan for and deal with. This pregnancy was unplanned, and now I'm debating whether I should stay here (we own our house here) while she moves 3 hours away with our son and we get together on the weekends until the baby is here, just short of 3 months of back and forth. Or, if I try to find a new job there, and pray that my insurance will be good, and cover her since her insurance thru the site will not be great, and we still don't know the full details of it. 

Anyway, if you've been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear how you handled this.

2b2sdz,1,2014-07-18,24 yo Aerospace Engineering grad student. With student loan debt. Seeking advice on how to land that 'first' job/position.,temo89,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2b2sdz/24_yo_aerospace_engineering_grad_student_with/,"Hi Reddit

As the title states I am 24, male, living in California. I am currently a graduate student at a pretty prestigious, accredited university majoring in Aerospace Engineering.

I plan on graduating within a few months (hopefully, research is a lot of work) and I am bit worried about finding a job once I am finished. 

The back story to this all is that: This past quarter I applied to various summer internships/co-op positions with the hope of gaining experience, connections and being able to finally support myself (i.e start paying off my student loans). I applied to various of the big industry names : Northrop Grumman, Boeing, General Atomics etc.. And I received about 5 or 6 call backs/emails for jobs and internships for the summer. But to no avail , none of them have come through. My plan was to work and get an internship for the summer and come back during the fall to finish up my thesis. 

I tailor my resume to specific positions I feel and sometimes know I am qualified for. But, after a couple formal telephone interviews, followed by a couple technical phone/email interviews I have yet to hear back from anybody. I emailed back H.R. and hiring managers who contacted me , about possible updates and new information about the jobs, but have yet to be contacted (its been a couple week and is a little frustrating because I feel as though I have been left in the dark). The interviews via the phone and emailing went well and on a couple occasions was told by H.R that they were very very impressed by my resume and experience and would try to bypass and send my resume directly to Hiring managers etc. 

My questions are: What am I doing wrong? Is there any way to better my chances of being hired as an entry level engineer for positions I feel I am qualified for? How do I get H.R and Hiring Managers to get back to me (if at all possible).

I'm just a bit worried because I feel as though if I cant get an internship position for the summer, that I wont be able to get a permanent job once I graduate (which is scary for multiple reason). Any and all advice would be much appreciated and well taken. Thanks and much love. "
2b2zfi,1,2014-07-18,What to learn next or improve on?,kevinvhengst,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2b2zfi/what_to_learn_next_or_improve_on/,"Right now I'm mostly working with html, css, javascript and php. But i want more. Obviously i could improve the things i know currently, but doing new things is also a lot of fun.

The problem is, in programming there is so much going on. Frameworks, language's and so on. And since im just programming for fun and my study, not for a company, there is no-one to tell me what to learn. When i did an internship at a company i was forced to work with php, which is fine. I get motivated to do so that way. 

I can teach myself quite well, but i want to learn to much at the same time. last two months i started with Java for android, Python (and even on Django), Node, a bit of Ruby. Everytime when i read something cool about a language or a framework i want to try it out. But as you can imagine, learning 6 different things at the same time isn't working at all, atleast not for me. 

The reason for me making this post is to ask some advice. As i said earlier in my post, when someone tells me to learn this or that, I can much easier focus on just that. So it might sound weird, but if a lot of people tell me something like: ""Learn Node, that is with great value"", gives me some ""power"" to get into it more serious without being distracted by all the other nice stuff the programming world has to offer.

I know it's a strange question/request, and that a lot is based on opinion, but maybe i few reply's with some valuable info would be awsome!

The only thing i know about myself right now is that I'm not that much into mobile yet. I preffer making web applications and such. Although i could get into html5 apps with my html, css and js skills. 

Hopefully my question is clear and not to weird, and hopefully i'll get a few helpful responses! 



Also if someone is a good mentor, and good time and willing to learn me anything valuable, I would happely accept those offers! I got a lot of dedication, just a bit of a struggle of knowing what i want! =)"

My degree was Architectural Eng, but there is no Arch E version of the test so I took the Civil version as I took quite a few of the same classes as them and I ended up bombing a few sections pretty hard and failed the test.   Its mostly my own fault for not researching the test more beforehand and actually buying study materials and preparing for it but as a poor college student I could barely afford to eat so seeing the expensive prep courses made me not even consider it.  I went into it thinking it wouldn't be too difficult as it would be open book, I'm bad a memorizing but I've always been good at tests when the formulas are given.  Another factor was my school didn't prepare me for the test as parts of the test covered classes that my degree didn't even require.   I came out of the test pretty demoralized and after I got my results, I was pretty angry and ended up not even attempting to take it again.

My degree program also has the lowest rate of passing the test (65%) so that has also been a big part of why I'm biased against the test as my degree puts me at a disadvantage as I'm having to take the ""other disciplines"" test which covers a lot of material I'd be clueless about or take the civil test (which I did) and has sections I'm clueless about.     

I only had a mediocre GPA (2.7 ish) and my hometown didn't have many places to apply too so I never got a internship plus not having the EIT pretty much sealed my fate that I wouldn't get a job with any engineering company after school.  I did a terrible job of networking during school and all my friends were in other engineering majors where having an FE isn't needed so none of them studied for the test as they didn't need it.  So without any contacts in my own field, I'm coming to reddit for advice about the FE test.

After graduation, I got a job with a city government as a construction inspector enforcing ICC building codes and I've been there for 6.5 years now, I made a decent wage but very low compared to what an engineer should have 6.5 years after graduating (42k usd but good govt benefits) .  I actually really like the job and I enjoy doing it but I pretty much don't have anywhere to promote too and it will be years before some of the people above me retire and open up promotion opportunities.   The more years that pass the more I feel like I'm wasting my degree(that I'm still heavily in debt for) and I trying to figure out where to go with my career and that is why I have been thinking about taking the FE/EIT test again to give my career a boost and maybe open up some career opportunities.


My questions: 


1)  have any of you passed the FE after being out of school for so long.  I have lots of free time so studying isn't an issue but its been so long since I was in school that I'm afraid I'm going to be wasting my time and fail it again.  I took mechanics of materials 10 years ago for example.  

2) My 2nd question is for Arch E's specifically: did you take the civil or other disciplines test?  How did you study for the sections you didn't take classes on?

3) Engineers that haven't passed the FE.  What have you done with your career and what other career options do I have to improve my salary without the FE?

4) do you have any links or know of any websites where I can find free or cheap study resources?

5) have there been any major changes to the test in the last 7 years?  I see its available to take a computer testing centers now (I've been there for my ICC testing).   How many times can you take it in a year?  I know it used to only be offered a couple times a year and the results took forever to get.

TL:DR.  Failed the FE 7 years ago, considering taking it again as I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my career."

I interned at Bosch for 2 summers during schooling in the same group.  After graduation I was hired into this group full time.  I will have worked there for 2 months at this point.  Before accepting this job/receiving Bosch's offer I interviewed with Apple.

I just heard back from Apple today and they want me to have a phone interview with the manager in one of the groups there and then find a date to do an on campus interview which they would be paying to fly me out there, all expenses paid.  

After the Apple interview I was really excited because it is my dream to move west and get closer to mountains and everything that the west side of the States has to offer.  But it would be really hard to leave the group at Bosch when I know everyone there and have already established myself.  I would also be leaving a lot of friends. 

I guess I'm not really sure how to handle the situation.  I told Apple that I had already started my work at Bosch and they asked if I still wanted to entertain the idea of working for Apple.  I said yes and now I'm going to have a phone interview. 

Has anybody been in this sort of situation before? How did you break ties with the first company? (I've only been there 2 months minus the internships).  

I think this opportunity would be really exciting.  Moving to the other side of the country, living in CA, meeting new people, working for a huge tech company.  The work life would probably more demanding with a company like Apple.  This would be a really tough decision to make if I get the offer and I'm trying to prepare myself for the decision.

I am currently a graduate student (classes finished since september 2013) completing my internship with a US branch of government in Canada (I am a locally hired intern from Canada). I will be done in a week, and upon submission of my final paper (mini-thesis), which I have until end of September to finalize and submit, I will receive my piece of paper. My degree is in international relations and public affairs, while I also hold two BAs (Public Affairs, 2014, and Political Science, 2011)... and yes, I know all the BA jokes are pretty much true, career options it seems like a waster of time and money, but I honestly enjoyed the entirety of my university education, in fact I'm going through somewhat of a Peter Pan-syndrome like phase. I really can't imagine being out of school and getting into the ""real world"" but at the same time I am excited for new challenges and opportunities... however, I have been having trouble finding them. 

Basically, I would love to work internationally, but I feel I am entering later into the game... I'm in a long term relationship, and to the dismay of my other half I have expressed wanting to work abroad, at least for the short term.. but who knows, maybe even longer? My government is cutting back in international opportunities, of which they are rare to begin with. I have applied for 88 positions in the last 3 months, mainly abroad, and more specifically Europe. 1) for the experience, 2) for the possibilities, 3) because the majority of my studies and research revolve around there. I have previously held administrative positions with a local university and for the municipal government, and have even run for office at the municipal level here in Montreal, but clearly lost. I want to work for an NGO, an international organization, a think tank, a research group, a human rights organizations, a criminal court... anything, and anything anyone can name I think I have applied to them all.. even if the posting were above my capabilities, I still applied anyway out of desperation. 

I know it isn't easy, that's obvious, and I don't want to bitch and moan, I'm not looking for a pity party as well. I just want some sound advice, some resources, what anyone has to offer. I know working abroad is difficult as well, considering I don't have citizenship and would need the company or organization to sponsor me for a Visa. I've got some savings but not much and would want to find something relatively modest but with which I can live on. I would take temporary assignments even, but those aren't even biting at my applications. I'm 26 going on 27 very soon, and just feel like I'm getting a late start, been dating someone for 10 years... yup, and don't want to put this much pressure on them, but in the long run I feel that if I don't do this, I'll end up regretting it or resenting myself for not trying it out when I had the chance.

Was just winding if anyone had anything to offer. 

Thank in advance, it's really appreciated!"

I'm about to finish my MSME, and I'm still frantically looking for a job.  My degree is from a top 5 school, my GPA is high, and I have an interesting portfolio of projects.  However, getting hired has not gone so well.  I think I've gotten it down to two problems:

1.  I'm a generalist.  I've taken classes/done projects all over the place, and most people want someone who's spent all their time in grad school doing thing xyz.  My thing XYZ is sort of product-designy, and those openings are few and far between for someone who doesn't actually have a PD degree, so I'm trying to lean on my other skills to get employed.

2.  I have a hole in my resume.  I didn't have an internship between my last year of undergrad and grad school due to a combination of moving and hiring issues (it turns out that people aren't super excited to hire someone that's just going to frolic off for grad school), which in and of itself wouldn't be too bad.  Unfortunately, I had a nervous breakdown between my first and second years of graduate school, which meant that my summer was spent at the psych's office rather than working.

How do I compensate for these issues and become a productive member of society, or at least get some more interviews?"

In a rough spot in life, Boss at unpaid internship is a cynical dick head who figuratively dangles money over my head. I'm about halfway through the summer and its hurting my school work to stay dedicated to him. What should I do?


**BACK STORY**

Early February I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant. At the time I was working at a Dunkin Donuts doing overnight shifts for minimum wage and kind of just giving myself no pressure to do anything with my life. As soon as I found out that we were having it, I bucked up immediately.. I found a 32 week Networking program that would help me get my A+ &amp; MCSA. I always had a knack for computers so I hit the ground running.


3 Months in, so far no problems until I have a issue at work with a local gangmember (Threatened me with a gun). Needless to say I quit that place. I have a kid on the way so me and my family agreed that it was too risky to stay there.


**HERES THE STORY**

A month rolls by and I land an internship at a nice little IT firm. This is where I'm at a dilemma, so far this internship is amazing. I'm learning so much from being here, unfortunately though this boss is an asshole. He constantly belittles me, scrutinizes every little thing about what everyone does. Worst of all he has no problem dangling $ over me to get me to do stuff. This is an unpaid internship, in which I do everything he wants me to do for free. I understand this much, but when he's asking me to spend every waking moment outside of the hours I'm at the office to work on support cases just so I can show my worth? what the heck man. I'm fresh in the IT field and I have no experience whatsoever working with VoiP systems &amp; firewalls etc.

SO I'm wondering is the grass greener? I'm basically working for this place for free 4 days a week 8 hours a day working on support cases for this group if I don't understand something I crash course myself as fast as I can on the subject and end up asking a stupid question and getting flack for it. I got a little side job at Microcenter just the other day. I'm wondering if I should just stick with the internship til he just gets fed up and *fires* me or if lets say they do offer me a position should I just decline it? Also I don't even know how much starting pay is.."

My original plan was to use cython, but i don't have microsoft visual studio. And since i'm only on my internship for 3 more weeks i figured i'd just not bother and translate it when i'm back home and able to use a wired connection on ubuntu. But i wanted to figure out why it was so slow so i ran a profile.

The profile readout says that it's actually faster than c++ but the wait is so long. What gives?"

2b404v,10,2014-07-19,How do I break it to my parents that I want to go out to a bar?,pastryoverlord,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/2b404v/how_do_i_break_it_to_my_parents_that_i_want_to_go/,"Bear with me, this will be a bit long.

23, female, fresh out of college, typical Chinese household. While I was never subjected to countless hours of piano lessons, I was subjected to endless hours of my dad comparing me and my brothers to the children of his other friends. ""Oh, so and so is doing so great at his new job"" or ""why can't you be more like so and so?"". This is the prevailing narrative in my life so much so that I've had self-confidence issues as a result.

But this isn't what the post is about. It's about the fact that in my 23 years of life, I have never not slept in my own home. That means no sleepovers, and definitely no bar outings that may result in having to sleep over at a friend's house. Oh yes, and my piss poor social life.

Growing up, and even now, I never got to do any sleepovers (""you're gonna get raped!""). One time in college, I suggested that I sleep over at my friend's dorm on campus because we were going to have a late dinner (it was hard to get reservations at the place we were going to okay?) and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get home in time for the unspoken curfew (11 pm). Plus, I had work the very next day (internship on campus), so being on campus would've been very convenient and save me time commuting in the morning. No intention to drink at all, just have a pleasant dinner and catch up with friends I haven't seen in a while due to being busy at work. I didn't suggest the sleepover because I was planning to drink or do stupid shit (seriously, getting shitfaced on a weekday isn't really in my personality and I had work at 8:30 am the next day. Being hungover was the last thing I wanted to do) - it was purely a matter of convenience. In my mind, it seemed like a practical idea.

Instead, my mom (who is less strict than my dad, but equally nuts) went apeshit at the mere suggestion. And when I asked why (bad idea btw), she gave the standard ""because I said so"". Even my brother (who is 30, but still lives with us) was backing me up and telling my mom ""she's old enough to stay out and sleep over"".

And there's the curfew. In my entire life, I've never been out later than 11 pm. And the one time I was (the late dinner), I got chewed out. Big time. ""Why were you out so late - something bad might've happened to you"". They weren't mad at the fact that I was out late when I had work the very next day (which I fully expected). They were mad that I was out so late because ""omg you could've gotten attacked"". I kid you not, I wish I can tell you I was exaggerating. I know they are coming from a place of genuine concern, but sometimes I can't help but wonder if it's also from a place of wanting to control everything I do. On several occasions, they've asked me why I don't hang out with my friends. Well, you never let me hang out with my friends, that's why.

Double standard time: when my 30-something brother goes out with his friends and gets utterly shitfaced, he usually isn't home until the wee hours of the morning, maybe 1 or 2 am. And my parents are fine with that. But if 23 year old me is out any later than 11 pm, I start getting panicky phone calls and a constant barrage of messages wondering what time I'll be going home. Not only am I the only girl in the family, I happen to be the youngest of 3 kids, which complicates things even more. They're extra protective of me, to the point that much of my social life has been severely limited. I am serious when I say it wasn't until my senior year of college that my parents were cool with me hanging out with my friends, having brunch or dinner, what have you. 

Now here's my situation: My friends invited me to go with them to the local pub next Friday, and it's my first time going to a bar EVER. Not to get utterly wasted mind you, just to have a few drinks and maybe mingle. In the past I've always turned down invitations to hang out with them at the bar or go clubbing because I know that my parents will absolutely forbid me to go. But when they invited me, my parents weren't around so I said yes (I think more than anything I was excited that I finally get to go on a proper outing that didn't end promptly at 11 pm). Then I find out after my ~~weekly~~ daily phone call with father dearest (he isn't in the country right now) that he will be arriving a day before the scheduled outing. Welp, there goes my chance to have a girl's night out. I was so excited at the prospect of finally being able to relax and have a drink with friends (I know, it sounds so sad) that I really wanted this outing to work.

**How do I break it to my parents?** Trust me when I say that I've never had a drink while in the company of friends, ever. But I think my dad worries that I'll get super drunk and drive inebriated - he used to be a raging alcoholic and decided to stop when he crashed the family car outside our townhouse many many years ago. I remember 7 year old me being really scared and wondering if my dad was okay (the crash was very minor, but that made him swear off alcohol completely). And of course, they're concerned for my safety. But the place we're going to isn't even in the shady part of town, nor is it known for being a dump. It's a fairly run-of-the-mill establishment where people can relax and have a beer.

I've never had a drink in front of my parents. In fact, I don't drink much at all, if any. I can count the number of times I've had a drink in my entire life on one hand - usually it's when my parents aren't around. I never drink when they're around because the asian glow gene is strong with me, and they will know right away if I've been drinking or not.

If you think this entire situation is fairly tame, I can tell you that my issues go waaay deeper than not being able to go out with friends. It's everything. Sometimes I feel like because of my upbringing, I haven't acted out (according to my parents anyway) until now. Sigh."
2b4ipl,0,2014-07-19,Preparation for internship interview (building cloud storage),mindvsbody,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/2b4ipl/preparation_for_internship_interview_building/,"Hello, 
I've got a scheduled interview in the next week for Python internship. The internship project is building a cloud storage using Python (like Dropbox). 

My question is, what skills and knowledge (specific to the internship project) should I have to increase my odds of passing the interview and later actually doing a good piece of work?

I'll list a few points and you're welcome to correct me/add more:

- knowledge of Python (that's pretty obvious, but I suppose it's one of the main factors determining the odds),
- knowledge of version control systems - at the moment I know basics of Git and I'm going to read a bit about forks, branches, merging etc,
- knowledge of relational databases? - I'm familiar with PostgreSQL and I think this point matters too,
- HTML?  XML? Javascript? JSON? - the former two are familiar to me, I saw JSON and it looked pretty easy to understand too.
- Some computer networks related knowledge? Protocols?"
2b4up9,9,2014-07-19,Negotiating a semi-intern position working with an SQL manager/developer at a family member's company,vic986s,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b4up9/negotiating_a_semiintern_position_working_with_an/,"I have a family member who runs a decent sized company (around 200 people), and that particular family member is looking to start up a new smaller business here very soon. At this new business, they will be utilizing some software that I have a lot of experience with, and they've requested that I set up the system for them and train the new manager on it. 

I've agreed to help them get everything set up, but I have not negotiated compensation at this point. It would cost them a decent amount of money to go through someone else to have the system setup and their staff trained, so I feel like that gives me some leverage to negotiate with. 

At the larger company (manufacturing), they have an IT department of about six people. I worked with their network admin for a few weeks on a small project a couple of years back, and I remember that they had one person in IT who did a lot with SQL. I believe the database they were using was MySQL. 

My current plan is to graduate with my CS degree in Fall of 15, and to do an internship the industry (aerospace) that I want to break into in Summer 15. I've already been viewing a bunch of internship positions and entry level dev positions in the industry, and I'm seeing a lot of them asking for SQL and database experience.

Do any of you think it would be beneficial to attempt to negotiate some time to work with their MySQL person in return for doing all of this work at their new company? I have no SQL experience at all right now, so I would pretty much be picking up books and learning constantly while not on the job. Do any of you think there would be any work that I would be capable of doing while in this role?

I'm taking a web programming class in the fall where we will use a little SQL, and then next spring I'll be taking an advanced database management systems class where I'll finally get some formal education on the topic. I figured if I approached them with this offer, then I would request to work with them for a few weeks in August, and then for a few more in December between the fall/spring semesters. 

Any feedback or advice here would be much appreciated."

2b587g,0,2014-07-19,"Going to upper management at former job about current director. [NC] With what I'm bringing, will I get into legal trouble?",LtLiberty,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2b587g/going_to_upper_management_at_former_job_about/,"So I used to work at this job for four years at my old college. About a month and a half before I left, a new director of our division took over. I was optimistic about her leadership when I left the job (due to graduation). Fast forward to present day, ~14 months after I quit, and 47 employees have quit the job with the primary reason being due to her (we only have around 25 employees on at a time). So I proposed to send an email to the head of the company. I'll carbon copy two leaders of other divisions who knew me well since they were both former heads of my division, and they knew my integrity. I'm doing it because I don't have anything to personally gain and I never had any issues with the new boss while I worked with her for a month and half. But also, this was the best job I ever had and it was more like a family. Furthermore, we didn't compromise on safety or job performance. I hate to see what it has become.


So here are a few things I'm planning to make a point of (I'm only making points that have been substantiated by multiple people):

* * -She specifically targeted veteran employees in disciplinary action and gave them less hours. I assume this was to bring in her own staff who wouldn't question her decisions.
* * 
* * -She was incredibly against any feedback or criticism. Employees felt as if they could not go to her at all to discuss how things were ran. She snapped on people continuously when they would suggest a different way to try things. She does not like being questioned.
* * 
* * -Multiple people have said that they received ""verbal and emotional abuse."" Many employees felt personally attacked and a lot of people have left her office crying.
* * 
* * -She constantly reminded people that they were replaceable. She was passive aggressive in all instruction and her tone was condescending and unprofessional most of the time.
* * 
* * -She knew that almost all her employees disliked her and she would go out of her way to remind everyone why they need her. I.e. without her, they couldn't have upgraded an arbitrary item. She was always on the look out for those that were ""complaining about her to new employees, causing these new employees to dislike her."" She was so self-absorbed, she couldn't believe that people could come to their own opinions of her leadership and management.
* * 
* * -The pay was raised recently but prior to her, that wasn't needed because everyone loved their job. Now they have to compensate for her leadership with better pay.
* * 
* * -Along the lines of extra costs, they definitely have to recruit a lot more to keep up with turnover.
* * 
* * -She had a very unprofessional relationship (boyfriend-girlfriend) with an employee of another division. Everyone knew when they had a fight because of her attitude that day. He was also in her office a lot and our employees felt that if they were doing the same by not working and talking with their SO, she would snap on them.
* * 
* * -I am going to cite multiple stories of where she completely went back on her word such as saying she would get someone's shift covered, then when the shift couldn't get covered, she punished that employee for not getting his/her shift covered.
* * 
* * -She has two completely dishonest acts. One where she was the last in the building and the next day, a member of another division came in to find the door unlocked. This was reported to higher ups and they got mad at her. She blamed it on an employee who had left prior to her. Said employee got in trouble. The second one, she told an employee who quit that she was ""legally obligated"" to give her a letter of resignation. This isn't true. She only wants these letter of resignations so she can say that these people quit on their own (as long as she isn't mentioned).
* * 
* * -She guilt trips all the employees for putting shifts on the tradeboard (because there are always so many up). Prior to her, there was nowhere near as many people looking to get shifts covered (people enjoyed their jobs). But she tries to make employees feel like their betraying each other other by asking for shifts off. They want shifts off because they don't want to work there anymore. When it was a happy workplace, this was never an issue, now it is after she took over.
* * 
* * -She told an employee to his face that ""not everyone has mommy and daddy paying for everything."" She then insinuated this in an email to them that most of the employees' parents paid for their expenses, in regards to her perception that the employees were bitter about having to do extra work. The quote: ""It's important to remember not everyone has parents/guardians/loans to support them and they would love to have a job whether it's picking up trash or sitting in an office.""
* * 
* * -This job is a campus job and the main reason to work at school is because most bosses understand the priorities of students. The job is not a demanding one and so on our downtime, we used to be able to study. Now she does not allow this and then blames employees of betrayal when they put shifts up on the tradeboard so they can study.
* * 
* * -Very few felt as if she showed any of her employees respect. They were adamant that she was someone who couldn't earn respect but has to demand it. Furthermore, everyone at least agrees that she is not genuine when she tells them her concerns about them. When she does something that is ""nice,"" there is definitely an ulterior motive.
* * 
* * -A lot said that they never felt appreciated and she only ever had criticism.
* * 
* * -She was a completely different person when upper management was around. She would immediately get nicer and more cheerful. I'll ask the director I'm emailing to take into consideration that she was very different when you were watching.
* * 
* * -Many employees are adamant that they don't want their names mentioned in this email because they believe that the boss will go out of her way to personally hurt anyone who dissents. This comes mainly from her personality but she has also threatened multiple employees who were quitting that if they didn't stay, or finish their shifts, or said rude things about her, or whatever, she would be sure to punish them if a future employer called her.
* * 
* * -Many qualified, outstanding employees said they would come back if she leaves the position.
* * 
* * -To highlight the turnover issue further, we used to only have to hire once a year because people rarely quit, and when they did, it was because of graduation, or an internship, or something like that. Now they have to have recruiting sessions ~4 times a year and continuously hire new employees (new ones are brought in every month).
* * 
* * -She took a staff of ""responsible, skilled, seasoned, happy, fun, and positive [employees]... and turned them into grumpy, under appreciated, apathetic [employees].""
* * 
* * -Most importantly, sans her leadership and management, we never failed at an emergency and we always fulfilled our responsibilities while still loving our job. What she brings is not necessary.

Names will not be mentioned in the initial email. However, I will say something like, ""there are a few employees who would be willing to speak with you personally, I can give you their contact information if you like."" All of these things I am pointing out are coming from the stories/issues/concerns of those who told me that they quit the job because of her, not my personal feelings or issues. Of that 47 I mentioned, about 25 have contributed their input thus far.

I plan on making this letter/email very professional and obviously expanding on all those points. So by sending this to the director of the company, with these claims, do I have anything to worry about legally?"

I bought both the storage drives during a local hard disk blowout at Microcenter in Detroit. The case and power supply are the only two things that were rather costly. But the enthoo pro and the RM 750 were a good deal for the price anyway.

It took about 30 days but, for the core system I would've managed to get it under 900$, had I not bought the gelid cooler, went with a cheaper case or bought a non-modular power supply. I cannot thank /r/buildapcsales enough for helping me get an awesome PC at an awesome price."
2b5r9m,1,2014-07-19,Need help creating a 'smart' Word document for form letters,SCE-2-AUX,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2b5r9m/need_help_creating_a_smart_word_document_for_form/,"Hey everyone.

I'm working an internship at the moment that deals with a lot of form letters for generic situations with clients, other businesses, etc. and the way it's done right now is really inefficient. I'm taking some initiative this weekend to create a word template with 'smart' fields that auto-fill and other improvements to help out. I'm using Word 2013.

Usually I'm pretty good with Office, but I'm having trouble with some of the more complex things right now, and I don't know if they're possible and I'm ignorant, or if they just won't work at all. Here's a list of things I'm trying to do:

* Insert a dropdown menu in the document to select which form letter you need. Once selected, the template pulls itself up on the document. The dropdown menu should hide itself when you go to print. I could just make a bunch of different documents, but there is a ridiculous amount of folder clutter that this would help clear up.

* Fields that hide themselves on print and don't leave a gap if they are unused.

* Auto-filling fields based on previous entries on the document. Like if I put 'John Smith' as the recipient in the header address block, then the document auto-fills 'Smith' into the greeting.

Basically, here's what it should look like:

&gt;Dropdown menu to choose letter type (hide on print)

&gt;[Date Field]

&gt;Recipient Name  
&gt;Recipient Title (Hide line if empty)  
&gt;Name of Business (Hide line if empty)  
&gt;Recipient Address  
&gt;[City field], [dropdown of state abbreviations with home state preselected], [ZIP Code field]

&gt;If letter type requires it:  
&gt;Re:	[Client Name to use with auto-fills later]  
&gt;C#[Case number field]

&gt;Dear [Dropdown: Mr/Ms/Mrs/Custom] [Auto-fill Recipient Last name]:  
&gt;Insert pre-written form letter based on letter type dropdown menu with fields for situation. ""Thank you for contacting us about [blank field]""  
&gt;""If you have further questions please contact [Dropdown menu with staff names], a member of our staff. You can contact [auto-fill Staff first name] at [auto-fill staff member email].""

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;Image of boss signature

&gt;Boss initials:[Auto-fill Staff Member Initials]:[Field for the initials of office drone writing the letter]

Is this possible? Any help would be great. Thanks!"

I'm currently in a bind.  I'm at a pretty good University in the Southwest region of the United States.  I'm a computer science major.  I transferred here after I got my associates of network security administration.  I've also got a few security companies' attention by leading their security team which I created.  
  
So what's the problem?  1.  The money per year is pretty outrageous.  I mean, I have some scholarships, but it is hard for me to pay even with loans.  2. The program has one security course (and it's taught by someone that doesn't know security, but rather just thinks the program should have something).  
  
I am thinking about transferring to another University with not as many credentials as the university that I currently attend, but it has an information security and assurance bachelor degree.  This university would be affordable and it'd also specialize in security (including standards which I didn't interact with until this current internship I'm in).  
  
I know a friend who's doing good for himself and he hasn't finished his degree yet (and probably won't), but he has a few more accolades than me as he started in the field much younger.  
  
The other thing is that at the current university I'd have to still take more common curriculum courses (which is okay to have since it makes you more well rounded, but I've already taken over 130 hours of college courses starting from high school).  
  
So what are your opinions?  I'm leaning toward transferring.  I've always felt it's what you do beyond the classroom that counts the most.  I'm currently interning as an information security consultant.  I've worked as a systems administrator.  I've participated in many security CTFs (placed in a few) and I'm a captain for my teams.  I mentor for the CyberPatriot program.  And I'm constantly researching and practicing on my VMs.  
  
tl;dr I want to transfer to a lesser known university.  Does it matter where I graduate from if I do more beyond the classroom?"

My background: I'm currently a freshman at a ""public ivy"" studying Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I'm a good student (3.8 GPA) and will be interning this summer at  Data Analytics startup doing software Development. I basically got the Deloitte offer through being invited to the Deloitte NextGen Summer Program (4 day conference).

Long Term Goals: I'm a techie / coder with a interest in business and entrepreneurship. My dream is to one day run my own tech-startup or have a C-level position at an established tech company. I most likely want a MBA (80% chance). Either way, I want to find my way into Silicon Valley doing something more than simply just coding.

Question Elaborated: I keep going between the two. Before I graduate, I also want to intern at a big tech company (Google, Microsoft, FB, etc.). Which internship would look more interesting to a tech recruiter the summer after Deloitte? Which one would I learn more things? Which one would I learn unique things (if tech just means coding, it wouldn't be very interesting)? Which one sets me up for a better future?"

2b7rww,0,2014-07-20,Job Security,Scottstoiletpaper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b7rww/job_security/,"Hey cscareerquestions, I have a couple of questions that I'd like some up-to-date answers to. Here's some background: I'm currently a sixteen year old heading into my senior year of high school in the U.S. I'm really passionate about CS and will probably pursue it as a career regardless of the answers I receive to my questions, but would still like to be informed about the field. That being said, here are my questions:

1. It's been brought to my attention that with the outsourcing of a lot of CS jobs, employers in the U.S. are becoming increasingly selective or don't want to hire domestically. I get that there are advantages to having an employee that speaks your language well (not to say that foreigners don't speak English well, but you know, less language barrier) and that there are also benefits to having your employee able to physically come into the office. Is outsourcing really a big concern?

2. What kind of experience and practice do you guys recommend I gain/do *now* so I'll be ahead of the game when time comes to find a job. I'm currently interning for a tech start-up (and *loving* it!) There are plenty of opportunities in NYC, where I live, so it's hard for me to know what opportunities I should look into. I chose to intern at a start-up because I  figured I'd learn more, having a smaller office and all.

3. My ultimate goal is to work at Google and develop apps on the side. In your experience, what steps must one go through in order to accomplish such a thing? More specifically, what steps will I have to take? How many years of experience outside of Google do you recommend I have before seriously applying? I want to internship at Google during my college years and am looking into it.

4. For those of you with cs jobs: Are you guys satisfied with what you do? Do you feel rewarded at the end of the day? Am I in the honeymoon phase? I don't want to devote my life and college years learning something I might become disenchanted with down the road, though I'm sure there's no way to tell for sure if I'll like ANY job after a while.

5. What languages should I spend most of my time working in? I understand that the language you program in isn't as important as understanding the fundamentals of CS, but when employers will ask for samples of my work, what language would they request? Right now, I'm familiar with Java, Python, HTML and CSS, and PHP. I know Python is on the rise and am devoting/have devoted part of this summer to learning it.


6. I know there are a ton of practice problems out there, but I'm slowly (but steadily) exhausting the list. What kind of problems do employers ask you to solve? I've done most of the questions available on [codingbat](http://codingbat.com) and on [Google's Python Course site](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/). I have a ton of other resources that I can list if any of you are interested in refreshing your own knowledge, but I'd really like to hear from you guys/gals. 

Thanks for your responses guys. I'm looking to learn from your experiences and I'm sure you will."

2b8473,4,2014-07-20,software development apprenticeships: what should I expect?,TheChosenOne570,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b8473/software_development_apprenticeships_what_should/,"A little backstory: I graduated in 2008 with a degree from an online school. It turned out to be pretty useless and the only job I found in my major resulted in me getting laid off in 18 months. I've tried to find other jobs, but the longer I go without a job in my major, the less likely I'll be able to get into the industry again.

Anyway, recently, I was introduced to ""software development apprenticeships."" Apparently, there are a few companies that are willing to bring you in and pay you as you learn (I would assume its like an internship?). The one company I looked into will put you up in a living facility and give you a monthly stipend for the 6 months you are apprenticeship-ing . I didn't get details as to how much that stipend is, but this looks like a ""too good to be true"" scenario for someone like me. And, prior to college, I'd be fine with taking that risk, but now I have financial obligations and a steady form of income. It would be a shame to screw myself over by moving to another city just to be exploited in some way by these programs.

Anyone else have experience with software apprenticeships? What should I expect? "
2b8b8v,53,2014-07-20,The Dead Never Really Die,CoasterKid93,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2b8b8v/the_dead_never_really_die/,"This might be the only post I ever make about this, and to be fair, I won't be surprised if it's deleted very soon. But I don't care, because the events surrounding The Abraham Project need to be exposed to as many people as possible. I'm a whistle-blower of my own labors; I hold myself accountable for what's happened, and what's coming. 

I'm a college student in Washington D.C., and for two years, I was part of an extensive, joint-research internship program between the National Institute of Health and the Department of Defense. I'm not going to list names of the people involved in/aware of this program (believe me, there are few), nor am I going to discuss how I became involved with this program in the first place. What I am going to tell you, however, is what this program did, and what it's threatening to do. 

Funny enough, it all started by accident. Two years ago, a team of NIH agents were helping west Asian villagers combat an unusual strain of the flu. Reports estimate that around fifty people died before it was properly treated, but that wasn't the problem. The problem came from what was happening to the agent’s cell-phones, computers, and all other electronic devices. 


""It hurts."" 

""I have to leave.""

""Who are they?""

""Going east, now."" 

""RECEIVED."" 

""RECEIVED."" 

""RECEIVED."" 


With each passing death, the agents received bizarre and rambling messages on their electronic devices. At first, they chalked it up to interference in telecommunications given their rural surroundings. Their opinions immediately changed when personally identifying information of the deceased leaked into the messages, such as their names and birth dates. It was unclear how they were received messages in the first place, but following an immediate, classified investigation, the agents were ordered to return to the United States. Within a month’s time, The Abraham Project began, and I was hired as a research assistant with DOD Security Clearance. It didn’t fully understand my work; I’d heard of Lambda waves in some physiology courses, but never in anything relating to national security. 

Lambda waves are transmitted from the occipital lobe of the brain whenever someone’s eyes are open, and cease when someone is asleep. For the first three months of my research, I was analyzing Lambda wave patterns of countless, anonymous individuals. I wasn’t told why, at first. I suppose my supervisors needed to be reassured of my commitment to the program, and my trust. Regardless, the true nature of The Abraham Project was revealed to me six months into my internship.

I want to stop now and quickly state something. If anything that follows directly or indirectly describes the loss of someone close to you, I apologize. It is not, nor was it ever, my intention to exploit anyone’s loss for my own use. In fact, I’ll restate now that I absolutely WILL NOT reveal the names of the dead.

It turns out that Lambda waves continue to transmit 36 hours after someone dies. Technically, the deceased are “seeing” during that time. And the messages those NIH agents were receiving? And the reason they had me analyzing Lambda waves in the first place? Through technology, they found out that we can directly contact the dead. What the dead could “see,” and what they could “feel,” could be transmitted directly to us. Don’t ask me HOW, and don’t ask me WHY, because I don’t know the answer to either of those questions. All that I know is that in the collective database of The Abraham Project, there are hundreds of thousands of these messages. And how did we receive these people in the first place? Their corpses? Turns out that over the past few years, a large number people classified as organ donors on their drivers licenses are transported to us for research after they die. 

The nature of the messages depends on the person that died. Last year, there was one person we received following a multi-car pile-up in Southern California a week before Christmas. The body was mangled and shredded beyond nearly all recognition; I don’t even know if I can call what I saw a person. Regardless, this person was having a full-blown meltdown inside of himself. 


“HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO FUCKING STUPID?”

“Jesus Christ, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. IT HURTS. PLEASE, IT HURTS.” 

“I don’t want to feel anymore?”

“Do [names expunged] know? I can’t take the pain anymore. Make it stop!” 

“Where am I?” 


There was another person we received who jumped from a Denver high rise last summer. She had fallen over one hundred feet to the pavement below, yet somehow, her brain was still going. 


“Why aren’t I dead?” 

“Am I still falling?”

“Where am I?”


“Where am I?” was a pretty common question. They all asked that, and no one could answer. I don’t think I need to tell you how horrified I was at this. We received and analyzed nearly a hundred people a day. Each of them received their own group of staff, their own room, and their own equipment. But what terrified me the most, and puzzled all of those involved, is what happened when those 36 hours were up. 

“[PERSON’S NAME] RECEIVED.” 

This message was always relayed at exactly 36 hours following each death. Sometimes, the dead would be cut-off mid thought by this. 

About a year ago, without my knowledge and the knowledge of most of my colleagues, a specialized unit was assembled to find out just who or what was relaying this message. I don’t know what they thought they would achieve by doing so; we all had a good idea of what it was. Disaster struck soon after. 

Members of the unit were disappearing one by one. Soon after, dozens of people involved with The Abraham Project were also disappearing. The crisis escalated to the point that military personnel were stationed to monitor our security. It didn’t help. People were continuing to vanish without a trace, and to this day, we have no idea where they are or what took them. All that we have, for now, is a potential explanation. The specialized unit was trying to talk with it. 

I don’t know the exact nature of their conversations with this thing, but almost immediately, the thing was trying to reach out to the rest of us. It never did so through questions or introductions. It simply displayed our personal information. Intimate details of our lives. Where we lived. Our relationships. Everything close to us was displayed in front of us like a lure. Some people were stupid enough to try and message the thing back and, you guessed it, they disappeared. That became a new rule: “don’t address it.” That didn’t help a whole lot, because a month ago, after 67 unexplained disappearances, The Abraham Project was terminated. But that thing lives on. 

Someone I became close friends with through the project disappeared last week, and there are scattered news reports of people going missing throughout the D.C. metro area. People who had nothing to do with The Abraham Project. I refused to see any connection until a received a random, Facebook friend request. 

There was no name, no picture, and no identifiable information. Just the husk of a Facebook profile. I declined it. Then I began to receive e-mail messages, Skype requests, and as of last night, phone calls and text messages. It’s trying to reach out to me. It already knew who I am, and now it’s trying to reach out to me again. 

Please believe me when I say that there is now something alive in our technology. It’s beginning to learn our names, and soon, it will know us all. Don’t accept any of its attempts to contact you. Don’t listen to it. Don’t acknowledge it. Don’t talk to it. If you do, you will end up like the others. I have no idea the extent of its reach, but the more people that disappear, the more its will is done. There is something alive inside of our technology, and it’s trying to take us all.

2b8ufp,2,2014-07-20,How do I combine my wireless routers.,[deleted],techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2b8ufp/how_do_i_combine_my_wireless_routers/,"So yes. I'm a sysadmin in training, but since it's holiday and the last time we did wireless routery things was before my internship in February, so the brain has become lazy...

Anyways. I got 3 wireless routers, one is the main uplink from the ISP which sends a weak ass signal around the house which is beat in speed by a 56k.
The other two I want to set up around the house to act as access points to have a strong signal throughout our concrete house which loves to block said signals.

So I set them up, amateurishly at that. They got 3 different SSID's meaning that if you want to connect, you need to sign in 3 different times. Which is a chore, something everyones dislikes.
So tomorrow I want to finally start doing what I was supposed to do, and combine all three routers so that you can get on the network once and are connected everywhere without hiccups.

Now, how am I going to do this and what is the (no doubt) easy answer to this question.

For hardware reasons. All three devices are different brands. One is EnGenius, the other is Sitecom and the third uplink router is the ISP brand, probably Cisco or Sitecom."

Advice? :/,ShyRonnayy,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2b8yyj/quitting_my_coop_advice/,"Background: I've always been good at math and science so I thought my best choice coming in to college would be to major in engineering. Since ME seemed the most broad, I figured that would be the way to go. 

Since the end of Freshman year I have kinda questioned if ME is right for me since I've never really ""tinkered"" as a lot of my friends do. Since I do well in class (~3.8 GPA) I figured I had no reason to change my major. I decided I would try and land an internship and see how I feel about it - which brings me to the current dilemma. A few months ago I just finished my Sophomore year and started my first co-op as a Mechanical Engineer and I have lost about all interest. I'm supposed to stay until December, but I will not be able to last that long.

Most mornings I wake up dreading going to work and when I get there I usually just sit there and worry about my acne (recently started developing problems with acne). So that may be a source of all this anxiety, but I think that's just what threw me overboard since I've been questioning my career path for awhile. I know I have this commitment, but I'm also quite certain I would like to change my major to Software Engineering. I have been teaching myself some programming on the side and I actually enjoy it quite a bit. I have talked to my advisor about my doubts and I would like to take fall semester off and try to do some soul searching to think about my choices - maybe take a programming boot camp online.

So back to the dilemma: I have little to no determination at work and I feel the anxiety is making my life worse - physically and emotionally. The environment isn't that bad here, I just can't be productive and can't see myself sitting in a cubicle like this after college. Since I'm quite sure I would like to change my major, I don't feel like this co-op is helping my career goals, so I may just leave it off the resume. Ultimately I'm seeing it as a waste of my time and my employer's resources, and I'm feeling kinda stuck. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice as to how I should approach this situation?

So my step daughter is off doing her internship and her &lt;2 year old HP Pavilion dies.  Nothing on the screen, blah, blah, blah.  She takes it to the local computer store that people recommend.  The guys looks over it for nearly an hour and declares the motherboard dead.  We look up info on Pavilions, and motherboards seem to be a very common failure with those models.  We order her a $600ish thinkpad since she no longer plays any 3d games (she used to play sims3) and wouldn't need a discreet GPU.  

We have her drive to where we live so I can transfer her data, uninstall Norton, install malwarebytes, MS antivirus, etc.  Her new laptop only had 6GB of memory, so I pull out a 4GB DIMM from her old one so she'd at least have 8GB.  I consider pulling out the 32GB flash cache from the dead HP to put in her mom's computer and notice the CMOS battery hasn't been pulled out since it's still taped in.  So, what the hell, I pull the battery for 30 or so seconds and put it back in.

Lo and behold, it boots up fine after clearing the bios.  So, I finally get a ""new"" laptop with an i5 and low end nvidia chip to replace my aging AMD e-350 based laptop.

TL;DR2: Pulled the CMOS battery, fixed a ""diagnosed"" dead mobo.  It was a long(ish) shot, but took 10 seconds to try.  Always try the fast &amp; easy fixes.  Note: I haven't been a ""tech"" in almost 15 years, but some things never change.  When I was a tech, I was the go to guy for fixing things that no one else could fix, and 3/4 of it was trying fast &amp; easy fixes.

I have been going through several posts on this subreddit and it seems to be the general consensus that going to a top tier school ""helps to open more doors"" in terms of interviews for internships. I find this perk vague. Does it imply that students from top tier schools do not have to work on side projects or other programming related tasks in order to prove their qualification for an interview. Also, what is the extent of this automatic credential of top tier students? Is it enough to qualify attending the **affordable**, but yet more expensive, University of Wisconsin - Madison over a still respectable and cheaper computer science undergrad program such as that of the University of Massachusetts - Amherst.

2b9ph5,25,2014-07-21,[recent grad] got fired from first job after 5 weeks. Is it me or just poor management?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2b9ph5/recent_grad_got_fired_from_first_job_after_5/,"I'm a recent college graduate, and I recently got fired from my first job out of college after 5 weeks. This actually happened a few weeks ago, so I'm past the whole crying in bed phase. I have recently accepted another job opportunity (had 3 offers total after I got fired). I'm obviously sad, but I want to move on and learn from this nightmare. 

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks ago, the CEO/founder (small business) called me into his office, asked me how I was doing, and informed me that I had been let go. He said it was performance-related, and the two guys I worked with said I was slow at picking things up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I told him that it was my first time working with the software, and yes, I had been a little confused, but it was all apart of the learning curve, and I've been getting more and more familiar and fluent with the language. I've been on my own mostly for these last few weeks... debugging and backtracking any errors I had on my own. Anything that I did struggle with or needed help walking through, it was because it was my first time doing it... I had turned the corner...

&amp;nbsp;

We (me and the three other guys I started with) had a one week training, and then we started. Out of our cohort, I was the only one put on a project that very first week (when I was fired, I was told that this was a ""test run"" to see what I could do). I just wish I was given a fair shake and had the opportunity to learn and get familiar like the other guys had. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to take some responsibility though. Everything the CEO said in the meeting was somewhat true. The senior member there, who was assigned to help me, basically relayed every technical question I had to the CEO. Looking back, sure I was asking some very basic questions (with hindsight), but it was my first time. They said I was slow picking up some of the concepts in training. I personally thought training was overly simplified and we were going too fast (i.e. following the trainer without much thought of what we were doing). The other people that I talked to there... all agreed. I was just the only one that asked questions out loud. So basically, if I had kept my mouth shut and didn't ask any questions (other than to the other new guys), I'd still have a job.

&amp;nbsp;

There was 1 week of training, 1 week of presentations and orientation, and then I was put on project at the beginning of the 3rd week. Midway through the 4th week, I was already notified that I was being taken off the project. I finished the 4th and 5th weeks, and subsequently let go. A decision was already made after 3 weeks it seems... 

&amp;nbsp;

The stuff I was assigned on the project wasn't too difficult per-say (with hindsight and having done it once already), but nothing I had encountered in training. The project manager basically walked me through the tasks the first few days (i.e. click this, do that, move this). The thing is, the code that he helped me get started -- the end code after the 5th week was totally different, which I did since the requirements kept changing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nobody said anything to me during my time there. Nobody asked me how I was doing or said ""Hey, the trainer said you were having some difficulties"". As far as I was concerned, I was doing a good job. I met all of my sprint deadlines. Yes, I was slow out of the gate, but I gotten over the hump and thought I was really understanding and picking things up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just in total disbelief. Being fired after 5 weeks is almost unheard of... especially if you are actually genuinely trying. It'd take an attitude problem or sleeping on the job to be fired that quickly. I think about all of my friends and the jobs and internships they've had over the years. None of them were ever sent home after 5 weeks and made it through the entire duration (eh, maybe some confirmation bias). I'm having some doubts about myself, and that it may be me that's the problem. 

&amp;nbsp;

During school projects, I'd have trouble starting projects because it took me a while to understand what it was asking, but after I fully understood the project specs, I was fine. I graduated at the top of my classes with honors, not because I was overly smart but because I had good time management, worked hard, and was a good test taker. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to accept some accountability, but are most companies (small businesses) like this? Or is this just the exception and I got unlucky? What kind of company invests all of this money in background checks and training lessons to fire them this quickly? I'm just searching for some answers. 

&amp;nbsp;

I secretly hope ""performance related"" was just a front, and they fired me for some other reason. Over-hiring? Maybe, but they were still hiring... Whenever I wanted to take a break, I would browse dog shelter websites (was trying to adopt a puppy) daily. Also, I was engaging in conversations with one of the clients via instant messaging -- 70% work-related and 30% about other stuff, some flirting and teasing, but nothing inappropriate. Were they spying on me? At least with the latter reasons, it'd be easier to swallow since I know I need to be more focused. But the other reasons... that's me... that's my personality and learning styles. I can't just change that. 

&amp;nbsp;

Give it to me straight. Is it me reddit?"

* Fall: CS 2110 + CS course

* Summer: Internship?

I have heard mixed reviews about the usefulness of CS 2340, but apparently it's required for the Design project. With Algorithms, it's been that its the source of all interview questions. That and it opens up all the theory courses in CS.

In terms of skill level in each, I haven't done any serious coding projects of any sorts yet, so 2340 might be useful in that regard. (Don't you have a GBA game in 2110, though?) With regards to algorithms, I did well in 1332 and Abstract vector spaces."

I am currently a pre-Junior BS in Computer Engineering and minor in CS student at a school in the States that is looking for my third co-op in an international location. I have done two co-ops in the US both as a software developer in two different companies. I need to look for an international location purely for CPT reasons (so I can be eligible for my Optional Practical Training visa for when I graduate).

***What is the issue:***

My school works with a company that specializes in finding international internships; this particular office is in Singapore. I applied last week. Today, I had the opportunity to conduct a Skype interview with the headhunter for this program. The experience was interesting.. Let me elaborate on what she told me:

1. I was told that the majority if not all internships are **unpaid**. That said, AIC urges companies to stipend interns for meal plans and/or transit. While this was expected, in both my previous co-ops as a software developer in the USA, I was paid by the hour to a max of 40 hours a week. She continued to persuade me that an internship should be about the experience, and that all students should be about the experience, and not put emphasis on payment, which was interesting.

2. The **housing in Singapore is one of the highest in the world**, and the internships will 100% not provide housing for you.

3. Singapore is one of the hardest working first world cities on earth, where it is common that you're working **8 AM to 8 PM 5 - 6 days a week**; interns are not the exception. The headhunter told me that ""earlier this week, an intern told me that she was working from 9 AM to 9 PM"" to which she chuckled. I forced a laugh. 

4. She told me most employers **will not offer a job description**. You will be given their website and as much information as possible to determine what your job/role pertains, because ""people are busy in Singapore and do not have a dedicated employee to write a job description."" This was a very weird point to me, amongst the other quirky points she told me, because wouldn't having a job description allow the company to better find a fit for their interns? 

5. The final kicker: I have to **finalize with her whether I am committing to a co-op at Singapore by this Wednesday** (in three days), by then she will begin sending out my resume to prospective companies. By committing it means I am set in stone that I *will* be working at Singapore, regardless of the company or position. This is a decision I find hard to accept at the moment, as 1. companies in America generally understand that even if you interview with them, you may not necessarily work with them, and 2. it is hard for me to ""commit"" to a job without knowing what positions or companies I potentially will be working for, this aspect even more important because it is unpaid, and 3. I am still looking for other companies for the co-op this September.

Overall, I finished the interview on a good note with the coordinator, but in my head, I was unsure what to think about what I just heard. One hand, I was happy that they guarantee 100% that they will find an internship, but on the other hand, something felt off about what she told me. At the moment, they are pretty much my only option for an international location, because of the 40+ positions I've applied to (that contain intern/co-op) in countries such as Canada, Germany, and more, I've only received one interview..

I feel like I am running out of options, and they seem to be my only option for a co-op this September, with the exception I switch cycles to Spring-Summer.

***My questions are:***

1. Am I being too much of a little bitch? Am I being unreasonable? Am I thinking too highly of myself?

2. She sounded a little unreasonable, and I don't know why, but the entire time, I just couldn't but notice the red flags in my mind. My intuition tells me something is way off about what I heard. Perhaps it's because of the difference in work culture.

3. I plan to talk with my co-op coordinator tomorrow about this conversation and about moving on. What is /r/cscareerquestions' thoughts on this situation?

I apologize for this very long post, but I am at wit's end at the moment, feeling dejected and self-esteem at an all-time-low, at the same time, feeling like I am out of options. I would love your input on this matter, whether it's something I want to hear, or something I need to hear.

***tl;dr*** is this internship program in Singapore a little too demanding both financially and technically for an unpaid intern?"

Sorry if it's not the venue for it. 

I feel like I can't be happy. I try so hard at work and at school and with my friends to be the fun happy person I know I can be but it doesn't happen a lot. I spent so so long faking being that person and I can't fake it any more. Everything just feels so bleak and so pointless. 

I spent the first part of the summer focused on my internship and getting in shape, and I let a lot of social stuff fall by the wayside. Thanks to that I'm feeling really isolated and like there's nobody I can talk to. 

I know that I demonstrate a lot of symptoms of depression (and honestly I'm really scared I might be bipolar) and I really want to see a therapist. I don't for two reasons - first, I'm home from college and living at home, and I really don't want my parents to know. They're very conservative and tend to fall in the ""depression is bullshit"" camp, so I know they'd be so disappointed about this. 

That's really just an excuse though. The real reason I don't go is because I'm so scared that I'll find out what's wrong with me, and then I can't pretend everything is ok any more. My whole life is based on this fake person and I can't do anything about it because if I do then everything is going to fall apart. 

It feels like who I am is this massive jenga tower I've spent 20 years building, and learning that I'm depressed/bipolar/whatever I am is going to make it all collapse. And to some degree living like this is better than that. 

That's all I have. I wish I had the determination to even kill myself if I'm honest. I feel worthless and irrelevant enough in my own life to do it. I just don't have the follow through. Thank god get small miracles I guess. "

2banmm,53,2014-07-21,What to Know About Applying for Graduate School (STEM),littlemoondragon,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2banmm/what_to_know_about_applying_for_graduate_school/,"I have given advice on applying for graduate school several times. I should have made this before, but did not realize how often this comes up. Here is my advice on applying for graduate school. This is based on my research when I applied (talking with professors from various universities, other graduate students, etc.)

**NOTE:** I graduated with a double major in mathematics and physics and I focused on physics applications at the time, but ended up going to an applied statistics program.

**Please let me know if I have said something erroneous or should add some other information.** 

Early on in applying, you need to figure out where you will apply for. Applying is expensive. On average, it will be $100 - $150 per application. This includes the application fee, GRE submission, and transcript submission. Apply for five to seven places. Why? Pick one or two that are your dream school that you think you will not be able get in. There might be a chance you can. Pick one or two you think you might get into, but are unsure. Again, one or two you are sure you will get into. You need safety net in case you do not get accepted to any of the higher schools. However, keep in mind that you don't want to go to a university or program just because you couldn't get into anything else. If you are not accepted into the programs of your choice, follow up with the program and say thank you for them considering your application and ask what areas you can improve on.

**NETWORKING IS KEY!** In some instances if your advisor or some other professor in your current department knows someone in the program you are applying for, the chances of you getting in increase substantially. Just like a job, if the boss knows you, you are more likely to get hired (based on if he or she thinks well of you). Sometimes professors will select an applicant out of the stack if they know them and have the funding. If the department doesn't have to pay for the student, they are more likely say yes. This happens often.

**Fellowships:** Apply for fellowships early on. This not only helps you with how most applications processes proceed and give you writing experience, but if you do win one you have a leg up on other applicants for graduate school. For instance, if you win the NSF GRPF, you come with your own stipend and money for the university. This becomes very appealing for graduate programs considering incoming graduate students.

Usually, graduate programs look at five parts in applications. The list is no particular order.

1.	Personal Statement and/or Resume/CV
2.	Research Experience
3.	GRE and/or writing sample
4.	GPA
5.	Letters of Recommendation

A great application will excel in all five areas. However, most people will fail in one or two. You want to make sure you do well in at least four out of the five to be accepted in the more competitive/prestigious programs. My suggestions will be geared toward going to top programs. Keep in mind there is a difference on being an acceptable applicant vs being a competitive applicant. Not only should you meet the following requirements, but you need to stand out. The top programs will have hundreds of applicants. You need to be remember-able in some way. Additionally, most STEM programs will waive your tuition, provide a living stipend (around 20k to 28k), and sometimes health insurance (or at least a subsidy). This means they are investing in you and taking a risk for both reputation and financially wise. 

**Personal Statement and/or Resume/CV:** The personal statement is one part of the applications you must customize to the particular program you are doing. Each program varies on what they want you write. Most of the time it is a 1.5 page essay about your research goals and why you want to be in the program. I have seen a few that require 3,000 words or more. These are my suggestions on writing one:

1.	Write a generic essay NOW! As in before school starts. This essay will be the most time consuming part of your application. If you have a program in mind you want be in (i.e. your favorite program) find their statement and write an essay based on their requirements. Since most personal statements are the same or at least similar, you can modify the one you wrote to fit to others.

2.	Make sure you find a professor you want to work with and mention them in your statement. This says you looked into the program other than just their reputation or other reasons (I know some people went into my current program because the university has a great football team). Of course don’t just name drop. Explain how working with this professor meets your goals and how you two will be a good fit.

* If possible, contact the professor you are interested. Get your name out there.

3.	Do not mention classes you have taken in your statement. That is a waste of space. You are only given 1.5 pages on average to tell them your goals and why they should accept you. Transcripts are required. Why should you remind them again what classes you have taken?

4.	If there are poor marks on your applications such as bad grades, GRE, etc. your personal statement is the place to mention why you did poorly one semester or why your GRE score is low.

* Why should you do this? When you apply, the committee will have no idea who you are other than the stack of paper in some folder with your name on it. If you do not explain yourself, they will automatically make a poor assumption on you. 

* What are some examples of this? One of the top ten physics programs accepted a woman who had a bad GRE score and in the same semester, her grades plummeted. Everything else looked great. She wrote in her personal statement that her boyfriend died in a car crash before taking the GRE and had a difficult time focusing on her schoolwork that semester. Another example is a few friends of mine went through a divorce and another friend that had been diagnosed with severe test anxiety. However, do not make your situation sound as if the committee should pity you. Write about how while this happened, you became stronger or your rose above the situation or something.

Sometimes programs ask for a resume or a CV. If it is a resume, make sure it is only 1.5 pages. Jobs usually want one page resumes, but when applying for academia resumes can be longer. However, do not go crazy. If they wanted more than 1.5 pages, the program will say CV instead of resume. (My source is chairs and heads of admission committees from at least four different universities.)

**Research Experience:** You are applying for an advance degree in STEM, so you must have SOME research experience. If you are a rising senior, get on it NOW! Many fail this one area. If you are applying for anything in STEM and have a publication or gone to another university for research such as a REU you will have a huge advantage over the other applicants.

However, this section is not as relevant with those in **mathematics**. I was the only one in my incoming class of applied mathematics and statistics students with any research experience. Professors at my current department told me research experience is not as important. The most recent year did prove otherwise. The committee admitting students for this year (2014) all had research experience and the professors on the committee were impressed with all of them. While research experience for mathematics is not as relevant as the other sciences and engineering, it couldn't hurt.

1.	If you are early in your undergraduate career, start asking professors about their research! This shows initiative on your part. Some departments do seminars on what research is being done and if a professor is seeking students, but not all. If you are in one of the departments that does not, you need to talk and find research on your own.

2.	What if research at your department isn’t in you interests? Look for internships or REU’s. I have done couple REU’s, and they are great exposure to research.

* If you do research at another university (e.g. REU), you have someone lined up to write a letter of recommendation. This becomes a powerful tool in your application, because this research advisor can vouch for you abilities at a different university other than you own.

**GRE:** This part varies from university to university. Some programs want you to take only the general exam others want both the generals and the subject test. This also depends on field. For instance, all top physics programs will require both the general and subject test exam. This is because the subject test is a soul-crushing monster and helps programs compare students across the nation. On the other hand, some top applied math/stat places do not require the math subject test.

1.	What I have heard from several professors (chairs, committee members, etc.) in STEM, they do not care if your verbal GRE score is low (unless it is horrendously low). All they care is your math GRE score is in the top percentage because the math GRE is below calculus I. There is the writing portion and most of the time when I asked about this part, professors kept saying along the lines of “Oh the writing portion…is it out of 4 pts or something?” (This was during the old GRE scoring system.) For most programs, writing does not matter because you have to submit your personal statement or sometimes an old essay. The old essay is usually one you did for your English or Writing class.

2.	Do a few practice GRE and subject test GRE to become familiar with how the test taken. The test is timed, so being familiar with the test will help with speed.

**GPA:** Most top programs will require a minimum of a 3.3 to 3.5 GPA. If your GPA is low, look at the personal statement portion on explaining why your GPA is low (if you have a good reason).

In **mathematics**, since research is not as important, your grades matter a lot. A minimum GPA of 3.8 to 3.9 would be most advised.

1. 	Graduate programs do look at individual GPA's (general courses vs subject courses). If you didn't do well in your ethics class but excelled in organic chemistry, the program will only care about the courses that were relevant to your field.

* More of a side note. I have been told I had a great transcript because it showed I did all the required coursework (did well in them) and took other classes like advanced snowboarding and judo. The DGS told me personally how I stood out and said he wanted me to teach him and others to snowboard (odd request). Not sure how much this matters. Just a story.

**Letters of Recommendation:** Most places require three letters. I have only applied to one that required four. If you have done research, did well in classes, and some other extra circular activities, you should have at least three people in mind. 

1.	Ask the three or four people you are considering well in advance. Summer is a good time. State how you are considering applying to graduate school and would like them to write a letter. Remind them one month before the due date, then one week, and finally the day before. If you do not have enough letters, it is an easy way for the graduate committee to cut your applications out.

2.	Whom should you ask? One should be your advisor. I hope that you have developed a good relationship with them, and they can speak to your character. The second one should be someone who can talk about your research. If this happens to by your academic advisor, that is great. The third one can be anyone that knows you well. I say this because you need to make sure you have a professor that KNOWS you. It is obvious to the committee how well a professor views and knows you from the letter. In addition, it does not hurt to play the system. I had a list of professors I had that could write great letters of recommendation. I had two professors that taught at the university I ended up attending. They could speak about how I could meet the expectations based on how well I did in their class compared to other students they taught at the university I was applying for. Networking is key.

3.	Be wary on who you ask. Most “good” professors will make up an excuse if they know they could not write a nice letter about you. Others might agree and write a slanderous one. This has happened a few times in my experience (not about me, but others). Do not let this happen. If you are uncertain about professors, the best advice I have heard on the matter is you not only ask the professor to write a letter, but a good letter. Be tactful on the issue.

Let me give you some background.  I’m a 26 year old woman.  I have a degree in Criminology, and am finishing up a degree in Forensic Chemistry in December.  I’m currently undertaking an internship in the analytical lab.  I consider myself a scientist, and therefore believe in things I can observe, record, and measure.  I live my life based on data and fact.  As such, I am not easily spooked and I do not believe in the paranormal.  I do have a penchant for the show Supernatural and the Hellblazer comics, but that’s only for fun.  It’s not real, and I know that. 


Due to my chosen career path, you can also bet that I am unbelievably curious and nosy; I have to investigate anything and everything.  I am an expert facebook creep, I can find just about anything on anyone (my friends always call me their personal private investigator), but I have had legitimate work with the coroner’s office. 


As I said, I intern at a analytical lab.  It’s not in the most savory part of the city; when I say the section of town I work in, most people ask me if I carry mace/have a concealed weapon permit.  Our parking lot has a security booth and is fenced in with barbed wire.  Across the street last year, a girl was stabbed to death.  Yeah.  It’s not the greatest place to work, but the pay is good for an internship and let’s face it, I was desperate – I need to take an internship in order to graduate. 


Anyway, the plant itself is really old, but the main building in which the lab in located is even older.  It was built in the 1920’s, and like any old building, it has its issues.  There are odd noises all the time, scrapping in the walls and odd thumps, but that can be attributed to the sounds of the factory carrying through to our part.  Plus, it is easy to block them out with the sounds of the fume hoods and our heavy duty analytical instruments (we have an AA and ICP, and our ICP is ancient and loud).  There are also odd smells, but I think that’s mostly due to the fact that in order to prep samples, I have to dissolve metals in acid, and trust me, that is not a good smell.  If you don’t turn on the hoods almost immediately, the odor gets trapped in your nose and you can’t get rid of it for days.  The lights flicker constantly, but this is due to the fact that the lab shared electricity with the entire plant, and the lines are unbearably old.  Add in the fact that the old-ass ICP sucks a ton of electricity, and of course the lightning will suffer.  I’ve been here for almost two months now and I barely notice any of these things.  Only when I first started did I really notice them.


Anyway, about a month into my internship, they began renovations on our lab.  To describe our lab:  It’s a large room, separated by a big island. Each side has a fume hood.  The right side of the lab is getting all new cabinets and countertop, as well as a brand new fume hood.  Everyone was super excited, because the old one looked like it was straight up out of the 1950’s.  Right before they began to tear everything up, they were looking up in the drop ceiling to see where electrical wiring, gas lines, and water lines were.  I came in one morning to a removed ceiling tile and a weird… I dunno, hand print on the wall I guess.  It was really smeared, and looked rusty (the room smelled weird, too, but whatever, the contractors weren’t exactly the cleanest of people).  There was no ladder, but eh, they probably took it with them.  I sent a snap of it to my best friend, knowing she would get all riled up over it.  Sure enough, she sent back a horrified look, asking what on earth climbed up into our ceiling.  I just shook my head and went about my day.


When they finally stripped out the ceiling about a week later to extend piping, it was a disaster.  Apparently, the ceiling and walls was just all asbestos, and instead of removing it properly and sealing off the room, the dust went everywhere, including through the vents and into our one furnace room.  The furnaces went nuts and completely overheated as a result of the dust (which we think was a mix of asbestos and iron, which is highly combustible). Our instruments went haywire, too.  The ICP, which barely works on a good day, refused to cooperate, and the AA (the only instrument that is consistent) was giving bizarre calibrations and results.  Add to that the fact we had to wear ventilation masks that day and you’ll understand why everyone was angry. 


After that fiasco, the noises got more and more noticeable, particularly when the contractors weren’t there. You could knocks and scrapping sounds over the fume hoods and ICP.  Without the ceiling there as a buffer, every sound was audible. The only time I didn’t notice them was when the contractors were drilling or sawing.  Then there were the lights.  It’s understandable for contractors to cut power when messing with electrical shit, but the lights went on and off all the time without warning; sometimes it was the contractor, sometimes they just went out.  I think the contractors messed something up and made faulty wiring. I didn’t even care about the lighting so much as the impact on the instruments.  Everytime the power went out, the balance would shut off (sometimes in the middle of me weighing samples).  The moisture analyzer would turn off and then have to be recalibrated.  Thankfully the AA and ICP were on a different breaker and weren’t impacted because I would not have had the patience to deal with that mess.


It was also around this time we noticed things missing from around the lab.  Not huge things, mind you, like instruments, but things easily removed, such as power tools, lab ware, small bottle of chemicals…. Things you could put in a box and get out of the building.  Except lots of people come and go with boxes, so we had no idea who it was, nor did we have cameras in the areas where the missing objects were lifted from (we only have them in main entrances/exits of each building). 


All of these things are easily explained.  But then things got….weird.


My boss, unhappy with both the quality of work and the amount of time it was taking, chewed the contractor and his assistant out.  The day after, all the odd noises stopped.  But the work got even sloppier.  I was used to the assistant’s bizarre behavior, but then he started laughing at completely random things, like the trains that go past our windows, birds that flew past, or simply nothing at all.  If it wasn’t that, it was angry muttering.  And then one day last week, I walked past the door and he was just staring at the torn up ceiling at… well, at nothing really.  There is nothing there to look at besides pipes and wiring. 


Once again, I could chalk this all up to him just being strange, but on Friday I was walking in the hallway while he was up on a ladder by the door to the lab and a drill flew at me.  I dodge it and look at him.  The look of sheer rage on his face….


Now I’ve seen rage before.  I’ve looked in the faces of murderers and in the faces of people affected by brutal deaths.  The look on the assistants face was beyond anything I’ve seen at my time in the coroner’s office.  I can’t describe the twisted, enraged look on his face and the seething hatred I saw in his eyes. 


He told me he “dropped” the drill.  If you drop something, it falls straight down, not out into a hallway. 


I’m sure I’m just imagining things, right?  I mean, the contractors are tired, angry at being bitched at, sick of this job… And I’m overly stressed from wedding planning and thoughts of my upcoming semester… There has to be a logical explanation for his behavior.


Anyway.  The assistant contractor isn’t here today, so he must have taken a three day weekend to relax.  It’s just odd, because if the assistant is out, the contractor usually brings another guy with him to help, but he’s solo today.


Anyone have any ideas as to what this guy’s deal is and how I should proceed?

2bbj0v,2,2014-07-21,How beneficial would an associates degree in CS from a community college be and look on a resume if I have already gotten a BA in something else?,Turin_Giants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbj0v/how_beneficial_would_an_associates_degree_in_cs/,"So, you might recognize my posts from before but I really want to get this right so I hope you guys can appreciate that. Anyways, I went to a 4 year college, got a BA in psych. Stupid decision on my part but I can't undo the past. 

Moving forward: I want to get into the IT line of work, notably Cyber security. That is my goal, at least. Anyways, I was thinking, as a backup/foundation, I could attend a good community college near me and get an associates degree in BS. I would have no intention of continuing that degree at another university unless it absolutely warrants it. If I was to go to community college for CS, I would be simultaneously studying and, hopefully, receiving my certifications in A+ and security +, as well as Microsoft's certification, in hopes that it would raise my chances of landing a good job in the cyber security field. Ultimately, I would hope to get a security clearance, which would help me even more with finding and landing a good job. 

At the moment, I already have a full-time job, that pays salary, but it has nothing to do with what I want to do in CS, but this is relevant because this would stop me from getting any internships.... The only ""hands-on"" experience I would have (hypothetically speaking) would be what I do at home and the certifications that I (hypothetically speaking) possessed. 

What I am trying to get at is that I have a week to make up my mind regarding attending community college to get an associates degree in CS. I don't want to waste my money if its not worth it if I were to get all of those certifications, which I know many employers see as most important. 

I mean I see community college as something that CAN'T hurt in terms of experience and learning and good serve as a good background but I also don't want to waste my time and energy. 

Thank you for your help"
2bbl3t,0,2014-07-21,Programming practice / job prep,thebigbadjay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbl3t/programming_practice_job_prep/,"Hello All,

I graduated college in 2012 with a degree in Comp. Engineering, moderate GPA (3.0). I like to think I was a great programmer too, although I'm more than likely over exaggerating this. After graduation I went to work for the family business, which I now regret. Great pay, shitty hours, really no where to move up. 

So I'm looking to get a job as a developer in a few months. I've always wanted to be one, but I kinda fizzled out of programming practice. So I have a few questions to pose to you guys. Any help is very much appreciated:

1: Anyone have any good projects I can do in Java / C++ / Python that I can use to brush up my skills? I've been working on a self-made scientific calculator in Java / Android as a first practice. It's coming along well, but I can always use the practice with a new idea &amp; new language.

2: How important is experience for entry - level employees? It says 1-2 years experience on all the job listings I saw. Really regretting not going for an internship at least right now (among other things).

3: Should I put together a portfolio of my past work? None of it was professional really, mostly school work / projects. I made an app for the company last year, which wasn't that impressive really. Just something quick and basic that filled a need for my company in particular.

I know these questions are probably addressed elsewhere in the sub. Just hoping to hear something encouraging I guess. Pretty terrified of moving onto this next step. Any help you guys can provide is appreciated.

I worked there for close to a year to move on to another company that happens to be very close to where I was. One of the managers personally asked me to interview. I interview there a few times get turned down the first time. Though on the second go round they hire. 

Sadly doing what they hired me to do was degrading to me and not taking advantage of any of my skills that I had acquired. I learned alot at my internship and I work in my homelab quite a bit. Needless to say I wanted another job preferably one on first shift so I can live a normal life again. A friend is in the process of helping me to gt hired on as a Desktop Support/ Sysadmin Combo. In this process I went out asking for references again and included my internship manager. Now here is the best part, my internship called me back today and offered me a full salaried job with PTO at a pretty awesome salary (no where near where experience sysadmins make though).

Just a lesson to be taught when you do your internship work you Ass off and stay in touch. Never go in a bad mood and it might just pay off.

TLDR; Internship, Crappy 2nd Shift Job, Due to keeping in touch with the Internship and they knew I didn't like my current job they offered me a Full Time Sysadmin Job.

All I have to do is say yes and withdraw my current job application and in 2 weeks il be a SYSADMIN!

I should also mention I'm not old enough to drink yet if that tells you anything."
2bboo2,378,2014-07-21,I recieved a call from my best friend from high school...,irarelysleepatnight,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bboo2/i_recieved_a_call_from_my_best_friend_from_high/,"Last night, I recieved a call from my best friend from high school.
We had been out of touch recently, and hadn't spoken in a few years. She hadn't had a Facebook page, and whenever I called her it went to voicemail. 

In high school, we always had a lot of fun. We got into trouble, stole our parent's alcohol and got black-out drunk, smoked a shitton of weed, but still managed to earn straight-A's. We'd met on the first day of freshman year in homeroom, and instantly became good friends. From then on, we were at each other's houses every night after school, sneaking out to go to parties, telling each other everything, and having typical high school adventures.

When the time came for us to graduate, we'd cried in the bathroom, hiding in her house, drinking vodka and trying to forget. It wasn't the high school we'd miss; it was seeing each other every day, having fun and being carefree, laughing about people and events that had happened. It was all the memories, four years worth of them, and now we were hardly going to see each other any longer.

She promised me we'd have a reunion during Christmas break; she was going off to a college in Philadelphia and I was staying in New York to study jouralism. 

The first December break, she didn't call. I phoned her, and all I got was an automated voice telling me that the phone line was no longer in use. I tried to contact her parents, but there was no success. I tried to find her on Facebook, only to find she'd deleted her account.
I was confused, scared, and missed her a lot. I never heard from her again.

 Until last night.

I got a call from an unidentified number at around 2:00 a.m. When I answered, still awake from studying for a huge test I had the next day, I recognized her voice almost immediately. I'll try to recollect the dialogue as much as possible.

""Hey, April.""

""Um, who is this? Who the hell is calling so late?""

""It's Beth.""

""Holy fucking shit. Beth? As in my high school best friend who dropped off the fucking earth when we started college?""

""I thought you'd forgotten about me. [laugh].""

""Of course not. Holy shit, where have you been?""

After a long sigh, she began recollecting the last few years of her life. When she started college, she'd also been introduced to heroin, and became addicted very quickly. She grew very ill, and almost died a few times. Her addiction lasted for a year, and she constantly was stealing things to get drugs. This behavior ruined her life and future; she did not have enough money to continue for a second year of college, due to all the spending on heroin, and her parents grew suspicious. She'd always had more than enough money for school, as they were a bit rich, and so they forced her to come visit immediately, which she hadn't, since she'd mysteriously stayed home all her vacations to do ""extra work"". In reality, she had been injecting a dirty needle into her arm in the dark.

When they found out she had been on drugs, they were devastated, and checked her into a rehab center. There, she recovered surprisingly well, but when she left, after a few months, she could no longer attent the college in Philadelphia she had been previously attending. She was much too broke, and had wasted all of the money her parents had saved for her.

Being forced to attend a low-grade community college, her future seeming to go nowhere, she sunk into a deep depression. She took up self-injury, always burning and slicing herself, and eventually contemplated suicide. The first year into education at the community college, she attempted suicide. She failed, and wound up in a mental hospital this time.

So now, with two useless years of education, and a past of severe drug addiction and depression, she had barely any education to put to her name, and no money. It was very unlikely she'd get a job any time soon, but her parents, reluctantly, gave her some money to get an apartment in Philly, and get back on her feet. She thanked them profusely, and upon moving into her new apartment, she searched for a while for a job, where she could subsequently attend night school. She ran out of luck. Soon enough, she was doing nothing but sitting in her apartment all day, shooting up heroin yet again. That time in rehab had been in vain.

 I felt terrible. While her life had been turning to shit, I was successful and happy. I was making good marks in college, staying consistant, and avoiding any serious drugs (while smoking the occasional joint). I had a good future set for me. I even planned on being an intern in New York after I finished my final year of college at a magazine company.
Our dialogue then turned to this:

""I'm so, so sorry, Beth. Why didn't you call me?""

""Most of the time, I was too busy shooting shit into my bloodstream to care about anyone besides myself. I was selfish. And then the other times I was in rehab or the loony bin. I couldn't.""

""But are you all right now?""

""Yeah, I was in a really rough time, but I've found a way out. I'm okay now.""

""That's amazing. We need to meet up sometime. I missed you a lot.""

""[Pause] Yeah, maybe. That'd be nice. Remember the shit we did in high school?""

We laughed about our experiences for a while, recollecting on everything we did and how stupid we were. I was in the middle of laughing about one time when we threw a cliche keg party while Beth's parents were out of town, when she sighed.

""What's the matter?""

""Nothing. I'm just- I don't know. I'm sorry, okay? For never talking to you, for being a shitty friend. After all we went through together, and I didn't even keep my Facebook page up. I'm sorry. I love you. We'll see each other again really soon, right?""

She sounded panicked, in a hurry. We were just in a leisurely conversation, having fun and reminiscing, submersing ourselves in nostalgia, and now she was trying to hang up. I checked my phone. We'd been talking for two hours.

""Yeah, definitely. Thank you for calling. Stay safe.""

She chuckled. ""I already am safe.""

""What?""

""I have to go.""

""Good night, Beth. I love you.""

""Goodbye.""

The phone call ended. I felt uneasy, but satisfied. It was 4 a.m, and my roommate was waking up, pissed, asking me why I had been talking for so long. I apologized, drowsy, and headed to bed, although I could not fall alseep. I was too busy thinking about her.

When I was roused from the sleep I'd drifted into, it was my phone ringing at 7 a.m. I answered groggily, annoyed at whoever was calling this early. It was Beth's mom. I was shocked.

She sounded drained, exhausted. I asked her shakily what had happened. She explained to me that she'd gotten an odd voice mail from Beth last night at around ten, saying goodbye. When she didn't answer the phone, she grew very worried, and drove the two-hour drive to Philly to check up on her. She had a spare key to her apartment, and when she entered, she'd found Beth hanging lifelessly from a rope.

I was in shock. I didn't know what to say, but I could feel silent tears making their way down my face. She was dead. My best friend was dead. She'd lied when she'd said she was okay. She only had called to say goodbye.

""The police say she'd been dead for an hour by the time we found her.""

""When did you find her?""

""Around twelve. We knew this would happen, we should have done something to stop it."" I knew she wasn't talking about me; I had had no idea.

And then I paused. ""No, that can't be right. Beth called me at two a.m. last night for the first time in a few years. We talked for hours.""
""We found her before then. That's impossible.""

I hung upwithout responding, terrified. I checked my phone logs. There it said the exact time we'd spoken. It had definitely been Beth. There were things she said that nobody else could have known.

I'm scared. How the hell did I talk to Beth if three hours before she'd committed suicide? I'm exhausted and devastated, and confused. What do I do? Has this happened to anyone else?"
2bbtce,0,2014-07-21,I'm a student thinking I might have screwed myself over.,csjobthrowacct,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbtce/im_a_student_thinking_i_might_have_screwed_myself/,"A throwaway account because this situation seems pretty abysmal to me.
Okay, so here is the situation. For four years I studied to get my Psychology degree, near the end of which, I discovered I hated. I said okay, I'll just double major in Computer Science as well.

It didn't go as expected. Coincidentally, about the second semester into my Computer Science studies, I was both overworked, since I also had a side job and a lot of coursework, and struggling with crippling depression. Suffice it to say, I failed all five of my classes, which were all required.

I have since discovered that I've run out of funding for college. Since I've failed those classes, my gpa isn't so great for scholarships, and all my financial aid has been used up on my other classes. I may just have to graduate with a Psychology degree and call it a day, without any computer science experience and a ruined gpa. I think I might be sitting at like a 2.3-2.5 or so.

Additionally, I've only taken so many math courses. I've taken a lot of statistics, some discrete math, algebra and some trig. No calculus, however.

Is it salvagable? I know that people without traditional CS degrees can get jobs but they're usually not studies like Psychology, it's usually engineering or something more technically minded, even though it is BS in Psychology, more research focused. 

I might be able to do things like get certifications, self study, get a portfolio together, et cetera, and try and see if I can get an internship, but will that even be enough? Will the failure be too big a mark on me?"
2bbzen,7,2014-07-21,[CS Student] Applying for aerospace internships in six months and will be applying for full-time aerospace jobs in 1.5 years. Looking for portfolio / side projects advice.,vic986s,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bbzen/cs_student_applying_for_aerospace_internships_in/,"Ever since I started back school, I've been dead set on getting into this industry. My end goal is to work at one of the main pioneering companies right now like SpaceX or DSI. I realize that landing an internship and/or a full time job at one of those right now is going to be difficult. However, I am fine with starting at a smaller aero company and then working my way up to one of the more prominent players later on in my career.

I live about an hour away from Huntsville, AL, and there are smaller aerospace contractors scattered all over the place there. This coming winter, I'm going to start applying for internships at these companies for the following summer. I want it to be obvious through my resume that I'm set on working in this industry, so I want to be able to complement my school experience with side projects related to the field.

There seems to be a plethora of options out there for related projects, but one that has recently peaked my attention lately is to learn how to simulate aerospace related things. I've found a few books online like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Aerospace-Simulations-Library-Flight/dp/1563479362) one. While not exactly portfolio projects, I feel like going through exercises in books like these would help develop my physics/aerospace knowledge greatly, and also show initiative to an employer. 

I'm not exactly sure how I would list this in a resume though. Also, I do believe knowing how to do simulations like these is relevant to the industry, but would I be better off trying to learn more about embedded electronics? I have a decent enough workstation at home, and I figured I could pick up an Arduino and attempt some projects. However, I feel like the embedded electronics type work is going to be more suited towards EE's and compEngineers. The only embedded related projects I can think of that interest me are stuff like quadcopters, RC planes, and just a bunch of other projects that will cost me a lot of money and be less interesting to me than purely computational projects such as simulations. 

I'm mainly seeking advice on what I can be doing in the next 6mos - 1.5yrs to increase my chances of getting an internship and later a job in the aerospace industry. Thanks a lot for any feedback here!"
2bcffc,8,2014-07-21,Where to move to,TaylorHu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bcffc/where_to_move_to/,"Long story short, graduated from college with a B.A. in Game Design, which contained 0 programming.  Wanted to get a job at a game studio, but had all the student loan debt so I took the first job that came along.  Tech support for a web design/cms company.  Got a girlfriend, an active social life.  Worked my way up to more of a front end dev position.  Got basically comfortable in life, and next thing you know it's almost 4 years later.  Now I am approaching 30, and have realized it's time to get serious with my career.

I'm no stranger to programming, been doing it on a hobbyist level since AP CS in High School.  Decided to really focus on that and I would like to get a development job.  Maybe at a game company, maybe at some web based startup.  I'm not that picky.  While working at a game studio does sound like it would be fun, I'm not as set on that as a career as I was when I was 20.  So self studying, doing the Coursera/Udacity thing.  I can also audit classes through where I got my B.A. from (online), so been auditing my way through their CS program.  Now my question is, where should I move?

The best thing about my job is that it's telecommute.  I am in Phoenix right now, but I am thinking I should move to someplace more startup/tech orientated.  Due to my lack of actual CS degree or internships, I don't think I have a strong enough resume that companies would be willing to fly me out for interviews or anything.  I think my chances of landing a job are much stronger if I am physically there able to go to interviews at attend meetups and all that jazz at a moment's notice.

Now my job only pays around $42k/year.  Not exactly rollin in the dough, but enough that I can rent a studio apartment and buy top ramen until I find something better.  Right now I am thinking either Seattle or Silicon Valley.  

Advantages of Seattle are that my current income would definitely go farther there.  I also like the idea of living somewhere that buying a house one day is, you know, remotely feasible.  I also grew up in Alaska and spent some time in Portland, so I like the outdoors, I like trees and nature and hiking.  In general the Pacific Northwest has a lot of appeal to me.  Being a short, non-stop flight to Alaska whenever I want to visit would also be an advantage, though not one that would come up THAT often.

Advantages of SV are, well, it's SV.  Where all the big money is, the highest concentrations of startups, the highest concentrations of game companies, etc.  But it's also very expensive, I am assuming I'd have to get a place in the dark corners of Oakland at first. But my biggest concern with SV is that I'd be facing competition for jobs from people with degrees from fancy places like Stanford and UC Berkley who had internships at Google.  

I've never really been to either city so I don't have any first hand knowledge of them, looking for advice from people that do.  Is there someplace else I should consider (I've heard good things about Austin lately, but it's never been a place that was on my radar or anything)?

2bcyu7,1,2014-07-21,Settling the Factor of Prestige (at least for this situation),nepid79,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bcyu7/settling_the_factor_of_prestige_at_least_for_this/,"I looked at what the FAQ for this forum says about the importance of the “name” of the CS undergrad program that one attends, but because the question is too general neither the person that attempts to answer the question in the FAQ or I have been able to come to a definitive answer. I am hoping by providing specifics about my dilemma, I can find my definitive answer. Here are pro and cons lists for attending UMass Amherst and University of Wisconsin Madison. The bullet points that are more important to me appear closer to the top of the pros and cons. 


**UMass Amherst**:

Pro:

* I have heard several accounts of people landing jobs with upwards of a 100k salary

* Cheaper cost ( ~20k  every year)

* Closer to Home ( 1.5 hours I am instate)

Con:

* The CS program at UMass is distinguished, but it is not the top of the top so I will be at a disadvantage compared to students from a higher ranked school when companies are deciding whom to interview for internships
* On AVERAGE (not everyone) the students in the CS program will be less competitive and less skilled (sorry if it sounds harsh) 
* Tier 3 School (US News ranking of #25)
* I have not heard anything about the alumni network at UMass


**UW Madison**

Pro:

* More talented student body
Because Wisconsin has an elite program, I will be more likely to an interview for internships
* More of an alumni network
* Tier 2 School (US News ranking of #11)
* NICE Campus
* More Asians (IDK how to explain this one, I am Asian so I like to surround myself with people that share common characteristics)

Con:

* 17 hour drive; 5 hour flight (1,131 mile) – Although I do not plan to come home often. My family is Asian and we are not that traditional so we do not make a big deal about celebrating holidays
* Double the Price (~40k)









**Facts to Consider:**

* As both are in the top 50 CS programs the material being taught is the same

* I can afford both of these schools, but that doesn’t mean I want to piss away any money
* I do plan to work outside of Massachusetts, namely Seattle or California 
* I am more than willing to hear suggestions for different schools with good CS programs

The buildup will be slow, but the payoff(s) should be worth it. I'm trying my hardest to keep the science ""real"" but at the same time ""fun"", for varying levels of both. The outline makes this look like it will be 20 or more parts.

Analyst Mark Jones of the Signals Intelligence unit at NSA was covertly referred to as “Spills” by his coworkers, and at this moment, he was living up to that handle as he valiantly attempted to mop up the coffee that had jostled out of his cup and onto a the cover of one of the many folders laying on the conference table. His boss, Director John Samford, glared at him. “Do you need a sippy cup, Mr. Jones?” he icily ground out. “Or perhaps a bib?” The others at the table squirmed, both feeling sorry for Mark and at the same time, glad they were not the ones receiving the ire of Samford.

“No sir, sorry sir” stammered Mark, as he got the last of the coffee off the covers. Fortunately none of the papers inside them were ruined, which would have probably found Mark outside the front door with no security clearance, no job, and no pension.

Mrs. Rosemary, Samford’s secretary, took pity on Mark and brought him a waste can for him to drop the sodden napkins in. “Thanks” Mark whispered to her, and Samford glared at Mrs Rosemary, who ignored him as she returned the basket. She was quite capable of putting up with him, and he needed her more than the other way around, and they both knew it.

“Now, if we’re done with the water sports, can we get on with your report?” Director Samford asked.

“Yes, sir, as I was about to say, we’ve been seeing an increase of traffic between several research centers, both here and abroad. Most of it seems to be between observatories of various types, but recently we’ve seen a bunch of the same kind of traffic going in and out of JPL.”

“Well, what are they saying? That they’ve spotted a new rock or something?”

“At this time, we don’t know for sure; the email text is mostly encrypted. We’ve been sifting the phone records for whatever we have, but people are using more and more encrypted calls, so not much there.” Samford made a sour face. Ever since that goddamn trator Snowden let leak that the NSA was listening to everyone, people were more and more using free off-the-shelf encryption on their phones. His boss was pushing for a presidential directive outlawing that, but it wasn’t looking good so far, since it would only affect phone usages within the United States, and anyone they were “supposed” to be looking at would use it anyways, law or no law.

Mark continued, “From what we have pieced together, we do know it’s involving the new James Webb satellite and the Far Side moon observatory, and that it’s probably in the southern sky, but beyond that, nothing directly from any scientist involved.”

“That’s it? That’s all you got? I can’t go up the hill with just a ‘we don’t know’ report!” Samford turned the glare up a few notches, which, combined with his sour visage made other parts of Mark’s body pucker up.

Nancy McCalice came to Marks rescue. “Actually, we do have a fair bit more. Apparently, JPL’s Jim Broachfield just came back from Germany where he was meeting with Torsten Fiedler - he’s the director of the Berlin Radio Observatory - and SIGINT’s transcript of the phone call afterwards said that he was ‘on board’ with the operation they have. He was talking with Dr. Bill Robenson, a professor also working at JPL, and said to tell CNN it was a comet.”

“So they did find a new rock, big deal! You’re not blowing my skirt up here.”

Nancy ploughed on with “right after Broachfield boarded his plane, we have a phone call in the clear between a Russian reporter” - this got Samford’s attention, nothing like a Russian to make a briefing interesting - “and his editor where he mentions Fiedler, which triggered the SIGINT system to flag it for review. In in it he was asking her for a plane ticket. His reasoning is interesting and puts a new spin on what we have.” She tapped a spot on her tablet, and the audio of Yevgeny phone call played, with an English translation overlayed:

Yevgeny Kornelyuk: “Viktoriya? Yevgeny.”

Viktoriya Rubipon: “Your last article was crap. Just like the previous article, and the one before, and the one before that. Who cares about fancy dog shows? Maybe I should fire your stupid ass before you file any more crap like this!”

YK: “Yes, I know. Listen, I need a plane ticket and a visa to Texas, quick, today.”

VR: “Are you fucking drunk again? Are you going to start singing to me? I’m not handing out anything to you, I don’t care if you are my favorite nephew twice removed. I swear, if you-”

YK, interrupting: “No, I’m not drunk -  I think I’ve got something.”

VR: “Something or someone? What do you have, some nasty disease that you got from some American cowgirl?”

YK: “Goddammit, shut up and listen! I’ve just been given some stunning information by Jim Broachfield, one of the heads at JPL. Apparently there is some amazing things happening in the solar system, right in our backyard it looks like, and he’s got a whole bunch of people working on figuring out exactly what. It doesn’t look like anyone in the press has noticed it yet, and I discovered it by accident myself - they are keeping it very quiet. I think we have a real chance to report something earth shattering, and get in front of this.”

VR: “What kind of amazing things? A new comet or an metor about to hit us again?”

YK: “No! He gave me some pictures and reports, and I think it’s a goddamn *alien spaceship*”.

Nancy stopped the playback, and Samford stared at her for a very long minute and responded with “I’m waiting for the punchline”.

“Sir, there is no punch line; Kornelyuk managed to get Rubipon to fund a ticket and was able to get his visa approved amazingly fast. He’s already here. Whatever is going on, space ship or not, a lot of people who are a whole lot smarter than us are treating it very seriously. And I think we should too.”

---

*Christ, it was humid* was the first thing that Yevgeny Kornelyuk thought of when he stepped out of the LAX airport. His connecting flight from Texas had been delayed and his luggage made it before he did. Like many foreigners, he assumed that anything to do with space flight in America was in Houston, Texas, but being laughed at by his editor cleared that up.

*Just as well, I would have been looking for a story in the wrong place - again.* He muttered, under his breath, without thinking, “but at least a good place for a farm.”

Dragging his suitcase over the curb, he waved down a taxi. “JPL. Fastest way, please”.

Watching from a few cars down, Agent Boyard Nicles of the FBI pulled out smoothly behind the taxi. “Tracker is working nicely, and what did he mean by a farm?” he commented to his partner. “Hmph” was the only reply.

---


Jim Broachfield was talking quietly with one of the techs working on of the many control panels. The main screens were showing live images the Webb, Hubble, Far Side, and a few other ground-based stations, all of which were showing various star fields. A graph flowed across one display, giving a live composite readout from the SNEWS systems, and a few smaller monitors were showing telemetry data from the Mars Observatory still orbiting the red planet. The sounds of people doing their various tasks and speaking quietly into headsets provided a constant, subtle background noise that only made the buzz of the cell in Jim’s pocket seem that much louder.

“Jimbo. What? You are fucking kidding me! No, goddammit, shit, send him down to main ops. Jesus christ on a pogo stick”. It was hard to hang up a cell phone with the same kind of emotional force as slamming a receiver down, but Jim gave it his best effort. The tech he was standing next to looked up with one eyebrow raised, as if to ask what had his boss so upset.

“Reporters!” growled Jim Broachfield as an answer.

Yevgeny looked apprehensively at the receptionist, who had jerked as if she had been stuck with a cattle prod. “Well then!” she exclaimed “He seemed rather… agitated that you were here, but said to send you over”. Yevgeny nodded, still mostly awed at the displays suspended from the ceiling. “You’re going to need a visitor badge” - the one handed to him said “PRESS” on it in big white letters with a blue background - “and we’ll need to know your contact info.”

“My.. what? My contacts?” Yevgeny was confused. Why would they need them? Was he supposed to wear eyeglasses?

“No, I mean your contact information, like where you are staying and your phone number and stuff,” the receptionist - whose name was Marcy he now noticed - was trying to be helpful with the slightly distracted reporter.

“Oh, da, yes, sorry. I just arrived direct from airport, I don’t have a hotel yet, and my cell is Russian, so I don’t think it will work here, but I can give you my paper’s phone number if that helps.” Yevgeny was apologetic and managed to get his focus away from the replicas - was that *actually* the Mars Rover?

Marcy smiled and said “oh no problem, we can set you up at the Hilton nearby, we do that all the time. As for a phone, that depends on how long you are here for?”

“My visa is only good for two weeks, so just in and out I’m afraid. I might be able to extended it, but not by much”. Viktoriya had pulled a *lot* of strings and called in more than a few favors to get a visa in his name approved, and he was sure some of them involved a bribe. Or worse. At lot was riding on this story, for both of them. If this didn’t pan out, Yevgeny wasn’t sure a farm in Texas - or anywhere - would keep Viktoriya from coming after him, favorite nephew twice removed or not. He had a feeling it would be changed to just *removed*, full stop.

“Well probably not then, but if you need one, let me know and we’ll set you up with a temp one. Oh, here’s Josh, he’ll show to Jim. You can leave your bag with me, I’ll send it over to your room. Nice meeting you!”

Yevgeny smiled back and replied with a “nice meet you too”, before Josh led him deeper into the facility.


---

Boyard listened carefully to the bug that had been dropped in Yevgeny’s suit pocket by an agent in the airport in Texas. “That’s our cue. Get in there and grab the bag, and we’ll hotfoot it to the Hilton”.

“Hmph” was the only reply his partner gave as he exited the car.

“Hi, I’m from the Hilton for Mr. Kornelyuk’s luggage?” the well-groomed man smiled down at Marcy from his impressive height. She stared back up at him, startled by how quietly he had approached.

“Oh!” she squeaked. *Real professional there girl,* she chastised herself. Clearing her throat she tried again, “um yes, my, you are quick, I mean, you got here fast”. *Get a grip Marcy!*

“I was nearby and got a call, so it was simpler to grab it now and drop it off later. That won’t be a problem, will it?”

*You can grab me now and drop me off later,* Marcy thought, mesmerized by his hazel eyes. “N-no, it’s right, um, right here. Room 4023”. She rolled the luggage out and attempted to pick it up, but was stopped by Mr. Tall-and-Hazel before she had a chance.

“Thanks, but I’ve got it,” and with that, he turned and left with Yevgeny’s bag in one hand, as if it was nothing, leaving a very flustered Marcy behind.

---

Boyard was writing up case notes when his partner thumped the luggage into the trunk, and started up the car as he got in. “What room?”

“4023. And you get the bags next time, ok?”

“What, too much for you? Can’t handle one little girl?” Boyard laughed.

“Creeped me out, having to smile like that. Probably creeped her too, acted like she was scared of me.”

---

Josh was recounting what he had found from the Voyager 1 data, much to Yevgeny’s entertainment. He was just so wound up with excitement from what was going on, and being a part of it - he never thought that a summer intern job at JPL would turn out like this!

*Nobody did*, thought Yevgeny. “So, it’s been what, about two weeks since this started?” That didn’t match with the information he had been given.

“Naw man, we’ve only figured it out, like, two weeks ago. Voyager, like, it was sitting on the data for a week or so before it squirted it back to us, and then the new-treeno dudes got their shit together, and then, wham!” he smacked his hands together, causing Yevgeny to jump a bit “magic, man! And then the dude from Australia posted his picture of the thing, and was asking if someone was testing new stealth planes, and we just knew man, just knew!”

Yevgeny hadn’t realized that the blurry picture was from Australia, and he mentally kicked himself for not using an image search to match the source. Of course it would have been posted. “You just knew what? Man.”

Josh stopped and looked around, and cupped his hands in front of him.

2bcza4,2,2014-07-21,Having trouble with interview question: Why are you leaving your current job?,jbo-throwaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bcza4/having_trouble_with_interview_question_why_are/,"The reason I'm looking for another job is pay.

This is the truth, but maybe not the right answer (or is it?). I'm just not sure what else to say.


**Context:**

I'm still getting paid $10/hour for my position as an intern. This is my first job out of College, and I've been at it for about 26 months. I was initially happy with my position, as at that time, I valued experience over pay. But now, for what I do, I could easily be getting twice as much at any other place. My boss even acknowledged this when I confronted him about it last month. He says that he can give me a raise, but not immediately. Apparently he found out about my pay just a couple weeks before. He even offered to set up a meeting with his headhunters. Can't tell if he's being sincere or if it's his way of showing me the door.

In speaking to my manager, he indicated that he expects me to take on more projects. This was the first time I've heard this ... up to this point I had always thought my role was to 'keep the wheels greased', by focusing on bug fixes and feature additions. So there was a bit of miscommunication, as I expected projects to be delegated. I'm very confident in my ability to debug/reverse engineer code, add features, and automating manual processes. But I would agree with my supervisor, I need to do more large projects.

At any rate, I feel rather pigeonholed. If I answer ""pay"", the question becomes: ""How much do you make"". If I say $10/hour, this seems to heavily indicate performance issues. It's entirely possible that I'm making a big deal out of nothing :| But I hope to tap into some wisdom here.

Thanks for any insight, and feel free to ask questions.

2bczur,2,2014-07-21,Should I graduate early or stay the last year for more internship experience?,xjtian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bczur/should_i_graduate_early_or_stay_the_last_year_for/,"I'm in a position right now where I could graduate with a BS in CS next year (spring 2015) after 3 years of undergrad, or stay an extra year, maybe do some research, and add an extra year of internship experience to my resume. I'm considering staying the extra year because I'm not sure if my resume is strong enough to attract many full-time offers.

My page at http://xjtian.com basically has everything that's on my resume. I'll list the highlights here as well.

1. BS in CS at University of Maryland on a full academic scholarship, 3.8GPA currently. Could graduate 2015, technically in the class of 2016.
2. Github: https://github.com/xjtian
3. Summer 2012 &amp; 2013 I interned at the [JHU Applied Physics Lab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Physics_Laboratory). Worked on a wide variety of things my first summer, writing drivers for wired gloves &amp; inertial sensors and a game in Unity3D among them. My second summer I just did front-end web dev &amp; design.
4. Currently, I'm interning at Bloomberg in NYC.

Should I stay for my last year and go for an internship at a big name company in summer 2015 to beef up my resume, or am I a qualified enough candidate for full-time positions starting 2015? Also, if I do stay one more year, should I continue as a full-time student, or do part-time classes (6 credits a semester) and intern part-time?

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

How do I use what little experience I am gaining to get a more development center job?,bain_n_switch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bd3ka/level_1_soft_eng_doing_little_to_no_coding_how_do/,"if you want a little background, you can see my previous post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qbdnl/i_feel_like_i_got_the_bait_and_switchnow_what/

some more background (skip ahead a couple of paragraphs if you just want the question):
basically, I am an older lvl 1 (30) working on a program in which I was told was web development but in actuality ensures high availability of network traffic.   I do little to no coding.  This fact alone grinds on me everyday.  Our baseline is comprised mostly of configuration files and configuration scripts.  We work almost exclusively with oracle products, and I grow more and more frustrated every day I come in to work.  This isn't what I want to do, this isn't what I went back to school to do, this isn't what I put myself in debt to achieve.
I had a better attitude in the beginning but I grow more frustrated every day.  The only thing keeping my spirits up are the good group of people I work with.  Being older than the average level 1 I feel like I don't have any time to waste gaining experience in an area of the field I do not wish to be a part of.  It is unlikely I would be able to transition to another team in the company because of the time investment that has already been made in me, and the team is still in need of a couple more people, so wouldn't let me go easy.  The lead on the team is also really a great guy, and has done everything he could to help me.  While I understand this is reputable and necessary work, and the pay is decent for out of school, no amount of money can keep me happy if I don't find the work at least somewhat rewarding. (end of venting rant)

The actual question:The buzz words I hear tossed around at work are SOA, cloud computing, web services (though I haven't written any), ORACLE products, j2ee (though I barely code in java), JMS, python/jython.  I would like more to work in application/web app development.  Something .NET or RoR/Django related.  Game dev would be fun but probably out of reach for me.  Soon, I will have 1 year exp when I begin my job search, plus 6 month .NET (wpf) internship experience.  How do I use my experience to get a job where I can actually create something tangible?  Or is the forcast of the area of work I am currently in so good that I should make this my home forever?

Please help, thank you."

-Currently interning at hewlett packard as a software engineer (for the summer)
-4 years of being on a first tech challenge robotics team in high school, went to national championships twice
-Spent a year on my current schools mars rover robotics team (competing in the university rover challenge)
-various other coding / programming side projects (don't know how much this matters)

The email was pretty self-explanatory. ""Due to recent reports of alleged security problems by an intern, I have had to temporarily block access to spotify. I apologize for the inconvenience.""

It got around relatively quickly that Jack was the one responsible. Two of the interns quit. They stopped playing music out loud. None of them talked to Jack.

He wasn't in the intern room for very long anyway. About a week after his hire, Boss's Wife decided to let Jack just use her office while she wasn't there, presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him.

*

Day 8. I got an email from Jack. ""I'm having issues accessing Buzzfeed.""

I didn't even move from my chair, emailing back a simple reply: ""Due to management concerns, Buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings.""

His email was immediate. ""Please? I just want to check some things while I'm on lunch.""

I replied back a simple ""No"" and went about my day. and that was the last I ever heard from Jack.

I'm kidding. *Of course it wasn't.*

*

Day 9. Someone had opened my desk. See, I have a laptop in my desk. The laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it, like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a usually-blocked news site. It's common knowledge I have it.

Someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop.

I stormed down to the officer manager's desk. She and I have the only two keys to my desk. I told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing.

""Oh?"" she said, confused. ""Boss came down here and needed the key to your desk.""

""Boss!?"" I was taken aback. ""I...alright."" Maybe Boss needed the laptop for something, I told myself. But that didn't stop me from going straight to Boss' Wife's office.

There, sitting at the polished hardwood desk, sat Jack, with my laptop. And my desk key next to it.

I approached. ""Jack, I need you to give me that back.""

Jack shook his head. ""I got approval from Boss. The computer in here was acting funny, so I asked if I could use your spare laptop and he said yes.""

I was completely stunned. ""So you asked Boss to get you the key to my desk--"" I picked the desk key up and put it in my pocket--""then take my laptop, and use it for..."" I looked over the screen. Two windows docked side by side: Facebook and Cheezburger. ""...this?""

He shifted the laptop so I couldn't see the screen and cleared his throat like I was intruding on his private data. ""Thanks. You can go now.""

*You can go now.*

*You. Can. Go. Now.*

Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Shit doesn't work like this, man. I felt like I wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me, but I steadied my hand and took a breath. The only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a spoiled intern.

The only laptop with unrestricted access.

I smiled at Jack. ""Alright, no problem. Have a good day."" I walked out of the office.

I had a plan. Jack was fucking going **down**.

[How often are there mice casualties, and when they do happen do you feel a guilt about it, or is it just part of the job that you've become accustomed to? Basically, how much emotional baggage comes with the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3wg19?context=5)|It depends on when in the procedure, but eventually all the mice are casualties. The most common place it happens are when we put them through pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. In layman's terms, when we give them epilepsy. This can often have a casualty rate of over 50% and involves watching mice seize, sometimes to death, for three hours.
 |I can tell you with a hundred percent certainty that I haven't met a single researcher who enjoys this process and isn't bothered by it. A lot of people break into tears. At the end of the day we all have to rationalize it by knowing that it will bring good to and improve the quality of life, maybe even save it, for a lot of people.
 |There are other procedures that are difficult as well, such as live profusions to preserve and remove the brain of an animal that is still alive for the preservation stage of the procedure. This really bothered me the first time I did it, but that ""numbness"" that happens after awhile is more you cementing in your mind that this will help a lot of people.
 |Also on related note, there are tons of provisions in place that make sure the animals feel little to no pain at any time and are treated humanely at all times. I know a lot of people say this as a sort of hurried defense but I can attest that we can get in huge trouble for breaking any of these rules and nothing kills a research lab faster than losing grant money because of animal cruelty sanctions. 
[Hello, thanks for doing this AmA. What advice would you have for a high school student interested in a career in science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3rogq?context=5)|It really depends what you want to do in regards to 'science'.
 |If you're talking R&amp;D a lot of it comes down to the university you choose. The specific one I go to has reputation as a large research university that has connections to a lot of local businesses and, in my case, a huge research hospital. So in short I guess just make sure the college you're going to has connections to research opportunities.
 |Also don't be afraid to be wrong in what you first declare as your major. I made a 90 degree change in my path after a year. No one expects you to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at 18 and there's no shame in realizing that what you thought you wanted wasn't what you expected.
 |Finally utilize your advisors. This was my biggest problem coming into college. Unlike your high school (probably) abvisors can help you out with everything from getting you into closed classes to waiving requirements to courses to getting you an internship or job just by asking. *Do not be afraid to ask for help.* It's much better than failing alone.
 |I hope that answers your question at least a little.
[Thanks for the reply, you did answer my question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3tw2r?context=5)|You're welcome. Best of luck in whatever your choose to pursue!
[How do you dispose of the deceased mice? Are they cremated at the lab if they are cremated at all? And if they aren't disposed of properly would there be a big risk of their disease endangering anyone or other mice in the lab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj52obm?context=5)|I'm not sure what the final method of disposal is, I assume it's cremation, though. The last time is see them is bagging them and putting them into a cold room next to necropsy (the room where most post death procedures are performed). The cold largely removes the threat of germ transfer.
 |I will say that none of the mice that I know of are undergoing infectious disease research. There are, however, a lot of mice I don't know of.
 |Transferring disease to the mice I handle is almost nil though. I have to swipe into a room, take my clothes off, change to scrubs, a mask, gown, shoe covers, gloves and a cap, then go through a 30 second air shower. Any outside material we bring in goes under a uv hood. It's very tightly controlled (and pretty cool) . Additionally if you go through any of the ""dirty"" areas that animals are kept in you have to either shower or wait 24 hours before going behind the clean barrier again.
 |Tl;Dr of that last paragraph: there are a ridiculous amount of sanitary procedures in place to minimize risk to us and the animals. 
[everything possible is done to minimize pain and discomfort. When experiments are not occurring the mice are treated very well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj42ld8?context=5)|Minimize is a key word there. We do everything we can to make it as humane as possible but there is always some risk. However without animal testing what option is there? People don't respond well to injecting their children and loved ones with untested drugs.
[Also, experiments will not be approved if the experiments could possibly be completed in a different model organism (i.e. cell culture, yeast, fruit flies, or nematodes\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj42ld8?context=5)|This as well. Animals are expensive and require a lot of people and a lot of time to take care of. There's often this thought of ""unnecessary"" testing for drugs and products going on. People don't understand the culture of lab work and how important budgeting your, often sparse, resources is.
[How friendly are the mice that you work on?.  If you wanted to could you like pet and hold them?!.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3sp2f?context=5)|Well the mice i work with specifically are actually pretty nasty. We induce epilepsy in them for the work we're doing and for some reason this makes them particularly aggressive when you're trying to handle them. They like to bite and don't really want to be touched, luckily almost all the hands-on work we do with them involves them being sedated in one way or another.
 |In general though the mice that are in the clean barrier (where a majority of the mice in the research wing are kept) are nice and playful like any normal mouse you'd buy in a pet shop. Part of the animal training involves picking up the mice and putting them on your hand and those mice were perfectly content to just chill on your hand and sniff around.
[Not to be an ass, but could the aggression not stem from fear over the experimentation? (I've heard research dogs are basically unadoptable for similar reasons.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj40l2i?context=5)|No offense taken. It's possible, though there are many possibilities and I'm sure someone could do months of research on just that issue. Personally i think it's more to do with the region of the brain that the pilocarpine targets: the hippocampus.
 |Since the hippocampus plays a huge role in memory storage my hypothesis is that it messes with or deletes their memories of humans, possibly even causing a type of mild anterograde amnesia. This would mean that despite being raised by humans the mice would have no perception of what we were and would be scared by even our appearance (they do get a bit skittish as well and are easily scared if you peer too close to their box).
 |Who knows, maybe it's just a reaction to severe pain. They don't care for other mice much after the status either. Your guess is as good as mine.
 |This is just another reason science is so interesting, always raising more questions.
[How hesitant are you to talk to your PhD bosses/supervisors about science when they know so much more than you do, and almost any question highlights the fact that you know so little as a college student? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3xrfs?context=5)|The PhD candidate I work under is awesome. She's my main liaison at the lab and my contact with her is essential to my everyday work. We have a very open work relationship and I'm not hesitant to ask her anything I'm unsure of. She was in her undergrad not too ago so she understands where I'm coming from.
 |The doctor who runs the lab on the other hand is a little more imposing. I've only spoken to him a half dozen times in so many months. Though he is a font of knowledge from what I've gleaned. He's also an expert in laser microscopy which is pretty interesting and which I do a lot of in the lab. I normally wouldn't approach him since I honestly feel like I don't know what I'm doing when I talk to him. 
[Real question! what is the difference between your control and experiment group? (i.e.\) what are they receiving and are they from the same litter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4919w?context=5)|The control receives a dose of our treatment before we record them (sorry, unpublished results tight now and we're working against another researcher) and the control group receives a saline injection.
 |I believe a that we are using the same litter for mice being recorded at the same time. However with an n near 100 that's not entirely possible. We do use the same breeders multiple times and all mice are genotyped after we record them to ensure consistency. 
[Do you work for a research company named Jackson? Or Jackson Labs or Jackson Research or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3tzci?context=5)|No, I work in the research wing of a nationally ranked hospital.
 |Anyone familiar with the area I live in could probably guess where based on the design of my badge in my proof.
 |I looked it up and Jackson Labs is actually who we get a lot of our mice from since our research requires mice with specific genes activated and deactivated. It's just usually abbreviated JAX whenever I see it.
[I'm close friends with Dr. Sanchez, if my conjectures are correct, he is a vet that takes care of the animals.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3xsd1?context=5)|I'm not familiar with that name. 
[Neuroscience seems like an interesting field which I unfortunately never got the chance to explore all that much while I was in undergrad (just graduated in May with a BS in molecular biology and a chemistry minor\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4aweb?context=5)|I do quite a bit, actually. I section brains, stain slides, do confocal imaging, analyze those images, analyze our EEG data, and I've even helped or performed numerous surgeries or operations.
[How much do you currently do around the lab and are you planning to increase your responsibilities in the future? Any plans for after you graduate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4aweb?context=5)|I don't write any of the papers or design any of the experiments, though, and I don't get paid (unfortunately). I alluded to it in another post but I'm not sure what I'm going to pursue yet. I'll be taking the MCAT but this work has actually sparked a strong interest in the research side of medicine. 
[Very cool, especially the surgery bit. I'm in a similar situation at the moment and I've learned that there is never a downside to keeping an open mind about your interests and goals. You'll never know where you might end up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4zwmi?context=5)|Definitely, an open mind is really the best thing you can have as a college student/young professional. There are so many things that you've never had exposure to and writing them off only hurts you.
[PS: don't let the trolls get to you. I had a similar reaction from people when I told them about my experience in biotechnology/bioengineering research. Anti-GMO people are...interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj4zwmi?context=5)|Eh, I'm over it, but thanks. I can only tolerate people who are purposely ignorant for so long. as for GMOs, talk about a topic that people detract for similar reasons. I'd ask the more or less the same question I asked the troll, ""What are your alternatives? Where's your data that it's a bad thing?""
[Yeah, thats pretty much how I handled the whole GMO thing as well (although it gets annoying thanks to all of those ""truth about Monsanto"" websites which never get peer reviewed anyway\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj5akoq?context=5)|It's amazing how much misinformation is spread and how much people take it to heart. It actually makes me sad sometimes because it stifles scientific progress.
[Good luck on your MCAT! I'm working on mine now :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj5akoq?context=5)|Thanks and good luck to you as well. I'm not taking mine for a semester or two but I'm already getting study materials together/looking at courses.
[What are your aspirations beyond undergrad? What type of mice do you use (just curious\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj46jlf?context=5)|Honestly I'm not 100% sure. Originally I was all about getting into med school, and I still plan on taking the MCAT and applying, but doing this has opened my eyes to the research side of medicine and how interesting it is.
 |I know the mice we use are all from JAX, which is a massive supplier but off the top of my head I don't know the strain. 
[Awesome! Best of luck on the mcat. I'm studying for the GRE right now and hope to go to grad school to get my ph.d. in neuroscience. We use Peromyscus californicus in the lab I work in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj57fph?context=5)|Thanks, and best of luck to you too! I have a few friends who just took the GRE and their life was hell in the weeks leading up to it but the studying paid off. Good luck with grad school as well, with any luck you'll end up doing some really cool and beneficial research.

It's part of the curriculum for most undergrads for a pre-medical/biology track.
[How often do experiments that worked on mice actually work on other animals, or even humans? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2bbws0/iama_research_assistant_that_works_in_animal/cj3uyze?context=5)|I can't accurately answer this question from a numbers standpoint buy I can say that nearly every procedure or drug you've ever used probably went through some level of animal testing on an animal that had a valid human analogue.

This started earlier this summer when I got a, let's just say internship, at a fairly large tech company (corp#) that operates out of Canada. CORP# provide business solutions for very large businesses. They have many important server banks, most of which are not easily accessed from the office location, luckily for the poor sob(let's call him Rodney). How ever the in house dev servers, that housed the pride and joy of the devs, were quite easily accessed. Our story begins on my second day of the internship. I'm given the skill testing task of reimaging many of the company's old machines for an upcoming staff sale. Rodney just wanted that job off his plate. This ranged from lenovo t40's to dell precision 390's. On this day I was given the task of getting the image off one of the computers (that Rodney had already imaged) via clonezilla. Rodney however was not present, so I was on my own to learn the ins and outs of their process. Being the curious little shit that I am I decided to do a quick virus scan of the computer I was about to take the image from and found there to be what can only be described as a *colony* of viruses. I began to chuckle.

&gt;headIT: What is it Liam?

&gt;me: Rodney has been nurturing a colony on his computer


He got up form his desk and began his usual relaxed walk over to my desk however his slow meander turned into a brisk walk when he spotted the red number showing just how F*%# up this computer was. His eyes widen and nostrils flare as he basks in the horror of the thin scroll bar.

   
   I left my desk to allow him some space as he slowly assessed the damage. I didn't mind, there's a Foosball table. Its a good thing Rodney wasn't there either or he might have no longer been with us. 

   After what seemed like an eternity I was allowed back to my desk and instructed to do nothing and not touch that computer in the slightest. The finish window was to be kept open until Rodney returned the next day.

   The other techs told me it would be best if I just went home for the day and prepared for the sh!tst0rm that was to become Rodneys Reality.

I'm a university student majoring in Accounting and Finance and am currently at a sophomore level, starting my junior year coursework in Fall of 2015.

I understand that, typically, accounting students do their internships in the summer between their junior and senior years, but I'm looking for something better than retail grunt in the meantime.

My main experience is in retail sales and food service and I'm looking to get out of the ~minimum wage area.

My course schedule for the fall is set up for me to have classes Mondays and Wednesdays only, so I have a work friendly schedule.

Currently, I'm trying to break into a bank teller position, but I'm not having much luck on that score.

I'm in my mid-20's (Non-traditional student) and have a great deal of work experience. Here's a brief list of my most prominent skills:

- Most work experience is grocery stores, department stores, and fast food.

- Exceptionally strong and recognized communication skills including public speaking to large audiences.

- Supervisory experience (have been in charge of up to 48 employees at a time)

- College extracurricular activities involving managing an $80,000 fund, event planning for 1000 students, lots of neat leadership-type stuff

- Lots of cash handling, including book keeping for $50,000 cash on hand.

Those are my main selling points, I have lots of other given skills like food safety, customer service, familiarity with MS office, my own transportation, etc. I've also been told by a few sources that I interview very well.

I'm looking into staffing agencies, but there are so darned many of them here in Charlotte, that it's a bit overwhelming and the larger part of them look shady/unprofessional by their web-presence.

Thanks for any help/advice!

TL;DR: Mid-20s, student, lots of experience and uncommon skills, making less than $9/hr, want to start pulling +$10/hr, tried banks, not going so hot."

I just found this subreddit by accident and I have been reading about the myriad of threads on job prospects and MS/Ph.D expectations. 

So I recently was accepted to CWRU's MS Program for Systems Biology and Bioinformatics and I am planning on going with their specific track in Molecular &amp; Computational Biology and will start the program next Fall (due to current work commitments). I am going in with a BS in Genetics from UCD and I have supplemented the degree with CS courses (up to Machine Assembly and Data Structures) as well as self-teaching myself SQL.

Now based on people that I know who works in the industry, some have told me to go with the Master's Thesis route as it enhances your CV/Resume when you graduate in two years and it demonstrates your skills. However, I see myself really wanting to go intern during the summer next year in a biotech company back in California (where biotech companies are everywhere) instead. I am focused on wanting to work in the industry and not academia and applying myself in technical applications over wet-lab, classical research. 

If I do choose to go with the Master's Thesis, I find myself stuck for the next two years literally at the university to get it done, but I really want to also get experience from the industry so I kind of not want to waste my big summer break in the lab. So my question to this wonder subreddit community is if the Master's Thesis is significant for the industry or it is better to not go with the extra mile and just find internships instead?

so a little background first im 17 now and my dad is 51 i live with my mom(48) and my brother(14) and my cousin sister(25) she was living in our house for past 2 years as she was studying and doing an internship under my dad  so this happened yesterday and i just don't know what to do 
 
so moving to main story 
.....
yesterday afternoon at around 1 pm  i was using my laptop and the 
power went out as it was not charged (because of cs 1.6) i asked  my dad for his laptop for the time being as i knew he always had his laptop charged up so i went to ask him and he said yes so i took the laptop to my upstairs and started lurking on reddit and stuff it was around 1:40 the horrible thing happened as i was trying to play my songs in the background through pd i opened the played before choosing the song as i oped it i saw some thumbnails of videos with me so i opened one of them and saw they were my baby videos i was happy very happy as i have not seen them for quite a long time as i was playing them (in continuation a video opened (purely by chance) 
......
them came the horror it was a video of my dad having s*x with my cousin i was shocked ,petrified as i watched that video with tear in my eyes ....
because the cousin was the one living in our own house she was my best sister(among 7 more cousins )i used to share every detail with her 
she was always polite and helped me whenever i asked
so as i watched the full video i cried and just fell numb for about 10 minutes. 
After that Ibecame angry but the horror did not stop there 
so i started search his laptop for more evidence i searched everything in his laptop videos photos everything them i started opening doc files and read every one of them (this went till around 3pm) then as i was opening one of them ..........
 i read this (exect as it was in the doc)

Q How did like the last time ?
Q So when will be the next time we do that ?
Q Did you liked the taste ;)
 
and many more questions like this

and in the end 
 your love (insert cousin's name)

i felt like killing them both and this did not stop there were docs like this as old as 19 months and what more did i find f ing pics of my sister 
 i felt horrible for even opening them ..
 so fast forward 2 hours i have him his laptop back (he leavers for work around 5:30) so at around 8 pm he comes back home with my cousin as she is an intern under her i open the door and just stare felling how could this have ever happened but it did i felt like puking and my stomach have been churning since then and the anger oh the anger

Holy shit.  Holy shit holy shit holy shit.

Contractor's assistant is dead.  He was stabbed to death. 

Freaking out a little, guys. 

Going to text the guys I used to work with at the coroner's office.  Maybe they can give me more info, because all anyone knows is that the kid was stabbed to death. 


Fuck. I'll let you know if I find out more.  All is quiet at work today, but I have been avoiding the lab and doing computer work because I'm freaked out.  The contractor didn't come in to work because of what went down. 


Edit: So I submitted this with 24 hours of my last post, but whatever, I have more to update.  I had managed to calm the fuck down until I got details from the coroner's office.  I shouldn't post them, but fuck it, I'm freaked the hell out and it's not my ass on the line if details get out.

The kid wasn't just stabbed to death.  His guts were basically shredded like ribbons.  ""Pete"" (my coroner contact) said that you couldn't even tell which organs were which, it was just a big sloppy pile of blood, skin, and tissue.  He doesn't know what they will find at autopsy, but he said he'd keep me posted.

But the part that freaks me out the fucking most are the facts surrounding how his body was found.  The contractor didn't know where the kid was and called the kid's girlfriend, who went over to check on him.  All the door were locked, the windows shut and locked, no AC running (which is weird because it was over 80 degree this weekend).  She went in, the house was completely normal until she got to the kitchen and saw him there.  The neighbors called the cops when they heard the girl screaming.  No one had heard from him this weekend, not his girl or parents, but the neighbors said they heard angry muttering Sunday night, but nothing else.  There were no signs of struggle or break in at the house or on his body based on cursory observation. The neighbors didn't hear a struggle or screaming.  And they found a bloody hunting knife beside the body, but no other signs of a person in the house.  No bloody foot prints (and there would have been according to Pete because of the amount of blood), no signs anyone cleaned up ....

EDIT 2:  Holy fuck, Pete just told me that they think all the wounds are self inflicted based on the wound patterns.  What the fuck was going on with this kid?? There is no way this is related to the weird shit at my internship right?  Like, I NEED some one to talk me down. "

I am a recent university graduate from a top public engineering school with a degree in CS specializing in software engineering. My dream is to head out to San Francisco and work at a startup company, however as of yet all the companies in SF I have interviewed with have fallen through in either the second or third round interview.
I have a final round interview with a company in a city close to where I am living which I am fairly confident I will get an offer from. The only catch is that position is in software testing and not development, which is what I really would like to do.

My questions to you are:

1. Would it be better to take the job near to me and build my resume and then after a year or two look at at jobs in San Francisco, or keep up my job search till I find the job I want.

2. Does working in software testing kill your chances at getting a development job in the future?

If it makes any difference I have no previous internship or co-op experience. The job I had before now was working as a TA for my university.

I specifically want to be a business analyst/ project manager. would this degree be a good choice? if so what specific courses out of the ITI program should I be focusing on and take? I also know that since the classes arent going to give much real world skills that I have to go out and acquire outside knowledge and also get internships etc..

I need some advice on where to go next. 

A little about me: 

Like the title says, I'm a rising sophomore at a public liberal arts college in the midwest(4.0, CS major). I'm about to finish up a business/finance internship at a Fortune 500 aerospace company. My big project this summer was writing a VBA macro that pulled HTML information from the web, but I also had a few business-related tasks.

As far as projects are concerned, I'm a budding app developer who just released his first app (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWyKlbIh_CM) and want to continue making apps, perhaps for a living. It took a lot of time so it's the only project I have so far.

Here is my situation: there is a pretty good chance that I will get a CS internship at this company next summer; however, I'm not sure whether I want to go back (culture is boring as far as I can tell). I've also really been wanting to get into the startup scene, and have thought about applying to startups in California next summer. I also would LOVE an internship at one of ""the big 4"" and will definitely be applying to those as well. I plan on studying heavily this semester (reading Code Complete, etc) as well.

A couple questions: what would you do in my situation? Does the non-CS internship look good at all if I'm applying for a CS internship? Should I apply other places? Is the internship that I'm already likely to get at the company I'm with going to stand out on a resume? Are my chances of getting any internship related to app development reasonable?


It should be noted that should I get an offer from my current company, I'll have until late october to decide on it.

Thanks for any advice you might have."

I am the only programmer (web developer) at the company and so there's no real set salary. I looked up averages for my university and cs specifically, but as the job is web development I am not sure if those apply. I'm general im not even sure what my position really is.

For the internship I'm developing backends of crud systems and restful api's eventually going to build web apps. Though I have to do everything single handedly. Database design and layout, frameworks, how the Apis work, basically everything. Presumably I'll need to fully design the layout of apps and what is needed.

What salary should I ask for? Both coop and full time positions are going to be discussed I believe. I've looked at glassdoor and salary.com plus my school and I assume for coop 16-22/hr is fair, am I remotely correct(Midwest)? Full time I would say 57-65k/yr. 

Are my numbers valid? Is there somewhere that's respected for averages? How should I go about negotiations, any tips?

I am currently a high school senior, just thinking about the future in general as I enter my last year of high school. I know it is typically unusual for a freshman in college to get an internship, but I would like to try my hardest to get one so I can experience different sides of the programming career in each summer of college before I graduate. I think that getting an internship at a startup would a good place to begin this.

One of the things I am interested in is knowing what type of technology/language I should focus on. I know that technology is constantly changing, but I assume not much will change in the course of a year. Since I'll be busy focusing on college applications and other activities, I would like to spend most of my time building applications in one language/framework so I can have multiple projects to show to potential companies. I think this would be better than trying to juggle a lot of different languages at first.

From the research I've done, it seems that the most popular technologies for startups are Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Django (along with iOS/Android in general, but I'm more focused on webdev right now). I am getting better with front end dev (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) every day, but I want to spend more time making full stack websites and I can't really decide which would be better to focus on. I've made a couple of test sites with Rails and Node and I really don't have a preference as to which is more ""fun"" to develop in.

So, what is the best route to go for the sole purpose of getting an internship at a startup? What languages/frameworks to focus on? Thanks."

My internship is coming to a close within the next 2 or so weeks and I'm having terrible stress about what I've accomplished. 

Basically, I was given just 1 big project throughout the internship and I'm worried that the team I worked with will look down on me because I wasn't able to finish their project. The reason is because the project was very challenging (at least compared to the projects at my previous internship) and I had zero experience with some of the tools and languages used. 

Because of this, I had to ask a million questions, google, watch youtube videos, and research a ton just to progress throughout the project. Everyone was very kind and more than willing to assist me, which I guess is where the guilt is coming from. Also, I wasn't micromanaged at all for this project, I was kind of a free bird so I realized I spent way too much time on certain portions of the project than I should have. At the most I can give them a half assed application that is kind of a useless and needs more work (alpha build as they call it?).

Just the whole meme of ""you had one job"" keeps playing in my head, because it's true, I did have one job. They paid me a ton to finish this damn project and I couldn't accomplish it. It's kind of annoying because the other interns I know received significantly less challenging work and have been/are finishing up their projects. They can safely say they accomplished their team's goal and will probably receive job offers. 

I've already been in contact with my supervisor, as he recently gave me a performance evaluation and had nothing but positive things to say. However, when I directly told him that I probably won't be able to achieve the ideal outcome of the project before my internship, he seemed kind of taken back a little bit. He said he won't be disappointed and completely understands since I had minimal exposure with the tools used. Nevertheless, I feel like I could still sense a little bit of disappoint from him. 

I have two major upcoming presentations, one to a group of management personnel outside of my team (very formal, professional, etc) and another one directly to my team (more casual).  I'm having bad anxiety about the one to my team because only my supervisor knows my project won't be 100% complete. Now I gotta let 6-10 other people know that what I did this summer really isn't going to be of use to them until someone else takes the plate and finishes it.

So do you guys have any words of wisdom for me? Criticism? Opinions? 

Sorry for my poor paragraph organization and/or structure...the stress is really getting to me I think. "

I stupidly took the first job that was offered to me straight out of uni. I studied a law degree and because this job was advertised as relating to ''law"", I snapped it up. Immediately, I got a weird feeling about the job and the interview itself made me question the merits of the company. They told me and the other trainees that we would be working with legal claims and would be really helping people who had been in accidents however, when we started , we realised this was nothing more than a glorified tele sales job! We spend 10 hours a day calling and effectively harassing people and it is making me miserable. I constantly get abuse on the phone and am so bored and sad, I don't feel like doing anything when I leave work. I have only been working here for 3 weeks but I already dread work. I feel like I have been lied to about the job and the job role.  It is hardly related to law, everyone who works there hates it  and the managers treat us all like idiots. The problem is that it is a job and I don't know whether I should stick it out just because it is something to go on my cv? Part of me thinks I should quit next month and look else where and perhaps get some legal work experience but the other half thinks I should stay and just be miserable for a year. The company itself seems like a scam in that they do a lot of dodgy things but I was told in the interview there is a lot of room to move up in the company which is the only good aspect about this job. I don't think I will get another job if I quit due to being fresh out of uni so I would have to look at internships and so I don't know if I should just stick it out or not ? I am just so confused, please help !!! 

In terms of the money side of it , it is okay pay, nothing special at all. If I did quit , my dad has already said I can go home and live rent free whilst looking for more work however, that seems like a huge step backwards :(. 

Oh, and I have expressed my thoughts with the managers and the HR manager who hired me and they really don't care. They are constantly hiring, training and firing people so I doubt they care less about the fact this job was falsely advertised.

As the lead programmer at my company I've interviewed a few interns and have worked with them one on one. I was an intern 8 years ago and worked my way up to a full-time web position (and have since moved on) so I know what it's like from both sides, here's a few things I've learned, and a few don'ts:

What I've learned:

- **Interns sit in a gray area** between profit, investment, and loss. I've taken someone from barely competent to very competent. I really feel like my (and my peers') tutoring was more valuable than a few college courses.

- That said, as an intern, **don't assume you're giving the company more than you're getting** (even a free internship). Mentoring requires weeks of taking someone very competent off-task, just to get you to the point of a net gain for the company. If you receive an internship, it's honestly not often a good investment for the company; it could be, but most interns leave after their term.

Anyway. As a mentor, the most annoying thing is interns with an **ego**.

- **If you try to complete my sentences because you think ""you got it; you got it"" then you're annoying your mentor**. I can't count how many times I had my sentence completed or talked over just to tell them that no, that's not what I was going to say. By talking slowly and in detail I'm actually trying to **keep you** from looking like a n00b. When I have to say ""no, that's wrong; like I said: it's like this"" in a slow and louder voice so everyone can hear, I promise right after you leave my peers and I will bitch about you.

- I understand maybe you feel a need to **prove yourself** as good enough or something, but please, please don't. We hired your for your potential and because you seem like a good learner. It's disappointing and dishonest if suddenly you are hard to teach, regardless of your skill.

- I'm (and most professionals are) a pretty good gauge of your current level of ability. If I stop to explain something slowly to you, its because **I'm pretty sure you don't know what I'm about tell you**. (And that's totally fine! A good learner is way more valuable than someone pretty competent, but with an ego)

- If you have an ego *and* get visibly frustrated about something I told you and you can't quite ""get,"" or argue with me that I ""didn't say that,"" you're causing more trouble than you're worth, literally.

But on a positive note:

- I really enjoy mentoring. I got my start as an intern, and I'll never forget the guys who taught me what I know; I learned more from them than my college courses. I really want our interns to succeed, and it hurts both the intern and the mentors if that relationship isn't respected.

And the best part for those of you who are looking for an internship: **the skills you have coming into the internship aren't really our only concern**. What we look for is:

- **Humility and appreciation** for the education we're giving you. **Ask questions** if you don't know something. Don't try to save face: just say ""Hey _____ ? I'm sorry, I forgot what you said about _____, could you show me that one more time?"" Do NOT try to blame your mentor for your trip up. You'll gain a lot of respect and trust for manning up

- **A friendly attitude.** If I'm sitting next to you for 100 hours in the next month, you better be pleasant. If it's a chore to explain things to you or if you're overly sensitive, you won't be recommended for a position; it's totally not worth it.

Anyway, this turned out way longer than I meant it to be. Any current / future-interns, I hope this helps you get on the right side at your company and lock in a position if that's what you're going for! You'll learn a ton and will create a very special bond with both your mentor and your company!"
2bidnu,2,2014-07-23,Hi guy wanted some advice and legal help,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2bidnu/hi_guy_wanted_some_advice_and_legal_help/,"Hi, I am new to reddit and its my first post, please bear with me. So a little background first: I'm 17 now and my dad is 51. I live with my mom(48) and my brother(14) and my cousin sister(25). She was living in our house for past 2 years as she was studying and doing an internship under my dad.


So this happened yesterday, and I just don't know what to do. So moving to main story.... Yesterday afternoon at around 1 pm I was using my laptop and the power went out. As it was not charged (because of cs 1.6), I asked my dad for his laptop for the time being as I knew he always had his laptop charged up. So I went to ask him and he said yes, so i took the laptop to my upstairs and started lurking on reddit and stuff.


It was around 1:40 the horrible thing happened as I was trying to play my songs in the background through pd. I opened the played before choosing the song. As i opened it I saw some thumbnails of videos with me, so I opened one of them and saw they were my baby videos. I was happy, very happy, as I have not seen them for quite a long time. As i was playing them another a video opened, purely by chance... Then came the horror.


It was a video of my dad having sex with my cousin. I was shocked, petrified, as I watched that video with tear in my eyes .... because the cousin was the one living in our own house. She was my best cousin (among 7 more cousins). I used to share every detail with her she was always polite and helped me whenever I asked. So as I watched the full video I cried and just fell numb for about 10 minutes.


After that I became angry but the horror did not stop there. So I started searching his laptop for more evidence. I searched everything in his laptop; videos, photos, everything. Then I started opening doc files and reading every one of them. (This went til around 3pm.) Then as i was opening one of them I read this (exactly as it was in the doc): Q: How did like the last time? Q So when will be the next time we do that? Q Did you liked the taste ;)


...And many more questions like this. And at the end your love, x (cousin's name). I felt like killing them both and this did not stop. There were docs like this as old as 19 months. And what more did I fucking find? Pics of my cousin. I felt horrible for even opening them...


So fast forward 2 hours. I have him his laptop back (he leaves for work around 5:30). At around 8 pm he comes back home with my cousin as she is an intern under him. I open the door and just stare, feeling how could this have ever happened. But it did. I felt like puking and my stomach have been churning since then.


And the anger, oh the anger. I didn't sleep last night and not even going to tonight. My mind is hurt. I just do not know what to do. Should I tell my mom all of this? Or ask my cousin to confess all of this? Help me guys. I don't know how to handle this situation... please help me if you can. Q I do not know how to confront my sister or my dad? Q Should i tell my mom first about this or first confront them ?

tl;dr: used my dad's laptop and found his and my cousin sextape

Edit My dad came home but without my cousin I asked him where she is and he said ""She has gone to the company's other office in a near by town and tomorrow he will also be going there "" I asked him for his laptop but said he left it in the office .Now I am thinking that tomorrow they will do it .But I do not have any evidence .
Q Is there a way i can remotely take the video or chats out ?
And thank yo all for the support now my main plan is to gather evidence first then talking to my mom.."

As a project while I'm there, they wanted me to look at reasons for leakage from a screw plug and then some possible solutions to it. So the screw plug sits on a copper washer which deforms to produce a good seal. The screw plug is a M26x 1.5 hexagonal bolt and the copper washer OD is 29mm and ID is 26 mm with average thickness of 0.95mm 

I feel the copper washer isn't deforming enough and I wanted to see how it deforms using FEA and force calculations. When measured, the copper washers usually deforms to 0.87-0.91mm thickness. The tightening torque for the bolt is 80 +-20 Nm.This large a deformation is something I cannot explain by theory(hookes law or roarks stress equations) or by simply FEA as the required force I calculate is around 800,000 N (which obviously seems too high). Does anybody have any idea where I could be going wrong and what I should be looking at. 

If it matters the screw is a chromium plated steel screw and the housing is cast iron. I'm using

I took a job in Wyoming but after finding out that my ""internship"" was going to be me spraying weeds with violently homophobic people in the hot sun for three dollars an hour I packed up my bags and went home after about 3 weeks. My grandmother sent me the money through my mom but my mom spent almost all of it, so I had to get the cheapest flight with about 3 layovers and then take a train home.


I've been living with my parents since then and my mother never fails to make me feel like a lazy freeloader about it. I've been looking quite hard for a job, but I have so much to fix with my life and I don't even know where to start.


My license is suspended and I can't get it back until I pay 675 dollars, and my mother will not give me a ride anywhere and we live in the boonies so it's like I've been living on house arrest the entire summer. I feel trapped. It's like solitary confinement. My father, the only person in the family who actually likes me is almost always away on business.


They also moved from our hometown a few months ago so it's not like I have anyone close who is willing to drive 3 hours just to hang out with me here and there. I feel like I'm going insane from boredom and lack of things to do and my mother won't even let me open a window in ""my"" room, and never fails to use terms like ""'disgusting"", ""retard"", ""ugly"", ""pig"" because she obsessively cleans as a housewife and I don't. 


There is so much to be done and I just don't know where to start. I'm extremely depressed, I just feel so listless and alone all the time. I've been spiraling downward into really negative thinking habits and I just feel like my entire life --- literally nobody has ever treated me like I was worth something to them.


I was always just something to be used --- either as a ""trophy child"" to my parents when my grades were good, or as a ""cool friend' who had a car and access to drugs, or as the person who was always willing to lend an ear. No one has ever granted me the same liberty. I'm just like toilet paper, to be used for my purpose and thrown away accordingly. It makes me wonder what is so horribly wrong with me that everyone feels the need to treat me this way, even my own mother.


I just feel like crying all the time and ending it. I had antidepressant but my mom threw them away, saying she didn't want a ""crazy person on crazy pills"" in the house. But I really need them. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just extremely mentally retarded and no one has bothered to tell me.


I bought some granola at the store the other day, my mother accused me of stealing it and threw it all away, then threw the empty bottle at my face. She then told my younger sisters that I am a disgusting thief and they should never be seen with me. I just want some sunshine in my life, but it's like I'm just drenched in constant rain. I want to die. I just can't see it ever getting better for me."

* US citizen
* 23 years old
* Have been at my current job as a software engineer for 1 year
* B.A. in Astronomy, 2013 (not as super lame as it sounds, I swear)
* Hoping to be able to live in NZ for at least 12 months, preferably in Christchurch

Questions about looking for jobs in NZ as a foreigner:

* Is it even possible for someone with only 1 year of experience to get a job offer as a foreigner? Software engineer is on the ANZSCO list of long term skill shortage occupations, but I don't have the type of degree or years of experience that are listed under ""requirements""--does that mean that any company offering me a position would have to prove that no one in NZ can fill it?
* My boyfriend tells me that many NZ companies will only hire through recruitment agencies. But if a job posting just says ""send your CV to blah blah to apply,"" does that mean they aren't using an agency, so I can apply as long as it doesn't say ""we're only interested in NZ-based applicants""?

Questions about Working Holiday visa:

* My primary purpose in going to NZ will be to work (assuming I can get a job first!). Therefore I don't think I qualify for a Working Holiday Visa. Am I wrong?
* Would it be easier for me to find employment or an internship in the software industry under this visa (if I did qualify for it)? I just don't get how any company could get past the ""no New Zealander wants/qualifies for this job"" requirement in order to hire a temporary foreign worker like me.

Should I give up on the idea of finding a job as a foreigner and go to school in NZ for a year instead? I could afford the tuition, but I'd really rather be able to work. (On the other hand, getting some kind of Graduate Certificate in Computer-whatever-ing might make me more attractive to tech companies.)

Does anyone have advice? I'm just a confused noob here."
2bjwve,6,2014-07-23,Advice on embedded programming,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bjwve/advice_on_embedded_programming/,"I started my first internship and I will be graduating in December. When I applied for the internship I knew it would be for embedded technology but I needed experience in the field and working with a team so I took it despite most of classes and projects have been oop programming and mobile application development. I am about two weeks in and so far I have spent a lot of time developing C# for some tools they need and I am really enjoying it. Time is flying by and I am learning so much more than I have in full semesters at school. However my managers are hoping after I finish a few projects and get a feel for how the projects come together to start developing or at least debugging some C programs for some embedded devices. I have spent some time with coworkers watching them program and learn how they do their jobs. We have even tested our problems using an oscillator. My question comes with my fear of moving to embedded work. While I have not done any before it seems boring to me. I won't get to create any GUIs and enjoying putting a project together and be able to see the results. What are some of the ""fun"" sides of embedded work? I am afraid as I get into it I will begin to hate it while I enjoy what I have been doing so far. Am I being foolish and just letting new material make me nervous?

I guess I am just looking for some advice on how to make the most of it and what to try in order to find out if I do enjoy it. I am looking for some advice on if I should talk to my manager about my concerns even though I have only been there two weeks. I feel like I should tell them I like what I am doing and I am sure they can find plenty more for me to do that is not embedded. What are your experiences with embedded work? Should I go give it a try before I decide how I feel about it?"

I'm a college student going into his senior year. I'm president of more than a few organizations within the University, and I'm a member of our SGA group. Overall I have a lot of on campus involvement. 

Things have been rough for me in the past. I was orphaned almost my whole life, and have no relationship with my actual parents. I was over weight, poor, and unpopular in high school. This lead to a ton of bullying up until my senior year when I was actually able to prove people wrong. During my high school days I contemplated suicide a lot, and even had a botched attempt when my roommate walked in on me as I was about to commit the act. 

College on the other hand has been pretty great. I have a pretty good GPA, I'm heavily involved on campus, and I've done a couple of internships. This summer however has been absolutely awful. I received  a paid internship at a CPA office in my town and that job was supposed to get me through the summer. However, I lost that job when the CPA office had a mass exodus during my second week. A lot of people leaving, and the office eventually going out of business left me without a job. 

This was really difficult on me. They told me not to get another job just yet, and that everything would be panned out. It obviously wasn't. My rent and car payment were approaching their due date so I had to pawn a lot of my items and I do mean a lot just to make the payments so that I could function. 

I was able to find a job a little later in construction. I did rather menial tasks for a couple of weeks and everything seemed to be on the right track. I was also able to get my T.V. back from the pawn shop so I wasn't bored to death when I got home. After a couple of weeks on the job, I lost work yet again due to the contractor running out of it. I'm still seeking payment for one week of work in addition to everything, but he's actually a really good guy. It's just obvious that he has absolutely not work on his plate right now and is behind on bills. 

After I lost my second job I was screwed. I had to wipe out my savings yet again, and pawn things to make my rent and car payment yet again. 

This is what led to the problem I have now. I was absolutely broke. I was scrounging up what I could just to fill the gas tank to look for jobs and eat, but I eventually ran out. In a horrible frame of mind I went to Wal-Mart stole an item worth $14 dollars and tried to return it for cash so that I could buy food. I don't even know what I was thinking, I didn't even try to pocket the item, I just walked up to the service desk. 

Needless to say I was caught, and Wal-Mart is pressing charges that allot to a Class A misdemeanor. Not only that, I'm banned from going to Wal-mart again which is unfortunate for a couple of my organizations. Now I'm sitting here typing this out feeling like utter crap. I live in a small town, and when I go to court everyone is going to realize what I did. I still haven't eaten in a few days, and the town is so small that food banks don't even exist. I hate everything and I just want to get out of it all. All the problems coming down on me seem like too much, and on top of everything I have an electric bill 5 days past due and no idea how I'm going to pay for it. 

I hate waking up every day where my job is to find a job. It's just all too much."

So a huge dilemma I am facing is deciding between a PhD and Industry+masters (Electrical Engineering field). One of the largest factors that will be deciding which route I take is **my ability to finance myself and my soon-to-be wife.**

I'm currently on a 6-month internship with Intel, and in May 2015 I receive my bachelor's degree in EE. For several years now, I have been wanting to pursue a PhD, and I believe I have a fair chance to a university like Stanford, Caltech, or Berkeley. I would be starting my PhD next Fall, 2015.  As you know, the salaries for PhDs are well below $40K, even in the most expensive cities.

The other option I have is working full time at a place like Intel (or any major corporation) while doing my masters simultaneously. At this point I'll be looking at at least $60K salary, depending on the location.

The problem comes in with my student loans and soon-to-be wife. She's a foreigner who will move to the US, and she'll need my financial support for a few months as she situates herself in a new country. (Her career is English/Spanish translation, so I'm sure eventually she'll find a job).

My question is, how affordable will it be if I'm doing a PhD, to pay rent and have a dependent for several months? Especially if I am in San Francisco, where rent is **very** high. 

On the other hand, if I choose the industry route, none of this will be a problem, and things will be relatively easy, financially speaking.

FYI: Both routes, phd and industry/masters, entail doing what I like. I won't be sacrificing what I love to do for money. The advantage of a PhD is having the opportunity to be a specialist in a field, which is *very* attractive to me. Just sucks ass to be in this financial situation. 

**TL;DR** Girlfriend is moving from her country, to the US, late Fall 2015. I need to support her for some time, and I have $30K in loans. Do I pursue a PhD ($25-$35K salary) or industry/masters ($60K-$80K salary) ? I'll do what I love in both instances."

I'm tired of hearing people say its not that important. That is flat out just an excuse to not give it your all. A competitive GPA will get you more interviews, and help you stand out in the final decision making process too.

2) Read Cracking the Coding Interview. ---- Be able to hand write all fundamental data structures many times, think them over in your head. Implement all fundamental sorting algorithms, many times. Practice writing down your code. If you spend the time to think them over in your mind, you won't have to worry about memorizing them.

3) Side projects / certifications / new languages should be 3rd priority. I'm not saying don't do these. But from experience, it is very easy to dive into learning new/complicated things, and the opportunity cost is HUGE when #1 and #2 are hindered.

Extra Note: For those of you who say GPA isn't a factor in CMPSC.. Look around. Look at the resumes &amp; GPA's of students who get internships vs those who don't. 

I am just a student who has realized the opportunity cost of studying new languages / frameworks / databases instead of excelling in these fundamental areas."

During my high school days I contemplated suicide a lot, and even had a botched attempt when my roommate walked in on me as I was about to commit the act.

College on the other hand has been pretty great. I have a pretty good GPA, I'm heavily involved on campus, and I've done a couple of internships. This summer however has been absolutely awful. I received a paid internship at a CPA office in my town and that job was supposed to get me through the summer. However, I lost that job when the CPA office had a mass exodus during my second week. A lot of people leaving, and the office eventually going out of business left me without a job.

This was really difficult on me. They told me not to get another job just yet, and that everything would be panned out. It obviously wasn't. My rent and car payment were approaching their due date so I had to pawn a lot of my items and I do mean a lot just to make the payments so that I could function.

I was able to find a job a little later in construction. I did rather menial tasks for a couple of weeks and everything seemed to be on the right track. I was also able to get my T.V. back from the pawn shop so I wasn't bored to death when I got home. After a couple of weeks on the job, I lost work yet again due to the contractor running out of it. I'm still seeking payment for one week of work in addition to everything, but he's actually a really good guy. It's just obvious that he has absolutely not work on his plate right now and is behind on bills.
After I lost my second job I was screwed. I had to wipe out my savings yet again, and pawn things to make my rent and car payment yet again.

This is what led to the problem I have now. I was absolutely broke. I was scrounging up what I could just to fill the gas tank to look for jobs and eat, but I eventually ran out. In a horrible frame of mind I went to Wal-Mart stole an item worth $14 dollars and tried to return it for cash so that I could buy food. I don't even know what I was thinking, I didn't even try to pocket the item, I just walked up to the service desk.

Needless to say I was caught, and Wal-Mart is pressing charges that allot to a Class A misdemeanor. Not only that, I'm banned from going to Wal-mart again which is unfortunate for a couple of my organizations. Now I'm sitting here typing this out feeling like utter crap. I live in a small town, and when I go to court everyone is going to realize what I did. I still haven't eaten in a few days, and the town is so small that food banks don't even exist. I hate everything and I just want to get out of it all. All the problems coming down on me seem like too much, and on top of everything I have an electric bill 5 days past due and no idea how I'm going to pay for it.
I hate waking up every day where my job is to find a job. It's just all too much."

2bm22o,1,2014-07-24,Advice about quitting...,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2bm22o/advice_about_quitting/,"I'm currently working 2 jobs.  One is a steady internship during the normal 8-5, and the other is a part time restaurant job I've been working nights and weekends for the last 2 months.  

I've finally reached the point where I no longer need the second job (roommate moving in at the end of the month), so I put in my 2 weeks weekend before last at the restaurant.

Schedules go out every Thursday that have the Saturday-Friday schedule.  So today is Thursday and I check the schedule, and I've been scheduled  6 hours on saturday, and 7 on sunday.  This is excessive, I've never had shifts more than 3 or 4 hours, and those are supposed to be my last days.  I have a puppy at home that I REALLY can't leave alone for more than 4 hours, even at my full time job I go home on lunch breaks to spend time with her.

My question... is there anything I can say to the manager that maybe I can get shorter/removed shifts for this weekend?  I don't know why they scheduled me these crazy shifts when they never have on my last 2 days.  There has to be something I can do, I mean couldn't I theoretically just not show up?  I put in the two weeks almost 2 full weeks ago and they load me up with shifts before I leave? This is a shitty position to be in, plus my boyfriend is coming to visit this weekend so if I work those shifts I'm not going to see him at all.  I had no idea about them until this morning, so this sucks.

There is supposed to be a C:\ drive that's mostly for system files and applications, and a D:\ drive that's ""Data"". The idea is that eventually we will have people's ""Data"" drives have automatic backup, as they will contain actual work documents.
So I set up these laptops allocating ~200gigs to the D:\ drive, and ~265gigs to the C:\ drive. This has been done on upwards of 20 machines so far. Today I'm informed that I was supposed to be allocating 265gigs to the D:\ drive, and 200gigs to the C:\ drive.
Here's my conundrum, short of 3rd party software I can't find a way to skim that 65gigs from the C: drive and give it to the D: drive. If it was just 1 machine I wanted to fix this on, I'd go through that, but downloading software and running this fix on machines that are already in use is not timely and not really an option. Is there any way, through CLI or Windows Utilities (or anything really) to get what I'm trying to do done?
These machines are running Windows 7.1 if that makes a difference.

**TL;DR**  

* C:\ has 265GB
* D:\ has 200GB
* C:\ needs to have 200GB, D:\ needs to have 265GB."

I'll be honest here, the reason why I'm majoring in engineering was partially decided by my parents due to its job prospect and salary. I told them that I wanted to go for undecided major to see what I could get but wouldn't let me, so I just ended up in ME department. The whole 3 years I've been depressed about my life due to family relation, course work, and having no clear goal in my mind. I kind of cleared this out with my family and we had a little bit of a discussion to allow me to take it easy without being pressured too much. Now I feel like I am able to concentrate on my studies properly and start thinking about my upcoming career. 

The problem starts here:
Due to my depression, my gpa ended up below 3.0, with no project or internship experience other than retail part time job and volunteering at hospital. It's summer right now so I'm spending sometime learning programming online Java,C...etc. (I guess that's a plus). But the thing is that I'm actually just learning the programming to get something in my resume to stand out a little. But that's just it. I really don't have clear goal in mind of what type of job I want to get so I really can't tell specifically what I should learn on my own other than taking classes. I honestly don't know a thing about engineering that I probably won't be able to talk about anything.

Any advices you guys could provide?

It's my first time writing a resume and i would really appreciate it if someone could take a look at it and help me polish it up a bit!
a little background about me: I started out as an intern at a small IT consultancy business and stayed there for 5 years. during my time there business went from small to getting huge accounts and big projects.
I went from intern to junior consultant to lead consultant pretty quickly because i delivered on their projects and although i'm pretty young(25), have never let my bosses down. 
So this is the first time that i had write a resume and i can really use some help.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8kAbMLOw96cURsNmNlUVhaMGs/edit?usp=sharing
Thanks guys!

Edit: Here's a couple of projects that i had. hope someone can tell me how to use it in my resume.
* Monitoring 500 Servers and 250 Network Devices using SCOM. it used SQL failover clustering, different permissions for about 15 admin and included tons of dashboards, servers Os ranged from windows servers, Oracle, Redhat and... . also monitoring Exchange and Vmware and differen web and sql servers. (i've had about 10 different projects about the same size or a bit smaller again using SCOM 2007 and 2012).
I have no idea how to mention this in the resume.

* DPM disaster recovery, kinda simple 200 servers, had SQL, SharePoint other good stuff. actual disaster recovery experience (definitely not fun!) (I've had about 5 of this type of project)

* I'm support for about 10 AD Domains right now. they all have dedicated admins but if they can't make something work they escalate it to me.  (Again have no idea how to translate this to a good point on a resume_

* SCCM for 3 different projects for about 500 clients. (it's not huge but it's something i guess?) including almost all it's features.

*Exchange 2010 : 2 migrations from 2003 to 2010. one for 5500 users one for about 1000. also designed 5 from scratch and currently support them. (they have dedicated admins but problems get escalated to me)

That's all I've been doing the last 5 years. add a couple of VMWare support cases. all my career my job has been problem solving. someone would mess up... they come to us an we solve it for them so i had to get up to speed on different technologies in a hurry and be ready for when shit hits the fan!
Now that i want to move on to a different company i have no idea how to make good resume from this.

again would appreciate a couple of examples on how to make this look good on a resume!

2bo81g,7,2014-07-25,Starting AI Late (Rising Junior): Steps to Get Into the Field?,justgivingsomeadvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bo81g/starting_ai_late_rising_junior_steps_to_get_into/,"As the title states, I'm a rising junior at UCSD. I'm doing a web dev/SAAS/business internship thing for my dad this summer, and I'm realizing I'm not really into software engineering/development. I like coding, I like coming up with solutions, both of which I'm doing. But too much of the focus seems to be on learning frameworks. Mobile programming is a bit better in this regard, but it's still not quite my style.

I've always been really mathematically oriented, I love the theory behind computer science, I love statistics (math minor in this field), I love learning, and I want to be on the cutting edge of technology (that's what drew me into CS in the first place!). So for me, AI seems like a natural fit. Unfortunately, like I said, I'm a rising junior, which means I'm getting in the game late for research. (I've done some research work but for completely unrelated stuff, and it's not much). Also, I haven't actually taken any AI courses yet (taking them this coming year), so the possibility is there that I don't like the field (I doubt it, though).

Basically, my question is twofold. First of all, are there any resources online that people recommend checking out to get my feet wet? I'm looking for something that would be good for people with a good understanding of CS and math (so, not too slow-paced) but also for someone fairly new to the field. I've already emailed a professor about doing research, but I would like to have a decent understanding of the field, key theories, what it entails, as well as some understanding of programming principles. That way, when the school year starts, I can make serious contributions and try to get my name on some publications.

Secondly, should I spend the Summer of 2015 doing an internship or just doing research? Ideally I want to get into a top program (e.g. Stanford, MIT), and I know that means I need to do a lot more in terms of research. So it makes sense to do research.^1 On the other hand, I do have an interview with Microsoft in September about a regular SDE internship for 2015, and I know that's usually the type of internship you should take.

Thank you for your input! I'm happy to hear about anyone with relevant information, but especially I'd love to hear from

^1 I should add that UCSD has a 5-year MS/BS program, so basically if I do one more year at UCSD, I can graduate with a Masters. It might make sense for me to do that, specializing in AI, and spending that extra year to get the sort of publications they need. On the other hand, UCSD's AI program is not nearly as good as the rest of the CS department, so that might hurt me in applications since I don't know if there are any big names in the field, which I hear helps your application.

Bonus Question: Would graduate schools care if I took my math minor's statistic courses pass/no pass? You can do that at UCSD, and that was my plan originally since I have a heavy courseload this coming year. They're relevant to the field, but if I take some grad-level AI courses and got good grades, and I had a lot of research would it matter? My GPA is pretty good (3.9) but it's probably right at the threshold for acceptable GPAs for top grad schools. Thanks!"
2bowo9,172,2014-07-25,They hunger,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bowo9/they_hunger/,"In 1994 Kevin Carter took a photograph that would win him the Pulitzer Prize. It depicts a small girl, a toddler in Sudan. She was struggling to reach a food distribution point and suffering from severe starvation. As she lay on the ground a large vulture landed on the ground behind her. The only thing that I can say about the young girl is that whether or not she survived is unknown. Carter took his own life that same year.

That was the photograph that got me interested in photography. I dedicated the next two decades of my life to capturing the images that defined life on Earth. I’m currently employed as a photojournalist for a small company that subs out the photos to larger magazine and online corporations. We go into the places where big names can’t. My old boss started the company back in the 1960’s and it’s been family owned ever since. He started his career following Soviet tank crews in WWII and diving into the jungles of Korea and Vietnam and had always said that he’d either retire at ninety or die doing the job he loves. I thought I’d do the same thing, until very recently. 

It started years ago. In 2001 we were given a contract with a larger company in need of photographs of the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo during the Second Congo War. The region was rife with conflict, and pictures coming out of the region were all propaganda. Everyone knew that atrocities were being committed, but no one knew to what extent. We were provided with a driver and a guide for our group. The driver was a local man and the guide was a Congolese woman of incredible beauty. I was a little worried at first; women in the DRC are frequently treated as second class citizens, and, especially in war zones they aren’t generally welcome among the DRC soldiers. Our guide wore the military garb of a DRC soldier, but did not carry a weapon. She claimed to be neutral in the conflict, despite her outfit, and told us that her name was “Aleeth.”

We flew into a small outpost just north of the DRC and headed south in a black Jeep that had seen far better days…possibly prior to 1950. After crossing a small wooden bridge we were immediately stopped by a group of at least ten or twelve haggard looking guards with assault rifles. They were a group of local militia and it appeared as though it’d been some time since their last proper meal. After talking to our driver for a few minutes they brutally dragged him from the vehicle and forced him to kneel in a ditch with his hands behind his head. As we all waited for the execution to take place Aleeth abruptly broke the silence by saying “cɔl. Ne la.” I understood very little of that; I know the Dinka language just about well enough to ask for a bathroom. At that exact moment the guards fired a barrage of rounds into the ground directly next to the poor man’s head causing my entire crew to jump at the noise. He staggered back to the Jeep with blood slowly trickling down from his right ear. I couldn’t tell if it was an injury from the noise or from a ricochet of debris, but as soon as he was able he pushed the old jeep to its absolute limit and left the small camp in the distance. 

Aleeth explained to us that our driver was from an opposing village that supported the opposing political party; the Rally for Congolese Democracy. Apparently he had denied having ties with them but they planned on executing him nonetheless. Our guide had an unusual amount of authority for a female in a largely male dominated country, and I hadn’t seen anyone refuse a single order handed down by her to this point.

We traveled to a large temporary village that was home to some twenty thousand people. They had been relocated from their homes due to the fact that some of the men had joined the rebellion. The DRC soldiers then rounded them up, man, woman, and child, and marched them miles from the places they called home, and forced them to live in squalor beside a small, very dirty, stream. The water was, simply put, toxic. No one could safely ingest it without becoming violently ill, and the land was of incredibly poor soil that could barely sustain even the hardiest of crops. 

Every few days the DRC soldiers would come and raid the village. It wasn’t pretty. They would “cull” the population as they called it. It usually happened first thing in the morning; there’d be some screaming, occasionally the sounds of a fight, and then the inevitable barrage of gunfire. The survivors were left to dispose of the dead either in the stream, which was about 4’ deep in places and swift enough to carry a corpse away, or in the mass graves…which were filling up rapidly and not just from the culling.

Food was more than scarce; any villager who got his or her hands on food usually didn’t last long; the DRC soldiers would usually kill them off to feed their own ranks or fighting would erupt between warring villages over who controlled the food. Either way the guards usually became involved and ended things quickly and brutally. Over the course of a few days I saw a small sickly looking dog wander into the village, and then I saw his bones picked clean less than twelve hours later, and finally I saw the bodies of some of the people who’d eaten him floating downstream.

At this point I realized that the satellite phone we’d been loaned had stopped transmitting. I’m not overly familiar with them, but it had essentially lost its signal due to a mechanical failure of some sorts. As we were, more or less, treated with some version of immunity by the DRC soldiers, my travelling companions were mostly unconcerned until a group of DRC soldiers raided the village in a spot right next to where we’d set up camp. More than one stray bullet tore through our tents and one of our interns took some shrapnel to the arm. Our medic stitched him up, but at that point we had to make a decision to move or stay put.

I spoke with Aleeth and she apologized for the soldiers. “They’re just doing as commanded; they can’t disobey his orders,” she said as-a-matter-of-fact, “even worse is that I have no power over those soldiers. They don’t have to listen to me if they don’t want to.” I didn’t really understand; why did she have power over any soldiers? At this point I began to wonder exactly who this woman was, and why she’d been hired to be our guide. We were slated to be in the camp for another month and she managed to convince us to stay where we were as moving our small camp to the outskirts of the village only put us at greater risk.

I finally was able to send a letter to the company that hired us to take pictures. They’d wanted documentation over the course of six weeks, and we were two weeks in when we were shot at. I told the details of the journey in and explained our current situation. They paid us half of our contract fee up front so I sent them a few photos of the miserable living conditions that spread across the countryside. I asked them if they had any sections they specifically wanted us to visit, or any other special requests, mentioned that our satellite phone was currently inoperable, and lastly, I asked them about our guide. All I had was her first name, Aleeth, and nothing else to go on. It was a very offhanded mention at the bottom of a long letter. I assumed they’d get back to us within a week.

A few nights later I was developing some film, yes we did actually use film still back in 2001, when I heard a shout come from our main tent. It was one of my camera techs who had nearly as much experience as I. I ran to see what was happening and I saw an incredibly large DRC soldier, at least six and a half feet tall, holding him against a pole by his neck. In his other hand he wielded a machete. The camera tech was a pretty big guy himself, but next to the DRC soldier he looked insignificant to say the least. A crowd of fifty or so villagers had gathered around to watch. They looked thin and sickly, and almost as if they were entranced by the entire situation. I didn’t know what to do and the soldier had raised his machete as if to behead my friend and coworker. That’s when I heard Aleeth Speak up.

“Näk yen.” She said nonchalantly. I recognized this; it’s something the locals say when they kill an animal during a hunt. As best I could tell it loosely translates to “Kill the animal.”

I watched in horror as the large man’s eyes became wide and he began to swing the machete in a huge arc towards my friend’s neck. Then something odd happened. His massive arm was intercepted by at the elbow by one of the villagers. Soon several more jumped on the man’s back. He was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of villagers as they proceeded to pile on the man while he fell to the ground. I couldn’t see everything well enough to understand exactly what was going on at first, but after a few seconds it became apparent; the starving villagers were eating this man alive. Within a minute or so he’d stopped struggling and had likely succumbed to blood loss. The villagers continued to feast until he was merely bones. Only two from my crew were there to witness the event; myself and the tech. We hurried back to our tent and stayed hidden the remainder of the night. I did not take pictures. 

As we ran back to our tents another rather large DRC soldier stopped us with an assault rifle in hand. He had a sizeable bite to his neck and was bleeding rather profusely at this point. He warned us to stay in our tent and staggered away. Gunfire could be heard intermittently across the village, however, not consistently; it came in sporadic and unusually short bursts. I had one small caliber handgun but was told to never brandish it; the soldiers saw anything that was holding a weapon as a threat and were trained to dispatch it immediately. I didn’t stand a chance against a trained soldier, so I did the next best thing; I rigged several of our cameras up by the opening of our tent. I set the flashes to maximum intensity and tied a series of fishing line to the path that led to the opening. If anyone was going to try to sneak into our tent they’d lose their night vision to the impending flash. It wasn’t much but it might be enough to give us the upper hand and survive the night as it was equally unsafe to try to leave and travel after dark. The fighting continued through the night and the cameras by the tent were going off almost nonstop. I’d left film in all of them so they’d be taking pictures as well. No one slept, but when dawn finally arrived none of us had been harmed either.

The village seemed empty in the morning when we woke. A thin acrid smoke hung in the air mixing with the morning fog. At first I only saw two other people outside, a large soldier with a sword at his side, and a smallish man who wore glasses and the attire of a surgeon. He seemed to be speaking to the soldier. I was too far away to hear what they were saying and they didn’t exactly appear inviting so I left them be until Aleeth stopped me.

“I’m sorry you had to witness that last night.” She said with the slightest hint of a smile.

“Thank…you…for saving his…our lives.” It was all I could manage to say.

“I wish it were another way; I have no power over the soldiers. But I do have the villagers; they hunger.”

With that she walked towards the two men in the distance and joined them in conversation. I gathered my crew preparing to leave; our lives were clearly in danger at this point. Our driver, who had blindly trusted our guide to this point readily, drove us out of the village and to safety. On the way, however, we saw the atrocities that had taken place during the previous night. Bones lay everywhere; stripped clean of flesh, they almost didn’t smell. The carrion birds were left wanting that day; there was almost absolutely nothing left. We made it out of the DRC and I immediately questioned my boss, who at the time was in his late seventies about our guide. He claimed that the company who hired us to do the work had hired the guide as well. I called them and they immediately denied hiring anyone but the driver. We had no other leads so I backed down. My boss took our photos and I never got to see them beyond what we developed in Africa. Due to a contract dispute most of the photographs never left our lab.

This past May my boss fell ill with pneumonia. He died in June and left the business to his son to run. He’s been managing things for several years now anyways and is nearly as good as his old man. I was actually included in the will and was left a small lockbox. It contained photographs taken throughout the ages, from WWII all the way to the present, and I’m assuming they were taken mostly by my old boss. 

One of the last folders I came to read 2001 – DRC. I gingerly took it and looked. The photographs weren’t the best due to the fact that the flash was a bit off for the extreme darkness, but I could see them. Thousands of them, milling around our tent. Blank dead eyes staring at the flashes and wondering what was behind. None of them advanced on our tent, but occasionally I would see a corpse of one of the DRC soldiers as they tore into him. My boss developed all of the film that we’d used in Africa. Film that was never seen by eyes other than his. It was almost more than I could handle…and I’d been there in person. 

Finally I saw that only one small folder remained in the box. It had been labeled at one point in time, but all I could read now was a small “A” scribbled on the outside. Inside were pictures of what could’ve been genocide for all I knew. Horrible events that I’d never even heard of. Massacres, at least that’s what I assumed they were, of tens of thousands of people, or what used to be people; they looked like husks of human beings. That’s when I realized that some of these people on the ground were still alive. I started to notice someone in the photos around the time of the Vietnam War. She was pretty and had uncharacteristically dark skin. Once the quality improved I thought I could make the face out.

I dropped the photos and staggered back. Once I built up the courage to look at the remaining few I found that they were mostly from America during the Great Depression. The last one was old, very old. It showed my boss as a very young man in 1935 judging by the writing on the back. He was down on both knees with the most pained expression I’ve ever seen on anyone’s face. Cradled in his arms was the corpse of a very young boy. I could see that the boy was dead; he had finally succumbed to either dehydration or starvation or some combination of the two. They were both rail thin and the boy couldn’t have been more than two years old. It broke my heart; I knew my boss had lost a child during the great depression but I’d always guessed it’d been to illness. Lastly in the background I saw a woman. She stood a few feet behind him. It wasn’t his wife. The woman stared directly into the camera and gave the saddest sort of smile. Aleeth.

I've completed my CS degree previous summer in Belgium and I'm currently living in London to finish my masters degree in Computer Networks. Yet something has been bugging me for a while which is as the title described acquiring 'more' knowledge about server/computer hardware architecture (Mainly server). My knowledge on this topic is somewhere in the middle. I've done internships where I managed and maintained a datacenter for 4 schools. During this period I didn't had to do any major planning on acquiring new machines or implementing new storage solutions. This wasn't part of the function I was assigned back then ( Mostly Networking , redundancy , infrastructure designing ..). Yet I've always wanted to know more about the datacenter infrastructure itself. Servers,Storage Solutions, Xeon processors.. and the technologies behind it. In my perspective I lack a bit of knowhow on the server/datacenter/storage,.. side whatever you may call it. For example the designing of a small datacenter based on the needs of a company (What kind of processors? Storage Solutions ?) And how everything ties together. I'm wondering If some of you could point me in the right direction of where I might learn about these kind of things (More in-depth). I've been looking for books, but most of them seem out-dated. Any recommendation I'm grateful for. Thanks in advance!  "

This company had been around since the early 1800s and has been making the same products since they started. 

Being a factory, there are a lot of people in high up positions who started 40 years ago in a very low level position. 

I believe, these are the people who really do a great job of running the company. They have worked here forever, and with a business degree or two under their belt ... they are in a good position to make decisions. 

The downside is, often, they do not mix well with technology. 

We had a few repeat offenders.

Such as the people in accounting with Gateway Desktops that had swelled capacitors. They refused to leave the computer ON over the weekend. In order to get their computers to boot on Monday morning, I would have to pull the power cable, remove the RAM, hold the power button, reseat RAM, then power back on. 

This particular call came in from another repeat offender. Very good business man, great person to work with (didn't belittle people who weren't at his level of management). He had been travelling and could not get his computer to boot. 

It was a brand new Dell Latitude E6500. Very high spec'd laptop ... for us.

I had determined his computer was trying to boot from the media center printer (WHY do people buy these things for an office?????). Pretty common for the HP printers.

Until ...

""Well there's this whirring noise  coming from it""

""Oh, ok, sounds like there might be a CD or DVD inside of it - can you remove the CD or DVD and try again?"" - ME 

""Hold on here, let me find something""

This didn't phase me. I thought that he realized he left a DVD in it and was looking for the cover.

*Popping noises over the phone*

""The whirring noise stopped but I think something broke. Can you come down?""

So, I grab my mobile and head over to his office. Wow, was I surprised! 


Apparently when I said ""remove the CD"" he didn't think of just, you know, pushing the button to eject the tray. He took a screwdriver and went to town.


The laptop was done-for. He managed to:

- Break the CD into 10 or so pieces

- Broken tray to CD drive

- Broken CD drive itself

- Mangled laptop palmwrest/case

- Cracked part of the motherboard off (apparently he went ALL the way in with the screwdriver).



My solution:
""Is it okay if I take this upstairs to take a look"".

Carried it upstairs, set it on my Boss' desk and made him take care of it. "

I'm back again and figured I would do what some posters on here are wont to do and take a trip down good ol' memory lane; back to my beginnings.

***

So the year is early 2006, and I'm fresh out of a ""wandering"" phase after my US military (the few, the proud) service. Read: doing nothing.

A childhood friend of mine has landed a sweet gig as desktop/sysadmin in a far away state that is known for the ""dry"" heat, rivers of salt, and snowbirds. 

He happened to have a newly created need for an intern (Thanks to: Dude who left for more money). He and I both started in computers together, playing and experimenting on his 386 pc back in the day. Good times. Needless to say I was up for the task of being a paid intern; it was to be my foothold into an industry that up to this point was a hobby for me. There are several stories I will be sharing, and this one seems to be a good one to start with. 

***

During my onboarding, aside from the standard introductions, tours, job descriptions, and overviews, I was warned about a few people; stay away from that one, watch how you talk to this one, those people over there will hang you out to dry, you know, the usual. Most turned out to be sage advice, with the definitive exception of one: the ""stay away from that one"" one. This person had just returned from her vacation from parts unknown, so up until now I had known her by name only. 

I see her in the elevator, we introduce ourselves (first names, last name would have triggered the warning) and kinda hit it off, turns out she was pretty cool. I find out later from my friend that she was the one I was supposed to stay away from. (I never found out why FYI) every now and then she would have an issue with her laptop, and I would dutifully go down a floor and fix it for her. One of her reoccurring issues was her keyboard keys were fading out. I was baffled as to why, until I look over her shoulder for the suspect. Hand lotion. The lotion has some sort of oil or whatever in it that would eat away the white of the letter to where is would fade/corrode away. And it had a side effect of making the whole thing feel slimy. (to me anyway) So I would make it a habit to bring some disinfecting wipes with me each time I went down there for any other issue just to make sure to remove any build-up. It sorta became the running joke between us about her ""slimy"" keyboard and me having to touch it. It was fun, I got attention, and she was pretty [Dur-Hur](http://i.imgur.com/4VYS8D3.gif)

I was so good (ha) that eventually all her issues were resolved,(It helped that I trolled the ticket queue for anything for her) and I was seeing less of her than I wanted to. I being the intrepid intern that I was, began to find things that were ""wrong"" with her laptop. Y'know, like revoking her client certificate so I would have to go and generate a new one (on her laptop of course), or gently dislodge her cat5 cable...

Childish, I know, but I liked the gal; I liked being her personal IT hero as often as possible. She wanted to thank me one day, and decided to take me to an establishment known for its chicken wings, waitresses in tights, and their ""owls"". I thought this was pretty awesome, had a few beers, and a great time. We ended up dating within a month or so, then we married in late 2007, and now have two beautiful children together. So much for staying away from that one... :D

***

TL;DR: Told to stay away from ""that one"", end up marrying her.

*[Warning: rant/wall of text incoming]*

I'm an aerospace engineering student, and I will be a super-senior this fall, with at least one more semester to go after this year. As far as the list of ""*Things every engineer needs to do to get employed*"" goes, I basically score a big fat zero... 

&gt; You *need* to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA in order to be competitive.

I have a 2.8. Granted, this does include some failed classes that I intend to retake at a later date, but the simple truth is that I'm not an 3.0 student. Of the classes I've passed, C's are my average grade. Personally, a B means I did well and fully understood the material, and  I only get an ""A"" in classes I found truly easy (aka, no engineering course ever). I've been this way since high school, and given that there's no honors 5.0 scale to save me, and no ""fluff"" classes for me to take, I don't really see myself really ever getting back to to the magic 3.0 mark. 

&gt; Make sure to get an internship or co-op before you graduate.

No such luck so far. I only have one summer left in which I could do an internship. My wife graduated in may, and is waiting on me to graduate before going to grad school, so co-ops aren't an option. I've tried to get an internship at the annual career fair for the past few years, but have gotten no real response. I've been brushed off for the most part, with the exception of companies who were more advertising than actually hiring interns. I got a lot of ""*Come back when you have more on your resume.*""  (although not usually stated  so directly), and a lot of ""*Great! why don't you apply online when an opening shows up in 3 months?*"".  Given that I still don't really have much on my resume, my intense dislike for the networking/job seeking game, and my general social anxiety, it looks like an internship is a long shot. I'm not even sure if I could relocate if someone were to offer me one...

&gt; Internships aside, other employment and professional activities can help fill a resume. 

No employment history. I've literally never had a job. I am the president of a club on campus, which helps, but it's far from professional: a poker club. My resume is basically just my leadership experience from this, and relevant course work. I'm really ramping up my courseload this semester, so I doubt I have the time for a job, or to take on more engineering focused extra-circulars. 

&gt;When looking for a job, don't be afraid to send out upwards of a hundred resumes, all over the country. Don't limit yourself to one particular area. 

I'm going to need a job in whatever city my wife is going to grad school in. While there is some room for compromise here, as the school can be selected based on where I get job offers, the reality is I'm only going to be able to apply for job in 3-4 small areas. There's no way I'm going to be able apply for dozen and dozens of jobs; I expect to only being able to find one or maybe two aerospace jobs in each location. 

*****
My funding for school will run out at the end of this next school year. Given that I may have to incur significant debt to complete my degree, and that pursuing my degree is currently inhibiting my wife's professional pursuits, do you think it's worth it for me to stick with Aerospace engineering? I do have a certification that could get me a casino job, which pays somewhat well (at least relative to how difficult it is). I'm interested in pursuing that as well as engineering, but I doubt I want to make a career out of it. 

Should I keep at an engineering degree, or just accept the facts, suck it up, and get on with my life? "

2bq8fv,0,2014-07-25,Going to do my Master in Erlangen. Need some inputs.,master_in_erlangen,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/2bq8fv/going_to_do_my_master_in_erlangen_need_some_inputs/,"###Background
This September I will start my Msc. in Computational Engineering in Erlangen. A more appropriate name is perhaps applied scientific computing. Particularly, I chose computational material science as the application field since I did Physics for my undergraduate degree. The program can be mostly completed in English. Some courses are only offered in German however.

I am kinda interested about what I should expect studying in Erlangen. A few concerns:

###Study
The program has a tight course schedule. The [curriculum](http://www.ce.uni-erlangen.de/students/standard-studienkonzepte-master/?topic=cms) requires me to devoted most of my time on coursework with an additional Thesis project at the last semester. Rather than a research degree, it's closer in structure to a bachelor degree. With Germany reputation for difficult technical courses, I wonder if I can do well there.

###German
From reading around this subreddit and toytown, it seems the consensus is that there are enough engineering jobs here. Mainly in IT and automotive industry. But they also requires a reasonably high level of German language skills. I wonder if I can accomplish this under 2 years time, in addition to the heavy course workload.

My plan now is to follow Assimil, and see how far it can take me after half a year. Erlangen says it doesn't offer beginner German courses. So I need to study the basics myself.

###Housing
Seems impossibly difficult. I haven't got any accommodation until now. Applied through the Studentenwerk, but failed. For now, I am just sending email applications to Privat Studentenwohnheim. Wish me luck. Any advice would be great.

###Internship
I originally planned to take an internship after I finished my first year. But I am confused with the semester system at German universities. They list summer semester starts from April until September. And winter semester starts from October until March. Is there any long vacation period? Or is it just a convenient way to split the academic year into two? I assume the effective semester, including the lecture and exam time, is much shorter.

###Cycling
Seems cycling is a must in Erlangen. If anyone can tell any peculiarities of cycling in Germany, that would be great. I have also read that there is a regular bicycle auction in Erlangen. Perhaps I should visit it on October.

I guess for the first few months, I will rely on the semester ticket.

###Insurance
It seems there are other important insurance than the compulsory health insurance for foreign students. Liability insurance and bicycle insurance are the most commonly mentioned. Any thoughts about the necessity of those two?

###Banking
Non-EU students are required to make a student account with Deutsche Bank. Unfortunately, the account doesn't include a credit card. Will a debit card be enough for live in Germany? There is a thread in toytown where a student cannot use his debit card to purchase items from Amazon.

Just worried a bit here. I appreciate it if anyone can give inputs or advice concerning studying in Erlangen, or perhaps Germany in general.

I've been working here for around a month and haven't had any issues that would require the work of IT until today.

For some reason, the macros I set up in our database to aid in my work got all messed up.  As I said, I'm an end user so I don't know many technical terms.  Basically, they weren't working the way they used to and I couldn't get them to reset.

So I called the support desk and within two minutes one of the tech support personnel (we'll call her Nina) arrived at my desk.  Nina is a very short, but very intimidating Russian woman with a thick and burly accent.  I was afraid she would go off on me for having such a simple issue to waste her time with.  

I explained the issue to her and she was able to fix it within 10 minutes.  After she left, I was afraid I'd left a bad impression on her so I decided to do something nice for her.  (hearing about all the crap you guys go through on here was motivation as well).

So on my break I went and got her a tea (I always see her drinking tea and I asked her coworkers what her favorite kind was).  When I brought it to her, she almost burst into tears.

""What's wrong Nina?""

""I just can't believe you would do something so nice for me!  You wouldn't believe how mean and unhelpful people can be when you're trying to help them with computer problems.""

Thanks to all of you on this sub for helping me not take for granted the efforts of tech support.  And thanks for putting up with ungrateful/impatient end users!

One year ago I graduated with my bachelor's in Natural Resources. During my undergrad I took two classes in GIS (roughly half theory, half ArcMap) and quickly started contributing to my group projects in other classes via GIS work. After I graduated I found myself with short internship with a wildlife researcher once again making maps and handling data management. It's been a strange road since then, but I've become the GIS equivalent of an odd jobs worker, taking small projects from public institutions, non-profits, and private individuals.

Anyway, I'm barely making any money and have no idea how to run a business but I so thoroughly enjoy my work that I'd like to do this sort of thing as a career.

Which leads me to a few questions:

How well does an Environmental Science degree (Natural Resources specifically) lead to starting a graduate program in Geography? Are there undergraduate classes I should look into before then? What about Esri certifications? What sorts of specializations do geography programs have, and what sort of study/work do they lend themselves toward?

This is a world of work and study upon which I simply did not focus my attention in college, and I could use all the help I can get.

Edit: I should also add that I know (""know"") Python and would love to pursue further computer science instruction if that is particularly useful."

I recently got hired at a IT firm that manages businesses around my area as an Intern making pretty good money. IMPORTANT NOTE: I was hired not necessarily for my knowledge of computers but because I was witty during the interview. It is a pretty laid back environment but because I'm a student I can only work part time so they hired on another tech. He is... well has more strengths in areas that I don't in which are utilized more at the Help Desk position. I love code but alas coding is not the focal point of my new job. What are some things that I should get familiar with fast to not fall behind and potentially be let go?

//Description: We handle back ups, we use ConnectWise and LabTech, we manage networks and domains, and we handle any job that needs fixing that requires new research.

I'm not so good with command line, DNS, and SQL server things so if I could just be pointed in the right direction to learn and build upon things to really get the most out of this Internship without fucking everything up. (I've been doing research but I would like some dialog with someone outside of my mind in what I think is needed.)

TLDR: What should a tech at the Help Desk know?

EDIT: Thanks guys this is exactly what I'm looking for! I'll probably come back to this page for encouragement many times!"

I worked in a big enterprise software company while studying and paused my M.Sc. to do an internship abroad where I worked on a couple of combined hardware &amp; software projects and am in the process of finishing up.

I am now really interested in working on hardware &amp; software projects in the aerospace industry and am thinking about how to proceed. I can get into a B.Sc. program dedicated to aerospace engineering with a focus on computer science to really learn the physics behind all of it which would be very handy, I would think. But I would need to get back into university and loose some time I could be working. Or I would try to get into the industry through programming jobs at aerospace companies and try to pick up all the fundamentals during that, which might not be as comprehensive as a whole degree.

Are there any people working in the industry which could give me some advice regarding these routes and how to best get into the industry? It seems a lot of companies would rather hire on the level of M.Sc.?

I'm not a US citizen, but live in Europe, if that matters."

* I'm a 21 year old student and this is my first position in the field. I was very excited to start.

* I'm programming stock/security trading systems in Amibroker AFL (new to me and there aren't many practitioners, but I worked with it).

* I started on May 12th at $12 per hour, in Ohio.

**My problem(s):** 

* While I have successfully completed 2 projects (each almost purely built by me), I am stumped on my current task, which was to build on a poorly built program from a prior intern. Some of the shit is broken; at least one part had fake output. 

* The firm is small. 2 programming interns with *no full time developer* to mentor us or help me out. The other 3 full time workers are financial/operations director.

* At this point, I'm more scared to go into work every day. I almost worry full time about what I'm going to do. The stress of the situation does not seem worth the pay or the future reference. 

* I am a high stress guy and will admit that I was hospitalized for trying to end my life last summer. It won't come to that here; I just wanted to say this is the 2nd most miserable I have probably ever felt. 


I'm going into work on Sunday for a few hours (my own choice). I really just want to type up a document that details how to use my last 2 projects, where this current one can be picked up, and be done with it. 

I had written up a 2 week notice (I wanted to quit August 8th anyway), but it seems pointless for me to be around for 2 weeks when I am unable to move this project forward. I'm also sure I would feel the guilt of abandoning this project, since I am/was the *only* person working on it (god damn I wish they had a full time dev...).
I honestly don't think I can look them in the eye enough to quit in person, let alone *stay around* 2 weeks after declaring my resignation.

I just had my midterm performance review and they had nothing but good things to say.  They also made it clear that they could like me to stay on throughout my remaining 3 years and that if I do it will likely mean a guaranteed full time job as an EE.  

So no job searching, great, right?!  

Well after talking to some of the other engineers that I work with they asked me how much I think I'll make fresh out of college, I said somewhere between 65k and 75k...they laughed.  They didn't tell me any actual numbers though so I really don't know how high I was on my expectations.  Something to note, these were all ME's, I would be the company's first EE.  Which is surprising to me because I don't know how the company got to where they are today without an EE.  (We do LED lighting)

Do you guys have any thoughts on this in general or just what I can expect to make out of college?

3 years ago this lovely foreign exchange student did an internship at my place of employment. We flirted heavily. One night I went to a party with all the students, and much to my surprise she ended up making out with one of them. Broke my heart to see it, I seriously thought we had some serious chemistry.

So, I faced reality, figured she was moving back to her home country anyway and dealt with the embarrassment of my shock at the party, which was made apparent to everyone by my actions of storming out of  said party immediately.

I tossed the emotions out of my mind after some time. Eventually, a year or so later we got to chatting here and there on the ol' FB and skyping from time to time. She has occasionally told me how sorry she was and she really made a mistake. We gave each other general compliments but never got romantic so to speak over the net.

Recently she told me she was going to vacation to America. Yay, right?! 

I told her she could definitely come visit, but we never really planned out or discussed a time period. 

I should mention I just took a new job as well, and am ridiculously busy with it. She knew this, but wanted to come visit anyway.

She sent an image of her plane ticket to my area, where I am the only one she knows(I've since moved states since she was here).

She plans to stay three weeks

Three! That's an eternity for a guy who generally likes his alone time, especially when dealing with a new high stress job.

Now she's here and she's been a saint about whatever I have to do. Hasn't complained, hasn't made it too tough on me.

However, she's come assuming I'm still extremely into her. She's pushing herself on me every night and as much as I like her as a person I can't just drum up these serious feelings for her over night, or even three weeks. I'm afraid I'm not goin to be able to feel anything. 

She's talked of how she's had dreams about me for the past couple of years. She's ridiculously into me for not having really talked to me consistently for a long time.

I've told her how stressed I am and how tough this is for me, going over a lot of what I mentioned above and how hard it is for me to just gain these feelings for her, yet she hasn't stopped pushing it.

What the hell should I do. She's got two weeks left here and I'm going batshit crazy.

Thanks reddit, had to vent. Here's hoping she or her friends aren't big redditors!

Any advice, much appreciated. Even a laugh.

I'll be a sophomore in the September, and I'll be starting my search soon for an internship in Summer 2015. I'm starting to look around for companies that I could apply to. 

So, there are a lot of questions on this subreddit that go along the lines of ""Should I work at a large megacorp or a trendy startup?"" And what I get from many of them is that if you're sufficiently young, you should be working for a startup. But very few of these talk about what kind of startups are good to simply intern for, the choice being between seed-stage startups, Series A companies, and Series B+ companies. From what I've been reading so far, seed startups will give you the most experience, although you'll also be compensated least for it, especially because stock options for internships are supposedly extremely rare, and the job security will be fairly unstable as well. Series A startups seem to give the best balance, but I'd like further insight from others.

I'm definitely leaning towards working at tech startups because the degree of flexibility they seem to be able provide and the casual working environment appeals more to me as a youth with no obligations, but I'm still not discounting large corporations. Overall, however, I just want to gain valuable technical experience working on projects I'm passionate about. 

So... any recommendations?"

If I continue to perform as I have been, and I only take the courses required in my degree program, I will have a 2.94 by next summer and it HAS TO BE a 3.0, because the internship I really want is a government thing and there are no exceptions. I want to add some extra courses but the thing is, these next two semesters are the ""weed-out"" semesters for my program. The classes I am taking are all supposed to be super challenging, and I will have no free time at all as it is... so whatever class I take has to be something that has very little time commitment, so a low level math class would be perfect because I am pretty good at math... Ideally I could just show up on test day and hammer it out.

I was thinking of taking pre-calculus or something super easy since I've been living and breathing calculus for the last three semesters... Just finished Differential Equations this week. That's only three credits though, and I'll need at least six. Other then that though there isn't much I can think of, because I took college algebra back during the first college go-around... 

Winter session classes are probably not going to be an option because my student loans are only enough to cover spring and fall semesters, but worst-case-scenario I can take out a private loan because I simply have to have a 3.0 by next summer, end of story. 

Basically I'm just asking for any advice, ideas, tricks, ANYTHING that I could do to bring that GPA up with a minimal time commitment.

2bv8gh,2,2014-07-27,Should I defer school? How do I build up a strong case for that?,superfroyo,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2bv8gh/should_i_defer_school_how_do_i_build_up_a_strong/,"Hi Reddit, 

I do not like what I am studying now (Business), I only took it because I knew I could score well in it if I put in the effort to study, and also because my parents say that getting a diploma in what I like (mass communications) is 'useless'. This also seems pretty lame but I also went into Business because I thought the school culture would be fun, but no.

But in order to enter the course, I just said that I liked business... WELL, yes I do intend to start my own business in the future... but yeah.

Sure enough, I've a rather good GPA of 3.7 out of 4.0. But honestly I feel so drained whenever I do my assignments because it really bores me, and I don't see the point in pursuing a business degree, honestly how many successful entrepreneurs even have one? 

and now I know that I would much rather do something I like &amp; gain more experiences out of it. 

Here is the situation, I can't transfer courses anymore because it's my second out of three years. 

I can either choose to fight to defer one semester in order to take marketing communications, which is the most closely linked 'specialisation' to my field of interest -- mass communications, because I really like to design and honestly I love the media industry even though I may not go into it in the future... I guess it's just the self motivation to learn more about it even though I don't necessarily have to, like how to photoshop and how to use illustrator, teaching myself in the process!

Or I can choose not to defer (which the school wants me to do) and just specialise in entrepreneurship &amp; marketing (without the design aspect...), and I feel so tired just thinking about that. And I know for sure after I complete my studies, I probably won't want to go into mass comm because I am not interested in the overly theoretical aspects of it, I want hands on experience and at where I live, my school is the one of the best places for that.

If I manage to defer school, I would really like to intern in a media company! Either that or nutrition, which is my second field of interest!

Yet if anyone asks me what I would want for a future career, it will be most likely to be nutrition, as I feel its more sustainable and able to impact others lives more! :) 

TL;DR: Is it wise to defer school for a semester in order to specialise in my field of interest, or just finish up whatever I am studying even though I am bored to death with it???"

I don't have anything particular in mind, it could be a game or an app,                 anything really that we could do in a month or two. We would use SVN and whatever site/app you wish to communicate. If you are in the same spot as me, reply!


As for a coach, I am not sure how would that work, but let's see first if there would be anyone actually interested in coaching a student ;)"

At the moment I only play Starcraft on my i3, GT550M, 1366 x 768 laptop and it's awful - but it works. I currently game on a 42"" LED screen and i'm not even sure if i have room for a PC but that's not what i'm here for. 

Plan to use with 2 1080p displays, for gaming and light work with Office apps etc. By day i'm an apprentice (intern) IT Tech so overclocking in the future is a possibility but for now i'm happy without. I have never had a desktop in my life so if i'm going wrong feel free to laugh at me.

I feel like all aspects of my life is at a dead end.  My love life is a mess:  I haven’t had sex or been on a date in 3 years.  There is a girl that I am absolutely in love with, but she is not interested in me at all, only sees me as a friend.  Even if she did see me as more, she’s not interested in dating anyone, only hooking up.  Most of my friends have abandoned me or are too busy with their own lives.  I can’t get a job anywhere, not even a part time job as a cashier.  I applied to 20 internships and 15 part time summer jobs and got rejected from every single one.  I’m a college student and can barely keep up with the work.  I’m already behind 2 years and going to be 23 or 24 when I graduate undergrad. Most days i can’t get up.  I just lie in bed.  There is a constant voice in my head reminding me of everything that I have ever done wrong in my entire life and telling me I’m worthless and nothing I do or try will ever matter.  Everything that I have tried to do in my life has ended in failure.  

I feel like i have no control over anything in my life and every day I get more and more desperate.  I’ve resorted to daily heavy drinking and self-harming.  I'm really concerned that one of these days I'm going to get desperate enough to do something really stupid."

This client wanted a no compromises MONSTER of a first gaming PC: the complete 1440p/120hz package. Every component was chosen carefully to maximize performance and aesthetics, and the system was meticulously built with the highest quality control standards. 0 finger print delivery, heavily overclocked, full stability testing, controllable LED lighting, full photoshoot, full product tour, full warranty covering parts and labor, and continued customer support. This client knows how to enjoy life, so I won't be too surprised if this rig goes under water next.

Turns out he's also a Houston firefighter that covers my neighborhood and an overall very cool guy.  I couldn't have asked for a better client, and gave him a brand new Razer Deathadder 2013 as a token of my appreciation.


**Just as a reminder, these prices from pcpartpicker are not what the customer paid.  They are the default vendors and values from PCPP.com.  I only simply provided a spec sheet through them because that's what redditors seem to like to do.  Hope that clears some confusion.**

***Frequently asked questions and complaints***  
In an attempt to clear up more confusion for the know-it-alls, I'll go through the reasoning for some of the common complaints as if this is their system or something.  

**OMFG WHY DID YOU PAY FOR UNNECESSARILY FAST 2400MHZ1!?!**  
It costed $81, not the $134.99 that PCPP listed.  This was cheaper than any name brand 1600mhz kit on Newegg.  There is literally no reason to not pick the higher quality, binned IC, aesthetically pleasing, faster RAM for less money.  

**WAIT, 1600MHZ CL6 RAM IS JUST AS FAST AS 2400MHZ CL9**  
Good luck finding a 8GB of CL6.

**YEAH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WTF YOU'RE DOING CUZ YOU ONLY GOT 8 GIGS**  
Please speak ONLY from personal experience here.  I routinely run 2 AAA title games, 2 voice chat, 2 text chat, and anywhere from 10-50 Chrome tabs at once.  Every day.  My system never exceeds 7.2gb RAM.  If you think a dedicated gaming and web browsing rig needs 16GB, then you're just daft.  Stop reading getting your advice from the comments section of Youtube videos.  Also, if my client wants 16GB ram, he can literally buy another kit and plug it in.  But he won't need it.  

**BRO WTF 1200 WATTZ IS SO OVERKILL OMG WHAT A WASTE OF PRECIOUS ENERGY CUZ EFFICIENCY PEAKS AND STUFF!!!**  
The client had several choices ranging from 850W to 1000W.  At the last second, the 1200W was thrown into the mix.  Why?  Try a custom bios and overvolting 2x GK110 chips.  This client is an enthusiast and wanted to be ready for watercooling, as well as *any other dual GPU setup in the future*.

**OMG $100 ON FANS THAT IS THE MOST BATSHIT THING I'VE EVER HEARD**  
Umm, okay.  Sounds like you won't have a watercooled PC any time soon.

**HOW DARE YOU MAKE A LIGHT HEARTED COMMENT ABOUT WINDOWS 8. WINDOWS 8 IS A SAINT!!**  
Like I explained, Windows 7 is what the client chose.  And contrary to Reddit, most people dislike Windows 8.  

**YOU SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A CHEAP MOTHERBOARD, 2 FANS, DITCHED THE 780 SLI SETUP, AND GOTTEN A 780 TI AND GONE 4K**  
The client loves the looks of the board.  It's over built and perfectly suitable for Haswell Refresh overclocking.  A 780 Ti is not sufficient for 1440p, especially compared to 2x 780's.  This is a big case with hot hardware, it needs more than 2 fans.  

**YOU WORK FOR PHANTEKS BECAUSE YOU LIKE THEIR PRODUCTS AND TOOK NICE PICTURES OF IT**  
I must be the unpaid intern they don't know about :/  

**BRO WHY DIDN'T YOU GET A 512GB OR 1TB SSD?!  250 IS WAY TOO SMALL**  
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to buy 873 Steam games and install them all at once.  Also contrary to popular belief, the client can add an SSD at any given time if the desire strikes.  I did not force him to pay extra for a larger SSD that he might not use, just like I didn't force him to pay extra for 16GB ram that he'll actually never use.

**HOW DARE YOU GET NICE PARTS INSTEAD OF SPENDING EXTRA MONEY ON THINGS YOU DON'T NEED!!  GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!**

2bvnor,11,2014-07-27,Got advice to quit grad school- should I listen?,inaorzo123,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2bvnor/got_advice_to_quit_grad_school_should_i_listen/,"I hope yall can help me with my current conundrum: 

I probably didn't go to grad school for the right reasons. I had no idea what I wanted to do upon graduation and was closeted, yearning to maintain the safety of college. So I enrolled in my University's MPA program. Turns out I've really loved it. It has taught me so much about government, policy and non profits and I've made great connections with other students who I know will go far in this arena. The best part was getting an internship at an amazing non profit, where I am right now.

In this new city, I got to know one of my neighbors. She's an older woman who has worked in government agencies and is very intelligent, but she's also known to be an unhappy old woman who can be very bitter. Still, she invited me to Church yesterday and then dinner so I said yes.

At dinner, after 2 glasses of wine, she basically unleashed on me, saying that she thinks my MPA program is useless and it's not going to open up any doors for me, and I should stop being idealistic about the big things I want to do in my life. I would love to head non-profits, work on campaigns, or be a political journalist, or even a lobbyist. She thinks I should drop out of the program before school starts in a few weeks, and either move back with my parents or find any kind of job available in my college town, or maybe just enroll in some classes that might be more useful (in her opinion). Basically, she doesn't think I need this masters for any of my future job prospests. Plus, she thinks I'm just a ""dreamer"" who probably won't be able to do any of those things without going hungry.

The problem is that I have already signed my lease for another year, and as soon as I quit grad school, my student loan payments will kick in. That will be very tough to handle. I also don't want to move back home because my parents are going through financial troubles and probably can't support me right now if I can't find a job.

I certainly am not excited about spending several more thousands of dollars on grad school, especially on a program that she doesn't seem to think is worth anything. But I also really enjoy it and would hate myself for quitting when I'm only a year away from earning my degree. Yes, I have heard people say that it's useless, but I have heard just as many people say that it was a worthwhile investment.

Since then I have spoken to several people who know me very well and they say I should stay and earn my degree. They believe that just having a masters degree will be an asset for me. I'm just so confused though. Should I even be listening to a woman who barely knows me and is known to be unhappy and bitter?

I guess I took it to heart because she personified the voice in my head that tells me I'm not good enough, I'm not that smart, and I'm wasting my time getting a masters degree because it will be worthless. I really need some feedback from people who have been through this."

I feel like I'm way overstating my confidence in languages I am familiar with, especially C++ and Javascript. I've used C in classes a lot and PHP/Python at work, and I'm reviewing my Java, so is there a way to separate those two categories out, or should I just leave out the ones I'm not too familiar with? I also feel like the high school internship part is not very relevant to the jobs I'm applying now, not to mention it was 6 years ago and is filled with jargon. Should I even include that? Finally, I did pretty much the same thing in both my internships, so is it ok if the job description for both of them are pretty much identical? Any help would be greatly appreciated."

If you are needing a programmer, I can help, I can tutor, I can make very HQ apps (more functioning, not design :P) but still, I am only 17, and a self-taught programmer, I have no idea where to go, I am very confident in my abilities, I know I am good, I know I am fast and clean. But I tried to make apps, I seriously cannot think of any original application ideas! Please, how do you guys make money, if you do? I really don't want to get a job besides programming something, it's my dream to work at google, go to a good school, like R.I.T. I think I really am ready to work with people, ready to do anything, trying to make a couple bucks off of my skills!

Thanks for your time!

Just so I don't get post on stuff I have tried,

I HAVE tried, Freelancing (as stated), I have tried to get some sort of internship, I have tried to make apps, but as I said I cannot think of original ideas!"

Part Six

It’s 4am, the morning after the night before and I’m still awake, my arm heavy and itchy under plaster. My wife, my poor, long suffering wife is asleep under my jacket in a chair. She hasn’t left me since I got here just after 7am. The hospital is tiny, more like a large GP’s office, but they were insistent on keeping me overnight because of my apparent head injury. Whatever it was that whacked my skull was blunt and heavy, Christina insists I’m lucky my head wasn’t caved in. 

 I’m awake because of the pain, the itching, the guilt of the worry I’ve inflicted on my wife. I’m awake because Cathy Robbins held my hand tight all the way through a preliminary examination, and not once did she make a sound. Her pale eyes tell the same story of every child I encounter at work; fear, mistrust – the eyes tell the same story as soldiers, trauma doctors and old homicide cops – stories of too much horror, too many unhappy endings, the witness to the worst humanity has to offer. I feel the weight of those stories in my heart and I wonder if I should quit before I turn into an old cop, a relic, a man with too many lines around his eyes and a heart encased in stone. 

Christina is silently fuming with me for not telling her the truth, for putting the fear of god into her when Sandy and Curly turned up on the doorstep at 2am saying they’d lost contact with me during a field operation. My plan to not worry my wife had failed miserably. Sylvia stayed with her the entire time, on the drive to the hospital outside of town, during the agonising wait for news, and finally crying with relief when we were reunited. She called her son in Jamaica and told him she was getting the first flight in the morning. The fear of losing someone we love unexpectedly makes us realise how short life can be, and as she said “I’ve lived a good long time, but it’s time to stop working and hold my Grandbabies again.” We’re devastated, but fully understanding. She’s become family this last six months. Christina has put aside her anger for now, and not left my side. 

At 4am, the world is particularly quiet. Not eerie, like in the town, but at total peace. 4am is also the lowest ebb, and it’s often when most critically sick people die. 4am is a phenomenon, a silent statue of an hour with eyes that see everything. This particular 4am I was thinking of my Father, and maybe I should reach out and reconnect with him after all this time. I think of the Robbins family, and wonder how it – or any of the other children’s families – will begin to heal from here. If these kinds of wounds cut too deep to ever heal fully, and what kind of scars will be left behind. 

It will be a long time, perhaps an eternity, to fix whatever damage was inflicted on those children. Jason is in protective care, reunited with his Mom, but by all accounts he hasn’t suffered any physical abuse, but we can’t say for sure on what he’s witnessed over the last week. The other two children, their respective families have been contacted and are flying in from out of state.

At 4am, Danny is back at the station with the Cap, the team and the FBI. Somehow, in-between my disappearance and escape, the powers that be have decided to get involved, hence the riot van peeling into the town. We could have done with them before this whole damn thing even truly started. I’d given my statement to one of the agents earlier, but he wouldn’t give anything away. They’d recovered the first cop, but he wasn’t “in a fit state to be interviewed.” The old guy, the second cop, he was dead. 


I pick up my phone, a heavy crack down the screen from my initial fall and scroll down to my Dad’s home number. It would be 9am in London, my ever early bird Father would have been up for at least four hours already.  I run my thumb over the crack in the screen, trying to muster the courage to press “Call” for the first time in six years, when my screen lights up with an incoming call – it’s Danny. I get up and move into the narrow corridor, hoping not to wake my wife or any other patients. 

“Danny? What’s up?”
“Sorry Jack, I know you’re meant to be resting but if I know you, you’re not sleeping.”
I smile. “What’s going on?”
“The Feds are all over this, but there’s still some legwork for us grunts, do you want to finish what you started?”
I look back at Christina, sleeping peacefully, her face relaxed and not racked with worry or fear. For a brief moment, I consider getting back into bed, but I remember Jason’s face and Cathy’s hand in mine. 
“At the risk of sounding corny; let’s finish this.”


Danny and Davis pick us up, thankfully we have a not-so-dreadful cell where Christina can sleep; she won’t be alone in the house and she’ll be near me, for some reason I don’t want to let her out of my sight. 

As I start looking through the file Danny passes me in the back seat, Christina leans over my shoulder. “Hey wait, go back to that photograph.”
“This is confidential police work.”
“Shut up, go back.” 
I flip the photo over, it’s one that Officer Barnham took in the basement. “I’ve seen that before.” She points to the wall behind the bench. I look at her, puzzled. “What, the circle?” She picks up the photo, studying it. “Definitely. I remember when I was an intern at Brookdale, we had a homeless guy come in – he had that mark on his back.” Christina looks up at me, her tired eyes suddenly alive again. “Like a tattoo?” “No, more like a burn or a brand. Fresh.  It was like, 5am, I’d been on shift for fourteen hours and he was incoherent, the doctor treated the burn but wrote it the babbling off as intoxication and sent him to the drunk tank.” 
“That was considerate of him.” 
“It was a heavy night, there’d been some traffic pile up. Look, I know that’s the same.” Danny twists around from the front seat and joins in - “How can you be that sure,? Surely this was like, what, ten years ago?” Christina raises an eyebrow – “Danny, I’m not stupid, I remember it clearly because it was my first week and the guy had third degree burns. The doctor just looked at it, decided it was probably drug related and got me to clean and dress the wound, but I remember staring into it and feeling like… you know the sound something makes when you throw it down a deep well, and you hear it bounce off the side and it echoes, but you can’t see it?” Danny remains stony faced. “Not really, no.” 


Christina puts her head to one side, a gesture I know she makes when trying to explain something complicated to a young child. “I still remember it clearly now. That circle burnt into his back, it made me feel like someone had sucked the joy out of life. The old guy, the bum, I remember him so well, he had really blue eyes – he was talking nonsense but I swear I heard him say ‘Help me’ but the doctor told me to get on with it and get him sent to the tank. He did reek of alcohol to be fair, I felt drunk just being next to him.” 
“So there’s a chance he may have been processed? He could be in the system.”
Christina shrugs, Danny sticks out his bottom lip and nods. “This fucking case, man. Jack, the feds think they know who these guys are.” 
“Continue.”
“So they’re involved with some next level shit, but when you went missing, your Cap, Mason, well, he freaked. Called in a few favours. Word spread like wildfire and then all of a sudden Curly’s picking up a fax from the FBI. Barnham sent over the pictures and they just turned up at the crime scene. They’ve been investigating these guys all over, call themselves The Silent Circle.”
“The Silent Circle?” 
“Well clearly they like circles; and apparently they aren’t too fond of talking.” Danny reaches over to the file on my lap, flips and few pages and there, right at the back is a photo of a corpse with its mouth sewn shut. 
“Surely this is a gang thing. Sewing people’s mouths shut? That’s fucking ridiculous.”
“Not so. There’s been rumours and rumblings but nothing concrete, then you wander into hell and blow the whole thing open.”
“And the children?”
“Here’s the cool part. Sorry.” Danny notices my wife’s unamused face. “The town is where all this loony shit started. Your ‘old man’ leader, Frederick Engles was a schoolteacher, but before that he was he posted overseas and got involved in some bad fucking voodoo and got dishonourably discharged. He started this Silent Circle business in 1960, continues his small town teaching elementary kids and gathers an anti-Government, anti-establishment movement working out of the church. He literally infiltrated a town of God-fearing people and got them to reject rational thinking. It looks like he was trying to re-establish the town with its original bloodlines.”
“Danny this is fucking crazy, you sound like a conspiracy theorist.”

“Ah funny you should say that, Engles started scaring the living shit out of the locals by criticising CERN, saying they were building a doomsday machine in Switzerland to bring about the apocalypse. According to some of his diaries in the Engles house, he began using rational fear tactics, saying the atomic bomb was just the beginning. People were uneasy as it was, he whipped them into a frenzy. He went full book of Revelations on them.”

“Okay so I’m taking this with a pinch of salt, but carry on.”

“Jack, this was all during the space race – science was moving on but some of these people were still small-town thinkers. Birth control was approved in 1960, imagine the field day a religious nutcase could have with that, he genuinely made them believe doomsday was upon them. He had records of his speeches at the church since he returned in 1959 – in May 1960, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded took place in Chile. People were fucking terrified.” 

“So Engles used current events to scare the living shit out of people. Not so different to American media these days.”

“There were a lot of young men from that town that fought in ‘Nam. People were starting to see real horror invade their lives. The nuclear threat, the Cuban Missile Crisis, planes dropping out of the damn sky, Engles’ preaching wasn’t so far fetched. Engles then told them that the government was so interested in the space race because February ’62 heralded a grand conjuncture of the planets and would begin the end of the world.”

“A grand what?”

“Conjuncture. Look, Wikipedia it. The simple fact was, Engles got enough people on his side, got them to literally shut up and listen and creep the hell out of anyone sane enough not to buy into his bullshit. It took two years, but most of the sane families moved out by the end of ’62.”

“Okay Danny so I get it, lunatic coverts small town thinkers into forming cult, but what’s with all the Light Bringer stuff?”

The car slows and I realise we’re at the station.  “I’ll let Agent Lee handle that one.” Davis shows Christina to our break room and promises to make her coffee and wrestle some donuts from Sandy. 

Agent Lee reminds me of Ed Harris, bald, mildly skeletal and imposing, a man of rules and little time for small town mumbo-jumbo, but after some ‘my right arm is in a sling’ awkwardness breaks the tension, he gives a firm backwards handshake and cracks a smile. “Detective Harper, you have really blown this case open. Sit. Detective Katz has got you up to date on Engles?”
“Kind of, I was just enquiring about the ‘Light Bringer’ stuff.”
“Ah yes, well, interesting you may ask. Light Bringer is the direct translation for Lucifer.”
“So devil worshipping crazy cult?”
“Not exactly. Engles believed Lucifer was the bringer of knowledge, of light. He capitalised on the fear of the unknown and promised to raise Lucifer in what appears to be a weapon against God AND Satan in the apocalypse.”

“In all due respect, Agent Lee, this is all a bit Da Vinci Code for me.”

Agent Lee sips his coffee and nods slightly. “Let me level with you, Detective Harper, I’ve been working on these guys for twenty years. We suspected Engles was operating out of the town, but we searched that place top to bottom and we never found a trace. Its likely he only went back in to town the last year or so – before that we’ve found traces of The Silent Circle in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Kentucky… basically all the southern states. Its likely Cathy Robbins was travelling with them, the other two children you found were abducted from nearby towns but there’s no evidence they’ve been in the town all along. There are no traces of any other kids in that place, and no bodies. It looks like Engles has been setting up franchises, about ten years ago they start popping up in New York. Robert Madder was a member.”

I feel a cold, creeping shudder run over my skin as if a ghost has walked through me. Madder was a prolific serial killer, as macabre as he was clever. The press went mad for him and I nearly went mad from chasing him. “Is this really why you’re here?”

Agent Lee leans over the table, hundreds of photographs of the ghost town laid over it. “Jack, this isn’t just about stolen children. I wish it was. Currently my team have recovered remains from eight or nine separate adult victims. The children were just the beginning; Engles believed in pure blood. Every member of the cult we’ve recovered – and it’s only been a few- have been connected to that town in some way. It looks like he was planning some kind of ritual for the next planetary event in 2020, but you scuppered his plans. Nobody has ever been close to these people. Not one person has made it out of The Silent Circle alive.”

“Except Robert Madder.” I suddenly realise how tired I am. 

“Of course, now we have Cathy Robbins, Bobby Nightingale and Mary Bucklesby. None of which will – or can- talk. Jason Anderson didn’t seem to see much and Engles was running out of time. Based on one eyewitness account and some basic evidence, I don’t have much to go on.”

“My eyewitness account.” I watch my left hand crush my paper coffee cup.

“You and I both know eyewitness accounts, especially under duress are… unreliable at best. Especially as we have that business of the 10-53.”

“I heard that 10-53.”

“I have no doubt of it, Detective, but considering the state of your companions and that Officer Barnham was separated from the group, I only have one witness with a head injury and three dead bodies, one of which is made of  nine other people.” 

“But… wait, three?” 

“Engles, although he didn’t have long left anyway, judging by his autopsy – end stage pancreatic cancer. Officer Mike Jamison bled out and of course we have our sacrificial lambs to identify. The Circle were trying to raise Lucifer through an earthly conduit, it seems.” 

“What about the woman? The old woman with the white hair?”
“No trace of a woman. No records, nothing in Engle’s logs – and he was meticulous. No mention of this ‘Sacred Mother’ you’re talking about. In fact, the only hard evidence we have is a ceremonial knife with yours and Cathy Robbins’ prints and a large hole in Engles’ throat.” 

Agent Lee picks up my statement. “No ‘magic box’ no nothing. Of course, I don’t disbelieve you for a moment but you suffered a serious head trauma and given your recent personal troubles and your history back in NYC….”

“So what you’re saying is, go home Jack, you’ve had a nasty bump on the head and you have a history of being on the crazy side?”

Agent Lee puts down my statement and looks at me with piercing blue eyes. Like an icy sky. “What I’m saying is, Detective Harper, you’ve given us Engles, god knows nobody will miss him, and some valuable hard evidence as well as recovering four missing children, you’re a local hero. Now let us take the investigation back to Langley and you take a holiday with your pretty wife. We know where you are if we need you.” 

I am equally angry as I am tired. I am beyond exhausted, my whole body aches in defeat. I have nothing further to say to Agent Lee that I won’t regret; I know how unreliable eyewitness testimony is but what they’ve found versus what happened… it doesn’t add up. Silently fuming, I get up without another word and collect my wife from Davis, who is showing her his latest report on lost cat activity. I want to go home and I want to sleep, for the first time in months, I feel like I need to sleep. 

Christina and I walk home in silence, her hand in mine. I’m quietly furious but despite my conversation with Agent Lee going over and over in my head, it’s becoming foggy with exhaustion. I look at Christina for a moment, and she’s beautiful and somewhere in the back of my mind, I’m eternally grateful I found her, and I know we can recover from anything. 

I have to break our handhold to fish out the house keys from my pocket, but as we get to the mailbox in the front yard, Christina stops dead. “…Jack.” I look at her face and then follow her eye line to the house. The front door is slightly open. I stop and hand my wife my cell phone. “Call Danny, stay here.” I reach for my gun and thank the lord I’m left handed. “Jack…” 

“Shh, honey, call Danny, stay here.” 

Slowly I make my way up the path, checking for any lights or prints in the dirt. The sun has started to come up, the birds are singing and the air is crisp. I can hear Christina talking to Danny, but my mind tunes out background noise. 

I reach the door and slowly push it open. Covering my back, I check the hall, living room, kitchen and dining room. The house is small, just one level with one bedroom and a little bathroom. Nothing in the house seems to be disturbed and I slowly, slowly make my way to our bedroom, my heart hammering somewhere in my throat. I check the bedroom and bathroom, but there’s no-one there. My blood is electric, powered by the furious pumping engine that is my heart. My chest is hot, like chronic indigestion, whilst the back of my throat burns, and I can smell something chemical. I put it down to a combination of exhaustion and adrenaline. I exit the bathroom and turn on our bedroom light, and then I see it. 

On the white wall above our bed, the paint of the fresh, black circle drips thickly like blood onto the bed linen where my wife had been lying just a few hours before. Underneath, in thin, painted letters, is a message left behind by someone who has invaded my home in the dead of night, someone who knows where I live and where I sleep, next to a framed photo of my beautiful wife, her face now covered in fresh, black paint. On the wall is a message meant for me and me alone. 


The axe forgets. 


The tree remembers.

2bwk2k,18,2014-07-27,What do you look for in an entry-level job candidate for system admin or helpdesk? Looking to start a course for homeless teens.,ParadoxDC,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2bwk2k/what_do_you_look_for_in_an_entrylevel_job/,"Hello fellow system admins. Long time lurker of this sub. I work for a very small company, so I'm the only IT person and because of that, I've never had to hire another person before. That's why I am posing this question you those of you who have.

I am looking to start an IT training program at a full-service homeless shelter. I have some ideas about specific topics to teach, but I am hoping to get some more concrete ideas that could potentially help young homeless teens/adults find an internship or even a job in IT. At the end of the course, for those students that show they are ready, we would arrange for them to take a certification course (a basic one, such as A+). The goal is to give these kids an extra leg up beyond generic, basic computer lessons. Maybe, just maybe, we can put them on a path to a successful career and break the cycle of homelessness in their family.

For those of you who have hired or would consider hiring entry-level people with little/no experience:

* What are some useful technical skills you might look for?
* What would be a solid basic certification we could arrange for them to take? We would likely structure the course around this exam. Current suggestion (my idea) is CompTIA A+. I know that many companies think that cert is a joke but it's better than nothing and could actually be useful for someone who hasn't had much exposure to computers.

Other suggestions for topics to teach, skills, or certification ideas are welcome."
2bwps1,60,2014-07-27,New Grad @ Big Tech Company from no-name school and I'm a disappointed in my performance,chronic_poop_throw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bwps1/new_grad_big_tech_company_from_noname_school_and/,"Here's the deal.  I read threads on here on all the time about people in new jobs freaking out about not performing well or not contributing, and people attribute it to imposter's syndrome.  I usually agree with this.  I think, however, in my case, it might not be.

I graduated from a no-name school in CS and did two unimpressive internships before getting an FT offer from one of the big tech companies.  I don't know how I got the offer because honestly my interviews didn't go that well, but whatever.  At my previous internships I was always pretty confident in myself, because even if my co-workers knew more than me due to experience I knew that I at least had a higher potential or aspirations than some of them.  While I wasn't the smartest guy in the room I always had stuff to contribute, especially in regards to stuff I've learned in school regarding best practices, and received positive reviews at all my internships.

I started my first full-time position a couple months ago and I'm astounded at the intelligence of everyone on my team.  Everyone is so smart, knowledgeable, and good at decision making.  Some of these people have only been out of school for less than a year, although they went to far better schools than I did.  Not only are they more experienced than me but I feel like IQ wise or intelligence wise they far surpass me as well.  Some of my friends went to these top schools so I know their classes and assignments, and frankly my school assignments were embarrassingly basic compared to theirs.

I'm doing my very best and trying to not be discouraged.  My coworkers are really friendly and helpful to me, and pair on things or give me advice when I need it.  I've learned more in two months than I have at my other internships combined (which in turn is more than what I've learned in 4 years of school).  But still, I'm absolutely embarrassed to turn in anything into code review because it will always get ripped to shreds for things I didn't even realize.

I've been spending some time after work trying to improve myself.  I've improved my unix command line skills, vim skills, git skills, read through *The Art of Readable Code* and now working my way through *Clean Code*.  I'm trying to reach a point where I don't make the same mistakes that I used to, which is important, and I'm getting better, but I'm not perfect and sometimes make mistakes.  Furthermore, it always seems like when I check something into code review, even if I did everything perfectly to the best of my ability, I'm missing something else.  My coworkers rarely get things caught in code reviews like I do, even those that have been there &gt;1 year.

I realize this has turned into more of a rant than anything.  I guess I just need advice.  It's hard to spend extra time after work improving myself without getting burned out, and I tend to find the best way to learn is just to make a mistake and have the code rejected.  But, that makes me look bad.  I'm not sure what the best approach to being in an environment where everyone is way smarter than you is.  Some of my coworkers have made jokes like ""Soo... chronic_poop_throw, when are you finally going to get something through code review on your first try hahaha,"" and although it is said jokingly it does hurt and makes me feel nervous.  Sometimes I feel like I will be fired (still within my probationary period).  What advice can you give me to succeed in this environment?"
2bx57z,3,2014-07-28,Dev work in Australia,dont_tell_my_mother,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2bx57z/dev_work_in_australia/,"Hey all, quick backstory. Currently have about a year of work experience (web programmer, more or less full stack), and things are going well. However I do plan on going to Australia in the next 6-12 months, and stay for at least a year. Preferably I would like to have a real job lined up (and a work visa), but may have to just use the work vacation visa.

Rough background: Have a CS Degree, have about a year (will be more like 1.5-2 years by the time I leave) of work experience in web development. Able to do lots of work on my own, but still in the learn something new everyday phase. Not against having to do an intern type deal, though would prefer full time work (and it does not have to be web based, though that is where my experience is).

So first, I was hoping to get an idea of what the chances of a non senior, non Aussie, landing a job is? I understand there is a skilled work visa. How hard are these to obtain? 

Second, if I have to take the work visa approach, are 6 month internships a thing in Australia (for non students in this case)? Part of the visa stipulates I would not be allowed to work at one place for more then 6 months, so I'm thinking this would be my best chance at work.

I'm still in the very early stages of figuring out what to do, so any input is welcome. I don't need any concrete details on these, but getting a few peoples opinions would be great. Thanks."
2bxdh2,4,2014-07-28,My little success story with advice for all. Enjoy!,HerroPhish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bxdh2/my_little_success_story_with_advice_for_all_enjoy/,"Hey people,

*long read*

I am pretty wide awake right now and I decided to tell you guys about my recent success story First, I wanna say thank you. I have used tons of advice on this subreddit and it really helped me out. For all of you guys on the job hunt, use the advice here, it is most of the time REALLY helpful.

So here's where my journey begins. I graduate from a large state school, shitty GPA, not much relevant job experience (I was a caddy every summer because of the money, I had one unpaid internship). My GPA was low not because I wasn't smart- it was because I really partied too hard and just didn't put in the effort I should have.

I got very lucky and found my first job rather quickly. It was more of a job that came to me and it was a R.E. sales jobs. I quickly learned, i HATED working on commission and I felt like I wasn't using my mind as much as I wanted. The company was small, but my bosses really liked me and they pushed me to succeed. I learned valuable life lessons at this job that I will never forget. It was a crash course on how to be personable, how to put yourself together, and how to never take no for an answer, and how to fucking hustle. Seriously, without the lessons I learned from this job I don't believe I ever would've gotten the job I have today. It was an invaluable experience that gave me thick skin and it helped me achieve my final goal for a job. 

Fast forward a couple months. I am finally realizing what I want to do in life. Seriously, I had no idea before, I was so clueless. I wanted to be a Financial Analyst at an Investment Bank- Mainly a Bulge Bracket bank. The money seemed amazing, you were given tons of work to do, and you have to think and solve issues and problems. But, this is one of the HARDEST positions to land

I started reaching out to people in my network and received an interview. Botched the interview. I plain and simple wasn't ready yet for a job of that magnitude. It was a wake up call. But, that was only the first of MANY interviews I fucked up on. Each interview I took something out of it. I learned, and i kept my focus. I knew what I wanted and I didn't let ANYONE tell me otherwise.

For a full year, I was in and out of interviews. Feeling so good I got the interview and I finally might have the job I want, and than being crushed by not receiving the job. Looking at jobs in the Back Office at banks hoping I can move up to the front office one day and STILL I couldn't get a job. It's fucking hard out there in the finance industry and very easy to give up, but don't. Keep on trucking and don't worry about the no's. Like I said before, use each interview as a learning experience and come into the next interview better prepared. 

I applied to probably over 1000 positions. The current place I got the job I maybe applied to 150 positions at the bank. I think I had a total of 10-15 in person interviews over that year. That isn't including going back for a second round.

So here it was one day, I received a email about a new job posting at a BB bank (I don't want to name the bank because of privacy reasons). Anyway, I had a connection at the bank and immediately sent him an email. He kinda pushed it off, said ""Apply online, tell me when someone contacts you"". I said sure, knowing nobody will contact me, my resume isn't the greatest! I emailed him a week later asking if he's heard any updates on the position etc.- He responded no I haven't. Again I email a week later (I'm a persistent mother fucker who has no shame) saying can you connect me with the recruiter? I would like to move forward with the process. He finally caved and connected me to the recruiter.

Whew, step 1 complete. Having completed this step so many dam times I knew how far away I was from having the job. The recruiter who was a really nice guy set up a 30 minute phone interview, prepared my ass off. Studied for a full 3 days on all the technical terms and potential answer to any STAR interview question they had. I aced the first interview. Set me up for a second in person. I took in everything I learned from the past year and made sure I was prepared to the T. Aced the second and the third interview and ended up getting the job of my dreams. A Front Office position at a Bulge Bracket bank. I was truly ecstatic. I still am, It is kind of surreal.

The referral I reached out to also said he loved how persistent I was and how focused I was on what I wanted, he had to help me after he saw that.  

Sorry that story was so long, it's been a long year.

My advice to anyone looking to break into finance or get a job in general-

-Do NOT be afraid to connect with alumni, parents friends, anyone you know. They will be the way in the door, you just have to do the rest

-Know what you want. Know the career path you will have to take to get there. Never contact a referral without being SURE of what you want. I would never contact someone and just say ""Yeah i'm looking for a job, do you know of any openings?"" you have to say ""Hey, I am looking to do X and I see your firm has an opening in X""

-Bring 10 copies of your resume and a ton of questions to the interview

-Study and know STAR questions (look them up if you don't know them)

-Know your story. On top of knowing your story be able to articulate it in a way that relates to the job

-Prepare your ass of for the interview. I can't stress that enough. Know everything about the company, why you want to work there, why you want to do this position etc.

-Dress the dam part. Shave, gel your hair. Do what you have to do to look as best as you can.

-Most of all don't dwell on a failure. Learn from it. Go over the interview and write down what you think went wrong. Make sure that doesn't happen again.

- For your resume, if you don't think its that great I would suggest getting it done professionally. I used WallStreetOasis.com (a great tool for anyone looking into a finance career) and I can't say enough how much it helped. $200 is worth it when you get that new job.


I really can't say how much I learned about life this past year. Nobody is going to give you anything in life, you have to go out there and grab it. Shit's gonna happen and your not gonna get that dream job you interviewed for, but suck it up and keep trying. I thought about giving up and staying at the job I was working in so many times. Luckily I didn't give up and my hard work paid off. Keep your head up guys, It took me a full year after graduating college to finally get a job I am happy with. 75% of my friends are still struggling so don't fret if you haven't yet. 

Remember guys, stay focus and keep trying. It's the only way in this tough job market. Don't be afraid to reach out and keep your heads up guys!


If anyone has any questions about my interview process, the financial industry, applying to jobs, or any questions about the language i was using (Front office vs Back Office) etc. ask away.

One tool I really recommend for job seekers looking into any kind of finance career, read WallStreetOasis.com. It has a ton of invaluable information on it. I was reading the forum all the time while I was looking for a job.

2bxsi3,29,2014-07-28,Rory Tulane,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bxsi3/rory_tulane/,"Hey r/nosleep

I'm here because, well, I can't sleep. Which is incredible considering that I just got off my third 12-hour shift in as many days. I'm a nurse at a local hospital (yes, a male nurse. Haha. Yeah, I saw Meet the Parents. Great movie. Shut up, please). Every couple months the shit-stars align and I'm blessed with the triple-header from hell itself. Anyway, what was I writing about? Christ, I'm tired.

I can't sleep. I met this patient two nights ago and my head hasn't been right since. His name was Rory Tuller or Rory Tulane or something. I had just spent a miserable two hours prepping a crusty grandma for surgery because she had started shitting blood at midnight. I needed a minute to breathe without inhaling old-lady-diaper fumes and I didn't want to risk being seen by the on-duty intern, so I went and hid in another patient's room.

Mr. Tulane was a suicide whose body hadn't read the note. He was out of bullets for the shotgun and swallowed a bottle of Tylenol with some vodka instead, or at least that's the gist of what the EMT had deciphered from the scene. His 40 year-old son had found him naked in a pool vomit and urine. The EMT told me that he had woken up en route long enough to stutter ""Can't cum. Time to die,"" and throw up some more Tylenol and chicken/potato slurry. Charming guy. His liver was stew meat, so even though he was still alive, he was going to bite it soon. All that was left was the slow slide into multi-organ failure which, thanks to an irreversible coma, he would sleep through. A tremendous mercy.

This also made his room an ideal hiding place. I remember thinking that Mr. Tulane (or Rory, as I have come to think of him. Since he fucked my brain, I figure we're on a first-name basis) looked like Bill Clinton at 80 as I pulled the curtain between me and the bed. I flung myself into an armchair and listened to the still steady beeps of the heart monitor. This was as close to peace as I would get. Three hours left.

I must have nodded off, because the next thing I remember is a pain in my shoulder.

""Hey, HEY, kid!""

Not only was my patient out of his supposedly irreversible coma, but he seemed to be pissed off about the fact. He was wearing a sour expression on his already puckered old man face. He was also jabbing me in the shoulder with the walking cane that his son had inexplicably left him.

""Are you just going to sit there, or are you going to get me a fuckin' glass of water?""

I hadn't expected to deal with it first hand, but this is about what my conversation with his son would have me expect him to be like. He said his father (Rory, my patient) was a mean-ass drunk who loved his children with his fists. For proof, the son showed me what looked like an extra knuckle at the base of his right pinkie. He told me that Rory had snapped it after he had poured the last of the whiskey down the drain. He was 6.

I got the man his water because that's what I'm paid to do. Through my reemerging headache, I thought about snapping his pinkie.

""What are you smiling about, kid? I feel like shit. What are you going to do about that?""

In my annoyance, I did what no trained medical professional should do, I told the raw truth. No sugar coating. Just as well; Rory had swallowed enough of those pills.

""Well, that's to be expected, sir, you're dying.""

""I know, dipshit. I want to know why I'm fuckin' here feeling it.""

I knew that I should get the doctor, but after listening to the son's stories about him, I took a bit of sadistic pleasure in letting him feel the jabs of the torture rack he had put himself on.

""Hey c'mere, I wanna... I want to tell you something.""

I knew what was coming, the deathbed confessional. Working the night shift, I got this a lot. Way too many old folks decided to die at 4 a.m. Usually it was something about embezzlement or peacemaking by-proxy with an estranged relative. The best were the bizarre, medicated ramblings, delivered with the solemn sincerity of the dying: ""Tell Jessie the flowers are on the roof."" ""We never did bury that dog."" These were currency at the nurses' station.

Something told me that Rory wouldn't be making any peace. Dreadful curiosity told me that it was going to be something foul and rotten as the man himself.

""When I was 12, my father took me to the river.""

Or not. Maybe the delirium was already here, and he was just telling me whatever random fever-memory it had chosen to show him last.

""There was this spot where the water swirled around, like a little pond right inside the river. The ducks loved it. I used to go feed them bread like your typical fuckin' little kid.""

He even sounded like Clinton, except with a Crayola vocabulary and a smoking habit. I had no idea how the man was still going on. With the amount of damage he had done to himself, he should have been in agony. No, I mean he shouldn't have been there at all. And yet he looked serene. Fucked up and serene.

""My dad was a sumbitch. Choked my mom half to death three times that I can remember.""

This was apparently a hereditary condition. Rory's son had told me that he had beat his mom and she had taken him and his baby sister and ran. Only a sense of familial duty had him checking in on his dear old dad at all.

""He took me right to that spot because he knew that I liked to feed those ducks. Not that he had taken me there before. Shit, no. He used to spank me with his belt for wasting bread like that. I'd have blood in my britches. No, he was going to teach me something. And his lessons were a bad sort.""

I looked up from my hands which I had been staring at, and caught his eyes. They were yellow as dog snow, and his skin was parchment showing every broken capillary around his angry red nose. It couldn't be long now. Best to stay put and let this play out so I could get a jump on the clean-up afterward.

""He sat down on the overhang and had me sit next to him. I was nervous-like, because I never got this close to him without the red marks to show for it later. There was this group of ducks that were sunning on the bank. They were real tame 'cause of all the folks feeding them. My father, he held my shoulder and it felt wrong. Like, his fingers were on my shoulder but his thumb was kinda diggin' in to my neck. And there was like this, this pulse. I couldn't tell if it were mine or his. 'Son, you're old enough now that you need to know what life is. You'rn need to know this.'"" 

""Like I was sayin', I knew his lessons and I knew what was coming before it happened. He swept the grass next to us with his hand, and a couple ducks came waddling up like the fat fucks they were, looking for any food he might have dropped. Anyway, my dad, he reaches out and just grabs one. Before it can bite him, he grabs it by the bill and cinches it under his arm. The thing is going apeshit by now, quacking and squirming. 'You see this?"" He says, 'You see how he's fighting, how he wants to live?'""

Rory suddenly gave in to a fit of coughing. When he finished, I saw traces of red in the saliva at the corner of his mouth.

""I should really call the doctor, sir, you shouldn't be feeling this...""

He held up his hand to stop me. ""Naw, you've had me going this long, you're gonna to let me finish. I always finish.""

I shouldn't have let him stop me that easily, but I had to hear him out, in spite of the fact that I knew he wasn't going anywhere pretty. I just wished the pulsing in my temples would ease up.

""Where was I? Oh, the duck. Yeah, it wanted to live. I could hear the breath coming out of its nostrils, and I saw the way its feet were scratching at his arm. 'He wants to live, isn't that great? Look at it, son, the beauty of his fear. He knows it's over, but he can't stop fighting it. He won't stop. Until...' Then the sumbitch did it. He squeezed that fuckin' duck under his arm real tight. Its eyes got all wide and I, I'd swear they got blacker. Like, deep. He pulled up on its head and just twisted. That squawk, I'll never forget it. It wasn't loud, just... final. I threw up then, like the pussy I was, but he pretended not to notice. He just waved that dead thing in front of me. 'This is life, son.' 'Death?' I asked him, like a stupid kid. 'No, son, it's this!' Again, he waved that fuckin' duck at me. 'You're gonna be a man soon enough. You'll have power. That's what this is. You can hold another life in your goddamn hands and end it if you choose. That's power. That's how you know you're alive.'"" 

""He dropped the thing at my feet and left me there. I cried at first, looking at that dead duck in the dirt. The eyes were still open and its tongue was stuck out the middle of its beak all choked-like. I kept looking in the eyes, but the depth had gone. It was beautiful in a way. Horrible'n beautiful all at once.""

Rory started coughing again, but I didn't even kid myself about calling the doctor this time. I just mechanically refilled his water from the carafe on the bedside table. His eyes had taken on something of a thousand-yard stare. He had been talking, but it wasn't to me. Whatever was on the other end of that stare, he fucking hated. In any case, his story seemed to be over. His breathing had gotten heavy and choppy, and he was just glowering now.

""I killed a girl in Nawlins.""

I dropped the carafe I had been holding. It was empty, and it clattered on the floor. Not only should I call the doctor, I should call the police. I know I should have... something, Christ I know. But there was so little time, and there was something more coming. I didn't want to hear it, but I did at the same time.

His eyes had found me again, and they were yellow. Yellow and pale blue, and black. His pupils had retracted into needle points but they ran deep, so deep. The pulsing had overtaken the crown of my head and I heard a rhythmic washing. Make him stop. Let him finish.

""I met her at a restaurant where I stopped on my way back up north to Kansas City. She was a waitress. Paula. Black hair, black eyes, red red lips. She had tits like Lady Madonna. Je-sus. I've jacked it to Paula's tits almost every night for 30 years, tilln' I couldn't anymore. That's why I took them pills. Always said, 'When I can't cum, I'ma kill myself.' And I kept my word.""

He was slipping, I thought. I was actually relieved. And then he kept on.

""I had to fuck her, I knew it. I never looked like much, but I could talk up a bitch. Plus, there was money. I had the wife's check in cash plus my poker earnings. That ought to get me somewhere... lucky she was a slut. I fed her enough drinks on the sly that she ditched her tables for the night to follow me. I brought her back to the hotel and I stuck it in her before we hit the bed. No rubber or anything.""

Class act.

""Well, at some point she started to have second thoughts and tried to get up. You fuckin' kidding me? I punched her out and finished inside her. And I understood. I understood what power is.""

I felt the bile rising in the back of my throat. I'm a messed up guy I'll admit, but Rory was fucking evil. I hadn't seen that before, and I had seen some terrible things. This was a rape.

""I must have broken her nose, because there was blood everywhere. I didn't notice until after. My head was throbbing with this pulse, you know?""

I did know. My own head was churning with it. The pale blue of my scrubs was suddenly too bright. I closed my eyes. Then there was this pain in my neck, like something digging in.

It was Rory's hand. His fingers were clasped on my shoulder, but his thumb was stuck into my neck. And the pulsing. It was making me nauseous.

""She was beautiful, all broken. I just sat there looking at her until she woke up. And then, the sound. Maybe it was the nose, but I swear it sounded like that duck having its neck all twisted.""

Fuck. I knew it. I actually retched. Rory tightened his grip on my shoulder and his thumb found a new recess in my neck to probe.

""You know what life is, kid? I took that girl's head in my hands. I saw her fear and it was beautiful. Her eyes were deep and black. I held her head in my hands and I twisted with all I had. I felt everything, I heard the snapping. That's power. I was alive.""

He was going to keep talking, but he squawked instead. His grip loosened and his hand slipped off my shoulder at last. The heart monitor raised the alarm and I shook off the shock as best I could and punched the code.

The doctor said I had done alright, in that there was nothing to do. Mr. Tulane, Rory, was always going to die. I don't know why, but I didn't say anything about the story. It's not that I was worried about getting busted for slacking on the job, but it was more... secret. Like I knew something now that was mine. When she asked me about the redness on my neck, I told the doctor that I had been rubbing a spot with an ingrown hair that I needed to tweeze (good cover, I know). And that was that. Rory was dead and I was, I was... beyond the valley. I knew I wasn't alright, but I wasn't present enough to notice.

I slept that night, but it was a bad sleep. Like the sleep you get after drinking too much for too long. I was a zombie the next day, a bit like The Walking Dead but even less interesting. Today, well...

I woke up with the pulsing back in my head. I was sure that I was going to be sick, but after I chewed a couple Tylenol (a terrible habit, I know) and drank some water, it dissipated quickly. And I actually felt good. I still remembered Rory's fucked up story but it was like the volume had finally gone down on all the shit in my head. I started to think I was going to be OK.

There's a stream a bit of a way back behind the hospital. Weather permitting, I like to sneak back there on lunch break and listen to the water. It's better than listening to heart monitors. I went back there this afternoon to bask in convalescent joy. The trees blocked enough of the sun that it wasn't too hot, and what sun got through danced on the water in tantalizing, kaleidoscope fashion.

And then the quacking. It's not common, but there are ducks that turn up here from time to time. And it was wonderful, a mother and ducklings. I tore up the last bits of my sandwich bread and threw it to them. The kids went nuts, mom was just trying to keep a look out for them while they fought over the pieces.

I don't know why, but I patted the grass next to me. She looked hesitant at first, but apparently the mother duck was fairly tame because she jumped up the bank to where I had stirred up the ground, babies in tow. It was so perfect.

The little ones scattered when I grabbed their mother. There was pipping and chirping and the pulsing had returned to my head with renewed strength. The duck bit my hand so I grabbed her bill. It was beyond fucked, but I felt so strong, so powerful. I tucked her under my arm and pinned her there. I saw her eyes and they were big and black and deep. Then I took her head in my hand and twisted. I left the body there, floating in the water with the ducklings clamoring over and around it.

Before today, I hadn't so much as swatted the dog for getting in the trash. I want to stop the pulsing in my head but there's like this voice growing in me that tells me that it's power. I'm *alive*.

And that is why I can't sleep.

For 3 years, I've tried to keep a clean lab, help everyone, and have taken hours out of my week to do my assigned fabrication of metal on glass substrates needed for all 18 something grads in my group. Only recently have I started getting acknowledged in their papers. I seldom get help from them (e.g. I'm out of state and out of 18 people, no one will pick up a package for me). In the beginning, I was working 14 hours in post-processing for devices for the entire group. I didn't get to sleep because processes would end middle of the night. I was falling asleep in meetings and my advisor would tell the older students that I was stupid and lazy. Eventually his post-doc told him he was running me ragged and I got some relief. I always heard the bad comments through the grape vine. I have no publications and I see my advisor less than once a month. My second year I never saw him because of sabbatical. Every meeting he tells me how I'm too unfocused and then assigns new random experiments for me to do, ""to see what happens."" Now my advisor says that 90% of our group does bad experiments. Our recent grad said that my advisor thinks I work hard but I'm just doing random things. I've had good projects through collaborations with top nanoparticle researchers in the U.S., but my advisor was unhappy with the results so he called our collaborators idiots and cut ties immediately, even without meeting to discuss the results we were seeing. I'm now back on this project after a year and a half and it is my main focus. We no longer have the collaborators though to help so I'm doing all initial steps myself.


My main problem is I just presented (after 4 years) my preliminary exam. In it I discussed a new earth-abundant solar material I had shown to be photoconductive, I showed all my work in adapting our process for this new proprietary glass and how to bridge any gaps in performance, and I showed how to use solution processing to eliminate carbon from a nanoparticle absorber film and the change in film morphology in post-processing anneals. I also showed several of the ""random experiments"" that were inconclusive - my advisor drew a lot of conclusions from these experiments based on self-assured assumptions, and I made sure to explain why nothing was conclusive. My document was 60 pages long and only had 3/4 of the research I've done. There's a lot of failure that I left out because when things failed, we were not allowed to find out why. 


The two committee members gave me adequate marks with an overall poor - passing me but stating that some of my research assigned by my advisor is more suitable for an intern, not a PhD student, and I am doing way too many projects with no depth. I agree with this assessment but it wasn't in my control to fix it. They passed me under the condition I pick one project and approach it scientifically - no longer just trying random things. My advisor agreed and now we are to meet every week. The last committee out-of-department member met me alone on Skype. The screen-share didn't work, and she wasn't happy with the terminology I was using (which my advisor uses). She failed me, and my advisor told me she said it sounded like I don't know what I'm doing and should leave. My advisor got her to agree to a re-examination in September. I need to show that I know what I'm doing with this one project. She was in town last weekend and I emailed her requesting a meeting so we could discuss what I need to improve specifically. I received no response.

So here I am, focusing on one project with little to no guidance, my only advocate is my advisor who has been detrimental for my tenure here, and one person has fully stopped my progress. My advisor says I have one year left of funding before he cuts me out. I may have to leave with a master's after 4 years of work. I've seen people walk out of my school having done much less than I've done. Hell, developing a new material and getting it to work is a third of my successful work, and something similar is someone else's entire thesis.

I'm thinking of going to an impartial professor in our department to discuss my situation which has never happened. Usually if an advisor says it's good, it's good. I'm glad I'm getting put on a more narrow track, but I'm terrified it might end in a cliff. Has anyone been through something like this? I've been going to a therapist to deal with this, and I'm hoping that will help.

My school has a solid CS program (ranked top 20/25 according to graduate rankings). I started working in a CS professor's lab doing machine learning work starting fall of my sophomore year. I really enjoyed the experience, and am seriously considering graduate school at this point. However, I have some questions for you guys:

 - I have no interest in staying in academia. I would prefer not be a Professor. My goals after school would be to move to a major city (NYC, Boston, Seattle,etc.) and work in industry (research lab, startup, whatever). My main reasons for doing a PhD are that I can really dive deep into ML type stuff. I really don't have any interest in web dev or stuff like that, and it seems that being a PhD student allows for a lot of flexibility in choosing what things someone wants to work on. Asides from that, intellectual fulfillment is also motivator. Ultimately, I want to work on the cutting edge, and I think a PhD can help me build the skills to do so. Are these intentions/motivations sensible?

2. For current/past students, how was your experience? If you don't mind me asking- what areas are you working on, what university, how do you
feel about your decision so far, etc? What was your undergrad profile like? When did you
seriously start considering grad school?

3. How do grad admissions work? I'm assuming recommendations, research experience, and grades/GRE are the three main criteria. I have an alright GPA- 3.76, but I can get it upto a ~3.85 by application time (I had a bad semester frosh year- 3.0 flat). What about the statement of purpose? I might be able to coauthor a publication with my PI by the time I apply, how much does that help? I took a mock GRE and got a 800Q, 710Verbal, and 5 on the writing. How hard is it to get into CMU/Berkeley/MIT/Stanford?

4. Joining multiple groups: Right now, I'm in one ML group, but I am also considering joining another lab that works on database stuff. Is working for multiple groups as an undergrad advisable?

5. Summer REUs: I have an industry internship for this summer, but should I chose REUs over industry internships? I didn't really apply to any REUs, and I enjoy industry internships for the summer (9-5 can be pretty relaxing!).

6. Any advice, things you wished you did or didn't would be greatly appreciated.

I work 20-35 hours perk week, it's very flexible. When I'm in school my boss recommended I do 20 hours, however they have hinted that they can still be flexible with hours. So my question is, should I work while I'm a full-time student? For university, I take 12-16-units(3-4 courses) per quarter.




**Details:** I'm not the best student and usually I fluctuate from a 2.2 GPA to 4.0 GPA (3.0 cumulative). I want to do grad school in the future if I can maintain the academics. I also want to be able to learn at my pace to absorb the material. However, at my internship I've learned a lot, and I'm actually putting my programming to use. Occasionally there even comes up instances where school material matches up with applications I need to work on, so the learning feels better. However, there is also the case where I do feel under qualified at work, and it would be nice to better invest time in learning there technologies.

2bz6ix,2,2014-07-28,Question: Not logging hours in payroll to ensure job security,youngperson,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2bz6ix/question_not_logging_hours_in_payroll_to_ensure/,"Hey guys, thanks for reading. I'm currently a full-time intern engineer at an international manufacturing company. I love my job, my coworkers and managers are fantastic, and the pay is great. My hope is to convert this internship into permanent employment.

I usually work 40+/- hours per week, but consistently log exactly 40 hours into our payroll software, as I am required to work 40 hours minimum in my job description, and would like to get paid a full 40 hours.

Tonight I have to come into work for an hour or two after midnight (unusual, I work 8-5 typically).

I'm thinking it would be smart to not log my hours tonight, so as to not smack my employer with massive overtime. I get paid plenty as it is, and would like to ensure that there remains enough money in the project budget for me to actually have a job. I actually won't mind coming in later either.

What does everyone else think about this? Is this a good idea, or am I just cutting myself short. The end goal is just for me to have a job, I could give a shit about the money. 

Also, I should add, my supervisor hasn't asked me to come in, I just need to come in to pull a sample. The person approving my weekly hours is unaware that I'll be in late.

I know this may sound stupid; this is my first internship; but how exactly will I know what to do? It's one of my buddies bosses company so that's one of the main reasons I got it. I am willing to learn but I am pretty nervous that i'll be on the job and I will get stumped and have no idea what to do. Again this sounds stupid but will there be someone to guide me?

I recently posted in /r/engineering about struggling to find a job as a recent graduate with a biomedical engineering degree. Mostly because I lack any direct experience with medical devices or engineering in general. (I had an internship a couple years ago that wasn't related to engineering which doesn't really help me now). Anyway, during my junior year I discovered an interest in computer programming and took some computer science classes for electives during my senior year. I would officially label my degree as a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Biology/Computer Science.

Now that I've been out of college and jobless for a couple months, I've been trying to think about what I really want to do with my degree and what my goals are. I would really like to combine my interest in computer science with biology or healthcare applications. Whether that is writing software for a medical device or writing compute programs to analyze the human genome, I want to do something that contributes to society and helps people.

Seeing as it is difficult to find an entry-level position for a BME (especially in the part of the country that I live in), I've been thinking about trying to find an entry level computer science job that could help me improve upon my programming skills. The next step would then be possibly applying for graduate school where I could then go for my masters in either BME or Computer Science with an emphasis in bioinformatics or computational biology. Does this sound like the right course of action for someone in my position? Any advice from you redditors would be appreciated! Thanks!"
2bzmni,1,2014-07-28,Looking for some sage advice regarding compensation for an internship ...,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2bzmni/looking_for_some_sage_advice_regarding/,"Hi /r/webdev!

I will try to keep the details to a minimum. I am a fifth-year undergraduate student studying design and computer science. My school has a fantastic co-op program for which I've completed four out of five semester-long, full-time co-ops (or internships). For my third co-op, I was fortunate enough to land a summer internship with a top tech company in Silicon Valley. While I was initially brought on to the team as (essentially) a web designer, my skill at programming and problem solving earned me the freedom to focus almost entirely on development projects when I was invited back for the spring.

Although my team (from said tech company) would have greeted me with open arms for a third internship, I instead made the (foolish?) decision to find something entirely new that could serve as my fifth (and final) co-op. My reasoning for this was that it would allow me to maximize the variety of my professional experience(s) before graduation. My team was very understanding, and we are on excellent terms.

Here is where I could use your better judgement, Reddit ...

I go to school in the Midwest. Ohio, to be specific. I have been talking/interviewing with a few local companies that do design and development work. It has become pretty clear to me that, were I to accept a co-op position at one of these companies, I would be receiving considerably lower compensation that what I'm used to working for. This is, *of course*, no great surprise. The cost of living in the Midwest is *considerably* lower than in San Francisco. What I would like to know is whether or not you think I am being taken advantage of, or whether these opportunities may still be worth following. To put things in perspective:

* My most recent co-op (with Big Tech Company) had me earning $30/hour. My team was incredibly happy with the quality of my work, and I felt that I was contributing close to what was expected of the other members of my team. I was having a blast.
* Today I was offered a position at a local marketing/design shop to do ""a mix of UX and development"". They offered to pay $12/hour.
* Also today, I did a first interview with a local startup accelerator. While the work could be exciting, I learned upfront that they offer $1000/month stipends to interns as compensation. This equates to about $6.25/hour, and interns constitute over 60% of their dedicated staff.

It is not always easy to estimate what we ought to be worth to an employer. (This is especially true for someone like me who does not have 5+ years of industry experience under their belt). Were I to guess what would be ""fair"" compensation given my location and amount of experience/skills, somewhere between $18–22/hour *feels* right. But could this be totally unrealistic?

So my questions are:

* Could anyone share a realistic expectation for what a web development intern — with four semesters of professional experience including multiple internships with a top company in the Valley — should hope to expect from fair employers in the Midwest?
* Should I not buy in to the ""We pay our interns less because they get valuable real-life experience"" hype? The thought of eschewing pay as a priority seems silly to me when, in eight months or so, I will be looking for a real job where compensation will certainly be factored into my decision. Have I contradicted myself here?
* Should I simply write off my last co-op as ""experience"", and disregard pay? There are many around me (*cough* co-op advisor *cough*) who would tell me that compensation should never be a priority with internships, and *experience* is all that matters. But I am just not comfortable with the idea of being underpaid for honest, quality work (I believe that I bring real value to my employers, and can function with as much efficiency as most full-time hires)


If it helps, I am highly proficient in HTML, CSS, Sass, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. I have experience using frameworks like Angular and Smarty for work projects that were usually independent. I've written lots of Python and PHP to build web services/tools, and have significant academic experience with C++. The majority of my academic background is in design, so my UI/UX skills are very strong. I have a slick portfolio, which I wouldn't mind sharing to anyone who sends me a PM. I'd just like to avoid posting it here publicly if possible.

Yikes! Sorry for the wall of text. I'd REALLY appreciate any perspective on this ..."

This cert will be a 9 months study of one of the following languages c/c++, Java or C#. I have one year in the service left and they will pay up to 4500 for a certificate. I would like to take advantage of that... I have no other options besides self teaching and free online material, none of the schools around me offer CS courses... 

This is just a way for me to get some structured experience and have something to show for myself when I start my actual CS program, the knowledge will aid in creating a strong portfolio and being competitive for internships. 

 - Which language has the biggest market? The school I plan on attending after I get out teaches primarily in C/C++.

2bztvp,14,2014-07-28,"Like a bad soap opera break up, except it's my Masters thesis committee (Rant)",midnyghtchilde,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2bztvp/like_a_bad_soap_opera_break_up_except_its_my/,"Hi there, just joined, because I need to document this story and share my rant with the world as I really can't believe how this is happening.

WARNING: LONG 

Background: I'm pursuing a master's in essentially conservation policy. I have a BSci in Zoology, worked for 5 years pretending to be a chemist, and went to graduate school to return to my first love. I have finished 4 semesters of classes, and now just have to finish my thesis. I'm doing a survey of public opinions on some conservation management practices around a local nature preserve. I strove to set everything up so it would go out end of May/early June and I would not overlap with the busy season at my job (which is at a different Preserve and my dream job, which I got because I was an intern, and my boss said I couldn't leave, so I was a seasonal, and now permanent, working on conservation and education).

As a chemist, I was promoted every year, have a patent, and a few awards for my work. My bosses loved my independence and strong scientific ethics. So I have independent research experience - I ran my own projects, ran the lab instruments, and wrote 100+ page reports on a bimonthly basis for customers.

So I tell you this background, so that I can tell you my thesis horror/drama story.

Flashback: 1 month ago!
Committee Member X is from the Organization around which my survey centers. He's not the chair, my School Program Director Z is, but Z told me to just work with X because this isn't Z's expertise and since its about their organization, he should lead. So I have. X is habitually slow - at least 2 weeks and often 1-2 MONTHS to reply to things I've asked. In March I asked about switching from an in-person to a mailed survey, and if the Organization could help - he said no problem! Well after a few months, it turns out that it IS a HUGE problem, and he never asked anyone about it, he just said yes.

So after my mistakenly contacting another staffer at the organization, X emails me and says ""call me Monday or Tuesday""...well I am working in a rural area without cell service and super busy. I email, saying as much, but I'll try to call on Tuesday. I do, and no answer. Thus begins a week of leaving of voicemails and emails attempting to get ahold of X, getting more frustrated because my super busy season at work starts in a few days and I really can't deal with thesis drama now.

At the end of a week of radio silence, X finally emails and says he is quitting the committee as he doesn't have time. Queue stunned silence and an at-home meltdown by me. I recover, contact Z and the second in charge of my program, and ask for help. Z and I talk, I fill him in, as i have no idea why X is quitting. Z says he'll back my decisions, there is funding available to help, and we'll get it done. 

We start thinking of new committee members, and Z says he will call X's boss, who I know and have talked with recently, and ask him to step in. Boss says he can't, then apparently has a talk with X, who them emails me and says he'll stay on the committee because it doesn't make sense for another staff member at the organization to do it. we are now 2 weeks from the initial ""call me"" email, and a week after X's temper tantrum quitting.

I talked to Z and said I didn't think I want X back, I'm moving on, we're finding a new place to support the work, and he's been a problem from the get go. X has also, on two occasions, demeaned my work, implying it is not independent enough nor enough work to merit a masters, though no one else agrees with him, and insulted my abilities as a scientist. Z called X ""childish"" and said he has a reputation for being tough to work with. I waited a week to think it over before emailing X and telling him it was OK, since his organization can't help with the mailing anymore I'm moving on, and thanking him for his time. He replied good luck with my work.

Come today I have an email from Z, saying that X is going to call him to ""discuss"" my thesis and wanting to stay on the committee. Z still supports my decision either way, and offered only a token reason for X to remain on it. I told Z more bluntly that I'm tired of delays and my scientific ability being questioned and insulted, and that as X's peer (which I am in my job at my organization!) in conservation, I'm embarrassed by this entire debacle. I did say that if X wants to call me on MY time to talk, I'm open to it.

I'm now waiting to see what they discussed and if I get any contact from X. Unless I get an apology for the tantrum I'm not budging, and I don't expect one.

TL;DR: Thesis committee member has temper tantrum and quits, committee chair attempts to get members boss to step in on the committee, member obviously gets a talking to and offers to stay but I don't want him and his trouble back. Then like a bad break up, member goes to committee chair and tries to talk him letting him back after I told him. Chair supports me! 

Shorter TL;DR: thesis committee member breaks #1 rule: don't be a dick, turns committee into soap opera!

2c05hj,0,2014-07-28,Our university counselor insisted I keep a log of my feelings (Part Two),NoSleep4Malcom,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2c05hj/our_university_counselor_insisted_i_keep_a_log_of/,"Excuse any sloppiness with this post, I just got back from Nicole's and I'm still a little buzzed. I couldn't wait though; I've uncovered some shit that needs to be shared. Things are getting strange, guys. I'm pretty sure what happened to Anna wasn't an accident.

Firstly, if you missed yesterday's submission here's a link to get you caught up: [Day One](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2bwep9/our_school_counselor_insisted_i_keep_a_log_of_my/)

Okay, let's start. After writing last night's post I finished up the rest of my homework, which took a good hour and a half mind you, and then tried to sleep. Last night was the first time I lay down with some degree of normalcy - if you'll remember I spent the better part of Saturday night cradling the toilet as a pillow - and thus it was the first time I tried to sleep while dealing with Anna's death. I don't know how many of you have witnessed death before, but it's a horrible sickness. It's like an insatiable hunger that eats at your very being, destroying even the thought of rest. Whenever I close my eyes I'd see her limp body falling torturously slowly but impossibly fast, hell, I don't think I'll ever erase that image from my mind. It'll be there forever. It took me hours to even get close to sleep. And even when I was *asleep*, I wasn't really. I hung between consciousness and darkness in an unsteady seesaw. Sleep was too permanent; it scared me. I wasn't confident enough to release myself. So after about a half-hour of doing my quasi-meditation monk-rest shit, I decided to go to the bathroom, not really to go, just to *do* something.

My feet slipped out of the cold coffin that I had been trying to sleep in. Our room was so cold nowadays. I swear whenever I breathe out my mouth smoke comes out. I didn't want to flick on the light - I'd wake up Benny - so I stumbled over backpacks and notebooks, propped open the heavy wooden door, and slipped through the crack I had created. 

The light was on in the hallway; a layer of grime and muck - casualties of the war insects waged with the bulb - covered it, painting the white stone walls a nasty greyish yellow. I hovered outside my door for a second, letting it close as gently as possible. A soft thump echoed through the hallway and then there was silence. A cleaner light was spilling in from my left. One of my dumb-ass suite-mates had left the door open. I hate the door being left open for three reasons: One, at night and in the winter, it gets fucking freezing in the hallway; leaving the shower from the bathroom becomes the equivalent of hiking through the Siberian wilderness completely nude; Two, it lets bugs in, huge nasty bugs, dangerous stinging bugs, creepy spidery bugs, annoying buzzing bugs; they're all terrible; and Three, if a dangerous axe-murderer ever so happened to get past our high-security (key cards) into our dorm, we're practically inviting him in. I decided I would shut it after I had my piss. My feet still sore from the collisions with school-supplies, I hobbled over to the bathroom door. In one swift, majestic movement I turned the doorknob and rammed about half of my weight into the door. It was like a cartoon, I completely rebounded and nearly fell over. I must have scared the living shit out of whoever was on the toilet.

""You scared the living shit out of me!"" It was Benny's faint voice that came from the toilet.

""Good. So you're finished?"" I retorted as I steadied myself and stood up, speaking in that kinda of scream whisper that you think is quiet but really isn't.

""I'll be out in a minute fuck-head."" 

*Fuck-head*, now that was a new one. I have to remember to give Benny shit for that next time I see him. Anyway, since the bathroom was now in use, I decided I might as well close the suite door.

My socks whispered as they slid across the wooden floor. I moved with a measured softness, attempting to return the suite back to a state of silence. The light projected my shadows against the yellowed walls, presenting a clumsy drama of darkness for an empty audience. God, I should have just slammed that door right then and been done with it, but something...indescribable drew me outside. I couldn't take my eyes away from the spot where she fell. The smoke still wrapped itself around the iron bars. It was such a terrible place. Every time I walk by I shiver. It's a tainted place, corrupted. I was hypnotized; my eyes were locked on that spot in space. I could feel death's pressing down on me with its awesome force. I felt it watching me. I was trapped. 

Then I heard that awful noise. The hairs on the back of my neck are pushed by the pumping air conditioning as I'm writing this. It was a booming, commanding tone; it insinuated itself into my body with the authority of a god. The noise was solid, I felt it press up against me, well up within me, push me and pull me, tear me apart. My mind became non-existent; I existed totally in the sound. I was complete. It eclipsed my seemingly minute existence. I was nothing. I was paralyzed in a blissful horror; my heart ached as the behemoth bellowed, as it cursed its captors, as it seduced its lovers. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. I wanted to turn my head to gaze upon my beauty, but I feared I would go blind. It resurrected the secret chord, embodied the perfect harmony. Captivation had taken its hold on me, wrapped its spiny fingers around my body, constricting my lungs-

And it was gone. I thought it was over. 

Then I heard the sirens. 

I don't know if it was a police car, or a fire truck or an ambulance, but that didn't really matter. I always thought sirens were creepy when you heard them under normal circumstances. They were tied so closely to death. But the sirens I heard were...warped. It was as if some had grabbed the waves of sound right out of the air, stretched them out, and held on as the inched their way towards me. The slowed down sound grew louder and louder, a cacophonous crescendo, the all-encompassing waves were closing in, I was petrified.

""...Mal?""

It was silent now. I turned around to see Benny's wide eyes focused on me. ""Thought I'd get some air."" I managed, though he didn't look convinced. ""Somebody left the door open again."" 

""Oh. Ha-ha. Bet it was Eric. I can totally beat him up if you want me to."" Benny knew something was up but he didn't push it. He went to sleep and a few minutes later, I followed him.

So now it was Monday morning - today. I woke up at 9:30 as per usual, and got ready in fifteen minutes flat; I'm the last one to leave in the morning so I have the bathroom all to myself. After throwing on a pair of dress shorts and a ""way too expensive to be a plain navy blue"" t-shirt I headed out the room. There was a new addition to our suite. A hastily scribbled upon piece of paper clung to our door, detailing every one to ""kindly fucking close the door"". Classic Benny.

My first class was Organic Chemistry, a total drag and a terrible way to start off the day. I have the absolute worst professor. He is unintelligible, stupid and plain terrible. At first I'd thought I just disliked him. But this dislike grew and grew I don't know if it was because I was missing sleep or because I had skipped breakfast, but I broke through to a whole new level of hatred today.

God he was disgusting, with his stupid fucking hook nose that was about a hundred times too large for his fucking body. And his beady little eyes that scanned the students, probably getting perverse pleasure out of our boredom (and checking out the cute girls that little skeev). He had terrible skin, acne breakouts all over his face. What was he a teenager? With his shitty, patchy beard. And don't forget his hair with grease and oil clinging to every strand. The fact that it was thinning all around brought me joy. I'm sure he smelled terrible, but I never got close enough to tell. He looked like he smelled terrible. Like a pile of rotten meat left out in the sun. The only purpose of his existence was to wrought misery. When he sat down in his chair - which he often did cause he was a fatass - his layers of bubbly cellulite would hang over the edge. God...I wanted nothing more than to smack his head into his desk. To slip the tip of a pencil through an eyeball, like slipping a knife into jelly.

Andrew is in my class and he actually likes him. I'm thinking about it now, and, he's not horrible. But today...today was different, I don't know. I'm going to say Anna's death fucked me up more than I realized. I'm sure Mrs. Keira will have an explanation.

Anyway after Organic, I have Violin lessons. Lessons are mandatory for students in Orchestra. They kinda suck but I don't mind too much when I practice with my quartet. There's this cute girl, Jess. She's a stunning blonde, always wearing those thick hipster glasses. And, she has amazing fashion sense, like top of the top best dressed. It's hard to believe, but she plays the bass! And she's damn good too. We've kinda been flirting back-and-forth, but in the 'I'm too much of a pussy to do anything' sort of way. And she's so nice. I'm not going to lie to you guys, wife material. Oh and as for why I'm in Orchestra. Chem/Music double major. It's a lot of work but, to me, it's worth it. I absolutely am in love with the violin - I couldn't give it up - and, as much as I complain about Chemistry, I actually do really find it fascinating.

After violin we have our suite lunch. Mondays are nice because somehow all the stars aligned to give everyone in my suite a free period around lunchtime. Eric and Benny both just come out of classes, and Andrew comes from his internship at our university hospital, so we can spend an entire hour acting weird, messing with each other and eating almost average cafeteria food. 

The rest of the day isn't really important, just a couple of classes and studying. Nothing really to note, until a couple of hours ago. 

I've known Nicole for a long time and I knew she was hurting. Anna was just a friend to me; I can't imagine how traumatic her death was for Nicole. I hadn't seen or texted her since our run-in at the counselors office and I felt bad about it. She needed a shoulder to lean on and I wasn't sure if she had one. Plus we were both grieving, it would be easier - if that's even possible - to talk to her about the death then anyone else. I shot her a text asking if she wanted to hang out and talk. I got a reply almost immediately saying she did. And so, I grabbed the fifth of rum I had been holding onto for a special occasion and headed over.

The first thing that struck me about their room was the duality of it. Carefully aligned pictures of friends and families, and perfectly grungy posters were the only thing on the wall of the right side. A bed adorned in extravagant pillows and a fanciful comforter was pushed against the wall facing a clearly organized desk. But the left side of the room...holy shit. Sheets of paper coated the wall so thickly that you couldn't even make out the color of the paint. And each of those pieces of paper was covered in the craziest sketches I had ever seen. There were portraits, with their features over-exaggerated, heads oblong and eyes scratched out. Wild patterns and shapes covered most of the remaining wall. The strangest drawings also happened to be the centerpiece of Anna's wall of madness. It was on a large scrap of construction paper; a detailed landscape stretched out into infinity, in the background there was a tree and you could just make out the figure of a person hanging. I tried not to look surprised when I stepped inside but that was pretty fucking hard. Anna had always drawn but never like this.

I managed a smile when I saw her; she was well dressed, so that was a good sign. ""Hey Nicole."" I pulled out the cheap plastic container I had stuffed in my backpack, ""I brought your favorite."" I sloshed the amber liquid around in its container, and coaxed a smile out of her.

""Good god, with all this talking planned we could use a throat loosener."" As soon as I set my bag down, she wrapped her arms around me in a tight embrace. She felt cold. The alcohol would help with that. ""But on a Monday night? We have class tomorrow. That's kinda sad.""

""Yeah but come on. It's the second week, we aren't really doing anything."" She didn't look sure. ""Come onnn Nicole. It'll be like high-school all over again."" I convinced her with that, after all, who turns down drinking with a old high-school friend? She pulled out two cups, I poured the liquid into them and we both sat down on her bed.

""So how are you doing?"" I sipped a meager portion of my drink, my eyes never leaving hers. So it began, the awkward tango around the subject of interest. How long would this last? Who would break the-

""I need to talk to you about Anna."" She must have seen the surprise in my face, because she quickly added, ""I need to talk to *someone* about Anna. Everyone else just dances around the subject, too scared to say anything. But you knew her, and we're close Mal, no matter how much we joke of how we aren't."" I simply nodded. ""You see this-"" she motioned to the wall, ""Anna did all of these in a week. They're beautiful, but how she drew them- I just don't know. Whenever she would draw she would like enter a trance. Nothing could disturb her; she remained just functional enough to dissuade any interest or conversation. I feel like that's *all* she did this first week. She was acting strange from the moment I saw her Mal. Every once and a while I'd catch glimpses of the outgoing girl we all loved, but they were rare. I'm trying to piece it together but nothing makes any sense.""

""I know, I know.""

""...And there's something else."" Nicole slipped off the bed. Reaching under Anna's old pillow, she pulled out a blue double-ring notebook. It looked fairly new, as if she had bought it for the current school year. ""I found it earlier today, it's just, I can't explain it. You need to see."" She handed it to me and, nervously, I flicked over the title page. Going through the notebook took a long time. As I went through the book, we were mostly quiet; taking sips of our drink every now and then.

There were no pictures in this notebook, only words. So many words, decorating every page in a sharp script. I don't remember everything in the journal, but a few excerpts stood out to me:

There was a bible verse, which struck me as strange because Anna was not religious *at all*.

**Revelation 1:7** *Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.*

It was repeated over and over again, in various different calligraphies and styles but that same fucking verse. But that's not all there was. No, what the whole journal was centered around was the lyrics of a song. You know ""I'll Be Seeing You"" by Billie Holiday? Nicole later told me that Anna would constantly play that song, though she couldn't find the version that she would play on youtube or anywhere.

*I'll be seeing you*

*In all the old familiar places*

*That this heart of mine embraces*

*All day and through*

*In that small cafe*

*The park across the way*

*The children's carousel*

*The chestnut trees, the wishing well*

*I'll be seeing you*

*In every lovely summer's day*

*In everything that's light and gay*

*I'll always think of you that way*

*I'll find you in the morning sun*

*And when the night is new*

*I'll be looking at the moon*

*But I'll be seeing you*

*I'll be seeing you*

*In every lovely summer's day*

*In everything that's light and gay*

*I'll always think of you that way*

*I'll find you in the morning sun*

*And when the night is new*

*I'll be looking at the moon*

*But I'll be seeing you*

The page that the song was written down on was covered in scratchy writing. It took me a little while to decipher but they read, ""They made me blind"" and ""I've lost myself in the woods, who am I"". It was terrible to see those words haphazardly scratched into the paper, bleeding the parchment in black ink.


*THEY TRAPPED ME*

*I'M DROWNING*

*THEY TRAPPED ME*

*HELP ME*


I shut the book. Nicole looked as scared as I felt. ""What the fuck?""

""She wasn't herself. Something or someone was controlling her. Mal I'm terrified."" Nicole took the book from me and slipped it back under Anna's pillowcase.

""Was Anna with anyone strange recently? Who is the *they* she keeps talking about?""

""I don't know. I don't understand any of this shit.""

I gave Nicole a quick squeeze - she looked like she needed it - then let her go. ""We're going to get to the bottom of this. I promise you. Now you said she had been spending a lot of time in the campus gardens right? We'll check it out tomorrow. I promise you we'll figure this shit out. Anna deserves us to.""

After a few minutes of reassurances I left and came right back here.

This is so fucked up. I'm not even sure what to do. I only mentioned the gardens because Nicole needed some direction; I doubt we'll find anything there. The most frustrating thing is, I don't even know what to do. And who the fuck is *they*. No, I've decided. Anna definitely didn't take her own life on purpose. Some sick fuck was behind this. Maybe they used drugs or hypnosis or whatever. But I'm going to find them."
2c06mh,2,2014-07-28,Unconventional Applicant for a CS MS Program; Advice Appreciated,Cambienta,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2c06mh/unconventional_applicant_for_a_cs_ms_program/,"I'm a student who's currently studying computer science post-bacc. My undergraduate degree is from CalArts in Character Animation (a well-respected school for that subject; don't know if anyone here would have heard of it). While at CalArts I became pretty interested in CS, and would like to go into tools/software development/research related to computer graphics (requiring a CS education). My fourth-year project at CalArts was done in CG. 

I'll be applying this fall, 2014.


To list my qualifications thus far:

-I graduated in May of 2013 and for the past year have been commuting between 5 different schools to grab all the classes I would need to apply to a master's program (more than 200 miles per week, which is kind of absurd). Right now my CS GPA is a 3.7, overall since graduating GPA is a 3.55 (CalArts is too artsy for GPAs, apparently, but I tried converting our fake grades into real ones and it was a 3.3/3.4-- I don't know how seriously anyone would take art school grades, though). I'm currently taking Design and Analysis of Algorithms at UCI. 

-I have lite work experience in the animation industry (mostly freelance jobs done while an undergrad, and internships at studios in Burbank). 

-I have had two CS professors offer to write me letters of recommendation thus far (so I need one more), and think they would write me ""good"" recommendations based off of what they have told me (one of these professors wrote me a recommendation for something already, and it was very positive; I got kind of teary-eyed about it, because I'm a sap). 

-I don't know if this is worth anything, but I placed second at a hackathon...?

(I haven't taken the GRE yet-- I'm planning to take it in September. I scored a 2160 on my SAT, mentioned in case it can give you any idea of how I might do on the GRE). 

I'm most interested in attending an MS program with a thesis track (which seems to be most of them), and am very interested in the development of simulation systems (fabric and fluids), and topology-related problems. 

That said, I have two questions:

1) I have no idea which schools I'm qualified to even dare apply to. Right now my top choice is UC Irvine, and I wasn't planning to apply to any schools ranked above that one (Irvine is 29, if I remember correctly). Should I apply to higher-ranked schools as well? Should I forego Irvine and only apply to schools ranked lower? Some of my friends are trying to convince me to apply to a few schools ranked between 10-20, but I'm nervous to consider it because I don't want to waste anyone's time (if that makes sense). 

2) I've heard really conflicting things on whether to send college-level coursework done while in high school. Does anyone know anything about this? I've had quite a few people tell me not to send any stuff from before graduating high school, which would be welcome news. I went to a ""middle college"" type program (I really wanted to ""broaden my horizons""--I was such a cliche--before going to art school), where we took a bunch of dual enrollment classes, and I think my performance falls into the category of ""mistakes you made when you were 16-years-old"".

I am a recent college graduate with a BAS in philosophy and psychology. I held a customer service position during school that led to two eventual promotions, a lead and a supervisor position (both which I worked until I graduated). I've been reading around this subreddit and it seems like once you get up there in your career as a software developer, you program less and your main role is making sure projects get done, effectively and efficiently. 

I wouldn't take back my degree in philosophy, as it was pretty much a major for me. But if I could go back, I would have done computer science instead of psychology. Since graduating, I have taught myself Javascript, jQuery, php, python, c and c++ (well, at least the basics and syntax of each via codecademy and lynda.com). 

Long story short, I am a little lost trying to find my career path. My dream career now is to be a computer scientist, I want to play my part in whichever team would have me to finding solutions to complex problems. The problem is, I don't really have a guide to show me how to do it at this point. I've seen some suggestions about going  back to get a second bachelor's, but there are a limited number of schools that have such a program for cs. I also saw some posts about getting a masters but I don't know if that would benefit me, I don't know how strong my cs foundation is as it hasn't been tested in an 'institutional setting'. 

So any advice would help. I've been looking into finding junior developer internships. Even if I did have to go back to school,  I wouldn't mind. But I would probably do an internship and/or job that is in the career field this time around. Thoughts and suggestions much appreciated! Thanks!"

[I originally posted this on /r/webdev, but I'm looking for more feedback. Please let me know if you think this is a violation of reddiquette]

I will try to keep the details to a minimum. I am a fifth-year undergraduate student studying design and computer science. My school has a fantastic co-op program for which I've completed four out of five semester-long, full-time co-ops (or internships). For my third co-op, I was fortunate enough to land a summer internship with a top tech company in Silicon Valley. While I was initially brought on to the team as (essentially) a web designer, my skill at programming and problem solving earned me the freedom to focus almost entirely on development projects when I was invited back for the spring.

Although my team (from said tech company) would have greeted me with open arms for a third internship, I instead made the (foolish?) decision to find something entirely new that could serve as my fifth (and final) co-op. My reasoning for this was that it would allow me to maximize the variety of my professional experience(s) before graduation. My team was very understanding, and we are on excellent terms.

Here is where I could use your better judgement, Reddit ...

I go to school in the Midwest. Ohio, to be specific. I have been talking/interviewing with a few local companies that do design and development work. It has become pretty clear to me that, were I to accept a co-op position at one of these companies, I would be receiving considerably lower compensation that what I'm used to working for. This is, *of course*, no great surprise. The cost of living in the Midwest is *considerably* lower than in San Francisco. What I would like to know is whether or not you think I am being taken advantage of, or whether these opportunities may still be worth following. To put things in perspective:

* My most recent co-op (with Big Tech Company) had me earning $30/hour. My team was incredibly happy with the quality of my work, and I felt that I was contributing close to what was expected of the other members of my team. I was having a blast.

* Today I was offered a position at a local marketing/design shop to do ""a mix of UX and development"". They offered to pay $12/hour.

* Also today, I did a first interview with a local startup accelerator. While the work could be exciting, I learned upfront that they offer $1000/month stipends to interns as compensation. This equates to about $6.25/hour, and interns constitute over 60% of their dedicated staff.

It is not always easy to estimate what we ought to be worth to an employer. (This is especially true for someone like me who does not have 5+ years of industry experience under their belt). Were I to guess what would be ""fair"" compensation given my location and amount of experience/skills, somewhere between $18–22/hour *feels* right. But could this be totally unrealistic?

So my questions are:

* Could anyone share a realistic expectation for what a development intern — with four semesters of professional experience including multiple internships with a top company in the Valley — should hope to expect from fair employers in the Midwest?
* Should I not buy in to the ""We pay our interns less because they get valuable real-life experience"" hype? The thought of eschewing pay as a priority seems silly to me when, in eight months or so, I will be looking for a real job where compensation will certainly be factored into my decision. Have I contradicted myself here?
* Should I simply write off my last co-op as ""experience"", and disregard pay? There are many around me (*cough* co-op advisor *cough*) who would tell me that compensation should never be a priority with internships, and *experience* is all that matters. But I am just *not* comfortable with the idea of being underpaid for honest, quality work (I believe that I bring real value to my employers, and can function with as much efficiency as most full-time hires)

If it helps, I am highly proficient in HTML, CSS, Sass, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. I have experience using frameworks like Angular and Smarty for work projects that were usually independent. I've written lots of Python and PHP to build web services/tools, and have significant academic experience with C++. I am quite comfortable using Git/SVN, and I've picked up a bit of Bower/Grunt for my personal projects. The majority of my academic background is in design, so my UI/UX skills are very strong. I have a slick portfolio, which I wouldn't mind sharing to anyone who sends me a PM. I'd just like to avoid posting it here publicly if possible.

I'd REALLY appreciate your perspective(s) on this. Thanks!"
2c22qx,219,2014-07-29,I'm a lazy A-Type,DeathIsBeckoning,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2c22qx/im_a_lazy_atype/,"So dear readers I bring you another tale of my IT internship. 

This one is concerning a stereotypical type-A personality who knows nothing of the ""'puter"" and consistently a thorn in our side. A month or so into my internship, the warnings given during my nickel tour start to make sense. This particular warning was: ""She is a VP ($BVP), but an idiot; immediately escalates, bi*chy, mean, and complains when whatever takes longer than 30 seconds to complete. BE AWARE."" I think to myself, mmmkay... and go about my day(looking over my shoulder in her direction). 

Not today however. Today we get a ticket to resolve a printer issue on ""her"" laptop, and it needs to be fixed ""NOW! I have a (power point) presentation in 2 hours!"" 

O.K. fine, already off to a good start, lets just knock this out, and make her happy for once (maybe?). 

I head over to her office, and notice a sickly caramel smell of some perfumy candle burning that is emanating from her office (open flames not allowed, but she apparently has a special need to put all of us at risk). Her office is a visually moody, dimly lit, and the dark cherry decor was tastefully done; soft white noise is playing on the personal CD player to complete the feel. She had created a ""zen"" zone and it was actually pretty cool (I would have done the same thing had I had the chance to do so, sans the nasty candle). Given her demeanor and attitude towards anyone other than herself (and upper management), she really needed it. 

So back to the issue at hand. I walk in: 

&gt;$Death: Hi $BVP, I'm $Death from the desktop team, you submitted a ticket for a printer issue?

&gt;$BVP: Goddamnit it took you long enough!

I'll skip the rest of the back and forth, but within 5 minutes of the ticket being created I was there, you get the jist.

&gt;$Death: O.K. so lets test this out and see what it does &lt;-print-&gt;

Off in the distance I hear the networked printer kick off a job. I walk to the printer, grab the top stapled job from the stack, confirm it was what I just printed.

&gt;$Death: So $BVP, it seems to be printing fine, what was the specific issue that you getting? I'm a little confused.

&gt;$BVP: No one brought me the printout, I thought it wasn't printing.

What? Did... What?

&gt;$Death: O.K. let me go check something real quick, I'll be right back.

No way. She can't be this bad... can she?
I head back over to the printer and confirm my theory... there were approximately 10+ copies of the same .ppt in the stack; spaced in between other print jobs.

Ha, wow.

I collect the copies, and bring them back to her.

&gt;$BVR: Just put them over there.

&gt;$Death: Sure, are you all set?

20 seconds of awkward silence whilst she flips through the .ppt printout in her hand.

&gt;$BVR: Yes.

TL;DR: Keep printing copies until someone brings one to me. No one brought it? Create a ticket."

I realized 3 years ago I made a mistake graduating in this field, as I wasn't really that passionate about it, but went to grad school anyway....which turned out to be another mistake. I strongly dislike my grad work and am just going through the motions at this point. 

I've always liked computers, and I've always wanted to be able to program. I absolutely love the notion of of being able to...well, ""create"". I've spent a few hours learning just the basics of coding and I really want more. My passion has always been with computers, hardware, software....just everything about it. I still don't know why I didn't switch majors during my undergraduate years. 

Now, though, I'm hesitant. I'm 27 years old. If I go back for a CS degree, it would take about 2 - 2.5 years. And, even if I practice coding on a consistent basis during that time, I'm still going to be a new, inexperienced programmer by the time I get a degree. 

I'm passionate about this stuff, and feel very strongly that this is what I want to do, but I'm worried that I'm too old to ever be a successful software engineer...especially when I see these high school kids getting coding internships at places like Facebook and Google.

I'm currently attending the University of Washington in Seattle. I'm studying something unrelated to computer science, as I discovered my interest in programming kind of late into college. I am likely graduating in June 2015, and I don't have any intern experience yet. I've taken 4 comp sci/programming courses and am planning on at least taking 4-5 more (the important ones that are offered here, like data structures/algorithms, algorithms &amp; their complexity, intermediate programming concepts, etc) before I graduate while self-teaching. I also am looking into doing on-campus undergraduate research with the CSE department here.

I'd like to work as a SDE post-graduation, but I know that I'm kind of working on a time constraint, which is now until I graduate, or 1 year. I know that I have to learn as much as possible during that time-frame. So that is a gist of my situation, and realistically, I see myself interning after graduation because I don't think I will enough experience by graduation in order to get a full-time job.

So I wanted to ask you guys and see how common it is to be an intern after having completed a degree and wanted to hear people's experiences, or anything you guys think would be helpful for me to hear!

Thanks!"

The position starts later this month but requires a background check. I have all the information required except for some information about a ""police record.""

The question states: Have you ever been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you?

I'm unsure how to answer this question. Three years ago (I was 19 at the time) some ""friends"" and I snuck onto an abandoned farm in my area to check it out, we had become obsessed with seeing ""spooky"" and ""abandoned"" places after stumbling across some cool photos on reddit and similar sites. Unfortunately we were caught and each issued tickets, we had to appear in court the next day and pay the fine and that was that.

I've regretted the incident ever since and recognize how much of a jackass I was to sneak onto private property - I since have an irrational fear of police officers and have very low self worth (this was something I already had). I don't much talk to the ""friends"" that I was with that night.

What I'm looking for advice on is, how do I answer this question? Is this even a criminal conviction? There wasn't a jury or anything like you see on TV, I literally went to court, got told what I did wrong, paid my fine and left. I've asked people like my parents if its something I should report and they laughed at me saying they did wreckless stuff in their childhood/teenage years and that this wasn't worth reporting.

From what I understand about the incident, I am led to believe that this is a disorderly persons citation but I still am not sure. Previous job applications (internships) only ask for felonies (which I know this is not) so it is usually not applicable.

Should I call the court/legal office in that town to find out? Any advice would be appreciated."

Fresh out of college, I would have been the classic PFY if I hadn't Accutane'd the hell out of the pimples years before. Technically I started as an intern, but it was a well paid internship followed by a series of generous short contracts.

I knew they were into printing, but that did not prepare me for the printer to worker ratio that stunned me as I walked in there. There was a formal 'print room' with a couple of the most expensive super office printers I'd ever heard of at the time. These two had all the features necessary to print legal tender and were not commercially available. There were the regular kind of printer pretty much everywhere there was a corner to put one around the floor, and yet every secretary had their own in their offices, too, and half the staff were secretaries. This wasn't a place with cubicles. All offices and boardrooms. Even the maintenance closet doubled as a relatively nice office.

It didn't stop with the printers. Everyone had everything. The latest gadgets for everyone above janitor. Second day my boss gives me an Expenses account explaining that I'll have to regularly purchase new things as I get orders handed down. 

&gt; /u/bytewave: ""Okay, I need to understand better how things work here. Why so many printers? Why are we ordering so many laptops and licenses just for this floor?""

&gt; My First Boss: ""Like we talked about in the interview, this is HQ and it has a unique culture. Anything that gets paper approved by any of the 12 Veeps or the President's secretary does not get disputed, we order it, we set it up nicely, we sync it when they can't. Each of them will be making sure their secretari(es) have all the same toys as the others. You'll be mostly migrating boxes for now, but if you get a paper order or email for any equipment, you put it in right away. By the way, always knock before entering a room with a closed door and wait to enter.""  

Oh yeah, migrating boxes... that's why they needed me to help out initially. Who the hell migrates all corporate boxes to a new version of Windows before SP1 is out? These guys. I've cloned more installs of Windows 2000 than I care to remember. They averaged 3 computers per head given the mountain of laptops. 

&gt; /u/bytewave: ""Instructions received, but I'm still fuzzy on the why on earth would they need all this?""  

&gt; My First Boss: ""It's not about need. There are some turf wars you won't want to get involved in. You'll see justifications like 'confidential work, cannot be printed on general printers', sometimes none. They don't matter, just remember, immediately order anything if it's from a Veep or the President's secretary as long as you get a paper trail and log everything. Aside from that, anytime anyone here calls you, stop cloning and go sync their PDA, unjam their printer or whatever. Keep the pager on you, keep the server room locked tight, be on time, dress like this, and carefully ignore whatever isn't tech related going on around here and you'll do great. Any questions, come to me or call.""

I soon understood what he meant. I have no point of comparison, this being the only time I worked in a corporate headquarters, but it was all turf wars and appearances, which were greatly valued over effectiveness. They'd routinely order equipment they'd never use just because one VP had authorized it for her secretary and now they all wanted one and they all got one. That was what had caused the explosion in printers; having your 'private' printer locked in your office was a status symbol of sorts. There was a lady whose' job was to ensure the huge 'office supplies' room was stocked up with everything imaginable and the cafeteria always full of everything, anyone could take anything they wanted, nobody cared if you took supplies home, she'd restock. No time for breakfast before work? Fresh muffins, fruits and such all the time. There were open fridges and damn good coffee. There were a few other perks, I'll save the best for another story.

The dress code and the level of chic was out of this world. They had a professional designer who came in biweekly to make sure everything was up to snuff, and she had a thing for pricey art and random furniture upgrades. Almost everyone had an official title so inflated that made it difficult to quickly understand the formal and informal hierarchies. The secretaries almost all looked like models, and there was a reason I was told to always knock before entering rooms. Rooms had names. 'Guttenberg Room', 'MacKenzie Suite', stuff like that. The President had a condo that he never used that was built as an extension of the floor, 1400 square feet of top-value skyrise office space lost, in case he ever felt like spending the night. Access was tightly regulated, I only went in once in over two years, but I could tell millions were spent on it. There was champagne and truffles on the clock every time they brought something out, which was all the time, they had come into money for a series of acquisitions. Meanwhile I kept hearing that in factories and floors they owned everywhere the conditions were terrible and staff retention was a big issue. But from the 39th floor in that tower, everyone was a kid in an open-bar candy store. 

I came to understand I got the job largely because I looked sharper, sounded more educated and dressed better than the others for the interview. They assumed we could all do the technical work given the degrees, which was a dangerous assumption given I learned on the job half the things I had to do. At least, I did learn a ton there. I had a very colorful coworker who was admittedly a good teacher in retrospect. Having to support such a mishmash of constantly rolling luxury hardware with no standardization process whatsoever was.. interesting. And the only thing I could really say 'no' to was 'please open the server room's door'. ""I want admin on this laptop""? ... ""Yes, ma'am"". And then I'd be removing comet cursor the following week.

We all have to start somewhere. I could definitely have done a lot worse, at least I had a taste of corporate luxury.

Quick background: This summer, I got an internship at the county Superior Court, doing anything I was told to do within reason (opening mail, refilling printer paper, processing traffic tickets, running case files between courtrooms, etc). Despite my best efforts, I ended up as the computer guy after resolving an Excel issue, and got called whenever someone had a problem.


Most of the time, people called for simple things, like the keyboard number pad turned off, or the mainframe client crashing, or the default printer set to Microsoft XPS. Simple things that took less than a minute to fix. I joked occasionally with the actual IT person assigned to the courthouse (named RealIT for this story) that nobody knew how computers work here, but it was painfully accurate. The upside is that he never had any actual work during the summer except for Windows Update and hardware replacements. 


One day, I'm preparing the calendar in a courtroom, and the clerk calls me over, asking me to fix her printer. No problem. I walk around the desk and open the print que. Nothing. I remember they use some {large corporation} print software I can't access because I'm not IT. I tell her that she is going to have to let it print out, and just keep re-feeding the printer, thinking she printed it three or four times. 


One hour later, the printer is still printing. This isn't good. I go knock on RealIT's door. No answer. Someone walks by and mentions to me, ""RealIT is out until Thursday."" Great. I walk back and tell the clerk to call the help-desk, which she does. I tell her to tell them she needs them to clear her print queue, which they start doing. Then I hear the clerk gasp. She calls me back over, and whispers, ""7023. 7023 documents in the queue."" Apparently, there is a bug in the print software, where the document will be sent to the printer a couple of times a second until the software gets a response. I don't understand who thought this was a good idea, but some programmer thought it would prevent lost documents, I guess. Printers were almost never offline, so nobody had seen this before. It gets worse, though. This wasn't a one page document being printer thousands of times. It was the judge note sheets for the cases tomorrow. All 37 of them. Some quick math in my head gave me somewhere around a quarter of a million sheets of paper. No printer can continuously print 259,851 pages. This printer would have melted. This printer would have caught fire.

2c403j,0,2014-07-29,Am I in any position to negotiate my salary as an intern?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2c403j/am_i_in_any_position_to_negotiate_my_salary_as_an/,"I am interning at a financial company, and I have been for the past year or so. I am a college student studying business.

I have many reasons to believe that my salary is considerably less than interns earn on average in my industry. I have researched the average salary for an intern at similar companies, and the average salary of students from my university who intern in the same industry. I make less money, 

I am tasked with fairly high level work. When I first started, I was doing the work of a regular analyst for a few weeks before my boss caught wind of it. I was doing the job well, but she made the fair point that it didn't look good that an intern was doing the same work as analysts. Since then I have completed a lot of projects, in addition to picking up the slack when an analyst is out of the office. We have contract workers in our office who are helping us with some very important projects, and it is very common for my boss to receive a completed product from one of them, hate it, and ask me to completely redo it. She and my supervisor give me a lot of praise for my work.

I have been persistently asked to apply for FTE positions in our department (and take night courses), but I want to continue with school and remain an intern. People continually ask me when or if I'm leaving, and I think it's fair to say that our department will be shorthanded if I leave (assuming no other analysts are hired). 

I recently got a $1,xxx bonus. I was really happy to get it, but if spread over the course of my employment, it amounts to a $.50 wage increase. I would like a 30% increase on my current wage, but don't know whether it's at all appropriate for an intern to negotiate salary, and if so, how to do it.

Can someone tell me if I'm being unreasonable? I've been told that as an intern, it's arrogant to complain about my wage and that this should primarily be a learning opportunity. I get that, but at the same time, I'm adding value to my department, and I feel like I should be fairly compensated for that. Should I broach the subject with my boss, or should I suck it up?"

The past few weeks have been kind of busy, but I've got roughly 7 weeks left which is mostly free.

I was thinking of picking up some Android programming through [this Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853). Do I have long enough to really make use of that? I'm guessing there's pretty much zero chance I can finish that course and develop a proper app in the time that I have.

I've learned some Java at university and done some casual Python programming before, and I can work HTML/CSS/jQuery, but I've never really had a serious project in any of them.

What's a good thing to go for? Ideally I'd like to get some money for it, but failing that (and let's be honest, that's pretty unlikely) I'd just like something serious to put on my CV/talk about at interviews for internships next year. "
2c4qtz,453,2014-07-30,TIFU by meeting her parents with my shirt off,Holy_Shit_Its_Bad,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2c4qtz/tifu_by_meeting_her_parents_with_my_shirt_off/,"Holy shit guys. I feel so fucking awful.

I'm working away from home for the summer. During a fit of boredom one day (and after reading, ironically enough, the Tinder horror stories AskReddit thread), I downloaded Tinder. Eventually I matched with a pretty chill girl who I've been hanging out with a lot over the past week. Nothing super crazy - we went out on a few dates and came back to my place to chill. I have a roommate who doesn't go out much so we never have too much time to be alone together.

Tonight, though, I was at my apartment watching some Vsauce. I passed out on the couch and woke up around 3:30 AM. When I picked up my phone, I had two missed calls from this girl. So I said, ""fuck it, why not"" and called her back. She had been out with some friends that night and tells me how she had missed me and that she was horny. My natural instincts kick in, and without much convincing, I go to her place to pick her up. At this point it's close to 4 in the morning. We can't go back to my place since I share a room with my roommate, so it's the back of the car for us. I should mention at this point I'm parked directly across the street from her house. It's a pretty dark street, though, and easy to hide. We have a little fun together, I do my thing for 15 seconds, and then she gets ready to go. At this point I have my pants back on, but not my shirt, which has been used to clean up some... fluids. She opens the door to my car and, without any reason or warning, my fucking car alarm goes off at full blast. We look at each other like one of us had just stepped on a landmine. At this point I'm groping my keys for any sort of mechanism to unfuck this situation. Now it doesn't matter if the street was dark. The car had all of its lights on. We were both in plain view in the back of the car. She runs out, I run around to the driver side door, and then I see it. Her dad, standing menacingly in the now-open doorway. He's the kind of guy who doesn't take any shit, and runs a tight ship at his Chinese restaurant. And then here I am. No shoes. No shirt. Standing in front of my car with horn blaring every second, furiously mashing buttons and hitting things, trying to get it to stop.

The driver-side door opens. I get in, start the car, kill the alarm, and get the fuck out of there. Only the windows are impossible to see out of from the steam. And when I got in my car, the door didn't close all the way. So I'm half-naked, driving my car down a street with windows that are fogged up to the point of not being able to see out, on top of having all the lights in the car turned on. I almost run into a parked car on the side of the road. I turned the corner, and after the adrenaline wore off, I realized how fucking awkward I just made this poor girl's life. She had to walk out of my car, across the street to the front door where her father was waiting.

I guess I didn't really meet her parents with my shirt off. I did see her dad while I wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes, though.

It's 6:04 right now. I have work in 3 hours, but I feel so terrible for her that I can't sleep. I sent her a text apologizing, but holy shit I just made her life so much harder. Hopefully her parents wouldn't be able to tell that she had weed earlier that night.

**EDIT (10AM)** FUCK. SHE LEFT HER PHONE IN THR CAR. That's the only way I have to contact her. So I can either

1. Stop by her house, where her mom is, to drop it off

2. Stop by the restaurant she works at when she goes to work, which her dad owns

3. Hope she responds to Facebook messenger

4. Give up on life and join my friends on riding the rails

**OP DELIVERS (6PM)** I'm still alive. Her Asian father hasn't found me... yet.

I tried to meet up with her over lunch, but when I went over to her place, neither her nor her mom (fortunately) was home. In a way, that made things worse. It was impossible to focus when I got back to work. Her phone was dead by this point. My code wouldn't compile. Things were bad.

Fortunately, she found a way to send me a message through Tinder without her phone. Turns out she went to the lake with some friends today. She agreed to meet up with me at 4 to get coffee. So I went out and got flowers (bitches love flowers), drove up to her place, and picked her up. She felt just as awful about the whole thing as I did (the flowers probably helped). We were both exhausted, so the coffee was a nice pick-me-up. We made some casual conversation, and apparently she's been in more embarrassing situations than that, just not in front of her parents. Speaking of which, they haven't blown up on her... yet. Her mom did sent a pretty scathing text saying (among other things) that she pulled a ""whore move"", though.

So right now, I'm just playing everything by ear. I've only got one week left in town before my internship is over. This girl has been super chill about everything. She's a fucking boss."

2c592p,0,2014-07-30,Did I choose the right company? Will I stagnate too much?,Greece_Lightningg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c592p/did_i_choose_the_right_company_will_i_stagnate/,"I am going to graduate by the end of this week and had a few offers to choose from, all of which were contract to hire (CTH) positions except for the offer from the company I interned with. I chose my the direct offer with my current company since they matched up to the highest offer I got, even if it was a CTH offer. I was a bit too busy with part-time internship and full class load to do the real full-time job search that I wanted, so these were my options.

This company is also a government contractor, so I may not further my tech skills too much, but I still will be learning a lot about about physics concepts. Plus, I get to stay where I currently live and finish the last 9 months of my lease, which I can't get out of early. The benefits package was also pretty nice. I just feel that I won't keep up with software advances too much at this position. Note, I will still be doing a lot of development work, but mostly with more c++.

One of the CTH offers was going to be pretty cool with some new technologies I haven't really work with too much, but I didn't like this place because of one of the upper managers who ticked me off during the interview and smaller desk space than what I'm used to. Plus I would lose money if I left my current situation for this offer, so I made the decision to stay put for a few months.

Did I make the right career decision choosing my current employer?

I do plan on leaving after 5-6 months, for reasons mentioned above.
That plus my 6 months of internship experience will put at just almost a year, so I figure that's a good time to hop ship and hopefully find a more software-related engineering position. My worry is if the more software-related companies will still take a look at me. 

Thus, does it seem very feasible for me to end up doing more software work after my current experience?

PS - I do have heavy c/c++, ruby, and java experience compared to most youngsters (those are my top languages), plus I a lot more languages that I've at least touched a few times. Not too mention that I have a lot of work experience with Qt and OpenGL, and some personal project experience with Android. 


Anyways, thanks guys. Really look forward to reading your replies. 

Best of luck,

2c5bbg,0,2014-07-30,TIFU by opening my computer,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2c5bbg/tifu_by_opening_my_computer/,"So a little background story as I share my first TIFU; typically before I go to bed I lay down and watch something on Netflix, Dexter, breaking bad, lie to me, and a few other shows depending on what I have finished or not. Well my computer has this easy function where I can press a button and it sets (I have it set this way) to put my computer to sleep in X time, so that when I fall asleep my laptop wont run all night. 

I take my laptop to work daily, 1) for personal use, 2) its a hell of a lot faster then my work computer. Well when I open my computer up after it goes to sleep while playing something, it usually plays 3-10 seconds of what ever I was watching that was already buffered onto my computer before timing out on Netflix, not a problem. Well today for some unknown and god smiting reason, my volume was absurdly high. Right as I opened up my computer today, my direct boss calls my name and says ""hey 8Bit, can you do this for me?""

Now do not get my wrong, my boss's love me and the job I have is pretty sweet. Its relaxed and I can do what ever I want typically as long as I have results. I often will screw around with my boss and joke with them, but it is always blatantly obvious no disrespect is meant and she understands it, ladedah we all have fun.

Well today, in that blaze of glory moment when I open my computer simultaneously after she asked me to do what ever project it was, my computer sound comes on, extremely loud, and in a voice sounding rather similar to mine (pre-buffered into my computer from the night before), in a completely serious sounding tone, decides to make my day interesting and says ""absolutely fucking not.""

Now, I work for a Christian company, I do not swear around or to my bosses. So there she is, as she comes around the corner of my cubical, completely flabbergasted as I appeared to have not only stepped my boundaries by swearing at her, but it sounded completely genuine and joke free as well. I just spend the last few minutes explaining to my boss the situation, of which she began to laugh hysterically at the nearly impeccable timing to which #1, she asked me to do something, #2, I opened my computer precisely on time, and #3, that my computer had to stop in that exact moment of the episode I was watching. I got off with a please be more careful after much explaining. TIFU at my internship :(

Also, TIL the digital universe is out for me and I need to put my headphones in prior to opening my computer.

TL:DR: My computer essentially told my boss fuck you with a combination of incredibly timed events."

[Thanks for AMA straight off buddy :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgewm?context=5)|Mostly for my family. My schedule is fantastic and if I took promotions I would lose that.  Another reason is because we aren't hurting for money. I have made way more money and been miserable. I make about 1/5 of what I used to make and I am sooo much happier.
[Are you less than full-time now or still putting in a less-stressful 40?  Edit:   *I work every weekend from 7-4 and I'm off during the week.*  So you went from a demanding 50 to 18 hours a week, no wonder you are digging it. Good on you for making it happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbmn8v?context=5)|Thanks! I didn't do much except pull the trigger and do it. I'm fortunate to have a very supportive fiancé that allows this to happen. The goal is to work on her career, and put hers first, and maybe in the future I'll reevaluate my options.
[Why???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgg95?context=5)|A few reasons actually...
 |I got tired of working in an office and freelancing from home just didn't seem to suit me.
 |I'm engaged to a wonderful woman with two great kids. My schedule is very flexible - to the point where I can almost come and go as I choose!
 |I did have a great paying job that was semi IT related for awhile but the company closed down. Being laid off was a shitty feeling. I enjoy my job security now.
[Thanks, guess if I could do the same I would however once u have responsibility and that income is the main source u can't change.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbgzic?context=5)|Exactly. My income isn't our primary source. My fiancé is a night shift hospice nurse and is the real provider.
 |I honestly feel fortunate to have the luxury to do I enjoy doing and the family not suffer because of it.
[That's pretty cool. I could imagine it isn't terrible working there when it isn't a ""sentence"". I'm sure it also helps if you're a good employee and your managers know if they piss you off you can just take off and not have to deal with any bullshit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbmnnw?context=5)|That is a bonus, yes. I'm not cocky, and when I go in I bust my ass and feel good about what I accomplished when I clock out. But if something were to happen I do know I have other options. They need me more than I need them. It feels good.
[What is the cost of living in your neck of the woods? Happiness is most important; IMHO this doesn't seem viable long term , in terms of aiming for owning a house, college fund for kids, retirement. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbkuyk?context=5)|It's not bad. If you're single you can probably live off of $25-30k/year pretty comfortably. For a family maybe $50-60k, preferably $70k+.
 |We are renting currently. Nice 3 bedroom, 2 bath house. Medium sized yard, newish cars and we can't just up and go to the Caribbean on a whim, but we do ok.
 |This is not a permanent plan. Once the kids are older I will either go back to school (considering paramedic) or turn Walmart into a career since upper management can make $40k+ a year pretty easily.
[How are the hours?  Do they make you work crappy shifts?   Garden center seems like a cool gig.  Work with plants, talk about like flowers and stuff.  MILFs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbh16x?context=5)|My hours are great. I work every weekend from 7-4 and I'm off during the week. On the weeks we have the boys (they go to their dad's house every other week) I stay home mon-fri. On the weeks we don't have them I just go in whenever and leave whenever.
 |Garden center is cool. I love being outside and I'm a fan of manual labor. I really don't deal with plants much surprisingly aside from the rare occasion I water them. Usually someone else does.
[I've worked outside garden center for Home Depot and Lowe's. I loved it. Then got transferred to inside garden at Lowe's. I liked it even more. Garden Department is best department. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbjrl1?context=5)|It really is, man.
 |While I was in college I worked outside garden for Lowe's also. There is just something about it that makes it so un-like a typical retail job.
[No wonder you like it. You are only working 16 hours per week. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjc4fd9?context=5)|Every other.
[Does your spouse still provide a significant amount of income/work full time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbifw9?context=5)|Yes, she does. She is a hospice nurse and her job isn't just important for the income, but one of the most important jobs I can imagine.
[No offense but if you really wanted to help this girl and her kids, your best course of action would be to provide for them. Not play video games and work at Wal Mart on the weekends. You have to think that every bit of money she spends on you, she should be spending on her kids future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbpg8p?context=5)|Again, that's not the case. I don't expect you to know the conversations we have over it, because obviously you don't. There is a plan here and often I hint around at doing something more and it gets shot down.
 |Also we include them in this, especially the eldest. We value their opinion as well.
 |EDIT: I work nearly 40 hours every other week (when they aren't here).
[How would i go about getting into IT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbivdq?context=5)|Most colleges have a career services department. Also, I've found a lot of cities have an IT professionals group where people can network and get their name out there.
 |Aside from that, simply submitting applications or going through a staffing agency works just as well. It's a growing career that's flooded with new professionals, but there is always work to be found.
[Should I get a degree in IT? I'm about to go back to school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbkwj4?context=5)|Absolutely. Let me reiterate, the tech industry is not bad at all, though I do think if you can freelance by all means do. But it simply wasn't for me. I loved designing Web pages and learning how to program as a teenager and even throughout college, but once I hit the real world I didn't mesh well with the industry.
[As a college student looking into IT, is it always being a desk jockey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c35jj/iama_former_it_professional_who_now_works_for/cjbibtb?context=5)|Not always. I had an internship while I was in college and I got to run cable, walk from one side of a campus to the other fixing professor's laptops and desktops. I really enjoyed that.
 |Networking probably would have been a better career choice than design and programming for me.
[What do your fiancee and your parents think of it?

Now I've found out I need to get my tonsils removed ASAP and the only time I can get them out before school starts (can't do I during school I need to preform well in class) is at the start of the last week of my internship (there are 2 weeks left) since the doctor is going on vacation meaning I'd have to miss the last week most likely due to recovery. 

How do I bring this up with my boss? Is it even ok to ask for the last week off? (Hopefully won't need the whole week but I've heard tonsillectomies can be brutal).

I hardly ever get angry but for some reason my patience is running really low today. The first good thing to happen was typing in /r/rant and realizing that it's actually a thing. So here I am.

I wake up this morning with 4 hours of sleep; I'm a little cranky, but I'm a grown man so I can just suck it up and get on with my day. Or, like the fuckstick I am, I could fall back asleep for 20 minutes by accident.

Now in a frenzy, I flop my lifeless body down the stairs and get a bowl of cereal, only to be greeted with rotten milk. Tired, hungry, and late, I leave for work.

I get on the train and once I finally get off, my bus has already left. 1.5 mile walk in dress clothes / 85 degree weather. Woohoo! 

I make it to work a bit early by some miracle. So, I stop at Dunkin Donuts and order a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. Once I left and opened the bag, I discovered that they had actually given me two sandwiches. I said to myself ""Wow, today's going to be a good day!"" It was this exact moment when I set my expectations too high. I happily ate both, but my stomach decided to initiate a gastrointestinal World War III on them instead. First half hour of work spent in the bathroom.

Now, I work as an intern programmer. Sometimes, I might not be precise enough, or I ask stupid questions, or I seem like I'm not ""trying"" when really I am, and am just trying to learn. I posted a question to StackOverflow and was torn to pieces because the community is 98% pretentious assholes (probably not actually, but that's how I feel now -_-). They basically say I'm dumb, not putting in any effort, and don't follow proper StackOverflow etiquette. 

Frustrated I message my friend and describe this situation. I don't even care if I'm wrong. I probably am. But all I wanted was to hear someone sympathize and call them assholes with me. Instead he says I'm dumb, not putting in any effort, and don't follow proper StackOverflow etiquette.

Also a hot girl unmatched me on Tinder and I forgot to put mustard on my sandwich. Fuck.

I can't wait to channel this frustration into a good pump at the gym later.

* Responsive, mobile friendly
* Outstanding calendar/schedule feature
* LOTs of pictures
* integrated, visually appealing audio player
* Integration with social media
* FB feed on website
* Contact form
* Shopping cart
* Google analytics
* SEO optimization

I have a job that I absolutely can't stand. Now, some background, I just turned 27, I've got a bachelor's degree and a master's degree..and I'm in a job that makes $30k a year. I'm paying off student loans because I made the huge mistake of going to grad school (a mistake that I regret every damn day) and I don't see them being complete anytime soon. I just bought a new car, but I had a lot of money saved up since I've been saving since I was 17, so I was able to put a good amount down and only take a small loan for 10k, which is extremely reasonable for a monthly payment.

I've been searching for serious jobs ever since grad school obviously, and I've been rejected by the federal government about 73 times and counting since 2011 via USAjobs.gov, and that's extremely disheartening (especially since I have contacts within the government, and nobody seems to be able to help at all. it's not even about who you know anymore!)

I interned for a State Government position back in 2010 while in grad school, but they told me on day one that the unpaid internship would not turn into a job opportunity. I said ok whatever, and took it because I figured it was good resume material..but here we are 4 years later, and it hasn't helped a damn bit.

My current position is pretty much a glorified cashier. It makes me feel like crap. I've spent all this money on education, and I make 30 grand a year doing collecting and whatnot. I hate it. I don't like the people I work with, and it frustrates me to no end how some people there are babied and get away with not doing as much of work as I do, yet it just doesn't seem to matter to anybody. My boss claims to love my work ethic, which I'm sure is true because I'm a damn hard worker, but it's not like I'll ever see a dime more for being a hard worker. It's a municipal job, so they can't just go handing out raises and promotions.

I absolutely loathe this job. I wake up in the morning, and the first thought on my mind is how much I hate that job, and how going there makes me want to jump off a bridge. Every night, I come home from work, go online, search for new jobs, then goto bed. That's all I do, because my hatred of this job has broken into my personal life and completely changed my mood. I'm just completely full of anger because of this job.

The problem is that it's affecting me physically as well too. I've had intestinal issues for years, but they've gotten much worse in the past 1.5 years that I've been at this job, and even my gastro claims that these symptoms are due to the mind-gut relation, and that my feelings towards work are most likely why I'm having such issues throughout the day. My hair has become more gray over this past year, and I'm even getting pure white/gray hairs in my beard, which I've never had up until now. I get headaches often, and I just feel like utter garbage. I've gained about 15 pounds the past year working here as well. All in all, my health is pretty crappy, and a lot of the reason why can be attributed to this job.

I apply and apply and apply, but it seems that my wasted degrees (bachelors in political science; masters in criminal justice w/ a focus in homeland security and defense) won't get me anywhere. Still living at home because there's no way I can afford to move out, and it just seems like my life is on complete hold because of this job.
I'd love to quit, but financially it's just not an option, and it's not the responsible thing to do. I need a new job, but nobody wants to hire me, and I've got no idea what to do. Any advice, Reddit?

TL;DR: hate my job a lot, it's affecting my health, and pretty much makes my daily life suck.

thanks guys!"
2c73vz,1,2014-07-30,Clarification needed on different education systems,Pheelbert,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c73vz/clarification_needed_on_different_education/,"**Introduction**

I often see posts on here written by recent or about-to-be graduates that question their abilities as a developer because of a lack of practical or professional experience. This has got me confused and I would like to know where these people come from, what their program are and any other related detail.


**My background**

I'm a 19yo french canadian that suddenly decided to get into computer science starting CEGEP (*I'd like to say that CEGEP is the equivalent to other's colleges, but I find it hard to believe and this is a little the purpose of this post*). 


So, just to explain shortly how it is here, 6 years in primary school, 5 years of highschool, 2 years of CEGEP or 3 if it's a 'technique' (*In the case of computer science, it is 3 years*). Normally, the 3 year programs are meant to bring you to the job market, but there's also the possibility to continue University afterwards which works the same as yours' I believe.


Personally, I've had plenty of practical projects in and outside of school as well as two internships in big and small companies. Therefor, I cannot understand where those people come from when they say that they can't ""code themselves out of a paper bag"", for example. Please explain your background, what happened at school and if you went out of your way Not to get any practice.


PS: This also applies to those posts where people mention that degrees are useless because bachelor graduates have no professional experience and that it's very different than being in class; or bootcamp-related posts.


I hope this is clear, thank you for your responses."

It has about 30 employees, 5 of which are full-time programmers, and I am the only software intern. But I really don't like this internship for a lot of reasons: 

1. This company is really disorganized and mismanaged. It has been 10 weeks and I have already been re-assigned to a new project 5 times. I never get to work on a project for more than 2 weeks before being moved to something new.

2. I have no mentor or any direct training. The only ""training"" I'm given involves a coworker sending me a link to a site where I self-learn the material. I basically have to figure everything out myself. 

3. A lot of the previously written code is *really* bad and written by former programmers who were laid off. It's terribly organized and has little to no documentation, which makes it a pain to work with.

--

At this point there's only a few weeks left so of course I'm going to tough it out till the end. But does this sound like a normal internship to you? Cause I think a ""real"" internship should involve a lot more mentoring and training, and a single well-thought out project that you do for the entire summer. Thoughts?"

2. Learn actual finance, particularly Hull's book on options

3. Try to get a tangible certification for my resume, such as pass CFA level 1. Or even the actuarial exams, which I have most of the knowledge to pass P/1 and FM/2.

4. Take my already proficient C++/Java/Python programming and try to get to the advanced level

This build was on a $450 dollar budget. My girlfriend is working a summer internship and her boss mentioned that it was his son's birthday and that he needed a gift for him. When he also said that he has been asking for a computer lately my girlfriend swiftly volunteered my services haha. So since this is for my girlfriends boss, i really wanted to make sure it is a good build and his son would like it. The son is 15yo plays mostly League of legends and World of Warcraft, but mostly doesnt play other games bc the family computer cant handle it.
The $450 dollar budget is always tough, it started out at 400 but when he said he wanted a color theme and nice case, i said that it would cost a little extra. The color the,me he wanted was a blue and white since it is his school's colors. I had trouble making anything cheaper than this that would perform well with the games at hand. I originally wanted a i3-4130 for the CPU since WoW is a CPU sided game and i know he will be playing that, but microcenter didn't have a cpu/mobo bundle for any cheaper i3's, thus the fx-6300, which is still a fine CPU.
For the GPU i went with a r7 265 over a 750ti because the performance is much higher and i had the wattage to spare. The 750ti is a great card nice and cool and quiet, but i think that he would benefit more from the gpu speed performance than heat and noise.
I wanted to go with a phantom 240 case but i had trouble finding one in stock that i could get on short notice. But this case turned out nice and fits the color theme well.

was built about a month ago.

2c7tpt,2,2014-07-31,First Job. Does the language used by a company matter?,MentalMinotaur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c7tpt/first_job_does_the_language_used_by_a_company/,"Quick background: Soon to be graduating Computer Engineer Tech with two internships that specialized in C++ embedded type programming. Other than that the only other language experience is from learning on my own.

I currently have 2 job offers at 2 different companies that focus on 2 different languages. 

Job A: The same place I interned at. They develop solely in c++ for their standalone products. 

Job B: Their main focus is c# but they have some code in c++ although it is unclear how much c++ development I'd be doing. They are also looking to delegate configuration management tasks to me so basically using scripting languages to automate  pre-build processes(I believe). They develop desktop applications so much bigger code base.

So my questions are:

Does it matter which language I get experience in for my first job? 

Does picking one or the other really impact me from finding a job that requires another the use of a different language?

2c7ub3,5,2014-07-31,I'm having trouble deciding what I'd like to do with my life.,AutisticBadger,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2c7ub3/im_having_trouble_deciding_what_id_like_to_do/,"As my title says I am seriously confused about what I want to do with my life. I am a 21 year old college student. Though this will be my fourth year since I entered college (senior year), technically I only have credits to be considered a junior. I have technically had two different majors since I started college. I entered college with my declared major being Management Information Systems and then right around the end of my freshman year I changed to Computer Science. 

By the end of my sophomore year I began to realize that I was just not cut out for computer science because I was just not able to keep up with the math classes. I tried to give it one last shot the first semester of my junior year but I just could not get a good enough grade in the math classes.

So over that winter break I was talking to some of my family during a Christmas party, and a lot of them are educators. They got me all excited about education and I told myself that I wanted to become a teacher. I took some classes the next semester to head in that direction and quickly realized I just was not passionate about it. I dreaded studying and going to class more than anything. I am the average college student who doesn't usually get all excited about class and studying but it was different this time. 

I was taking summer classes, this summer, to try and make up some credit hours cause I've fallen so far behind with the major changes, and not getting good enough grades in classes. My GPA is literally in the shitter. I had a break down/realization moment the other day that I am 21 years old and have no idea what the hell I want to do with my life and in the mean time I'm just wasting money and time. My parents are trying to be understanding, but I know they are disappointed in me. They are both have very professional jobs and made their career decisions and made it through school with no problems. 

So, now that you've read all that and probably want me to get to the point. The two summers around when my majors were M.I.S. and Computer Science, I had actually managed to get internships. After the second summer I decided I could not sit at a desk all day every day for my entire life. I like to be up and moving around. I love the outdoors and I like being athletic and working out. My parents are understanding of this and have been trying to give me some career options. My mom has said firefighter and dad has said anywhere from police officer to park ranger, because he knows I like the parks. I still want to get a degree, so the advice I am seeking is some college majors and the careers you can get with them that kinda fit my personality of not wanting to sit at a desk all day and such. Thanks in advanced and sorry for the long story.

TL;DR : I am a 21 year old who keeps switching majors only to determine either I can't handle the difficulty of some of the classes or I am just not passionate at all about it. I don't want a career where I would have to sit at a desk every day all day and also love the outdoors and parks and being active in general. Would appreciate any input on college majors and the career they pertain to that meet these qualifications."

It'll be my first time in that city.  For housing I have the option of choosing roommate or no roommate.  The advantages of a roommate is I can socialize and discuss work.  A possible downside is that I'll be doing several phone interviews for next summer and don't want to be disturbed.  In general, I don't like to be disturbed when being productive.

Former interns, could you share your roommate/no roommate housing experiences?"

Today I found myself in a very uncomfortable situation. I just finished high school and I'm not into college life so I'll be on ""my own"" from now on. That said, here's my question.

I've been into web development for about 2 years now, I know the basics and I've been doing some research on the most difficult parts of coding, so you could say I already know a bit about this world. Recently I've been looking at web marketing and I'm starting to love it because a part of me always loved to adverstise things and make people ""fall"" for it, can't really explain what I want to say but I think you got it. Now I want to follow a path, this is, I want to get a job from what I've learned and I was thinking of taking a course on one of this two loves of mine, so I could get a certificate, an internship and to get all clarified for me.

The real question is, what should I take a course of, Web Development or Web Marketing? Should I do web marketing and still use my code knowledge or should I just follow dev and in the future learn some marketing?

(Sorry for my English. And please, don't throw any hate, if you think this is a bad idea or that I should just follow anything else, please write your opinion down calmly and in order so I can understand. And remember, this isn't just an answer I'm looking for, many might look up for this and will aswell be helped with this type of question just like I might will. Thanks.)"
2c8jvc,1372,2014-07-31,An attractive female walked past and broke the system..,Captain_Flashheart,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2c8jvc/an_attractive_female_walked_past_and_broke_the/,"So I worked at a hospital for about half a year and my contract ended about a month ago. For my department there were no longer any dedicated IT staff due to budget cuts, but the hospital had turned to hiring students to fix bugs and applications, and make sure that everything went smoothly. Most users could rely on the main IT helpdesk, which helped users with all their more common problems. What I did mostly was small bits of development on some of the laboratory tools. Think VBScript/VBA and MS Office. 

About a month after my contract ended I get an urgent voice mail from my ex-boss. 

&gt;""Captain_Flashheart, if you're able to come please help. We have a very urgent bug that is stopping the stream of data from one of the analyst machines to the central hospital information system.""  

About half an hour later I get another call:

&gt;B: Captain_Flashheart, did you get my earlier message? We tried calling every intern who has ever worked here.  
&gt;M: Yes, I just haven't been able to reply yet. What is the problem, exactly?  
&gt;B: Remember the string of information that the system uploads from a text file? Something corrupted the string and randomly placed eighteen [tab]s at the end of the file, so the file could not be read properly.  

At that moment I think back. One of the files that is imported is essentially a group of comma separated values that correspond to blood serum values and patient IDs. It's just a basic text file that does not need to be opened by anyone who is not a machine, but if anything screws with the formatting there would be a big fat error from the server. 

&gt;M: Yes, how could that have happened?  
&gt;B: Well, I looked at it and went down to the lab. Apparently someone opened the file and just as they did a very attractive female walked past. They lost their focus for a second and managed to add the 18 tabs to the file by pressing the keyboard, and carelessly saved the file as they closed it.  
&gt;M: I see.  
&gt;B: I'm calling you to tell you that it's fixed.   

At this point I had to suppress my laughter. I can only imagine how much of a panic people had when they discovered this ""bug"" and how ashamed they must have felt when they got to the cause of the problem. "

Decision due by EOD today.,ActLikeAnAdult,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2c9m6c/need_some_advice_about_choosing_between_job/,"Hey r/jobs, just curious what you think about these two job offers.

Background on me: one year marketing/PR experience, one year intern experience at a PR and Ad agency. I've always wanted to go into advertising and agency work has always been my goal. 

**JOB 1:**

* Account Coordinator position at an Advertising/Marketing/PR agency
* Salary 1,000 below what I was requesting
* High profile clients
* 100% health/vision
* 401K matching
* Opportunity to be promoted quickly
* Free parking
* Longer hours
* Larger company (60 or so)

**JOB 2**

* PR and Social Media at a growing tech company
* Salary $3,000 higher than Job 1
* 100% Health/Dental/Vision
* Flexible Hours
* 4-6 weeks PTO
* 401K Matching
* Free parking or subway (I live walkable to a subway station in my city)
* 5 week sabbatical after 5 years
* 5 person marketing team, each person has a different function

I guess I love the benefits and salary at job 2, but I feel like I would be operating in a vacuum and have no one to learn from. I'm wary of the longer hours/harder work/driving requirement and salary of job 1, but as I'm just starting out in my career, I feel like working at an agency and being able to learn from those around me doing the same thing would really help me grow and develop.

Thoughts?"

After dropping out a year ago and doing nothing with my life since then, I finally got serious about job hunting. I had 1 interview left with my dream company but for some reason accepted the very first offer I received, from my boss when I was an intern at uni.

It sounded really cool when he described it to me. I would be learning embedded development, maintaining a cloud-based ASP.NET software service, and some misc. tasks. Unlimited vacation and the ability to telecommute sounded incredible, but now I realize that as a small company there is no way to take a long vacation since we're always busy, and I feel really awkward working from home since no one else seems to really do it.

Our embedded software uses Rabbit microcontrollers, and while I'm trying to keep an open mind, I am pretty sure that Dynamic C is a huge piece of shit and we're dealing with obscure hardware that has a dying community for support. I have no clue what i am doing, no hardware resources to help debug programs, and the only other embedded developer is on another continent so it's really hard to get help.

I don't really get to write much of the ASP.NET application. I am basically patching it up into a semi-passable state after it gets written by some outsourced programmers in India. They have to either be fucking with us or trying to rip us off; they write absolute garbage. I discovered our software saves passwords in plain text and is vulnerable to SQL injection, and no one seemed greatly concerned (we sell this stuff to government agencies). There isn't enough time to rewrite it, I just get to spend all day wrangling with half-assed code.

I feel no motivation whatsoever. Everything is so frustrating to deal with that I don't care to do my best work. My girlfriend thinks that I will get better assignments as I prove myself, but I don't know if I can take it. I can't even get my employer to buy me Visual Studio, I have to download the Express edition.

Since my boss also was my supervisor at my internship, if I walk away from this job I will have no references. I didn't finish my degree and do not have a portfolio, so I feel like I would totally burn myself if I walk off this job.My contract specifies I need to give a month's notice before leaving, but I already feel like I'm losing my mind. Sometimes when my alarm goes off in the morning I just start crying.

I don't really have any money to survive being without a job if I quit and try to find a better job. But what can I do? Should I just tough it out? Or is it worth the hardship to find a new job? Maybe I'm just a whiny bitch and have too high of expectations for my employers?

I don't really know what I am asking for or expecting to hear, guess I just needed to get that off my chest. Sorry if I wasted your time."

Again.,FLUT3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2c9tb6/rejected_from_cse_major_again/,"I go to one of the top CSE schools and applied to be in the major last year (after my freshman year) and again this year and was rejected again. 


My backup was the CSE department for the same school but in a different location (much less competitive), because that's what my advisors suggested. But I was rejected from there too. 


My second backup was the informatics program, which I haven't heard from yet. But now I'm a little worried about that one too. 


So far what I'm thinking is that l should just major in math because it's an open major. 


The reason why I'm being rejected I assume is my calculus grades from freshman year ~2.5 avg. My CSE grades are very good though, with an average of 3.8. 


What I'm wondering is if continuing with the math route is a good idea (especially considering I'm apparently really bad at math). And how should I approach recruiters, especially at job fairs, about not being in the cse department but wanting an internship in software development? My biggest concern is being ignored by these recruiters and not learning enough cse in college. 


Any advice would be great. Thank you! 


EDIT: I got accepted in the Informatics program at my school! I think I will end up following that path for the next 2 years and try my hardest to network and get good interviews, hoping that I am not turned away just because of my major. I guess my biggest question at this point is how to approach recruiters about not being in cse when I am actively pursing a job in software development. Thank you all for the advice! "

I love the culture, I love the office, I love the people I work with- even the ones that I have only met through IRC. Full-time employees have given me positive feedback about my work here, and I have enjoyed most of my time in the office. I even enjoy working out of the office- on weekends, evenings, it's just a place that has kept me really excited about what I'm working on.

My company doesn't traditionally offer remote, school-year internships, but there have been exceptions. I know most of the other interns I've talked to aren't interested in having a school-year internship, but I have spent the last two years doing internships alongside school, and I know it helps me learn and apply my skills immensely. Also, I'm a rising Senior and I have no CS classes anymore, I will have plenty of time to dedicate to work.

I would do any role they would ask of me, maintenance, testing, debugging, honestly, anything. I would work whatever hours they want, document all of my code thoroughly, participate in all of the meetings.

I don't know how to approach the topic. Every other internship I've had has approached me about continuing on. With two weeks left to go, I'm worried that this might just not happen. In which case, I need to resume interviewing for positions for the Fall.

Should I move on?

P.S. Please don't leave me comments telling me to enjoy or focus on my education. I am an intelligent, hard worker but I have several learning disabilities that have made school difficult and miserable, and the industry is my preferred way of learning.
