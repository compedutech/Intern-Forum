I have not much time left before graduating and really don't have any IT related experience but I would like to consider this as one of the options.

My questions are.

1. What types of positions are their in IT field?

2. What would you recommend me to learn on my own online to build up my resume for IT position other than applying for internships?

3. Is it unusual for ME major to seek IT jobs?

thank you!!!"

Any advice is appreciated.,leredditzle,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3yyym2/am_i_too_late_in_figuring_out_that_i_want_a/,"Hi all, I'm in my second year (about to start second semester) of studying Finance at a university in Canada and until recently I had no idea what I was aiming towards with regards to work. Due to some personal growth during the downtime from school, I finally began to research career paths and a majority of the careers that interested me are in finance. I've done some reading of a lot of the posts in this sub, which has been a wealth of information so far, and a common theme I have noticed is that a large number people seemed to have known the type of career they were aiming towards. 

To briefly explain my situation, I have an ok GPA but it is not in the range that would most likely be expected. I'm involved in relevant clubs, however, I also lack experience from internships or work.

My question is, am I already too late? If not, I could really use some advice from anyone with a more experience or a better idea of this than me. I want to start planning ahead on steps I need to take if possible, so any advice is welcomed and greatly appreciated

Hopefully I've followed the subreddit rules in my post.

Thanks!

**tl;dr I'm a second year Finance student who only now knows where I want to go and I want to start setting goals. My problem is I'm facing an uphill battle and think I might already be too late.** It's time to get serious. Thank you everyone who takes the time to read and help, I know your lives must be at least as stressful.

I'm not keen on changing majors because I know that an EE degree wouldn't necessarily be a hindrance and could actually help expand one's career in the industry. The field always interested me, but aside from 2 basic java courses at a community college (where I received A's but practically learned nothing), I have no experience. I appreciate how individuals can make it in the field simply by learning on their own and building up their portfolios online through the countless outlets that already exist and employers frequent. The more youthful and laid-back culture you see from places like the big tech companies seem to fit my tastes as well. So what I wanted to know was: 

- **Where can I begin? What's a good language?**

- **How can I make myself really employable?**

- **What can I do on my own?**

- **What steps should I take with my internships and/or work experience in the next 2 years before I graduate?**"

I was healthy and thin for the first time in my life, and things were going amazing.

and I fucked it up by talking to another guy about moving into his spare bedroom during my medical internship. It ruined me as a person. I had absolutely no closure to that relationship, I was just blocked from every means of contact.

Then I got a couple theft charges for shoplifting.

I finally got to see a psychiatrist about my problems, and he put me on literally 7 different medications for PTSD, Depression and Anxiety.

I got a DUII recently for those pills.

and then I apparently stole from another store without even REMEMBERING it. There was no police or anything involved.

I'm going through group therapy and counsoling. It isn't helping. They're saying I have too many triggers and am too sensitive to be in some groups. Yeah, my childhood was super shitty, and yeah I was sexually abused. 

My life is spiraling out of control. I don't even get out of bed anymore. I just spend all day watching TV and eating whatever is there. I go to group and that's about it. 

My current boyfriend is getting ""sick and tired of my shit"" because I tell him I'm depressed and he puts me down, says hes working two jobs for our future, blah blah blah.....he treats me like shit and I hate it. but I won't leave him, because he has a good paying job, wants to have kids, and a good life, a nice house and all the things I was promised with my last boyfriend. 

Except I have to live in an eternal hell as penance for the sin that I hurt my last boyfriend. 

Eventually I'll just take one too many pills and not wake up. Pretty easy to make it look like an accident. 

I will never be normal. I'll never be as happy as I was before. I'll never have the life that I originally had. This year is just as shitty as the last. "
3z3kg1,0,2016-01-01,"Former PCMR member's long decline into plebeian life, advice needed on a mouse buy",RahultheWaffle,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3z3kg1/former_pcmr_members_long_decline_into_plebeian/,"Happy New Year's folks!

Tl;dr I was once glorious PCMR, now I use a shitty laptop, my mouse broke today (HNY Me!), and now I need a rec for what mouse to get.

Phase 1:
I built my first computer 6 years ago when I was 14. SLI evga 8800gt, c2d e6700, 2gb ram ddr2 833 mhz, msi p6n diamond, and some other stuff. It was a gift from my parents since it was a cool learning experience to research, order, and put it together, and because I'd just been accepted into a 1-year program where, if I passed, I skipped high school and started college at UW (I passed, and I did and I did).

Phase 2:
I replaced it with a newer desktop 4 years later. I received this computer as a gift from a friend for teaching him how to build it 3 years prior from then and troubleshooting it when he had problems booting it.

Phase 3:
This past spring, the hard drive was corrupted, or so I thought, but the issue was actually with the motherboard. The components were quite dated, and I was going off to Cali for my internship with Riot Games (:D one of my better memories). I used the PC Bang computers there and my work laptop. Life was good, if only for the summer, and I was a transient PCMR member.

Phase 4:
On my return, I realized that my savings should be focused on paying potential post-graduation expenses, and I invested my savings in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. My laptop for school work was also dying (8 years old office hand me down from my dad), so my dad chipped in and we got a laptop for school. The type of program and the types of extracurrics I'm in really benefit from that mobility, otherwise I might have tried to get some old gaming desktop off craigslist or put one together this past black friday.

Phase 5:
If I can find a good job when I graduate this spring (fingers crossed, applications pending recruiter review), I could build myself a computer when I graduate, and my folks might pitch in too as a grad gift. I don't have my hopes up about that last bit though, my folks are big on self-sufficiency once I graduate, plus they're called gifts for a reason.

In sum:
Thus, from the once vaunted glory of CnC3, SupCom: FA, and Empire: TW at 1080i, to the high, high peaks of Ultra settings of Witcher 3, TW: Rome 2+GEM mod, and MGS5 at 1440p, I was demoted to playing lowest settings CS:GO and TW: Shogun 2 on my laptop with Intel integrated graphics.

But alas, still more tragedy awaits!

Today, my mouse also borked, and I can no longer hold down LMB (can't spray in shooters, can't select units in rts, ripperoni). Since this also affects my ability to do stuff in software I use for school (SketchUp, ArcGIS, Illustrator), my dad is once again coming to the rescue and helping me replace my mouse. He's fine with something under 50 bucks, since he knows how important gaming is to me professionally and socially, so I just need to know what mouse to get.

My first mouse was a Logitech G5, with the cracked blue tiberium cover from the CnC3 days. That mouse's cable broke, but when I cosplayed a (shitty) TPA Shen at Riot's PAX event two years ago, I got a free G700s, which had a similar feel to the G5. I really like dthe mouse, apart from the occasional drifting cursor, short battery life, and stiff charging cable that's unusable for shooters.  I'd like to avoid the problems of the G700s, but get a mouse that keeps its nice shape and has good flexibility in buttons and dpi settings.

So, to former brethren PCMR members, what mouse should I get?

However, I want to make sure now is not a bad time to apply. All advice is very, very welcome and thanks in advance for your time!

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my little review portion first

**Background**

* Work experience: software engineering internships
 * Summer 2014 - Fortinet
 * Summer 2015 - Yahoo
 * Summer 2016 - Google
* Key extra curriculars:
 * Writing tutor (3 years)
 * CSE tutor (3 years)
 * College student body president (1 year) + senator (1 year)
 * Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society (officer for 2 years)
 * Various other leadership/teaching roles
* School/major: 
 * UCSD - finished B.S. 2 quarters early -&gt; awkward timing
 * One more year to finish my +1 M.S. degree (Expected Fall 2016)
 * B.S. / M.S. Computer Science
* Race/nationality: Asian
* Sex: Male

&amp;nbsp;

**Stats**

* GMAT: discussed below in worries/questions
* B.S. Computer Science (3.93/4.00 - summ cum laude)
* M.S. Computer Science (4.00/4.00 - started courses Fall 2015)

&amp;nbsp;

**MBA:**

* Goal of MBA: I'm looking at technical management in the future. I want to hone my skills and pick up a formal education in the more business side of things before moving forward. 

* Target Schools: Stanford, Harvard, Sloan, Haas

&amp;nbsp;


**Worries/questions:**

* **GMAT**: I plan to take this sometime before mid-Feb so I'll have another shot if I need it before 3rd round apps (I have started studying recently and am pretty comfortable with the types of questions in the exam). I'm hoping that I will be able to score well based on how I have studied in university. Is this strategy sound? Or is it way too late in the application process to be still fiddling with getting a GMAT score?

* **Industry experience**: Officially, I have no full-time industry experience and all I will have had is internship experience. How bad is this, especially for 3rd round applications?

* **Timing**: Because I am set to finish my M.S. Computer Science by December 2016, is now the right time to apply for these schools? My hope is that if I get accepted, I can defer by a semester and continue right after I finish my M.S. at UCSD. The alternative would be to apply next year and spend my time after graduation working in industry before working toward an MBA. 

* **Am I reaching too far**?: Essentially, how are my chances with the four target schools listed above if I were to score well on the GMAT (say, 750+) and fetch some decent letters of recommendation?

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you so much again for taking the time to read this lengthly mess. I'll also be seeking to talk to a lot of advisors and professors once school starts again, but I'm hoping to gain a better grasp as soon as possible to become as good of an applicant as I can be. Any help/advice/direction would be amazing!"

It's been about 3 months since I passed my A+. I interviewed with three companies total, and one of them came back to me with an offer.  It's not the perfect job but it is a great place to begin my career in IT and to gain some valuable and diverse experience.

I am convinced that having the A+ certification on my resume helped to land the interviews that I got.  It's simply an easy way for HR departments to know that you are a trained candidate worth taking a closer look at.

Just FYI, the pay for the jobs that I interviewed for ranged from $32,000-$46,000 per year ($15-$22/hr)

P.S. A word of advice:  While you're studying for the A+ and/or applying for jobs, get yourself involved in some sort of IT related activity that you can put on your resume (volunteer, internship, part-time work).  Having a year of basic experience under my belt really helped when it came time to interview for jobs.

At school I use the Linux computers in our lab sometimes, especially when I want to run my C++ programs, but does that count as ""knowing Linux""?

So, I'm working in a small developer team (~17 people) in the DFW area of Texas and I have mainly worked with C# web apps and asp.net websites. I started work here as an intern making about 12.50 an hour shortly after graduating from college. 6 months pass by and they decided to hire me on full time, but for only 30k a year, which I pretty much had to take because I had to start repaying my student loans the next month. I also figured they would probably increase my pay at some point in the future, but here I am at almost 2 years full time in this position and my pay rate has only gone up to 31k a year. I've done a few projects already for them and one of them actually helped bring a section of our company out of the red since it wasn't making as much money as it should have been.

I need a better paying job soon or I'll have to put my student loans into deferment for a while...The problem is, I have no clue what I really want to do. sure I have experience as a programmer, but I'm not sure if it's just been this job or what but I really don't want to code much anymore...

My current job is wanting me to completely redo our main website and add in a bunch of features and stuff just by myself in the upcoming year and I'm probably going to have to work more than 40 hours a week to even meet any of the deadlines. I also won't get overtime pay due to a change in company policy not giving overtime pay to salary based pay employees. I'm almost tempted to quit, but can't unless I find another job fast.

I wouldn't mind another job in dealing with computers. Maybe information systems security or maybe even IT, but at the same time I feel like I'd burn out of the job just like I did this one. Some people tell me that, ""A job is a job,, you don't need to like it and just work to make money,"" while others seem to say, ""work a job that you enjoy and you never have to worry about hating your job."" 

If you read all this, thanks. So should I just try to find another job dealing with computers and try to acquire the skills they are wanting? Or continue down my current programming path and just bear with it and hope that they at least up my pay during or after this website project?"
3z85c2,2,2016-01-02,Concerned with pursuing a BS in Computer Science,TheMajesticFreak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3z85c2/concerned_with_pursuing_a_bs_in_computer_science/,"I'm currently applying for schools for a BS in Computer Science in Chicago which are DePaul, UICC, NEIU, and IIT. I know Northwestern and UICUC are top notch schools as well, but I don't think I have the grades nor the chance to get accepted. I've completed 24 semester hours at Hawaii Pacific University for an AS in CS, but they're all Gen Eds not including math so I'm a quarter away towards the degree.

My only concern applying to these schools for this degree is that I have no relevant work experience since I've been in the Navy  turning wrenches as an MM and EN. The job has given me a lot of knowledge and experience that can be transferable to the civilian world, but I would be starting from scratch when looking for employment. I hear internships can give me invaluable experience which looks favorable on my resume, but I feel that may not be enough to be marketable.

I'll also be much older than a typical college grad student. I'll be 28 when I get out next month but a BS in CS takes approx. 4 years to complete so I'll be at least 32 when I obtain my degree. I'm pursuing a degree that I've always wanted to do, but with my age and lack of work experience I feel the cards are stacked against me. 

Has anybody experienced or know of anyone that has gone through something like this? Thoughts and/or suggestions?"

TLDR version: Grad apps likely were overlooked because average (thus poor) GRE math score, internship ending soon and need to figure out what to do for both income (need advice for finding a job) and preparing for grad school (not just to get in but to do well when I do). Also, what advice do people have to continue preparing for grad school while still working full time at a job that possibly has nothing to do with my career. I am also seeking advice on how to best spend this year to give my best chance at the NSF fellowship.


I graduated last May with a 3.98 GPA, three years of research experience in two labs (concurrently, and during that time worked on independent research in their labs each semester), last summer I worked in a research program at another university (competitive to get into), and from those professors have three great letters of rec. A problem was I had average math scores on the GRE and my grad apps last fall were likely not viewed because of that.

I have since moved to California and thanks to kind words from my fiancé have an internship at a tech company (where he works). It is a fairly interesting job working with the cognitive psychology of how people interact with technology (not sure if it's really UX job). However, they do not have a long term position for me. My boss wants to help me get a job and/or help me go to grad school but nothing is coming of it. I do not know what to do with myself after the internship ends. I have been searching for jobs and have gotten interviews for research assistant jobs and complements on my cv (even statements like ""why are you not in grad school already"" because GRE scores are not on my cv) but that's it, and fearing I will soon be jobless. There are just not many paid RA jobs and all the applied jobs I find require a masters/PhD or several years of UX experience. Any advice for getting a job? I have already emailed all the professors I have worked for and none have connections to a position. I search every day on Indeed.com and look at cogsci society but there that's often blank. Plus, I have a two body problem and have to find jobs in the San Francisco bay area.

I also want to continue to prepare myself for grad school. Plus, the reason I did not get a job was because I did not have enough experience with fMRI. I would like to improve and expand my skills with techniques and knowledge a grad student should know like software, stats, tools, etc. but I am not sure what I should learn. Any advice on what to study would be helpful. A frustrating thing about undergrad is my professors often treated my projects at the undergrad level saying things like ""this is good enough for your undergrad project"" when I wanted to do real research and assess my ability to successfully preform it. I want to work in a lab hoping to get experience at a bit of a higher level now I have a BS. The issue is I cannot afford to be unpaid.

(Cognitive/ Cognitive Neuroscience),mad_neuroscientist,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/3z89sf/help_in_unavoidable_gap_year_not_sure_how_to/,"I ranted a bit. TLDR version: Grad apps likely were overlooked because average (thus poor) GRE math score, internship ending soon and need to figure out what to do for both income (need advice for finding a job) and preparing for grad school (not just to get in but to do well when I do). Also, what advice do people have to continue preparing for grad school while still working full time at a job that possibly has nothing to do with my career. I am also seeking advice on how to best spend this year to give my best chance at the NSF fellowship.


I graduated last May with a 3.98 GPA, three years of research experience in two labs (concurrently, and during that time worked on independent research in their labs each semester), last summer I worked in a research program at another university (competitive to get into), and from those professors have three great letters of rec. A problem was I had average math scores on the GRE and my grad apps last fall were likely not viewed because of that.

I have since moved to California and thanks to kind words from my fiancé have an internship at a tech company (where he works). It is a fairly interesting job working with the cognitive psychology of how people interact with technology (not sure if it's really UX job). However, they do not have a long term position for me. My boss wants to help me get a job and/or help me go to grad school but nothing is coming of it. I do not know what to do with myself after the internship ends. I have been searching for jobs and have gotten interviews for research assistant jobs and complements on my cv (even statements like ""why are you not in grad school already"" because GRE scores are not on my cv) but that's it, and fearing I will soon be jobless. There are just not many paid RA jobs and all the applied jobs I find require a masters/PhD or several years of UX experience. Any advice for getting a job? I have already emailed all the professors I have worked for and none have connections to a position. I search every day on Indeed.com and look at cogsci society but there that's often blank. Plus, I have a two body problem and have to find jobs in the San Francisco bay area.

I also want to continue to prepare myself for grad school. Plus, the reason I did not get a job was because I did not have enough experience with fMRI. I would like to improve and expand my skills with techniques and knowledge a grad student should know like software, stats, tools, etc. but I am not sure what I should learn. Any advice on what to study would be helpful. A frustrating thing about undergrad is my professors often treated my projects at the undergrad level saying things like ""this is good enough for your undergrad project"" when I wanted to do real research and assess my ability to successfully preform it. I want to work in a lab hoping to get experience at a bit of a higher level now I have a BS. The issue is I cannot afford to be unpaid. I need insurance and income to cover my student debt from undergrad.

3z8wi2,4,2016-01-03,Graduated with a bachelors in Bioengineering and feel depressed about my job search. Any advice for landing a fairly decent entry level engineering job?,VortexK,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3z8wi2/graduated_with_a_bachelors_in_bioengineering_and/,"Hey,

I graduated a couple months ago from a state university with my bachelors in Bioengineering (3.73 GPA, Magna Cum Laude). I never found an internship because I kept doubting myself and comparing myself to majors I believed were far more equipped to handle engineering related careers (mechanical and electrical engineers). Here's the program that I went through.

https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/student-services/advising/current/pdfs/be_2012_guidesheet.pdf

I feel like I learned something through the program but I don't have relevant real world experience with an engineering job. I am working part time right now for a small business doing completely unrelated work. My major interests through the program were bioinformatics, complex adaptive systems, and the data acquisition classes. I really enjoyed applying  my programming skills to create neural networks, genetic algorithms, and run some statistics on data sets. Unfortunately, because I don't have internships, I can only talk about my class projects and I'm not sure how to incorporate that into a resume that will get me noticed. My main concern is feeling unsure of where I fit in as an engineer in today's market. I'm always stressed out and feeling like I wasted my time with the degree. I liked learning the stuff we did and I think I have some analytical and project management skills that are transferable to real jobs but I'm stuck on this mental barrier I've created. I've been looking at entry level jobs on linkedin and found a cool post at Boeing for an Avionics engineer but I lack direction at the moment. 
https://jobs.boeing.com/job/long-beach/avionics-systems-engineer-level-1/185/1199958
This is the job posting. I feel like I'm qualified here and working in the aviation industry would be awesome but I keep thinking my degree will hold me back from interviews. 

I have no idea where to head after college. So I'm asking around and checking certain job related subreddits to give me some career advice. Ideally I would combine my analytical skills with engineering skills.

http://imgur.com/s9JJV7s

Here's my resume that I've mostly anonymized.

My program mostly challenged my applied programming skills and I enjoyed that aspect of Bioengineering but I'm struggling to take this into the job market and sell myself.

Any suggestions? Slap some sense into me or show me some kind of path I can take my life.

It was 2005, XP is the latest shit and the first flat screens showed up. But only in the office building of the hospital. Everywhere else? Windows 3.11,95,98, 100MHz machines, monitors so big you had to fear for the poor desk and floppies. Floppy disks everywhere. The 3 and 5 inch kind.

So one day, one of hospital wings finally got new computers. One day after that, while I was sitting at my desk, I got a call:

&gt;Me: Hello, this is the IT department, Anon speaking. How can I help you?

&gt;Nurse: Hello, this is Hilda (lets call her that) from the mortuary. I tried to access a patients file but the computer won't open the floppy.

&gt;Me: Well, those things tend to get damaged easily. What kind of floppy do you have?

&gt;Nurse: A big one. 

(So a 5 inch, I thought to myself.)

&gt;Me: You did close the lid and you're sure you put it the right way up?

&gt;Nurse: Yeah, this new automatic thing closed on its own.

(Wait a minute...)

&gt;Me: New automatic thing?

&gt;Nurse: Yes. You only have to press a button now and its open and closes automatically.

&gt;Me: Miss, that is a CD-ROM drive. It doesn't work with floppy disks, but with CDs. How did you get it in there anyway? (I already feared the answer.)

&gt;Nurse: Well, I had to cut of the edges, but after that it fitted very well.

---

End of the story is that the floppy was, of course, destroyed and with it 2 years of patient history. Good thing was, there was a back up. On magnetic tape, 10.5 inch."

3zajao,3,2016-01-03,2nd interview with government water pollution agency; help a jobseeker out!,steeeeeeeeeeeeevs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3zajao/2nd_interview_with_government_water_pollution/,"Hi, r/jobs,


A few weeks ago I posted about getting an interview for the field that I had studied in college.  Well, thanks to all the information here, I landed the second interview and now I'm back with a few more questions!  Any/all advice would be very much appreciated; particularly if there are any **utility/government/water professionals** that happen to be browsing.  This is in CA if that makes any difference. 


As I mentioned in my previous post, I'm interviewing for an administrative support specialist I/II position with a water pollution agency (government).  I've done my background research, and think I have a pretty good grasp on what they'll ask/what to say so that's aside.  


What I AM wondering pertains mostly to the 30 minute Excel/Word test prior to my site tour and final panel interview (with 3 managers and an HR coordinator).  


* What Excel formulas and Word tasks should I be able to complete?  I have 6 years of admin support experience under my belt so I'm pretty well versed, but if they use one of those automated tests (yuck) I want to be doubly prepared. 


*  What resources are available to help me train for those Excel formulas and Word tasks?  


And from my last post, which didn't get any responses: 


* I have a small gap (5 months) of unemployment that I need to tactfully explain in my interview. What is the best way to say ""Since July (when I quit my last job) I have been a classified sub at the school district I worked with in the past and have been intently focusing on finding not just any job, but the right job (which I believe in my heart of hearts this job is)."" I want to avoid coming off like I've been getting rejected a lot (which I have) or like I'm not doing anything to professionally develop/keep busy.


* I am up against roughly ~~8~~ 3 other candidates, most of whom are local. This puts me at a disadvantage, I know. I need to be able to explain the distance and why, despite that, I am the best candidate. I fully anticipate a question regarding this and have been trying to come up with the right way to say ""I have targeted this area because of its ecological significance (and economic significance-- huge agricultural industry that benefits from the water treatment/recycling here to abate groundwater withdrawal and seawater intrusion), I want to build a life here, I have always been involved in promoting environmental stewardship here (re: my college internship happened to be in a community about 45 minutes south of this opportunity). Distance or not, I am the best candidate due to my past work experience, my educational foundation in the industry, and my desire for long-term growth with this specific organization. I am relocating full-time (currently I am part time in the area) at my own cost commensurate with the right job opportunity.""


* I also need to have the right way to explain why I quit my past job. My real answer is that I left in the summer months to give the firm enough time to find/train my replacement before the busy season (January-April), but mostly because the work wasn't satisfying and I wanted to rededicate my career/life to the environment and move to my desired location. Previously I've stated in interviews ""I left [firm] in the summer with one month notice to give them the time needed to find and train my replacement before the busy season. I stayed past my notice to train my replacement personally, as the position is very integral to the office functioning, and because in two years I learned a lot of nuances that come with knowing the staff. As an added layer of security, I created a position manual for the new hire with all of this information and other tidbits of staff likes/dislikes, certain VIP client preferences/needs, and all procedures and technologies that would be involved in the job."" Is this what hiring managers want to hear?



Thanks so much in advance! "

Since since I was only 16 when I left high school I figured I'd start studying here for the time being first, I still live at home and tuition is basically non-existant. I was in New Zealand in September 2015 and thoroughly enjoyed it, which is kind of understandable since it was a vacation, but I also figured that studying there might give me most of the things I was looking for in the US, along with some other benefits. I also think it would be a bit more affordable, at 30k € for a year, everything included, more than half of which gets eaten up by tuition :/. **Are there state colleges in the US worth going to for a similar amount?** Also I was one of the better students but still way out of reach for merit based scholarships, I think. 

My second question and why I'm making this thread: **What does the internship situation look like in NZ?** I know in Germany, apart from a very few exceptions they are unpaid, although may CS internships in the US appear to have a nice salary as well. Also, if I were to study say at the University of Otago or Victoria University in Wellington, **how competitve would I be for internships in the US?** My best possible plan for the next years would be to study in NZ for 3 years (thats the normal amount of years for a BSc there), take internships in the US (**what about Australia?**) and later find a job in those countries because frankly the job market for software engineers in NZ doesn't appear to be well paid which would kind of one of the more important factors for me with a high student debt. I know that if I were to graduate in a NZ uni, I could get a working visa for the first 6 months, but **is it unrealistic to think that if I took an internship in the US before and prove myself, this company would go through the hassle of taking care of my visa needs and get me a job after graduation there?**

I haven't heard from a SINGLE place I've applied to, not even one and I am, to be honest, the most down I've felt in my entire life. 

My past:
1: Have a BSc going above and beyond neuroscience program at my university, this involved an extensive amount of anatomy, pharmacology, neuroscience and physiology courses. 
2: I have dissected human cadavers at the university hospital for over a year of experience, most of which was solo cadaver dissection and preparing prosections for medical students while studying.
3: 3 years of volunteer experience at hospitals including emergency rooms and long-term care units.
4: I also held onto a part time position at a grocery store for 5 years from high school and during my first degree.

Me currently:
1: Currently enrolled in my second BSc: specialization in computer science, my GPA in compsci courses is ~3.5.
2: I am going into technically my ""last"" year this semester (Taking 400 level courses like practical algorithmics, operating systems and advanced software engineering. I have already taken all the discrete math and logic, fundamental algorithms, databases, intro software engineering).
Point being: I've not skipped over any courses nor have I taken for granted what I know, I have gone into compsci with the FULL intention to do compsci. 


What I'm hoping for:
Landing an entry level compsci internship or job. I'm not expecting special treatment or have any delusions of grandeur because of my past. I am not looking for something extremely specific that has to be tied to medicine, I am hoping for an entry level position with a friendly and positive environment where I can learn and grow as a software developer.

BUT on the other hand, IF there is a place that is interested in my interdisciplinary background then I really would think that would be an amazing opportunity and no doubt somewhere that I could make a huge impact.

I'm a 4th year CS co-op female student who was lucky enough to obtain an internship at Apple last term and will now be joining Google.

After I obtained an internship at Apple, I remember a couple of guys making remarks that I was only hired because I was a girl. They seemed to say this in a ""joking"" manner but I couldn't help but think that they wanted to get a point across. Although I am admittedly not a girl who is constantly involved with side projects, and even though I believed I did fairly well in the interviews, I couldn't help but be bothered by these comments. The same situation occurred where another person decided to make similar remarks in reference to my Google internship.

Even though I believe that I did fairly well in both of the interviews, I can't help but be bothered by the fact that maybe I was hired to fill some sort of gender quota for the company, which would be incredibly disheartening if true. So, given that many of you have worked at some amazing tech companies before, and since some of you are probably already seasoned employees who know more about the hiring process, do employers sometimes hire candidates based on their gender, or even sometimes, race?

* GPA: 3.645/4.000
* Junior/Senior Year: 3.577/4.000
* GRE: 162V, 161Q, 5.0 AW
* Rec Letters: I have letters from my advisor (computer science professor), one of my professors (another CS professor), and my lieutenant colonel in charge of ROTC at my school.  
* Work experience: I have done training with the Army the last two Summers.  I had an internship with the U.S. Army Cyber Command last Summer given to 6 cadets nationally.  During school my time is almost universally taken up with ROTC; I've had a few very large jobs this year running the program at my school.  

I'm new to graduate school stuff, and I don't really know how competitive I will be for schools I'm applying to.  I'm applying for M.S. programs in CS.  

Schools: 

* Columbia
* UPenn
* Boston University
* Johns Hopkins
* Air Force Institute of Technology
* Naval Postgraduate School
* Georgetown

So, how likely is it that I get into a few of these?  I will have full funding through the Army.

3zgz4f,1,2016-01-04,"SF, Seattle, or Vancouver for a summer/fall 2016 internship: What do you think? (Long post)",alzi22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3zgz4f/sf_seattle_or_vancouver_for_a_summerfall_2016/,"I don't know whether I should do my first internship in Vancouver, Seattle, or San Francisco, with a planned start date of Summer 2016 or Fall 2016. I will try to list the the pros and cons that I have thought through:

**Vancouver pros**:

* It's my hometown

* Rent is cheaper ($800 CAD/month for good quality shared accommodation, close to downtown in a low crime area)

* I could stay at home if I chose

* No hassle moving to another city or with visa issues

* A car-free lifestyle is ideal

* Co-op is an integral part of Canadian universities so seasonal internships are more common among Vancouver companies

**Vancouver cons:** 

* Vancouver's economy is smaller and less developed than SF or Seattle's, plus the loonie is weak so internship salaries seem pitiful by comparison (averaging $3000-3500 CAD/month for Vancouver companies, compared to $7000+ CAD/month down south)

* City is missing some heavy hitters (e.g. FB*, Airbnb, Square, Stripe, Quora, Dropbox**) because its economy has traditionally been centered around mining/oil/real estate

**San Francisco pros**:

* I would be living in a city I've never visited, with LA, Vegas, etc. close by

* The nexus of the global tech industry

* Sky-high internship salaries

* SF is a global city (while Vancouver comparatively is a small town) so it's like being a small fish in a big pond

* Perks are better than at Vancouver companies

**SF cons**: 

* That high salary gets eaten up quickly: expensive rent (assuming the company doesn't pay for your housing), price of gas, employer health insurance premiums, out of pocket co-pay/deductible (assuming Canadian citizens still have to buy U.S. health insurance)

* 2br/3br units are almost nonexistent in the Bay, so if you want to save on housing your choices are Oakland/East Palo Alto/East Menlo Park (crime ridden hellholes) or in the Peninsula/South Bay (suburban hellholes where the 101/680/880 freeways are always jammed, and where Caltrain/VTA/SamTrans have been in need of expansion for 30 years), or live out of a van.

* Quality of life issues having been used to living in Vancouver (The Bay is very sprawling, a car-free lifestyle is difficult, and near-perpetual political dysfunction and social upheaval in SF [specifically] and in California [as a whole] as a whole prevent governments from getting their act together, social unrest [$15/hour minimum wage protests, Black Lives Matter protests, anti-gentrification protests stopping tech employer buses] is substantially more common than in Vancouver*** )

* The libertarian ""brogrammer"" mentality that permeates the Valley. I don't know how I'd react to that having lived in Canada all my life, where ""in this together""/""help each other out"" has been a keystone of the Canadian identity since Confederation (high taxes but strong welfare state, etc.)

* The state has so little water that they literally have to build a desalination plant, Saudi/UAE-style, to not run out. And what's worse is more practical solutions (tell China to piss off and stop demanding water-intensive California almonds) would be political suicide for Jerry Brown or any California State Assembly members.

* Taxes are a bear and lobbying from H&amp;R Block and Intuit (makers of TurboTax) prevents reform (though this is more of a ""living in the U.S."" con)

**Seattle pros**:

* Closer to home

* A lot of the tech companies in SF have engineering offices in the Puget Sound

* Less sprawling than SF

* Public transit isn't as terrible as in SF

* Cost of living is markedly lower than in SF

* No state income tax which makes tax time easier than in SF

* Perks are still better than at Vancouver companies

**Seattle cons**:

* Still pretty sprawling, especially if your office is on the Eastside

* Top 5 worst traffic in the U.S.

* Public transit is good for American cities but can't compete with transit in Vancouver

* Decades of car-oriented sprawl and an extremely regressive tax system means there's no money or political will for the infrastructure projects that are needed. The result is Seattle feels 10-20 years behind where it should be in many areas

* Expensive rent, gas, and health insurance eating up your fat salary is still an issue in Seattle

* Similar quality of life issues that I mentioned for SF also exist in Seattle, to a greater extent than in Vancouver

---

With this in mind, I might be able to turn a blind eye to the cultural/quality of life issues in the U.S., because of the better pay and growth potential. Moving on, I will list the companies that have gotten my attention for internships, at least in Vancouver (I don't know enough about U.S. internships to say). I use the following criteria to judge: whether the perks are decent, the salary is good (my benchmark is $24/hour or roughly $4000 CAD/month), and whether the tech stack is cutting-edge (i.e. I'm not working with CRUD business intellgience in Java/PHP/ASP). 

This automatically excludes two companies: MSFT, which only dues full internships out of Redmond, and SAP (the Yaletown office is responsible for [SAP Crystal Reports](http://www.sap.com/solution/sme/software/analytics/crystal-reports/index.html), which is the epitoime of poor-quality business intelligence designed for bloated public-sector budgets). Conversely, my ""tech whitelist"" consists of one Big 4 and a handful of startups:

* AMZN

* HootSuite

* A Thinking Ape (mobile gaming startup)

* Mobify (mobile eCommerce startup)

* Bench (cloud-based bookkeeping startup)

* Axiom Zen (idea foundry startup)

* Tableau (data visualization startup from Seattle; co-founder is a local; has a better product than SAP)

From the information I've found on the internet, it appears almost all of these companies will offer $5000 CAD/month or thereabouts to their engineering interns. AMZN is the highest at $5300/month, although there are no real perks (besides 100% MSP reimbursement and partial reimbursement of transit passes) from what I've heard. Still, AMZN is the kind of company in whose work I am interested; cutting edge tech and the forefront of computer science.

As for Seattle or SF, I have no idea. I like big data, systems programming, and the modern web, so I wouldn't doing a fall co-op at Uber SF or Uber Seattle. Actually, since I'm a Canadian citizen, I feel it would be better to apply to one of the ""under-the-radar"" startups that aren't in much demand as AMZN/MSFT/FB/GOOG, etc. The only problem there is, while $5000 USD/month might be a fortune in Canadian dollars when you factor in the exchange rate, I'll have to live on that money while I'm in the U.S., and it won't go far. I assume that smaller non unicorn startups will *not* pay for housing  or even give a stipend.

The other problem is, I'm currently in community college right now, and I spoke to an MSFT technical recruiter about three months ago who told me that I would have to be accepted to university and an approved compsci to use her services. That means I would have to apply in the regular stream, or network privately with compsci students at either UBC or SFU such that my resume could be passed on and not get lost in the pile. (The latest I can be admitted into the compsci major at my institution of choice is the Summer 2016 semester, but Fall 2016 seems more likely.)

What do you think? I don't know. Many SF/Seattle startups still hire interns up to the end of April. Who knows? Getting a job down south might work, or maybe I should stay in Vancouver and wait until I'm formally admitted into the major to plan for an American internship. Could you recommend any companies in any of the three cities?

\* The old FB office in Coal Harbour was an L-1 visa holding tank for foreign talent, and it shut down years ago. The largest ""big tech company"" with a footprint in Vancouver would is AMZN, which has 800-1000 engineers in the new Telus Garden building downtown. Oh, and in before ""Amazon's work life balance is literally SpaceX"".

\** - I swear I'm not trying to be a gunner and only focus on unicorns. With that being said, it's not hyperbole to say Vancouver's tech economy is comparatively underdeveloped."

3zh4l8,5,2016-01-04,"Straight out of Tech. College, what should I expect to earn?",xEppyx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3zh4l8/straight_out_of_tech_college_what_should_i_expect/,"So, I just finished my AA at a local technical college that has a pretty good computer and networking program. This program was heavily geared towards server administration, both linux and windows. My instructors gave me varying ideas about what I should expect to earn. Some said $40,000 for server administration.. some said $27,000 - $30,000 for help-desk.

Unfortunately, I started in the summer last year and just finished at the end of this fall quarter. Over the winter break, I got virtually no calls. I had a first phone interview with Nintendo for a graveyard shift the week before Christmas (who has been on vaca until today supposedly) and today I had an in-person interview at a local business. 

Unfortunately the local business was only looking to pay was $13.50/h and it was really help-desk oriented. My peers that completed at the same time as me are making over $18.50/h .. but they have previous non-related experience (one was a truck-driver). Not to sound cocky, but I graduated as the best in my class with a 3.99 GPA (that one A-..)

I have no real experience except a 6 month internship with my school's IT department under the Network Architect and a System Administrator. Both of whom are willing to give me great recommendations. 

I only have my Security+ and I have in-depth knowledge of virtualization, AD/Exchange user account management, DHCP + DNS, CENTos, 365, EMC San Management software and countless other skills.

Is the lack of callbacks just because it was the holiday season? Should I accept this $13.50/h job? or lower my expectations quite a bit and keep looking? Oh and just an fyi, I am in the northwest, there are plenty of tech jobs here.. but also plenty of tech people.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

  * have 2 summers worth of internship experience programming models in the financial industry, and doing a bit of DBA (using R, SQL and C#)  
  * 11 years programming experience so I'm comfortable learning most non-esoteric programming languages

Planning on applying for some kind of J-1 visa this summer, but that's obviously only temporary (I have another year in university left, afterall!). What's the best course of action if I want to eventually move to America? I assume that moving right after graduating might be a bit tough, given the competition for H1-B places, so I presume I'll be working here for a bit first. Is applying to the financial industry any easier to apply for than the big name consumer companies? I've also heard about internal transfers being another way of getting residency in America, but I didn't think that gave you a green card?

(CS student),PresCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3zifi6/should_i_quit_my_parttime_retail_job_and_pursue/,"First off, hello everyone! I have lurked this subreddit for a few months and you guys have helped answer several questions I have had about CS.

Background info: I have been working since I was 16 and have always moved jobs when advancing was no longer an option and pay was not increasing. Always left on good terms though. So there are no gaps in my employment history. I am 20 (turning 21 in 2 months) and I am currently in my last year at community college and will be getting my Associates in CS either in May or July. I will then be transferring to my two year school and hopefully graduating in 2018.

Current Situation: I currently work at Target and make $12 an hour (a year ago when I started it was $11.50) as an inventory associate. The pay is good compared to what my friends are making but the job is VERY physically demanding and leaves me exhausted most of the time. The co-workers are....well it's retail so annoying, rude, lazy, etc. I work 30 hours a week with a general 3-4 class load per semester and 1-2 classes over the summer. As a result of this job, I have had 0 time to work on side-projects as many here suggest that we CS students do. This has me worried about applying for internships. I don't want to apply to these places early and risk getting rejected and never being able to apply again due to my lack of side projects. I have taken three cs classes (java), all math classes (excluding calc 3) and 90% of the gen ed classes.

Crucial information: I do split semester fees with my parents while I pay for books, parking pass, etc. I have a decent amount in my savings account. Most importantly I bought a car last winter since the beater one that I got from my mom finally kicked the bucket so I DO have an obligation to make my payments on time since I co-signed with my dad. My worry is that if I do land one of these internships what if the hours aren't good/what if I initially get in the door and then I get let go due to only knowing one language or having no work experience in IT?

This is a bit of a mess but I would GREATLY appreciate any advice that you guys have for me because I have an itch to get my feet wet AND have the energy to work on side projects after work. Thanks

Hep C is very difficult to catch through sex. It is spread by blood. By clean  I mean that I ALWAYS use condoms and shower between every call. You'd never catch anything from me unless you shared a needle with me and i don't use anymore.
[Fair enough.  Not so sure that's what most clients might think when you say clean, however. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3zi1hj/iama_prostitute_ama/cymdy6b?context=5)|Clients don't have to worry about catching anything from me. As I stated multiple times, I use protection every time.
[I'd like you to comment on personal safety.  I suspect that being a prostitute has to be really scary at times.  Do you carry a gun?  Mace? a knife?  Do you have a process where some third-party knows where you are in case something goes sideways?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3zi1hj/iama_prostitute_ama/cymblio?context=5)|I carry mace and I take my boyfriend with me everywhere i go. If I walk into a call and he doesn't hear from me within 5 minutes, he is on his way inside and he is ALWAYS carrying. He needs a phone call from me within the first 5 and he needs to hear me say I am okay and that I've received my pay. I tell him how long I will be, if I go over that time by even a minute without letting him know, he is on his way inside. He ALWAYS assumes the worst.
[Any stories you can tell about he coming in at the 5 min mark?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3zi1hj/iama_prostitute_ama/cymd8rc?context=5)|They're all the same, really. They come quick and get embarrassed. One guy wanted his money back (he didn't get it). One guy once used some lame excuse about how he hadn't had sex in years (forgetting he had just seen me a week prior). He was a junkie.

[What is the worst kind of client?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3zi1hj/iama_prostitute_ama/cymb89u?context=5)|The kind that thinks they're ever going to become my boyfriend. And the kind that think they're ""the best"" in the bedroom when in reality they have tiny cocks and have to pay to get laid. The ones that think they'll impress me, or believe me when I tell them they do.

More likely that you'll be robbed. As far as i'm concerned, I've built a clientele that trusts me and knows I'm the real deal.
 |How safe am I?
 |I am never safe. I put my life in danger every day I do this. That just comes with the job.

I'm wet right now just talking about sex, and i'm not even talking about things i enjoy, lol. My girl is just always ready to go.
 |No, I don't ever really enjoy it, and they very rarely make me orgasm.

3zjj6p,3,2016-01-05,Looking for hourly/salary rate estimates for graduate CS students for co-ops internships in Boston,focusandachieve,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3zjj6p/looking_for_hourlysalary_rate_estimates_for/,"Hey all

I posted a lot of background below, but just as a question, what's the average compensation for a graduate CS Co-op / intern in Boston? 

Friends have told me that the average starting salary of a CS undergrad out of school is 75-80k in Boston. I've tried to get a sense of what would be reasonable for my experience level, but it's hard to find accurate information.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I'm technically entering my 2nd Co-op at my company in a mostly network engineering role, although my primary boss is moving me towards more computationally heavy tasks. There's a lot of detail I'm leaving out, but while network engineering is interesting, it's not why I'm getting my Master's in Computer Science. Ideally I'd like to go into Data Science of some variety. The position I have now could evolve towards that, as it's a startup and has an enormous backlog.

Bearing that in mind, I was fortunate enough to start an app development contract on the side which pays 40% more than my main job.

Unfortunately my primary role is not paying enough to be comfortable. i'm also delaying graduating too, and I find myself a bit exhausted switching gears between school and work. I could be taking 4 courses instead of 2. I could take out larger student loans to help bridge the gap if I needed to. 

All of that to say, I'm not happy with what I'm being paid in my current role. I don't have daddy dearest to bail me out. I have to pay all my own bills.

My primary position was a good first sink/swim role. I learned a lot. But since it's not my area of interest, I also don't want to get pigeon-holed in these types of tasks.

I made this clear to my boss, and they're willing to work with me on projects that are more suited to my strengths, but they're not really willing to negotiate. 

I feel like they're lowballing me when talking numbers. Specifically, I think I should earn at least enough to be comfortable financially if I'm going to burn the candle at both ends and work and go to grad school.

My options are to leave soon and pour myself into this contract that pays more. Take 4 classes and graduate more quickly. That contract ends at the end of January however, and there's no guarantee of future work with them, although they've talked about my role turning into a app development role.

I could continue my primary role for another couple months at least until I find out if the development role will become permanent. 

My third option is to take out large enough student loans so I can just focus on school right now. 

Last semester was a struggle. Academically, personally, and ultimately financially. If anybody has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it. "

The stress of not making any money at all is getting to me and I find it harder and harder to find a job in my field that doesn't require me to have all of my own equipment.

I'm considering changing to another career path but would probably have to go back to school. I like computers and I am prefer to work indoors. That being said I am not opposed to occasionally doing outdoor work.

I probably sound like a whiny bitch or something but I need to get paid and I find it hard to find a job that doesn't actively try to screw me over out of money.

I'm currently a Sophomore at University of Nevada, Reno. 3.4 GPA, had a 1970 SAT and 29 ACT back in high school, experience with 2 startups (neither had a live product), 2 research projects (neither of which I published on or had my name posted somewhere in reference to). I enjoy the CS program here, but I feel like I'm at a disadvantage from the lack of name recognition and lack of interesting companies to intern with in the area. I'm really interested in transferring to a school in one of the big tech hubs. My dream schools has always been Stanford and University of Michigan Ann Arbor because of their learning technology (Coursera, GradeGraft, etc) - that's the sort of innovation I'd love to be a part of. I don't think my GPA/test scores are quite up to par for it. I'll still apply for them, but I'd like to have more realistic options that still put me in the heart of technology.

So far, my ""most realistic"" options I'm looking at are San Jose State, SUNY/CUNY, and Washington State University. Is there anything I should do to really make my application stand out? Are there other schools that I should definitely be considering?"

My main concern is receiving an internship offer for the summer. I have applied to plenty during the fall semester when I had a 3.3 GPA yet no company has responded in any way. Are my chances greater to receive an offer this semester since I am adding EE field knowledge to my resume? Also, should I apply to ME internships?

So I've been at the same place for about 14 months. My duties include: exchange administration, VoiP administration, ADUC and all the lovely duties to managing AD objects (yes including some password reset and overall user issues, security groups, DLs etc), break/fix stuff, administration of building security systems, and some minor infrastructure stuff like re-patching the server room, moving racks, monitoring server health etc for about 400 users. Also I am one of two guys using Powershell to both do regular admin stuff and create tools for the helpdesk.

I'd classify myself as a lower tier sysadmin or a higher tier jr. Yes more than a third of what I do is helpdesk. That's the way it goes.

So everything is humming along nicely, have a great team, great boss and great environment. Then one day, my admin account was revoked completely and my exchange admin account deleted. I was then told to figure out what I needed access to and put in a request to get ""something like it"" back.

I can no longer do 90% of my job. I just feel...shocked. Bushwhacked...Like my career has regressed to that of an intern. This decision happened above my bosses head and when I went in to request this situation be explained I was told ""there were too many domain admins so you were removed"". I've tried suggesting some alternatives like granting elevated privileges on every user endpoint and several key servers that run the day to day stuff but was shot down.

I don't even know where to begin in terms of processing this. Any insight or help is much appreciated."

Preferably, I would like to secure an internship in either London or anywhere in the US - I would need to apply for a work Visa for the States. If I had the choice, I would love to work in finance for a hedge fund, investment bank, or anything similar. However, I am completely open to anything software development related at all.

&amp;nbsp;

Although I have a high GPA and a great love for programming, I really haven't developed any of my own side projects other than just a couple of coding challenges on /r/dailyprogrammer, Project Euler etc. I also have no previous work/internship experience in anything Computer Science related. 

&amp;nbsp;

Despite this lack of experience and practice, I feel as though I am quite a proficient programmer given the stage in my degree I'm currently at. I know C, C++, Java, SQL and have recently begun studying Python in my own time. I have thoroughly enjoyed my Data Structures &amp; Algorithms classes ahead of any others. I also have a keen interest in mathematics and problem solving as I was a 2nd year student in a Mathematics degree before realising I would much prefer to be focusing on Computer Science and so transferred course.  It seems as though my only way to show these skills of mine is through my GPA, as well as specific grades for relevent modules and classes, and so I feel as though I would not have anything else to make myself stand out against other camdidates.

I've been having some trouble looking for my first ever job during my time studying CS at school. I've had a few interviews with various companies, but they somehow have all ended terribly  with them not responding after the interview. 

Since I'm in school, I've asked for help from my co-op office for advice on how to prepare my self better for success in a interview but they really haven't been much help at all. 

I've also read parts of Cracking the Coding Interview and various websites to prepare my self for these interviews. But when it comes to the actual interview where I'm asked to answer the CS related question such as using/creating an algorithm for a word problem, I get frustrated/stumped by the question and am unable to give the right answer.

At this point of time I'm not quite sure what I should do and was thinking of going strait into 4th year. 

Is there anything I could do to prepare myself better for a CS interview. I really don't feel confident in what I'm doing right now will lead me to an internship.

Any help would be great. 

Thanks"

What is the best way to ask for a sooner meeting with X?,memes_everywhere,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3zlu0l/internship_question_a_meeting_with_company_x_was/,"As background, I am a grad student.

So the situation is: I worked on a project for company X (CX) in one of my classes, which is a large tech company. After the project was finished, I talked to the person from CX who periodically visited our class to update us and oversee our projects about internships, and they set me up with the head of their department. This person in turn said they'd like to set up a face-to-face with me during the week of January 18th.

However, today I just had a second interview with company Y (CY), who will get back to me within the next week, and knows about the potential meeting with CX.

Is it rude to ask for an earlier meeting time than the one offered by CX because you know an offer from CY could be coming before you get the chance to speak to even speak with CX? Do you tell this to CX as the reason for asking? This is what I was thinking of doing.

Thanks for any advice!"

I know that Seattle has a lot of cs students already coming from places like uw seattle and bothell, and being a student of OSU's post bac program, do you find it difficult to find positions competing in this kind of environment?

I ask because I know that Seattle is well up there in terms up tech companies and makes it more attractive so I assume that competition may be greater in this area as oppose to other places because of that reason."

Could you guys give me some suggestions for a good laptop? I'm okay with laptops which aren't available in Netherlands cause I can compare specs, but would prefer models available in The Netherlands.

* Country of purchase: The Netherlands/Holland

* Budget range: €800-€1200 willing to go abit above budget if it's really worth it.

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Desktop replacement. I use my laptop alot on my internship where I'm making concept art for games. In my spare time I use it for some light gaming/browsing/school related stuff.

* Screen size preference: 15 inch or bigger

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): I don't game that much, but when I game I play games like: League of Legends, Maplestory, Guildwars 2, Terraria, Skyrim, The Witcher 3.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): I will be using my laptop mostly at work, where it will run Photoshop or Blender 99% of the time. So an IPS screen and good performance in Photoshop and Blender are musts.

* Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): Will be carried around daily, but weight is no problem. I'm a strong guy :).

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): No Lenovo or Packard Hell.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I like how most MSI laptops look: big, slick and premium.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: * Build quality -vs- Low price: Build Quality and high performance are important for me. I will be using this laptop for atleast 3 years :).

**List any critical features:** An IPS screen and I heard I need an i7 for good photoshop performance. And is a 960m enough for good Photoshop performance? Will be doing tons of photo editing and painting.

**Which features would you pay a premium for? ** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): My current laptop an Dell l702x gets really hot. A good cooling would be nice...

After graduating I did a small bit of travel and then came home to work. I needed any job and was fortunate enough to get a job at Apple as a part of one of their support teams.

My manager is all about growing our skills and believes employees should be working to grow their career within Apple, no matter what position they hold.

My current position does not align with the career path that I want but I may have the possibility of pursuing that in 9 months time when by company policy, I'm able to apply for any other job internally. (Have to work a position for 12 months before changing position)

Would I be better off leaving and looking for work at the I.T helpdesk with a smaller company and work towards moving up to sysadmin or should I stay with Apple and hope for the best when I try pursue a more desirable position when I can apply for one?"

tl;dr: Most rigorous

**Awards:**

* Honor Roll

* Best in Economics

**Extracurriculars:**

* Ran an online currency resale business with a partner (we coded an autobuyer for FIFA Ultimate Team and then sold the trading profits online. Together, we probably made around $7000 in two years. During this time I also became moderator of a subreddit that had over 250,000 monthly page views at its peak in order to facilitate the selling) (9-11)

* Created a program that helps CS:GO players catalogue their progress (12)

* Completed a 6-month business plan program at a local finance-focused college (11)

* Varsity Tennis (10-11, won't pursue it further)

* Risky Common App/UC Prompt 2 essay about being the captain of a semi-pro CS:GO team (see [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3c7c6l/how_are_esports_viewed_in_an_application/))

* Solid UC Prompt 1 essay about coming from an ever-changing world and hence not having plans for the future and just being adaptable

* Feel confident in my supplements. ""Why Northwestern"" was pretty unique and I feel like I captured the essence of NYU and Columbia fairly well in their supplements. My Harvard/Princeton supplements talk about the autobuyer I mentioned earlier and to be honest, if any one thing will get me in there, it's that one. That essay was amazing and my counselor, while editing it, exclaimed ""Wow, you might actually get into Harvard with this!""

**Rec Letters:**

Obviously I haven't actually seen them so I'm just going off of my feeling and what my counselor has told me:

* 10/10 amazing from CompSci teacher

* 6/10 meh from Physics teacher

* 8/10 solid from Economics teacher

* 7/10 solid from prior head of secondary education (K-12 school)

* 11/10 incredible counselor report. He told me he had to tinker with the formatting to fit it all on two pages - the limit is one.

**Schools:**

* Columbia College (top choice)/Harvard/Princeton

* UC Berkeley/UCLA/UCSD

* Northwestern

* NYU CAS (demonstrated interest by visiting)

* Boston University/Fordham (can I squeeze out some merit scholarships here?)

Additionally, someone from my class got accepted Columbia ED, and she was a literally perfect applicant: 4.0 GPA, 2160 SAT, incredible ECs, the best rec letters ever and presumably amazing essays. There's no way I'm going to be able to live up to her in any regard except for standardized tests, diversity and maybe essays. I feel like I'll be compared to her no matter what happens, which will inevitably sway admissions towards the big fat ""Denied"". Then you also have this one girl who got deferred from Harvard today and will now also apply to Columbia. Once again, she's a great applicant - 4.0 GPA, 2250 SAT, and the rest of her application is also presumably on a similar level to mine.

Basically, I guess my worry boils down to being compared to others, which might leave me behind. Or maybe they'll take all three of us? Who knows. Will admissions compare me to other applicants from my school, especially already accepted ones? Will they even accept more than one applicant from a school?

Thanks and good luck to all of you!"

Could legal action be necessary?",BingApes33,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3znulr/i_live_in_the_same_neighborhood_as_the_nypd_cop/,"The officer who killed Eric Garner in an illegal choke-hold and sparked an international race debate as well as the Black Lives Matter movement is named Daniel Pantaleo. I don't have the same exact name as him verbatim, but I'm 1 letter off from his exact name and tons of blogs, news sites, and papers have misspelled Daniel Pantaleo's name to the exact spelling of my name. As a consequence of this irresponsible journalism, I've had my identity mistaken with his and faced tons of threats, intimidation, and fear living in my own neighborhood (where the real killer cop actually lives). The surrounding details only increase the extreme level of coincidence regarding this situation:


1. I've confirmed that I'm the only person living in America with my exact name. Although there are several people named ""Daniel Pantaleo"", there's no one else with my exact name which is 1 letter off.


2. D.P. lives two blocks away from me and has a 24/7 police protection detail stationed outside his house because of all the threats against his life. There are always cops just standing there  guarding his house, which I pass by often.


3. Most people say we look similar at first glance even though I'm significantly younger than him. Like him, I'm a relatively in-shape white male with some Italian features.


4. Because I couldn't find a good summer internship, I took up work with an event-based marketing agency to make money before going back to college. At least twice a week, I had to go to the HRA (human resources administration) in Staten Island to pitch government-paid free phone services to welfare recipients. This HRA is located directly across the street from the site of Eric Garner's murder, where there is a large memorial and most residents intimately knew Garner and his family. My job involved wearing a name tag and approaching/talking to the people in this community. I also happened to be sent to this location on the anniversary of his death this past summer, where there was a huge protest, lots of media, and Garner's whole family. People actually thought I was that cop all the time and I faced much easily avoidable intimidation, threats, and subsequently loss of income due to poor job performance (the job had commission-based incentives). 



After realizing all these things, I reached out to all the massive news outlets who misspelled his name to be mine and asked them to fix it. They all complied except for the website with the most-viewed article regarding the matter, which failed to answer me twice (I included that I'm incurring damages and would sue) and still hasn't fixed it - perpetuating this mistaken identity problem through pure negligence. I came to some lawyers asking if I could sue this website (which happens to be a decently known multimillion dollar media conglomerate) - they told me the case would be really solid but I don't have enough proof of damages. But how do I prove threats and intimidation that only occurred in-person? I used to get threatening phone calls to my house all the time but don't have any recordings of them (they resumed around the time of the anniversary of his death yet we never managed to capture a recording of one). Now I have anxiety about my family's safety in our home while I'm away at school. How do I go about proving the damages and even if I can, does this present a very strong case to sue the media conglomerate? Are they likely to simply settle? It's also important to note that I'm a broke student and can't afford lawyer fees. One lawyers tried to offer me a package where I had to pay around $2,000 for them to send them a letter and try to get a settlement but it seemed like a gimmickey and manipulative lawyer and I said if they were so sure of a settlement why don't they just do that work for a large percentage of the pay-off (they didn't want to do that).  So yeah, that's my really weird situation in a nutshell and I figure /legaladvice is the best place to take this"

Does this send up any red flags in their eyes? And would they question why it took so long, such as if I was working or not during the time?
What if I graduated when I was 25, and didn't have any work experience outside of internships? 
What I'm trying to get at is it may take awhile to graduate due to personal reasons such as health and family, so I've been avoiding going to school full time/working while in school. I'm worried it may look like I was just lazy in the eyes of an employer.
The other thing I was wondering about, is it possible/does anyone have experience with earning scholarships from 4 year universities, while they were attending a community/technical college? Like in my case, I didn't get the best GPA in high school due to being sick a lot, but if I maintained a 3.5-4.0 GPA while at community college, is it possible to receive scholarships from 4 year institutions, and what kind as well? Possibly even a half ride? I'd imagine universities would reach out to 2 year schools and try to recruit high GPA students with scholarships.
Anyway, thanks for any responses!"

[TELL THE GAKMEISTER STORY.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/3zllqw/i_worked_as_an_intern_for_nickelodeon_during_the/cyn2xgf?context=5)|Probably more anticlimactic than you think... I was trying to prank one of the camera guys at first by filling a pepsi can full of slime. But he didn't fall for it, so we tried a few other people but again no one took the bait. Then I got the idea to prank the gakmeister and the camera guy was in on it too. During the show the gakmeister would always roll on set with a cart full of maybe 12 5-gallon buckets of slime/gak. And on that cart was always a can of pepsi. So, at some point he left his cart and his soda behind... so I swapped it out with the slime filled can. And we waited. A short while later, he walked up and guzzled that can like you would on a hot ass day in Florida. Then he exploded. Slime spewed from his mouth and out his nose and he was not happy. The camera crew and I were laughing our asses off, but yet the gakmeister (who was also a comedian in his spare time) did not see the joke. Needless to say, I never made slime after that day because he refused to talk to me. So I kept to my other lame art dept duties. There you have it.

[Favorite sliming setup ever?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/3zllqw/i_worked_as_an_intern_for_nickelodeon_during_the/cyniafx?context=5)|There was one setup where the kids had to hand crank a bicycle peddle that would pump slime into a canister above them. When it filled it would pour on them. That setup was crazy dangerous and always broke. One time the bike chain snapped off and hit a kid. Not a serious injury but still wild.

Or go to the warehouse to pick up other props. Thats where the original nose and mouth are from Double Dare... and this was before camera phones so I never got pic of them.
 |One day I had to make cow patties. I cut out plywood, sprayed foam insulation on it in the shape of cow shit and spray painted it brown... I don't think that game ever made it on the air.

The main host was kinda cool, only really ever talked to him once. He told me he lied on his resume to get the job.
[Do you have any great stories? does slime and gak stain your clothes??](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/3zllqw/i_worked_as_an_intern_for_nickelodeon_during_the/cyn33qy?context=5)|The wardrobe dept always supplied us with tshirts to wear so I didn't have to worry too much about it... but it did stain my arms a bit, but it all washes out.

3zoeqr,0,2016-01-06,What are some good resources for writing a technical essay?,molotoviphone,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3zoeqr/what_are_some_good_resources_for_writing_a/,"I have an assignment to create a resume by Sunday. I am a freshman EE major, and I have never created a ""technical"" resume before. I am looking for your advice on what resources I should use to create a freshman essay that can be used for an internship or a school job.

Relevant stuff - 3.1 GPA(not stellar, but I want to step it up ASAP. It was a start I am okay with, however).

Computer science lab(in-class)

IEEE workshop(required for an intro class, but it was 2 hours once a week and very hands-on)

One quarter's worth of C++ info(I did well enough in the class, but don't want to oversell myself)

Sons circuitry and oscilloscope experience, as well as knowledge of arduino and programming things such as tank bots with attached arduino boards and sensors 

Does anyone have any good resources that they consider useful? Normal resume websites just don't seem suited to technical stuff."

3zpbee,2,2016-01-06,Finding job when we have experience in different technologies,Sebaall,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3zpbee/finding_job_when_we_have_experience_in_different/,Hi. Recently I've started iOS dev internship which may in future segue to regular job (it's fairly small company and they basically treat interns as very entry level employees). It's my first programming job and I have a question. Let's assume that in few years iOS development market will start to decline. How hard would it be to find next job in e.g. web-development/backend? How such candidates are treated? Of course I know that I have to learn new languages/technologies and not to be focused only on iOS-related things. So basically the question is: Is it easy to find new job in completely new technological stack when we have work experience in completely different stack? 
3zpf01,0,2016-01-06,"There's a 95% chance I've flunked out college, because I didn't handle it right.",FirstThrowawayOf2016,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3zpf01/theres_a_95_chance_ive_flunked_out_college/,"Hey everyone, I've made this throwaway because I felt the need to talk about some dumbass choices I've made during and for this previous semester. First, I'm going to start with a little background.

I've just turned 21 and I've been working with some levels of depression and anxiety in the last couple of years. It was certainly at its worse when I was 17, but it's gotten to a more stable level in one sense where I'm not working through panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, but in another unstable sense it's affecting my current work ethic where I've been prone to states of concentration loss and easily forgetting things. Sometimes I feel like that last part may be an excuse but I don't see what else could be the reason for these lapses I've been working through.

Anyway, so with these factors in play, I'm going to talk a bit more about this semester. I just transferred in a year ago to this 4 year college after receiving my associates degree from a local community college. Now, I've always been very nonchalant when it comes to school (That sounds bad already, huh) because while I'm the type to thoroughly study through something once my interest is piqued, I've had bad experiences in previous schooling that's caused me to keep myself involved in school from an emotional distance. It's almost comical in a sense that my interest slips once the subject is presented in a classroom setting, but it's suddenly worth spending hours on the internet over once I discover it myself. I also have a terrible track record with getting small homework assignments done, mainly because I've found them to be nothing short of draining and time sapping. It's a bit of an oxymoron when I'm more liable to write a long paper for a course but I need to be pushed to do a 10 question fill in sheet. Of course, this trend has followed me in a bad sense where I've been under-prepared in classes for pop quizzes or tests. 

This trend has really screwed me this semester since this was the bane of every class that I had enrolled in. I've done (and still currently doing) an internship this semester at a nearby non-for-profit, and there was a constant stream of tedious homework assignments that I would rarely get done. To top it off, I chose a roster of classes in a bunch of extensive, different topics that really strained me to keep my focus intact while dealing with the issues I mentioned above. Here's the kicker: Because of a late grade entered in my previous semester along with doing horrible in one of my worst subjects (Foreign Language), I was automatically placed under academic probation from the College's automatic bot, and there was no leeway for me to reason with the deans/counselors of my college due to a lack of proof that I did not hand in an assignment late. 

I finished this semester the best that I could with the time I had available to me, and a lot of effort put into getting the best grades that I could for my final exams. Because of my homework discrepancy, and because of unpredictable personal matters this semester (Loss of a family member, another family member had cancer which put a strain on the household), I am now LITERALLY .075 points below the threshold to be within the college's official minimum GPA tolerance. I've emailed my professors explaining the situational circumstances in a bid to do anything to get just a couple more points onto my grade to help recover that .075, but it seems very likely that I'm going to be kicked out of the college, and lose 28 credits that I've taken towards my bachelors.

Now, the fortunate/blessed parts? My mother and father are being understanding after explaining the issue of concentration with them (They've mentioned that they've noticed it in my day-to-day behaviors), I've been reconsidering my major as of late (Psychology is interesting but I'm not sure if this is something I want to major in any longer due to job security), and I honestly feel much happier working in a job setting instead of a school setting. I'm glad that I have my associates degree, so going back to school will start with 60 credits at the very least.

The actual bad parts? The feeling of letting down my parents and wasting their money that helped pay for my schooling, the self-inflicted let down that I've actually been kicked out from an academic institution, and the feeling of shame once certain friends catch on to what's happened to me. I'm probably just going to say that I'm taking some time off from school, but even then, that feels a bit embarrassing for me. 

As far as what now, I've become interested in the idea of learning computer science (programming) and I've spent the last couple of days utilizing whatever resources are available for free; Codecademy certainly hasn't been treating me wrong. I'm also going to try to grab a job, hopefully something like a bank where I'll be paid enough to keep steady and help pay for bills, etc.

Anyway, I wrote this on this subreddit for a reason. I want to use my current story as another read for a redditor that may be struggling with mental health issues, stuck in the contemplative phase after noticing bad school habits, or is even unsure as to whether they'll be able to handle a schedule with a wide variety of intensive courses. 
I took this semester thinking that I will be able to have this all under control and lift the probation status off my record as if it was never there. However, because I didn't work through my own inherent problem towards ""pesky homework assignments"", consider my current ability to concentrate on school studies, plan my schedule accordingly to work harmoniously in the intensive subject matters I was studying, or even consider to give myself enough time to do all of this because I thought I could do an internship as well, I am now probably going to be dropped from my college because of .075 points, with the only possible way to remain enrolled is through a professor feeling generous enough to help me out, or through a special review process through the Dean's office if they'll even give me that.

If you're dealing with something or you're aware of a certain problem, give yourself room to work with. Whether it's scheduling, a constant mood/thought process, certain things happening in life, a lack of push to fix an inherent problem: just give yourself room to work with. I feel that I certainly did not handle things correctly this way, and I really hope that the next time I'm pursuing my bachelors degree, I will have everything in check and do it right that time around.

3zpgt0,823,2016-01-06,(WY) Manager threw my laptop out the window and fired me - can I get him or the company to pay for replacement?,upsetandhavenolaptop,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3zpgt0/wy_manager_threw_my_laptop_out_the_window_and/,"It was my first day as intern, and I didn't know that personal laptops weren't allowed in the work place (I use my laptop for modelling, compiling, programming, media management - it's my work tool) when I came in, and everyone at work seemed fine with it and didn't raise an issue.

Then enter bastard manager. He is fuming that I bring a personal laptop to work, barks at my audacity and disrespect, and my attire (I don't have a suit ready - I wore a decent albeit a bit wrinkled dress shirt and good pair of pants to go with it, and a tie which I thought should be good enough - it was for the interview). As I try to jump in and defuse the situaiton and explain that it was my first day, my manager gets even angrier for interrupting him. 

He then chucks my 1300 dollar laptop straight out the window. 

I absolutely lose it, demand that he pay for it, and it escalates into a full on shouting match where he then fires me on the spot. 

I know I probably won't be able to get my internship back (not that I want to), but I don't know what to do. Company's refusing to take my calls. I try and contact the original supervisor who hired me and who I was supposed to report to in the first place, but she is also not available.

It was a two year old Lenovo laptop which had warranty on it, but the warranty doesn't cover absolute damage like this.

What should I do? "

My university has a job and internship fair during the semester, but it is mostly focused on juniors and seniors, and I really want to start applying during this current semester break.

3zqwtb,0,2016-01-06,"Commuter and college senior here. Should I move out for the last 2 semesters? Uncertain, please advise",Zifferblatt,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3zqwtb/commuter_and_college_senior_here_should_i_move/,"I'm a senior at a large campus on the outskirts of a major US city. For the last 7 semesters I've been living w/my parents and commuting to school. That + scholarships have given me a practically free ride and I'm on track to graduate with zero debt. I have a high GPA and have just been accepted into a fairly prestigious internship downtown.

Now, the problem: For those 7 semesters I've had zero social/extracurricular life and minimal independence. I always returned home soon after class and felt uncomfortable coming home late because my parents would get worried/upset. I didn't want to cause family tension by pushing the issue so I kept my head down and kept thinking of the money I was saving. I'm introverted and not a party type. I'm here for the education, not for random socialization, I thought.

But over the last year I've become more unhappy with this arrangement. I've been occasionally invited to activities with some acquaintances I made, but I always had to refuse. I hit rock bottom over this Christmas/New Year when I spent over two weeks with literally nobody to talk to except my parents. I'm not sure this is healthy at my age. Suffice to say I feel lonely, especially when realizing that almost every college senior has a developed social/professional network by now.

I'm on track to graduate in fall 2016 and part of me really just wants to live on my own at this point. My parents say they can help me pay for an apartment w/roommate(s) somewhere for a semester (I have a little money of my own &amp; will work over the summer). But they are not enthusiastic about it and think I'm being unreasonable when I can just stay with them another year and save lots more money.

My parents already live close to the university and we're next to lots of public transportation. My internship will be time consuming and I wouldn't be around the house much anyway. I'd feel guilty for taking my parents' money at this point when I've saved them 98% of college expenses already. It doesn't make financial sense. Plus there's no guarantee that I will feel less lonely or more engaged if I move away. What's the point if I'm going to be moving out in a year anyway?... Still, I can't convince myself.

I've still got a few weeks to make a decision before the spring semester starts. What should I do?"
3zqzyt,17,2016-01-06,"I messed up my career and am now regretting it (long, but needs to be said)",GreatDay4Hockey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3zqzyt/i_messed_up_my_career_and_am_now_regretting_it/,"This is somewhat of a cautionary tale and something I just need to get off my chest so others don't go in the same direction as me. I plan on turning this into a personal essay at some point, so what I post here may not be as polished as what I hope to eventually publish.

I graduated from a public state school (not a well-known one, but about 10,000 students) in 2008 with a degree in communications. I had written for the school paper and had one internship at a weekly newspaper on my resume, and I'd also been on the editorial staff at School Paper. I expected it to take some time to find a job, but I landed one within three weeks...at a call center, $10/hour. OK, fine. At least it was full-time and I could keep looking for something better since I had two weekdays off. 

About six months later, I got laid off from Call Center due to the economy. I was one of the unlucky 40 who got the axe. I was stressed, but within another three weeks, I had a sales assistant job at a TV station. I didn't really want to be in TV sales, but it was closer to my field of study and knew it could help build my career, so I took it. Unfortunately, the job ended up not being a fit and I got put on a performance improvement plan, then let go seven months after I was hired. Still, I knew the first job loss (call center layoff) had nothing to do with me, so no problem, I could get another job?

That's where it headed south. Nearly seven years later, I never fully bounced back. I was successful at my last job, a media website, until I was again put on a PIP for too many mistakes and fired three months later. (A new boss who took over for my old boss, who never even threatened a PIP, put me on it within six months of his takeover and was intolerant of any mistakes I made during the PIP period.) I hated my new boss, but I was also mad at myself for making enough mistakes to be on the PIP to begin with. I knew it could've been easily avoidable and ended back on the unemployment line. 

Now it's not as if I have any long-term unemployment gaps. I've always tried to find a fill-in job and have done food service and retail stints after being fired, and I've landed them without much issue. But since my last termination, the only job offers I've gotten were for part-time, no benefits roles, including my current position. I love the company I work for and the job isn't super stressful, and I have weekends/holidays off (which I couldn't say about my media job), but every day I think about how I could be doing so much better for myself if only I hadn't screwed up those two jobs where I had PIPs and got fired. Sure, one was seven years ago now, but I went to a job interview where they asked about my work history for the last 10 years PLUS why I left each job, so two firings plus a layoff were likely working against me. And my work history took up the bulk of the job interview so I couldn't deny the problem.

I also know part of it goes back to what I didn't do in college. I should've had more than one internship. I should've networked more. In my senior year of college, I started thinking about working in sports management, not realizing you basically can't get a job in the field unless you do a ton of unpaid volunteering and unpaid/low-paying internships. So while a couple of sports teams have interviewed me, I never get the offer. And yes, I could technically start working my way into the field now, but graduation was so long ago that I'm now 30 and have a lot of expenses that interning will barely cover. And forget financial support from my parents. Hell, I have a friend who's worked for three teams already, and even she admitted part of why she made it is because her parents were able to help her. Even then, she wasn't in a great position financially despite loving her work.

I've basically been a failure to launch.. I look for FT work on my days off and after hours, but with trouble in my early years and not a lot of accomplishments on my resume, all I get is, ""You were great but we went with someone more experienced."" Or ""You interviewed well, but other finalists matched what we wanted more."" 

If I could have college back, I would know what to do. I would've tried to make myself known and understood it's all who you know and who knows you. I would've been hitting the pavement early to volunteer with sports teams and do the internships, even if it meant saving up the whole school year to live on no salary in a Minor League Baseball town in Nowhere, Idaho. And when I got into the real world, I would've figured out what it took to be the best rock star possible so I was in demand for jobs, getting recruited and being able to get multiple offers. My friend in sports I just mentioned? She had 30 interviews and six offers in 2015. I dream of getting just one!

A lot of my friends my age and younger have legitimate careers and decent savings accounts. My boss who fired me in my last job is younger than me and already managing. A friend my age is a sales director. Another got the first job she applied for after graduating college. And she's in finance so I'd imagine she makes good money. 

Really, do not end up like me. Do your internships. Rock out at your job so you're amazing and they can't let you go. Do what it takes to be successful. I'm hoping now to turn my career around, but I can't help but think what potential employers are thinking of me at this point. I imagine a lot of it isn't positive. My mission isn't an impossible one, but it's something I have to take on after years of failure and not working hard enough. 

I hope this helps someone today, and if you've been in a similar place, may we rehab our careers together!  "
3zr3nb,1,2016-01-06,I have a couple of final round interviews with local companies where I go in for half a day and work on an assignment with the team. What should I expect and what is the best way to approach these types of interviews?,PM_ME_YOUR_ALGORYTHM,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3zr3nb/i_have_a_couple_of_final_round_interviews_with/,"*Note: I'm a new grad*

For each of these companies I have not been told much more than that. I've even asked what kind of frameworks and tech I'll be using but they haven't told me much (one told me to just prepare whatever is in the job description, which says ""Javascript and related front-end frameworks."" So that doesn't narrow it down). 

I'm pretty good at algorithm/data structure type questions, and I know my own project history confidently enough to demonstrate technical experience, but I'm really nervous for these assignment type interviews. In my internship my first assignment took me about two weeks to complete (though it was a challenging project and I wouldn't expect the interviewer to give me something of that scale). I still can think of several small bug fixes and feature additions that took 2-3 days and that was when I had an understanding of the code base. This might sound like I'm a bad or slow developer but my supervisors and teammates were all quite happy with me in my formal evals (and I got a return offer, but I'm trying to explore other options first).

Anyways, maybe I'm just psyching myself out or overthinking it. So if anyone has tips or advice, I'd really appreciate it!"

[22 m],CombineOverwatch,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3zrgsp/am_i_dumb_22_m/,"So let me get this started by saying when i finished High School i had no clue what i wanted to do. So i attended a community college for Architecture. And within one year i knew this was definitely not what i wanted to do. So i switched majors to Advanced Manufacturing. (Knowing i was good at that and jobs were needed so it wouldnt be too hard once i got my degree) 

Anyways halfway through my time i got an internship as a machinist. I was starting to realize that i may not be liking Advanced Manufacturing but i decided to just go with it and get my degree. 

I finish and receive my degree and quickly i found a job. Within a WEEK i had to leave because i could not stand it. I wanted to go back to my old job (pays much less). Within the next few months i scored a really high paying CAREER job working as an elevator mechanic. This is the type of job you stay at and build a family around. Although once again, i hated it. I gave it more time and thought and realized i wanted to go back to school for something completely different. I wanted to get into criminal justice. 

So while working as an elevator mechanic, at night i decided to try the intro class to Criminal Justice just to see if i liked it. And i did, i thought it was very interesting. So i planned on leaving and starting my school toward criminal justice. 

Ive been in criminal justice for a year now and unlike machining and being a mechanic, i like it a lot. But the question is, did i make a mistake basically dropping a career and a degree just so i could go back to school for something different? Im not even 100% where i would take my criminal justice degree, all i know is i dont want to go back to manufacturing, despite the large amount of money i could earn.

I feel like a moron for leaving sometimes, as i dont have enough money for some things, but i try to keep my head up knowing id be miserable at my past job.

Am i dumb?"

the thing is that i have to go back to finish school and pay the debt to get my diploma but i have to pay around &gt; 18000 euros or more which for my country its a huge amount of money else i wont get my diploma i get a certificate which is only valid on my country that says that i did finished a major and that i will have my diploma as soon as i pay my debt, my family have money issues and even though i have a nice salary it's only enough to live here. if decide i go back i will have to end my contract here but i can't get the same amount of money or a decent job or even do interesting stuff like i do here.
the normal salary for a graduated student its around 200 - 400 euros max and im earning here four times that amount... so its literally useless to go and finish when i think i can have a better opportunity here for a while until i get enough experience... i want to study software engineer but if i drop out from school they wont give me my highschool papers until i pay the debt which is really bothering me i dont know what to do i want to continue do my work here and learn new things, im actually a decent programmer.
what should i do? drop out from school or from my job? considering that i want to study something different in another country with my own money.
pd: to finish school i have to take 9-10 classes

Do you think its possible to get a job as a software developer without a degree if i decide to go back to my country and then come back?

3zsm76,2,2016-01-06,What do you think about using minimum spanning trees and pseudotime as a supervised differential expression algorithm?,VermillionAzure,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3zsm76/what_do_you_think_about_using_minimum_spanning/,"Hi! I'm completely new to this, so please tell me if something's wrong with that I'm saying.

Right now, I'm in the midst of a bioinformatics internship that works with single-celled RNA sequencing data analysis. However, I've encountered an interesting package called (Monocle)[https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/vignettes/monocle/inst/doc/monocle-vignette.pdf] that relies on this interesting concept of pseudotime and applies graph theory to try and find differentially expressed features from grouped samples.

From what I understand, the analysis consists of four parts. It first represents each sample with a dimension per feature. It then reduces the number of components by trying to find the independent ones. A minimum spanning tree is constructed on the samples, and then tries to find the longest path through the tree. It then finds alternate paths.

These paths represent gradual evolutions of samples where, I think, given the context of cell analysis, we are also looking for a spectrum of differences between cells but also want to find the progression from one state to another--for example, from healthy to cancerous cells.

I just thought I'd post it here and share. What do you guys think about this analysis method? Do you know of similar ones? What do you think this is best suited for?

But I think it’s time that I got a job that has nothing at all to do with IT. I mean nothing. No computers. No keyboards, mice, motherboards, wired networks, wireless networks. Definitely no fucking PEBKAC (look it up; you’ll laugh). And, most importantly and most absolutely, definitely: No backup tapes. Degauss them, burn them in a fire and piss on the smoldering ashes. Your monthly fulls and nightly incrementals can go to hell. Oh, what’s that? You want your most precious files safe, up to the minute? Tough shit. Don’t look at me. Not anymore.

Would it surprise you if I told you I lost my job last week? Right, I know. Probably not. But it’s not what you think. I quit. I had no choice in the matter, really. Sorry if saving my own ass from a psychopathic boss ranks higher in importance to me than my next paycheck. A paycheck which helped keep the beer fridge and herb jar full, and my penchant for pizza and gaming satiated. I'd be fine if that was all I had to worry about funding these days, but since my folks booted me out of the hole in their basement -- after what happened -- I have to add rent to that list. Utilities. And a car payment. And, shit, gas! Otherwise … fuck, I'd be fine not working at all. No job is worth dying for.

One reason I'm having such a tough time finding work is because not only did I quit a paying job with an okay career outlook, I left the next gig -- the one I quit the first one for -- after only one day. I know, I know; I sound like a spoiled-fucking brat, and I wouldn't know a hard day of work if it hit me square in the jaw. ""Ooo, *boo hoo*! You had to live inside the basement of your mommy and daddy's *mansion*. How *dreadful*!"" But you know what? Fuck you, if that’s what you say. You have no idea what kind of life I've led from a few words out of my mouth, so keep your preconceived judgement out of this and hear me out.

There really are very good reasons for both of those employment -- well, *unemployment* decisions. You may not believe me and, hey, that's your prerogative and all that, but at least I'm laying it all out on the line so that some considerate soul might see that I'm not bullshitting here. If it gets me a decent job -- again, not in IT; please God not IT -- talking about all of this again might be worthwhile. I may, you know, die a horrible death and all that from telling the world about this, but I've got little choice.

Back about a year ago, I graduated with a B.A. in Comp. Sci. out of B.U.. About a month before graduation, I had landed an intern-like job with a law office out of Cambridge. I say ""intern-like"" because, unlike an internship, I got nothing in the way of college credit for it, and the pay was about what you'd expect. The office had recently lost their sole desktop support admin, and they needed to quickly fill the role until they could find someone permanent. I didn't ask what happened to the last guy, and I didn't all that much care. I was just thankful he was gone and left the opening there for me.

The typical work day was pretty much your run-of-the-mill desktop support-monkey stuff. Make sure printers were kept full and unjammed. Dealing with malware, overabundance of spam, wifi issues -- that sort of thing. I also had to make sure the tapes from the backup server were rotated out every night. This meant removing the previous night's incremental backup tapes, storing them in the off-site delivery storage container, and placing fresh tapes back into the jukebox for the next nightly incremental run. Except on Fridays -- that was the scheduled full-backup run. My boss, Don Huber, Esquire, insisted on not reusing older tapes, on account of stricter guidelines for data retention in the law office or some-such. The office was on the small side -- about twenty-five people, all of them with desktops. I kept them all working and clean, inside and out. And all of them got backed up, including the on-premise email server.

Toward the end of the last month of my employment there, Huber -- who, I should mention, is one of the three partners of the firm -- called me into his office. Let me tell you this about Huber: I feared that guy. I'm not a small man myself, and I don't tend to intimidate easily, but this guy gave me the fucking creeps. He towered at least six-seven, thin as a rail. His sixty-something-year-old face was gaunt and pale, except for the swollen nose that the man couldn't stop blowing into that godforsaken, crusty handkerchief he kept in his pocket. And his breath; dear lord, his breath. I swear to God a cloud of that shit lingered around for an hour after he left the office. And despite his constant coffee binging, he always looked tired and uninterested in anyone, never smiling past those bloody gums of his. God forbid he ever look at you with his two piss holes in the snow.

""Jonathan,"" he said. My name is Jonah, but I was not about to correct him. ""Close the door.""

That breath. Shit.

Huber continued, in his draw-out, tired way. ""Jonathan."" But that's all he said. Was the guy trying to make me correct him? I didn't take the bait.

""Yes?""

""Backups. You make sure all of our computers and the email are backed up. Every evening. Am I right?""

I nodded.

""And the old backups are stored out of the office by that … something-Mountain place?""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""They're taken every night, about five o'clock.""

""And about how many years of backups would you say they have?""

""Wow. Um … all of them? Say, about seven years worth?""

He considered this a long moment. ""I have an important assignment for you. It's going to take some time. A bit of overtime work.""

Wonderful. ""Okay,"" I said, hoping to sound more disappointed than pissed-off.

""Will that be a problem?"" he asked. Alright, so I sounded pissed-off.

""Nope,"" I said. ""Let me know what you need.""

Huber glared at me. There was no bullshitting this guy. I mean, he's a lawyer for crying out loud; I am not. But I don't think he gave a shit about my feelings, except for making sure that I was sufficiently terrified of him and uncomfortable.

""I'm working on … a case. It's one that is very personal to me. So I need to trust that you will keep the details of what you are doing to yourself. Do not speak of it to anyone else, inside or outside of this office. Do you understand, Jonathan?""

I nodded.

The details of Huber's task were pretty simple, but the deed itself was not. Our nineties-era email server stored file attachments on a local file server, separately from the messages. Huber laid out a rule long ago that the attachment storage had to be cleaned out of everything on the first of every month. Every month! You had to have any documents you wanted to retain printed and filed, then allow the system to automatically purge. Probably as part of some sort of legal thing. Don't ask me; remember: not a lawyer. Now he needed me to go through the past year to retrieve all of his files, for this ""case"" of his. That meant retrieving a shitload of tapes, then spending hours -- make that days -- restoring both the full and incremental backups of every system. A major pain in the ass.

""And, Jonathan. Do not under any circumstances view the files you are retrieving. It is of important … legal procedure that you do not view them. Is that understood?""

""Yep. I mean yes. Understood.""

With that, I'd say he was as satisfied as he was going to be.

The following Monday, two crates of eight-millimeter mag tapes filled the desk in my butthole of a back-room office, and I got to work.

Probably most of you have not worked with these old backup-tape jukeboxes. Well, let me tell you: they suck. They're a pain in the ass to load, and the robotic arm for rotating tapes in and out of the drive is dog-ass slow. I also had to perform the file restores early in the morning, after the nightly backups ran, since I only had the one unit to work with. This is three, four in the morning we're talking, mind you. It was start then or never get anything done for the people in the office all day. You can be sure as shit I was logging all that overtime and strolling into the office later than usual.

At first, the file restores were pretty run-of-the mill crap. Thousands of Word documents and PDFs. Images, probably photos of crime scenes. There were some audio files here and there, too, most likely from testimony recordings and the like. And just like Huber the uber creep asked, I didn't open any of them. That is until the video files started to dump out.

It's like this: Boring does not begin to describe those nights. Brain-numbing. That works. If I was in law school, maybe I could dig into the tomes in office library, read up on some old cases; something like that. Even then, I was barely able to keep my eyes open, so my head wasn't so much ready for soaking in knowledge at that hour. The firewall -- one that I, sadly, still did not control -- blocked access to anything you'd consider fun to watch or read. Managed by some third party or some shit.

And now there are these videos I'm seeing restore back onto the fileserver. Mind you, videos aren't something seen very often within email attachments at that place. I'm not sure they knew how to operate the cameras on their phones, let alone transfer files from one; they weren't the most technical bunch. It was coming on two in the morning, I was bored, and I now had something that could pose as entertainment. So, I double-clicked the first one, and I watched.

What popped into the video player window was … fucked up, to put it mildly. A heavy-set woman, in about her late-fifties. She was bound and gagged, tied to a chair, in what looked like some kind of dirty basement. She was dressed in a soiled, white nightgown, her greying hair laying wet and matted against her face and forehead. At first I thought this was just some disturbing crime scene evidence, that the woman was dead and the camera operator took video rather than stills. Only no one else was in the room. No cops. And the woman was not dead. She appeared to be asleep or passed-out, as you could clearly see she was breathing. The person working the camera rotated around the seated woman, making no sound other than the occasional footfall upon the concrete.

The video turned to focus in on the woman's right thigh, where a smear of blood ran down it from a small wound. The camera came to a stop and clicked into place, presumably into a tripod. A hand came into view then, wearing surgical gloves, holding a syringe. It jabbed into the woman and plunged whatever liquid it held, then pulled away. Some shuffling off-camera, and hands are back again with another needle. Only this one … this one is huge. He inserts this long-ass needle into the woman's leg, right about at the bleeding wound. The hand moves away, and I can see it's a blood-drawing needle, filling something I couldn't see.

About a minute later, the needle is withdrawn. More blood trickles down the woman's leg. A bag of blood swings into view, with ""#000"" sloppily written on it in Sharpie.

A click, and the camera is raised up again, focusing on the woman's face. There's a soft kissing noise, and the gloved hand comes into view again, pressing two fingers against the woman's lips. The video ends.

I closed the video player window and couldn't have gotten out of that place faster than if it'd been on fire.

The next morning, I called in sick. It wasn't exactly a lie; I really didn’t feel well. Add a sleepless night to what I'd just watched, I felt like complete shit. I was told Huber wasn't happy about my being out, personally asking about my work on his ""special project."" Rather than risk getting outright fired, I told them to let him know I'd make it in that night to make progress.

I wasn't sure what to do at that point. I had no idea the context of that video, and I didn't know who it belonged to. As they're stored on the attachment server, they aren’t labeled with what email message they belong to. Without the accompanying email itself, the attachment is just … there. I'd have to restore the old emails as well, if I wanted to match them up. If I let Huber know I was touching those files, he'd shitcan my ass in a heartbeat. For my own sake of sanity, I just assumed it was disturbing evidence for a case long-since closed and went back to work that night.

Around about one A.M., more files were restoring from the tapes -- I was more than halfway done at that point. I take a look at the progress and the expanding list of files. More videos. I wasn't sure I wanted to chance another one, but of course I did. I'm a dead cat like that.

The video I open this time is yet another bloodletting. Same woman, same place. Only this time the woman is much thinner, and her leg is not looking good at all. The wound looks infected and festering, and there's a lot more dried blood. This time, she's not so passed-out, but close enough to it. She mumbles something behind the cloth blocking her mouth, while the unseen cameraman goes to work. This time, the bag he fills is labeled ""#011."" I wasn't watching them in order. Dear God, there were ten more of these? Maybe more?

I opened another video. This time the window filled with something much different; definitely much more disturbing. The camera faces Don Huber's unoccupied desk. The old man comes into view, holding a steaming mug of coffee and a brown paper bag. He sits at his desk and calmly opens the paper bag, removing one of those fucking bags of blood! He holds it up to the camera. It's half-full, with the label ""#008"" written on it. And the old man smiles. He fucking smiles!

That's not the most disturbing part. Huber takes this bag of blood and squeezes about a half-cup of it into his coffee mug. He seals the bag back up again, puts it into the paper bag. He sticks his index finger into the cup, swirls it around, mixing it all up. Then, in a big gulp, it's down the hatch. He swallows down what must've been half the mug. When he lowers his arm, his lips and teeth are stained red. He looks at the camera, and he smiles. Then he laughs. It's not just a chuckle; it's a full-blown cackle of insanity. Tears streaming down the man's face, the laughter becoming more maniacal. He takes another swig. Another, until the mug is drained dry. Again he smiles, and again he laughs. He wipes tears from his face, then walks from behind the desk, off-camera. The video ends.

I’m not sure how long I sat there at my desk in silence. I couldn’t get the sound of Huber’s insane laugh out of my head. I couldn’t erase that bizarre image of him sucking down that concoction and finishing it off with a bloody grin. Enjoying every last drop. And there were more of them. With the files that continued to restore onto the fileserver were more videos. Lots more. I’d like to say that I refrained from watching them. I mean, that’s what a sane, rational person would do, right? That person would have seen quite enough. He’d stop right there, maybe go to the police with that shit. He might get fired for being wrong, and then for opening files he was told outright not to open. But if he was right? Some imprisoned woman is maybe saved and that … vampire gets locked up. I’d be a hero, one who broke the trust of his employer for justice.

Yeah, that worked out well for everyone else who’s blown a whistle. And, shit, I was barely out of college.

The remaining videos were more of the same. Bags labeled anywhere between “#000” and “#021” were filled, then later consumed. Always with the laughter and smiles. Now it made sense why Huber’s breath was so goddamn bad. As I watched the old man cackle in another video, I felt I could smell the rancid odor through the screen.

No, I actually could smell it.

“Jonathan. How is the project coming along?” It was Huber. There, in the office. It was three in the morning, and I was alone with that blood-guzzling freak. I nearly shit myself.

“Uh, Mr. Huber! Hi! Yeah, I, uh. Yeah the restores are still, uh, chugging along. Should be done in another day or so.”

The old man pursed his lips and nodded slightly, not taking his bloodshot eyes off me. He was carrying a coffee mug. *The* coffee mug. Dear Christ.

“Just got off the phone with my mom,” I lied. “Told her where I was and that everything’s good, and I’ll be home soon.” I thought telling Huber I’d be missed would keep me from becoming another one of his blood supplies. His lack of reaction told me he didn’t seem to care.

“Uh, so, what brought you around here so late?” I asked. “Or is it early?”

“Late. High-profile corporate litigation I’m working on. Couldn’t sleep if I tried. This’ll be my home for a while.”

“So … Mrs. Huber — your wife — she doesn’t get upset at you being away?”

Huber narrowed his eyes. Shit. I must’ve touched a nerve. Now I wished I had called my mom. Thankfully, it didn’t take long for his look to soften.

“Lydia … Mrs. Huber is … she’s not well. Bedridden. Has been for months. I have someone taking care of her while I’m … occupied with this case.”

I nodded and mouthed a silent “ah” of understanding.

“Anyway, I’m glad you’re still here, Jon. I’m going to head out now, but I need you to print out a list of the files you’ve been able to restore so far and leave it on my desk. I’ll leave the door open.”

“Uh, sure! No problem!” Thank the good lord, I wouldn’t be alone with him anymore. I hoped the elation in my voice wasn’t too apparent.

Huber left, taking most of his dragon breath along with him. Before leaving myself, I got the file listing printouts and brought them into his office. It’s not often I go into that room. It’s kept locked when Huber’s not around, and somehow he’s kept his PC out of technical trouble, which meant little need for me to enter. And that’s why I’d never bothered to notice the photo sitting on his desk before.

It was the woman in the videos. The bloodied, tied-up woman in the chair. Huber’s wife.

The papers fell from my hand. I gathered them up as quickly as they’d fallen, threw them on the old man’s desk and got the hell out of Dodge.

I went over the whole thing in my head as a sped home. Huber — that sick son-of-a-bitch — had his wife tied up in his basement, draining the poor woman into blood bags and chugging her down like some sort of macabre breakfast drink! And then the smiling. The laughing! Tears of laughter, drinking every goddamn drop. What the hell was he? And why in God’s name was he taking videos of the whole process? He had to be emailing them off to someone. But to whom? And why?

The sun was rising by the time I walked in the door at home. Needless to say, I wasn’t much ready for sleeping. Rather than dwell further on what I’d just learned about Huber, I got to work on the most logical thing I could think of: My resume. I was getting the fuck out of that office as soon as possible. Either Huber would be caught and taken to jail, causing the whole firm to crumble and all of its jobs along with it, or that vampire would find me fit to fill more blood bags. No thanks.

Having sent my resume off to as many IT support job postings as I could find and fit into, I finally passed out on my keyboard, at about ten in the morning. By the time I woke up early that afternoon, I had a voicemail from a recruiter from one of the jobs I’d applied for. I called them back, set up an interview for the following day, and headed back to work. I had a little skip in my step, knowing it may not be so long before I wouldn’t be going back there anymore.

Inside my office, the printouts from the previous night sat on my desk. A Post-It note stuck to the top of the pile had Huber’s handwriting on it.


*Continue project. MOVE all files ending in .M4V onto USB storage. DO NOT OPEN THE FILES!*


The video files. Of course that’s what he wanted. The crazy fucker wanted to keep them all for posterity or something, then probably take the tapes and have them destroyed. Sure, I wanted to get the hell out of that job, but I did not want to let Huber get away with what he was up to. I decided that not only would I copy those videos to a USB key for Huber, I’d make a copy for myself, along with the emails they attached to. I just needed to complete the file recovery that night, then restore and save the emails from the same time period with my own copy. With that, I could send it all off to the cops, anonymously, and hope they nail that creep and save his wife before she’s nothing but dry flesh and bones.

I managed to avoid Huber that entire day. I swear to God I thought I heard him cackling laughter from behind his closed door on a few occasions.

That bony finger, swirling around in his mug. That blood-stained grin.

As the next dawn crept up on me, I had completed restoring the last of the incremental backups. I had fifty or sixty videos stored onto two USB storage keys: one copy for Huber, one for me. As planned, I restored all of the old emails for myself as well. I left Huber’s copy on the desk in his office, which was thankfully unoccupied, and left for home to get some sleep. I had an interview to rest for, for a job I hoped I could start ASAP.

The interview was for ten that morning. After about five hours of shut-eye, I downed a pot of coffee, primped myself up and arrived with a little time to spare. The job was for an IT consulting business that had set up shop within just the past six months. Business was taking off, and they needed to fill some entry-level remote tech positions to keep up with the onslaught of demand.

I nailed it. They made me an offer on the spot, and I snatched it right up. I’d only met with a couple of the lead techs, but I sufficiently impressed them enough to fill one of the spots.

I strolled into my old office that afternoon to find the storage containers — all of the backup tapes — gone. I knew it. Huber got in early; got rid of them all. He was covering his sick and demented ass from being found out. Likely he was toasting another mug of his vile brew to whatever fire melted the tapes down to a nondescript heap of plastic. That night, while Huber was re-watching and reliving his gory glory days of sucking down the blood of his wife, I’d be working to match up my own copy of them to the emails he sent and shut that fucker down.

I used my time at the office to type up my letter of resignation. I threw it onto Huber’s unoccupied desk and checked right the hell out of there. On my way home, I got a call from the new job. It wasn’t one I was expecting.

“Hi Jonah. Hey, this is Steve Paige, from ‘Puter Pros. You seem like a cool dude, thought we might meet up tonight for a couple of cold ones with some of the team, welcome you aboard. What do you say?”

""That sounds fantastic,"" is what I said, and that I’d head out that way after their office closed, about seven o’clock. Meanwhile, I had some videos and emails to deal with.

When I got home, I flopped onto the couch with my laptop and threw on some TV. I plugged the USB key with the videos and emails into the laptop, copied everything off, and got to work. Opening the email files was pretty straightforward. All that was left was to match the filenames and dates to Huber’s outgoing emails, and I’d have the bastard by the balls.

After about an hour of searching, I found what I was looking for. Make that half of what I was searching for. I was able to match Huber’s outgoing emails to only half of the videos, those of him doing the blood drinking. And the laughing. There was no email subject. Nothing in the body of the message. Just the video and one recipient: ppkg@gmail.com.

It was when I searched Huber’s inbox that I found the messages attached to the other half of the videos. Huber wasn’t *sending* the videos of his wife — he was *receiving* them. From someone else.

Unlike Huber’s outgoing messages, these emails did contain a message. They were all sent from the same address he’d been sending to. I read only the first:


Subject: Do you love her?

Hello Donny. Or should I call you Soulless, Bloodsucking Lawyer Don, Esquire? I like that name better. You should change it.

I’ll keep this short, because I know you’re a busy man and have a lot more bloodsucking to do. And now I don’t mean that metaphorically, as you will see from the attached video.

You may remember that when you took me into your employment, part of that deal was the promise of your firm finding help for my wife. You and I had a gentleman’s agreement. In return for free assistance from me for your office, you would assist us in suing the company responsible for the accident resulting in my wife’s handicap. That is not what happened. Instead, after several years of my free services to your firm, you turned against me and my family. You saw that there was more to be gained by representing the other party, turned around and counter-sued us on their behalf.

They won. You won. I lost nearly everything.

Last night, I lost my wife.

It’s time now for you to lose something. It's up to you for how long.

For your Lydia to remain alive, your instructions are simple. Firstly, do not forward this message or its contents to the authorities, nor make them aware of it in any way. I still control your firewall and know what comes in and out of there at all times. I will know. You could of course copy the files and send them some other way, but know this: Your wife is kept alive only by my administering her with the basic nutrients to stay that way, so if I were to, say, be killed or go to jail, she’s as good as gone.

Don’t worry, Donny. You won’t be without your wife entirely. I will be sending you that bag of her blood, one every few days or so. In return, you will be required to drink it. All of it, like the bloodsucker you are. And how will I know? You will record a video of yourself doing this and email it as an attachment back to me. But — and here’s the most important part — you must show me how much you enjoy it. Show me how much you’re enjoying every last fucking drop of it, you bloodsucking motherfucker! I don’t care how many cupfuls it takes or what the hell you mix it with, but you will drink that bag dry. And you will smile and you will laugh, and you will convince me you love it!

Your first delivery comes tomorrow morning. I expect your first video within four hours of that.

Tell no authorities. Tell no one.

Oh, and I quit.


Enjoy your breakfast,

The Kenster


The Kenster. I knew I heard that stupid nickname somewhere before. Was it at the office? Yeah, that was it. First day of work. One of the delivery guys who sometimes picked up the backup tapes once asked where “The Kenster” was. I had no idea who he was talking about. Now I knew: He was the IT guy I replaced. Before he left, he'd cleaned up anything and everything in the systems about him. Everything gone. Almost everything gone, I should say.

I still had the restored email.

I checked the time. Seven o'clock. Late. Shit.

Drowning my shot nerves in alcohol sounded like a decent plan at the time. I called a cab and met up with Steve Paige and the other 'Puter Pros at a bar across town, about a half-hour later. After a couple of hours of us chatting about all-things geek, I was happily on my way to becoming plastered and forgetting about the whole nightmare with Huber. That ended right quick.

Steve said, ""Don't worry if you get stuck with a tough client on the job, Jonah. We've all had our run-ins with 'em.""

""Pssh, no shit! Remember that old bat who insisted on me reinstalling Windows 95?"" another Pro named Andy said. ""Ninety-fucking-five! I had to torrent and burn some old ISO of the thing. I hoped it wasn't teeming with a hidden North Korean malware party.""

Steve gave him a punch on the shoulder. ""Jesus, Andy! Seriously? You don't do that shit. Anyway, Jonah, if you get stuck with a nut like that, you come talk to me or you find the boss. Because if you can't do it …""

They all said in unison: ""The Kenster can.""

I choked on my last sip of beer like I was drowning.

“Sorry … The- The Kenster?"" I managed to blurt out between coughs.

""Damn, you okay? Well, yeah, man. He owns the shop. Ken Graham. Goes by 'The Kenster' in the nerdy circles, like with us. He's the real pro at 'Pros. Knows how to deal with all types. You go to him with the difficult-to-please ones, and he's got you covered. He’s … a little quirky, I guess you could say, but you’ll love working for him. Y’know, I wonder what’s holding him up …”

“H- Holding him up?” I asked.

“Yeah, he was supposed to show up tonight. Guess he want's to meet you, in particular. I showed him your resume and I’ll be damned if his eyes didn’t light right up. Looks like your past experience at that law office paid off. You've already got his eye, big guy!""

Steve tried to give me a shot on the shoulder, but I was already beelining for the door. There was some confused yelling from behind me as they followed me outside. Most likely something to do with my skimping on the tab. I threw myself into the nearest cab and shot home.

---

That was a week ago. So I guess saying I quit my last job wasn’t so accurate after all. In truth, I hadn’t even started yet. I bet there aren’t many people who’ve done that, not without a backup plan on deck at the time.

I have no clue what Huber has planned for those videos he had me restore. Not really sure why he’d have them destroyed, either. If he turns them in, his wife’s likely a goner. Maybe she’s dead already? Maybe he doesn’t care and just wants to stop the blood drinking, making sure he’s got what he needs to make sure The Kenster pays for what he’s done. But the news has been quiet. No reports of a missing or dead Lydia Huber. No arrests of ‘Puter Pros owner Ken Graham.

Me? I’m keeping hold of my copy of those files and emails. That insurance at least helps me get a few winks of sleep every night.

My parents, of course, haven’t understood my unemployment, so I’m out on my ass and basically paying for this dump out of what little savings I have left. That’s not much. Not anymore. I’ve tried calling my mom for the past couple of days, basically to beg for her to let me back into their basement, which believe me is a vast upgrade from this shit hole. But she’s not picking up my calls. It never took very much to disappoint her.

Hm. Getting a text message. God, I hope that’s her. You know, I’m still sometimes surprised she even knows how to send one. Especially … one with a video? Why is she sending me …

Oh … shit.

I had a pretty prestigious internship recently, and during my job hunt I had 2 written offers. I used the first to negotiate up the second.

I mostly attribute this to waiting too long to apply certain places and a good degree of laziness. I'm hoping to do research at my university this summer instead if I don't get an internship.

However, I know the junior year internship is really the important one, and this is what I'm really stressing out about. I'm beginning to bust my ass with maintaining a github/StackOverlflow/Quora presence and am considering making a personal website. I'm hoping having some projects on my github and a sophomore research experience could help me get a junior internship, but I have a question. 

How important is it to have past professional software experience to get junior internships at some of the more competitive companies such as Google, Microsoft, Jane Street, etc. ? If someone who recently got an internship offer as a junior at a somewhat well known company can verify that they didn't have any sophomore experience, I would really appreciate it.

Sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but I go to a competitive college and knowing a lot of people that already have sophomore internships at Google and Microsoft is freaking me out."

Unlike most of the students in my year, I haven't done any CS internships in my junior year due to personal reasons.

I'm worried that I will have a hard time finding a job when I graduate since I don't have much work experience or any connections unlike my peers. My GPA is also mediocre (around a 3.3 although I will be trying to get it up with the time I have left in college). I'm currently trying to find an internship for this summer, but I haven't been having any luck. Asking the people around me has not been very helpful since they have worked very hard from the start so they have really good resumes and worked in major companies like Google, Microsoft, etc. I was wondering if any of you guys have advice on what I can do between now and December so that it will be easier for me to find a job when I graduate.

Are there any good places to search for CS internships? I'm not looking for an internship at a big company like Google or Amazon. I just want a place that will pay me respectably while I get experience working as a software engineer before I actually have to work in the real world. As of now I honestly just feel unprepared.

I have also heard that managers like to hire candidates who have done projects in their free time, but I'm not sure where to start on that.

And if you guys have any other suggestions at all please tell me. I'm in that 20s stage where the real world is looming behind my shoulders and I have absolutely no idea what to do because I wasted a lot of time in my college years (and have only recently come to realize that I better start doing something soon or I'll be digging a bigger hole).

I know there are many threads on this subreddit focused on this same question, or ones similar to it, but I wanted to share my situation with it.

I graduated with a BS in Biology in 2014, and spent all of college thinking that I wanted to go into the medical field (particularly veterinary medicine). After many internships at different clinics, and a current job at a clinic, I decided that this is not the field I want to spend the rest of my life in. When I was in high school, I took an intro computer science course and enjoyed it. However, back then I had never thought of comp sci as a possible major/career. Now that I know I do not want to go the medical route, I've been wanting to learn more about computer science. I recently signed up for the Harvard CS50 course online, and I am currently on the first week. After reading through many subreddits, I found that many people recommended the CS50 course to start. And I'm enjoying it so far!

 So I guess my next question is, what can I do during/after this course to strengthen my knowledge on CS to hopefully become a software developer in the future? Which languages should I emphasize learning? I understand it is a rigorous path, and the self-taught route is difficult, but I can't afford to get another undergrad degree in cs :( Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!

The question I have though is would there be better career opportunities if I went to UCF in Orlando? I know both schools don't offer much as far as name recognition is concerned, but UCF is know to have a better CS department. Would this create more opportunities for internships and jobs?

 The downside with going to UCF would be that I would have to pay for living expenses. If I go to school locally I will be able to save money by living with my parents while I go to school. Would this be enough to justify staying at UNF, or do the benefits of going to a school with a better CS program pay off?"

I'm on my third extension there as an intern so I think it's fair to say they appreciate my ~~cheap labor~~ hard work! Over the months I've spent a surprisingly large amount of time doing luncheons and small projects with the CEO of this company and he normally will remember me by name and chit chat for a moment in passing. 

Normally I keep my head high and good eye contact and all that socially acceptable stuff, but I've had a pretty tough start to 2016, so I've been a bit stressed. Walking through the office I had my head in the clouds, trying to figure out how to get my year back on track. All of a sudden here comes the CEO, and I say hello and suggest body language that I'm busy and must keep going back to whatever I was doing. He stops me and asks me a question, my immediate response was ""I'm good, how are you?"" (Still have no clue what that original question was). I then hear him ask something about my name. So natural response, ""oh my name is thebeastjohnson"".. He looks at me, cocks his head chuckles a bit and says ""I just wanted the first letter but alright. Good to see you"" and shuffles off. 

Not a huge FU today, but I feel like those are the little things people remember when considering hiring someone later on. I can imagine him thinking ""thebeastjohnson? The idiot who almost ran into me and can't complete a conversation? Yea nah we can get rid of him."" 

WOO! 2016!"

I'm 28 and about to start my second semester of a CS degree. I have a previous bachelor's so I only have to take CS related classes (thank God) and so, with summer semesters, I can be finished by spring of 2017.
I currently work as a part time property manager at a Startup Hub/coworking space. This job is great, it fits my schedule for classes and pays most of my bills, and I am meeting small business owners with programming needs all the time. I'm hoping this will turn in to a programming job down the line.
My question to you all is this: In the upcoming summer, should I be seeking an internship, or would you recommend taking summer classes and sticking with the current job? The classes will shorten my degree timeline considerably and i won't have to gamble with my current job. However, I know that coming out of school, it will be important to have some work experience in actual programming.

What would you do in this situation? Thanks in advance for any advice."

3zx97m,687,2016-01-07,The Wrom Institute,EZmisery,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3zx97m/the_wrom_institute/,"When I received word that I was accepted to an internship at the Wrom Institute, I was ecstatic.  It was my dream job.  Although just an intern, I’d be able to work alongside Henrietta Wrom!

For those unfamiliar with her, Wrom is the leading researcher in childhood psychology.  She holds PhD’s in psychology, child development, biology, mathematics, and engineering.  She is without a doubt a brilliant scholar.  She has published books on the subjects of childhood personality disorders, trauma effects on the brain, and the role of humanity in psychosis.  Her research articles are numerous and used in almost every program across the country.  She started the Wrom institute a few years ago and it has become a hotbed of new and exciting opportunities.

To be honest, I didn’t think I’d get the internship.  I had only just finished my bachelor’s degree in psychology.  Sure, I had a 4.0 and was at the top of my class, but thousands of people applied to the institute.  PhD’s, doctoral students, professors, and even world renowned scholars had all applied.  I was the only person selected.

My first day I was overwhelmed with excitement.  I nearly spilled coffee all over myself.  I had picked out my best outfit and had done my makeup perfectly.  I stood in front of the Institute for a while, eyeing the building.  It was a huge brick building with no windows (this is fairly common when research trials are being done – so the weather doesn’t affect the outcome of the experiment).  The building stood alone down a long road.  The nearest building wasn’t even in eyesight.  I took a deep breath and walked inside.

I was greeted by Mai Lee.  She was a tall Asian woman in a lab coat.  I felt a little comforted by the fact she was Asian (I’m half Pilipino) but her demeanor was not friendly.   She held a clipboard close to her chest as she gave me a tour of the place.  I saw multiple labs complete with microscopes and other biological equipment.  I saw interviewing rooms and offices.  It took us nearly three hours to tour the entire facility.  Near the end of the tour I noticed two red double doors that were closed and locked.

“Where does that lead to?” I asked Mai Lee.

She glanced at the doors but kept walking.  “That is the Achilles Ward.  You don’t have clearance to enter there.”  She kept going briskly and I hurried to keep up with her.

My excitement was waning, and waned even more when I learned that my job was going to comprise completely of data entry.  Mai Lee sat me down at a computer and explained that I would be entering the weight, color, and consistency of baby gorilla feces.  Apparently the experiment was seeing if the babies’ bowel movements were affected by the amount of attention their mothers gave them.  Needless to say, this did not excite me.

“Am I going to meet Henrietta Wrom?”  I smiled up at the other woman.

She did not smile back.  “It’s Dr. Wrom.  And no.”  She turned on her heels and walked away.

That’s how I spent my first week – entering baby poop data.  Each day I tried to keep a positive outlook.  But no one spoke to me unless they had to.  No one smiled at me or seemed to want to get to know me.  Everyone just went about their business and left me to my computer and feces.

But then something odd happened.  I had been there ten days and was taking my lunch in one of the break rooms.  Two men were talking about a study they were working on but did not invite me to join them.  I sat alone.  I reached into my bag to pull out my sandwich.  But inside I felt a crumbled piece of paper.  I pulled it out.  It was an empty worksheet with a message written on it in red crayon.  It said:

“Help me.  I’m in Achilles.  I need you.”

I was disturbed to say the least.  Someone had clearly slipped this into my bag when I wasn’t paying attention.  But I was just a lowly intern…I figured it had to be a joke.  I looked around the breakroom and noticed the two men had left.  I also noticed a woman looking in through the window, but once I met her eye-line she quickly rushed away.

I threw the note out and felt even more depressed.  A few days went by and I had finished entering the gorilla data.  I was given a new data entry project – entering the images, colors, shapes, and scribbles of children’s artwork.  It was tedious.  I didn’t have very any friends so I couldn’t complain to anyone.  Plus I grew up in the foster care system so I had no mom or dad to vent to.  All I could do was go home and ramble to my dog.  

I got another note in my bag five days later.  This time it was written on construction paper.  The text was still written with crayon, this time green.  It said: 

“Please, I need you.  I’m in Achilles.  I know you want to help.”

Since getting my first note I had been extra cautious with my bag, making sure it was never out of my sight.  How did the note get in?  I stared at the paper for a long time.  I felt a little scared and confused.  If someone really did need help, why would they turn to me?

On my lunchbreak I walked past those red metal doors I had seen on my first day.  I inspected them.  There were electronic, rigged up to a palm reader.  The only way in was to press your hand on the reader and be recognized.  But Mai Lee said I didn’t have clearance.  I thought about trying it anyway, but was fearful of getting in trouble.  I scurried back to my desk and tried to focus on work.

But I couldn’t.  Those notes…they were too weird.  I decided I would wait until everyone had left, and then try the doors.  If I couldn’t get in, so be it.  If I got in trouble or got fired, fine.  I was miserable here anyway.  Plus I guess the notes triggered some creepy savoir complex in me.

It took hours and hours.  People worked late at the Institute and I was incredibly anxious just sitting at the computer.  But around 11pm the halls were completely silent.  The lights were motion activated, so the only light shining was directly above me.

I got up quickly and made my way to the red doors.  It was creepy walking alone through the Institute.  The lights would come on as I moved and go off where I left.  I realized that I had started running towards the doors.  When I reached them I was out of breath.  I caught myself and looked at the palm reader.  Here it goes, I thought.

I pressed my right hand against the reader.  It took a moment, as if it were thinking.  I almost wished it wouldn’t work.  But then it blinked green.  The doors started to open slowly.  I nearly turned around and ran out of there.  What did I expect to find?

But when I looked through the doorway it appeared normal.  It was a hallway with doors on one side.  It looked like interviewing rooms.  I sighed in relief.  Someone must have been messing with me.  I decided to go in anyway, just to see what was in there.

Once I had walked through the doorway the red doors slammed shut behind me.  I turned around in surprise but couldn’t open them again.  This was starting to feel dangerous.  But I crept forward down the hallway.  As I moved the light in the hallway turned on, and I realized that the hall wasn’t normal at all.  

It had prison cells in it.  Large cells with glass instead of bars.  I could see in the rooms and what I saw…

In the first cell was a toddler.  He couldn’t have been more than three.  He was sitting on the ground, rocking back and forth.  I froze where I stood.  Without warning two slots opened on either side of his cell.  Through one came a large metal arm with a bowl of food.  Through the other came an arm that looked almost human.  Except it was completely covered in barbed wire.  The toddler had no hesitation.  He ambled over to the human-like arm and started cuddling it.  He rubbed himself against the barbed wire, cutting his skin and causing him to bleed.  But the look on his face was one of pure contentment.

I screamed and started pounding on the glass.  But he didn’t notice me.  He must not have been able to see or hear me.  I could only watch in horror as he caused himself more and more injury.

I fell to the side, nearly vomiting.  The light went out where I was standing, and the next came on.  I knew what that meant.  Someone or something wanted me to keep going.  I clutched my stomach and inched towards the next cell.  In it sat a girl of around five.  She was speaking into a mirror but I couldn’t hear what she was saying.  All of a sudden a speaker turned on and her voice filled the hall.

“Red. Apple. Tree. Cut. Blood. Red. Apple.”  She was repeating the same words over and over into the mirror.  She was staring at her own reflection almost unblinking.  Her hands clutched the sides of it as if she would fall over without it.  The girl started saying her mantra louder.  “TREE. CUT. BLOOD. RED. APPLE. TREE. CUT. RED.  I mean, blood.  BLOOD!”

There was a huge spark and the girl screamed.  Then the speaker cut out.  I realized slowly that she wasn’t holding the mirror – she was strapped to it.  A jolt of electricity must have been sent through the mirror into the little girl.  The jolt knocked her out, and she hung unconscious from her hands.  They were nailed to the mirror.  Her little head fell backwards and her mouth was open and drooling.

The light went out.  The next light turned on.  It lit the hall menacingly.  I shuffled towards the next cell.  I don’t know why I didn’t try to run away.  Maybe I knew that those doors were not going to open.  Or maybe I was just sick.

In the next cell were three children around the age of nine.  Two girls and a boy.  The girls were wearing odd shaped paper dresses and the boy wore a diaper.  Behind them was a screen with words on it.  The words said, “Shave Boy’s Head.”

The girls approached the boy, who did not resist.  They had no sharp instruments, so they began pulling his hair out with their hands.  When this didn’t work well, they began ripping it out with their teeth.  The boy was crying but did not struggle.  The words appeared on the screen again, “Stop.”

The three children looked to the screen, awaiting instructions.  “Girls Need Bath.”  The two girls looked at each other, and then started licking themselves.  They licked feverishly.  The boy licked too, alternating between the girls.  I looked away just as the light died and the next light popped on.

I couldn’t do this.  The hallway was too long and I couldn’t stand any more disgusting sights.  I cried out to no one, “Why did you bring me here?”

The lights went out again.  No other light came on.  I stood for ten second in deafening darkness.  Then a female voice said, “You wanted to come here.”

I fell to my knees and started to cry.  “No, I would never want this!”

“That’s what you wrote in your application.”  All of the lights suddenly turned on and I squinted in the intense brightness.  I rubbed my eyes quickly and realized there was a woman standing in front of me.  I tried to move back but I hit a wall.

“You wrote that you would do anything to participate in the Wrom Institute.”  She was wearing a white coat.  Her frizzy hair was up in a bun on her head.  She wore wide rimmed glasses.  I recognized her immediately.

“Dr. Wrom?”

She stepped towards me.  “Didn’t you wonder why you were chosen out of thousands?  Why a girl with just a bachelor’s would be selected?  You went to a state school for god’s sake.”  She scoffed.  “You were chosen because you have no one who will miss you.”

I wrapped my arms around myself.  “But you study child psychology.  What do you want with me?”

She grinned a toothy smile.  “You were raised in the system.  You have no family.  You are the perfect subject for a new study I am developing.  It’s looking into the effects of trauma on foster care graduates.  As you can see, I have created the trauma.  Now I just need to inflict it on you.”

Before I realized what was going on someone had grabbed me and dragged me to my feet.  I struggled but the person stuck a large needle into my neck.  My vision blurred and the last sound I could hear was Dr. Wrom instructing me to relax.

I woke up here, in my cell.  The walls are tinted but I am sure they are glass, just like the cells of the children.  There is a speaker on the ceiling that tells me what to do.  Once a man came in and strapped me to a chair.  He said he was testing out a new machine designed to keep my eyes open.  It hooked into my eyelids.  I asked him why and he said simply, “So you can’t look away.”

And that’s why I’m writing this.  Because the voice in the speaker told me to write it.  It told me to account for my time here at the Institute.  I guess I will be writing entries after I am subjected to…to whatever it is I have to see.  

Okay.  I have written it all.  Am I done now?  You said I might still be able to go home.  Please?  Help me.  I need you.

And I usually would completely agree. But this is a special case, to me anyways.

About me:

* 1st year University of Waterloo Student

* A couple of side projects. Hybrid Android app, Blackberry Playbook tablet app

* Write blog posts on Medium relating to technology, kinda interested in Product Management 

* See [redacted résumé](http://i.imgur.com/szX4S0u.png)

* Would like to intern in Silicon Valley

So I have the opportunity to intern at a company in Silicon valley with some cash flow and funded by 500 Startups. Their app has hundreds of thousands of users and I feel the work could teach me a lot.

Compensation is as follows:

* Housing in their company 'mansion'

* Food

* Transportation (shared car)

* $200/month stipend

So basically I wouldn't be making money to pay tuition like I might be able to by interning elsewhere in Canada, but especially for the first internship, isn't experience king? Considering my goal is to land future internships at more established companies in California, this job seems like a great springboard. They will also cover the cost of getting a visa. 

Thoughts?"
3zz2sq,5,2016-01-07,Cambridge maths -&gt; CS,unnddd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3zz2sq/cambridge_maths_cs/,"I am a third year student just coming to the end of my mathematics degree at Cambridge. Having got a 2:2 in each of my first two years, this year is going slightly better and I expect that I can get a 2:1 (the benchmark 'good' grade in the UK which a lot of companies ask for).

I have always been quite interested in computing and I came very close to studying it, but in the end I settled on maths. While Cambridge is extremely prestigious for maths and undoubtedly has a very good course, I now feel like it was not the best choice for me, and that fact is reflected in my below average grades (it is also objectively tougher, at least here). Unfortunately, there is very little in the course which is related to computer science, and in Cambridge you cannot take classes from other subjects, so beyond picking up Python for some basic projects and to solve a few puzzles, I have very little programming or computer science knowledge.

Last year I applied to a few software companies for summer internships but despite some of my interviews going well, I suspect I was at quite a disadvantage due to lack of knowledge and lower than average grades. In the end I did an internship in finance which I won't go into other than to say I hated it - I wish I had just spent the summer picking up some more programming skills.

I genuinely feel like, given the right opportunities to learn and gain experience, I could be a very good software engineer, but at the moment I feel like I've squandered the last 2 years not doing anything useful to further that aim.

I suspect there are many others who have made a similar transition from maths to computer science, so does anybody have any advice on the best things I could be doing to get my foot in the door, and hopefully have a great job that I enjoy a few years down the line? Bear in mind that I will have almost no time to do anything but maths until the summer. I am considering that maybe I could take a 1 year course in computer science which is aimed at mathematicians/physicists/engineers. Are there any good courses like that in London which someone would recommend?

Thanks in advance for any advice."

401fsj,2,2016-01-08,Freshman CS student... how am I supposed to get an internship?,themooseexperience,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/401fsj/freshman_cs_student_how_am_i_supposed_to_get_an/,"Hey everyone, so as the title says, I'm a freshman majoring in CS at a top 25 CS school (if that matters) and minoring in business (from a top 50 business school). I skipped over my school's intro to programming class through AP in high school, so I was able to take a Data Structures course my first semester that most freshmen don't take until their second. Next semester I am taking an Intro to Computer Engineering and a Machine Organization and Programming class. 

I cannot seem to get an internship. I feel like my current skill set, especially as a freshman, is at least on par with students that *are* getting internships, I am beginning to put some basic stuff up on GitHub, and I'm involved in a bunch of varied student orgs. I got rejected after the phone interview from Microsoft's Explorer Program, and turned down from 3 smaller companies near my hometown (NYC area). I've applied to at least 15 other companies and haven't even heard back. I almost don't even want to bother applying for Facebook University, since it says in its description it's for underrepresented communities in the tech field, and I'm a white Jewish guy from the East Coast.

What can I be doing differently, start doing, or stop doing that could boost my chances of getting an internship? Does anyone here have any past experiences with CS internships, especially as a freshman, and would be willing to share their advice? 

Any help is much appreciated.

**TL;DR** Freshman majoring in CS, minoring in business that can't get an internship no matter what he does. Does anyone have any past experiences / suggestions that I could use to help boost my chances? I know I'm just a freshman, but this is a goal I have for myself."

I must be doing something wrong...,themooseexperience,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/401hd3/how_to_get_an_internship_as_a_freshman_i_must_be/,"Hi CS friends, I just posted to /r/college, but I realized that my question is probably better suited here. So, to summarize my issue, I'm a freshman majoring in CS and have gotten rejected from every internship I've applied for (upwards of 15).

A little background: I'm a freshman at the University of Wisconsin - Madison majoring in CS and minoring in Business. I skipped over the intro to programming course through AP credits, and just finished an intro to data structures course (ADTs, complexity, sorting, etc). Next semester I'm taking an intro to computer engineering and a machine organization and programming course. I have also taken an entrepreneurship course along with a risk management course through my business minor path (if that means anything). I'm proficient in Java and Python, and I'm learning C# in order to use the Unity Engine to design games (on my own time). I'm actively involved on campus: I was elected Recruitment Chair of my fraternity as a freshman, am in an invite-only CS club, and part of a student leadership program (plus a cheese club and beer club because Wisconsin). 

Overall, why I know I *am* a freshman and my skill set in the general scheme of college students is extremely limited, I feel as if I am at least on par with the CS freshmen that *are* getting internships. But so far, the best I've gotten is an in-person interview with a smaller company near my hometown (NYC). I got rejected after the Microsoft Explorer Program's phone interview, rejected from about 6 smaller companies near my hometown, and haven't heard back from at least 10 companies. As a white Jewish guy from the East Coast, I don't know if I'm even going to apply for that Facebook University internship as it specifically says it's for underrepresented minorities in CS.

Does anyone here have any advice they could give me, or any experience they'd like to share on the matter? Any help would be much appreciated, as this is a personal goal I set for myself and it's really starting to bum me out.

**TL;DR** Freshman CS/Bus student at University of Wisconsin with a skill set that (I think) is &gt;= on par with most freshmen that *are* getting internships. Very involved on campus. Can't get an internship, even through certain companies' freshmen/sophomore programs. Any advice / experience on the matter would be much appreciated :)"

Javascript is my go-to language so when I looked for summer internships I really wanted to do most of my work in that language. 

About a month ago, I applied to Mozilla for a Javascript intern and yesterday I got an invite to take a 4 hour timed coding challenge. I decided to take it right away and with about 30 minutes to spare I had finished the challenge. The challenge was 3 javascript coding challenges and I completed 1 of them with 0 errors and 12/12 test cases successful, completed another with getting 11/12 test cases successful, but I had a few issues with the last and I couldn't get any successful cases, I was pretty darn close though, but after 3:30 hours I was pretty dead.

Now Mozilla probably gets hundreds of applicants so the fact that I didn't finish one challenge probably eradicated my chances, but I'm just curious if not being able to finish a question stumps your chances? In my opinion it shouldn't be the worst thing since I'm applying for an internship, but I just wanted to hear your opinions.

Thanks for the feedback. "

I have done well in the industry but I want to make a switch over to IT for a more stable income. (I have a technical degree in IT and building PC’s/ gaming is a hobby of mine.) I have an older friend who is the managing director of IT at a hotel. I asked him how he got started. He answered saying he got a college degree then intern, and then got a job which he worked his way up in. He proceeded to tell me about a position within his company that he will be hiring for. He asked if I was interested and I jumped on the opportunity. However it was just posted through their HR department and the requirements are computer science/IT bachelors  with 2 years experience in IT. I do not have a degree or experience. He personally knows me and I will say for myself that I am a go getter, ambitious, and dedicated to the trade I pursue. He told me he’d really like me to work for him and even his boss is okay with hiring me.
 My question is that even though I’m confident I can learn and excel in this position but since I have almost no traditional qualifications for the job, can I be hired over someone who does? I can tell you I don’t think he would be biased toward me because we know each other; it’s that I’ve helped him before and impressed him even without actively perusing a career in IT. The position has gotten numerous applications already… I’m wondering if HR could say no, or he is obligated to hire someone with those qualifications. 
Any insight would be awesome.
Thank you!

I recently finished an internship that was unpaid, and now that I've returned home, I am living with my parents until I can find a sustainable income.

I've been looking for positions in my area that will pay at least $25-30k a year so that I could pay off my car and credit card before I move to a bigger city with more opportunities. However, I've applied to over a dozen places, with 3 rejections and the remaining no responses. 

I've been debating on if I should keep searching in the vicinity (my city and the few other cities that are around here) or taking a leap of faith and applying to positions a little further away (thinking NYC or LA. I spent 4 months in LA for my internship, and I loved it so much. It's a goal of mine in the near future to move to California.)

Problem is, that I am currently roped into paying $600 a month in student loans right now, plus a car and credit card payment, so I would need to make a hell of a lot more than $30k if I wanted to move away. Since I can't even seem to find one job here that pays me that much, I'm worried if I looked for positions elsewhere, I won't be able to find something there either.

[Mike: What's your favorite card for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game that you've designed so far?  What's your least favorite? Is there anything major that you would do differently with the Rise of the Runelords set if you were to go back and do it again (other than fix typos and FAQ-stuff\)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr01dd?context=5)|Gaby and I super-heart what Paul let us do in the Welcome to Blackburgh scenarios for Wrath 5. We basically built a maze out of cards. I'm sure there are people who don't think we're as clever as we think we are.
 |I would not be upset to see all copies of Holy Candle consumed in flames.
 |In some sense, we are getting to do just that with Runelords, because it's being rebuilt by Obsidian for their fantastic new PACG digital version. But we're not changing all that much, really. Just lots of little things. I do like that we're getting to do more wacky scenarios now, and I'd probably have put more of them in Runelords if I could.
[How does someone break into the game industry? Any tips or recommendations on how to get started? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr0tnk?context=5)|My answer is always the same: ""Be the person known for that thing."" Whatever that thing is. Put something out there that people know about and love. Then, when you want to get people in the game industry to pay attention to you, you'll already be the person known for that thing.
[Then what ""thing"" do you each think you're known for? Or would at least WANT to be known for, outside of your excellent musk.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr1atx?context=5)|I'm ""the puzzle guy."" Even among boardgamers, I'm the guy whose stuff is always a puzzle to figure out.
[What is the secret to writing great crossword clues? I've only found a few designers that don't swing too far to ""dead simple"" or ""infuriatingly esoteric""?  What's your favorite crossword clue of all time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyqzdvh?context=5)|My favorite clue was in one of Mike Shenk's crosswords -- except he read it outloud to us. The clue was ""Like arrivals from Asia,"" except it was really ""Leica rivals from Asia,"" and the answer was CANONS. Mindbogglingly good.
[Can you elaborate on the process? Having never put out a game, what's hard about putting out a game? What do you wish you had known the first time you started a kick start campaign?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr0wch?context=5)|Running a Kickstarter campaign requires multiple people with specialized skills. You have to know how much things costs to design, make, and ship. You have to know how to get people to pay attention to your idea. You have to figure out what stretch goals you need and when you need them. And you have to make it look really good.
 |In our case, we also always tell a story with our campaigns. Sometimes it's an ongoing puzzle, sometimes it's a story, other times (like with Ninth World) it's a gradual revelation of a universe. We want you coming back every day to see the new developments.
[If you could go back and tweak one game you worked on/designed, which one would it be and how?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr16zu?context=5)|Oh, that's easy: Betrayal at House on the Hill. I would love another crack at that. We've learned so much about how co-op games work since.
 |Also, the Underground Lake would be in the basement.
[Care to share some of what you've learned about co-op games?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr1pwi?context=5)|Well, tension-balancing is a mandatory step, which I barely understood at the time. The Pathfinder game probably does it better than Betrayal. But Betrayal does some things better than Pathfinder. I'm sure a second go-round on either of them would produce positive results.
[Any possibility of an expansion of sorts for Betrayal? New scenarios, rules, etc?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr3ots?context=5)|That is entirely up to Wizards of the Coast.

Any suggestions for puzzles to get my brain started in that direction? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr0i6g?context=5)|You don't have to, but man, cryptics are the best stuff ever.

And the post kickstarter work on it? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr36ac?context=5)|That Kickstarter campaign was a game in itself.

Do you know any nouns?""
[Favorite Pokemon?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/402pnj/we_are_paul_peterson_and_mike_selinker_designers/cyr17cs?context=5)|[This one.](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/5/53/054Psyduck.png/250px-054Psyduck.png)

Technical things tend to just make sense. At a young age I went from working on bicycles and helping my father do mechanical work to more computer related things (especially when I got into gaming). A class on basic HTML and Flash was offered when I was about 13 and sparked my interest in technology (and soon I'll be graduating with an ACT degree). Over the years, I have practiced my forms rigorously, trained each and every day, and have managed to earn a 1st degree black-belt in Google-Fu.

 As most of you are aware, knowing how to search is just as important as knowing what to search.  This skill landed me a job as a paid intern at a small company that really doesn't tell anyone no when asked if the company does $X. Web hosting? Sure! Cloud Computing? You bet! Oh, you want some sort of data-security? We can probably do that.  The CEO was even thinking about trying to support voting machines when asked at one point. All those in the building told him no, thankfully.  

Now for the Tale.  

I'm sitting at a bench with a bunch of PC's that need updates applied before we deliver them to a customer. While waiting for updates to apply I would usually surf Reddit or such sites on my phone using the internal WiFi. I noticed that my internet speeds were significantly slower than normal and then see that the icon for WiFi was not active. At this point, I had not seen $Boss in about a month. We just communicated by text/email. The company hit a rough patch about a month prior and through a series of events the two techs I worked with were no longer with us. I'm now on my own to find, and diagnose the problem. This isn't a big deal to me because I set up my entire home network with a Untangle firewall (turned the router into an AP and set the firewall to be the DHCP server) and I have my PC using a wired connection so I also have Google. Long story short, the AP we were using was faulty and had some thermal issues so it was shutting down. RMA'd it and got a blank replacement. I Googled my way through configuring the replacement (I had no idea what VLANs or a bunch of other things were). I learned something, that's what being an intern is for right?  

Now, the CEO sees that I got the WiFi back up and everything is working so he wants to replace our $Vendor AP with $FancyVendor AP's which require a controller to operate. I show up to work one day and see boxes on my desk with shiny new hardware in them and have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to be doing with all of it. I haven't seen $Boss in four months and have a terrible case of *I don't know what I don't know* syndrom so I can't even Google it. This is something that someone with network certifications/know-how is supposed to be doing. Not a job for some intern who's biggest accomplishment up to that point was assembling a server cluster in a rack with fiber cards and extra NICs. I've since  gotten a little network set up (off off the internal network) and just need to figure out how to provision the APs so that they'll broadcast.  I'm working towards my Second Degree Black-belt in Google-Fu and now we hired a new networks guy so I'll have proper instruction. It's a learning experience but sometimes I just need to vent.

TL;DR I saw you change a tire on your car, can you tell me what this sound is in my engine?"

With this, I have no idea where I'm supposed to go and how I'm supposed to implement any of this knowledge because just knowing how to program for a homework assignment is VERY different from knowing how to create and implement programs in the real world.

If you graduated feeling the same way that I am feeling now, what would you recommend that I do so I can come out of the gates swinging?

I sat in an interview today for a 66k/year bar job with full benefits with option for 401k.  For the service industry, this position doesn’t fly by every day.  I expected to be excited but then the manager told me that the job is 40-48 hours a week.  My stomach turned.  I didn’t feel hungry for this move up at all.  As my work day was outlined: the idea of operating in another high stress and fast paced position that doesn't contribute towards a career I want for 40-48 hours a week sparked a breakthrough for me. I love interacting with people but the gut reaction is warning sign I need to change fast.   I don’t know what to work in!  I am really embarrassed by this whole situation.  I need advice!  

I returned to Bay Area at 25 after spending a lot of time abroad.  I loved every second of living in different countries places. Meeting new people and cultures really challenged me to think on my feet and understand life outside of the United States.  I even met my wife!   Anyways, with my English Degree in hand, I thought I was going to pursue law.  Once I began working in immigration law and entertainment/production, I was advised to pursue fields besides law (over-saturation in the legal field.  I was not excited about the work.  However, I was just happy to feel like I was using my college education).  Any who, I fell into service industry because I could not make up my mind about what I path I wanted.  During that time my mom passed away and I became demotivated in all of my aspirations.  As a result, a lot of my personal relationships have suffered and I find myself feeling desperate and directionless.  So in an  effort to not be in the service industry forever, any input I receive will be greatly appreciated.

At this point my plan is to enroll in UC berkley extension courses that lead to a certificate in a technical skills field (financial planning and analysis or software development/programming).  Or find an entry level job in a possible field of interest and then try to jump into a masters prog in about a year or two to jump start the career.  I have difficulty executing and following through but this is what seems to be the smart decision.  I am leaning towards the second option.  Or Maybe a combination of both where I work and try school at night.  I’m just hoping that I can find something that I can stomach or genuinely find enjoyment.  I learn to love a lot of things.  I mean, I never imagined I would have loved the service industry.  Anywho, Goal wise: I want to be able to have a career that could enable purchasing a house with my wife.  In the Bay Area, thats a tough deal, but i am optimistic.  

Interests - Interacting with Positive Like minded people.  I love learning.  I am a chatterbox.  I thrive in active settings, when I need to think: I have to move around (drives my wife crazy).  I love to research and discover bullet points that people did not consider.  (I handled navigating the immigration process myself).  I value fun and teamwork over technical know how.   Any ideas?
What are tips on finding entry level jobs?  What would be a good way to find an internship for a 29m out of college?  Thanks again Reddit!

After quite a few unsuccessful tries, I figured I'd try asking for advice here.

Edit: Sorry for the long post, the first few paragraphs are context and the question is in the second to last paragraph.

I am currently a university student entering my final term of my BTech Degree in Computer Systems (specializing in Network Security) for which I am required to do / find a practicum project. While the degree is in network security, my diploma before it was in Computer Information Technology. What this all means is that I'm fairly well rounded in IT and development from OO programming to web development to virtualization to security/analysis.

The practicum project has to be something that is approximately 400 hours of work and innovative in someway (or at least I have the convince the project board that it is innovative, or that it is complex enough for someone with my level of education).

For this project, our department has provided us a list of projects that potential companies have submitted.. But essentially they are the same as the diploma industry projects with the only change being that We are expected to work on it alone instead of with a team. We have been told that the best case would be to find our own clients and projects but most of us will probably end up picking a project from the list. 

Here's what I want to do. There are a lot of cool startups and tech companies in my area (Vancouver BC) and I would love to work on a project for them which I believe would be good for both me and them because (1) I would be able to graduate and hopefully find a job in the process , and (2) a company could use it essentially as a long hiring test.  Considering that this is a school, I would be willing to work for just the experience so funding wouldn't be an issue(?).

I believe my skills are up to snuff (or at least acceptable?) because our program is very deliverable oriented (most of our assignments involve developing to specs in any language or tool of our choice) and considering that I'm applying for web Dev shops, I've already got a portfolio with a number of industry projects (what was done in he diploma ) as well as an active and organized GitHub. 

My passion is in web decelopment and have experimented/built with Node.js (my current obsession) and PHP (Codeigniter webapps, WP themes). Outside of web dev, ive built security applications with Ruby, Java and Python.

Here's where I need some advice: How do I convince a company to let me do a project for them? Would this be considered a co-op? Or an internship? Is this even a thing that companies would be interested in doing?

Currently I have been applying to junior Dev postings and messaging start up devs and hiring managers to no avail (I even got a rejection email on Christmas Day :/ THAT was pretty discouraging). 


Any advice is appreciated :)"

I recently graduated from college ( M.Sc. computer science, GPA 3.87/4 ) and now work for a startup. The position is a permanent position, but not well paid - friends at other companies make at least 10-15k more / year. In fact, my internship in California 3 years ago paid more than my current job.
And yes I know the cost of living is higher over there, but even so I managed to save up more while interning abroad than at my current job. Plus the added perks of good weather, improving language skills etc...

Getting a visa sponsorship for an H1B work visa seems to be a tedious process that
not many companies are willing to do, I assume that there is much competition for such positions.
However I found many interesting internship positions and was thinking of using 
that as an opportunity (j1 visa, 2 years rule does not apply) to get a foot in the door with a company. And if I find that this does not work I could at least use my time abroad and apply for 
permanent positions at other companies while being in the country.

About my current job: money is not necessarily the main motivation, but I have a 
gut feeling that tells me my current job is going nowhere and 
I don't see myself doing this long term. This gut feeling might be unfounded, but at the
same time I think that there are many reasons in favor of quitting.

I haven't worked any other long-term jobs before, but did work temporary positions and
 3 internships, 6 months each.

Would it look bad on my resume if I quit a permanent job for an internship? 
(After all, there is no guarantee that I find a job abroad for the time after the internship)

407o24,2,2016-01-09,I'm clueless but like biology. Wall of text inside.,reddit34nng,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/407o24/im_clueless_but_like_biology_wall_of_text_inside/,"As of right now I am currently a 19 M who has been in college for two years now. I originally went to an Engineering school in the U.S. For CEE (Civil/Environmental Engineering). Got an internship my first year that offered me ~$16.50/hour. I thought then ""Wow. I didn't make any mistakes in my career path. I already have an internship, and through my advisor setting up meeting for me I was able to network properly. My career upon graduating is almost guaranteed!"". I was working for minimum wage at a retail shop that I hated so anything was a step up and when this happened I was psyched! 

Originally I had went with CEE because I wanted to be outdoors, more specifically in the environment (Not housing/business districts), and get to interact with wildlife. I was majorly mistaken as to what CEE would let me do though. After my internship that I was so excited for I realized ""I picked the wrong major"". I thought things such as I would be able to go in the forest and make sure wildlife is properly thriving without a huge human impact on the environment they lived in. Look at nutrients of plants and the yields they give. Look at water and how to purify it properly for those who do not have drinking water. I knew obviously I would have to focus on one of these paths and couldn't do all of them. I wasn't sure which I wanted for sure but I knew, or thought, I would figure it out later after I take my classes/get internships. However, after my internship I started to worry that I was in the wrong area. So I went and talked to my advisor about what I actually wanted to do and if CEE would allow that. I explained my interests were in helping life, both human and/or animal. After conversing about the issues that I was feeling two options came up. 

1. I could do things such as that, but would need to focus more specifically on certain areas. It would be towards the end of my degree I would actually get into what I want to do though.

2. ABS (Applied Biological Sciences). More down the line of helping life and would even open up the door for Med-School.

So I went ahead and tried ABS for a year. I'm feeling good about my decision. I had the opportunity to do what I actually wanted to with my career choice, from somebody who has been doing it for years so I couldn't be majorly mistaken again like I was before. I thought well, I'll have to ""re-network"" and all that again but no big deal.

At this point I was unsure as to which path to take so I was still enrolled as CEE (didn't want to lose my scholarships), but took a few ABS classes at the same time. I loved my biology class and lab (My professor might have been the reason that is the case) and it felt like I had a passion for biology. I liked it. I liked what you could do. I liked how it could tie into animals, or even purifying drinking water. Then Chem hit me. I wasn't really bad at chemistry I just had no passion for it. I would go to lecture everyday... Then start to skip a day here and there because I had no passion or interest in going. I knew that it was required for me to do what I want in life so I made myself continue going. Chem Lab though is another story. I HATED my chemistry lab. From the content we did to the professor. I thought to myself I can't do this as a career since I hate chemistry this much. I have no passion for it. I tried to suck it up and hammer it out because I liked biology so much. I couldn't though, I'm not sure if it is because of the content or professor but I eventually got to the pointed where I just simply dropped the class because I didn't want to go. 

So after the semester I talked with my advisor and explained that I'm taking a semester off and going to figure out what I want to do as a career. My plan is to now go back to college in August knowing what I want to do. 

I'm currently not enrolled now and am making upwards to $17/hr after taxes. Made me realize that if all I wanted to care about was money, I'm okay with where I am now. I don't just care about money though. College is about finding the career that you enjoy and want to do for the rest of your life. Where I am now isn't where I want to be for the rest of my life. 

Now knowing that I want to go to college I began thinking. Thinking of different careers. Pharmacy is what is playing over and over in my head. Why? I don't know. It doesn't appeal to what I wanted to do as far as working with animals or purifying drinking water, or looking at crop yield. The money I can make is calling me, it certainly is easy on the eyes. But also being a retail pharmacist seems, for lack of a better term, easy work. Low stress, nice working conditions, and well no chemistry. Upon looking into pharmacy more and even talking with pharmacists I come to realize there is a TON of chemistry here. For some reason though I can picture myself being a pharmacist and start thinking ""Maybe my chemistry experience won't be so bad once I get into O Chem, and biochem, and the professor is what ruined it for me. I'll give it another shot!"". Because I start thinking this way I look more into pharmacy, only to hear some not so pleasing information. Information like the job market is over saturated. Over saturated to the point of 3-4 graduates for 1 job opening. Sounds way to competitive for me. Don't get me wrong I love competition when it comes to games and sports, but not when it decides whether or not I wasted 8 years and $200k of my life. I begin then thinking and brainstorming ideas of what I might be interested in. I come up with CS(Computer Science), Biology teacher, and... well... that's it. I've lived my life on the computer. I spent pretty much all day on it growing up. That lead me to CS. Well that and the fact that when I view it I think of job security, nice environment, and more or less repetitive easy work as long as you know the material. I've never taken a CS class in my life though, so I have no idea if I'll enjoy it. Sometimes even just thinking about CS as a major I think to myself I'll go crazy at the fact sometimes I could be staring at my computer all day and make no progress (ie, can't figure out what's wrong with the code). I have no idea if I'll like it or not, and I don't want to waste MORE time and money if I won't. Then it brings my to Biology again. I like it a lot. I hate chemistry though (simply no passion) and knowing that most, if not all, biology related careers involve some chemistry I think what doesn't. I came up with somebody that teaches biology and just biology. I had always been interested in teaching English abroad, so teaching was kind of something I thought I wouldn't mind doing. Well, shockingly I find out my Uncle got a degree in teaching and after 1 year realized he hated it and didn't want to do it. Hated it so much he stopped teaching after 1 year and wasted his degree. This got me thinking that maybe I don't want to be a teacher. Whenever I thought about it I would always think about how I wanted to teach eager and excited people this information. Talking with my Uncle and why he quit, was because he didn't have freedom and most people didn't want to be there. Opened my eyes to all those kids in my prior education that didn't care, were rude, class clowns, and what have you. Made me realize that I don't/can't handle that. So that was crossed off my list. 

Leaves me to the point where I'm basically back where I am started. 
Pharmacy: Requires chemistry and over saturated career. Requires I go to Pharm school if I go Pre-Pharm. 
CS: No idea if I would enjoy it and would probably want to shoot myself some days because of the frustration.
Biology related fields: Requires chemistry. 

It seems at this point the things I want to do, and know I like require chemistry. Do I just suck it up and learn 4-8 years of chemistry and hope I like it somewhere down the road? If so should I go pharmacy or should I go something with wildlife? My professor for my Biology Labs has a wildlife degree, but ended up teaching so I feel like there wasn't enough jobs available to her. Not to say people aren't interested in teaching, but she clearly has a passion for wildlife and isn't doing it as a career. If I shouldn't go the path of hope I like chemistry, then what? 

tl;dr 
I'm clueless but like biology. I currently have no passion for chemistry. What to do for a career. Where to start?"

I have removed the old Mobo, labeled all the wires and thought I'd be fine. I now put in the new MOBO, and I think I'll be okay with the graphics card, USB, RAM, CPU, fans etcetera, but what baffles me is the power.

My old MOBO has an 8 pin ATX, a 6 pin PCI express and ofcourse the 24 pin ATX. The new one only has the 24 pin ATX, and apparently a 4 pin ATX. I think I'll need a 4 pin to 8 pin converter cable of sorts, but what should I do about the 6 pin PCI express power cable?

I have a slightly overpowered powersupply BTW, an Antec 500W EA-500D, which has lots of cables protruding from it, including what looks like a 4 pin ATX. If I connect that one and leave the 8 pin and the PCI-express unconnected, will I be fine?

408ajz,0,2016-01-09,Big 4 Consulting &gt; Top MBA &gt; BB IBD Doable?,ibhopeful93,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/408ajz/big_4_consulting_top_mba_bb_ibd_doable/,"Hey guys..had a quick question.

So I graduated from a large state school in the South with a BBA in finance and a 3.94 GPA recently. Interned on the sales and trading side junior year (school is a pretty big feeder to trading side of business), found out that I didn't like it, and wanted to make a switch to IB for full time. Unfortunately, pretty much all the banks had filled their FT classes with interns, and being at a non-target didn't help get me a interview at the few banks with 1 or 2 spots left.

A big part of why I didn't go back for S&amp;T full time was the culture and environment, so with that, I decided to hunt for places where I feel like I'd fit in the most. This ended up at a Big 4 in their consulting practice..but my heart still lies in banking. Game plan right now is to still work and apply at year 3 so I will have 4 years of experience upon matriculation to school. So a few questions for the community:

1) I hear it is very hard to switch both industry and function after MBA. Since I'm in the Houston area, a majority of the work that I am doing is in the oil and gas industry. I would like to gun for NY banking, but I fear that there is no oil and gas groups up there. So I would effectively be switching from Energy Consulting to (Not Energy) Banking. How would this be viewed during recruiting? I don't have any intention to stay in Houston for the remainder of my working career.

2) During the business school application process, would it just be easier to say that I want to do consulting instead of banking, and go for banking AFTER I get in? I would imagine it makes more sense to say ""I want to go for MBB because I'm looking for more strategy work as opposed to operational/implementation type work that I get at Big 4."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but this takes the switching function out of the equation, and adcoms might view me as a safer bet to actually land the job that I am ""looking"" for.

Right now, my goal is to go and kill the GMAT. I'm going to be studying for a full year (taking it Jan 2017), and will be volunteering as much as I can during the next 2.5 years.

What do you think guys, is this doable? Any input would be greatly appreciated!"

Obviously this is very close to actual software development and the experience would help, but exactly how much would it help? 

Would a recruiter view it as a big bonus in that line of work, or is it something that would look lackluster to actually writing code. I appreciate any advice."
409wb1,64,2016-01-09,My friend is gone and I just need to talk about it,Kryptonovich,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/409wb1/my_friend_is_gone_and_i_just_need_to_talk_about_it/,"Ryan Wilson was my best friend since first grade. We did everything together. From Ms. Alvers’ first grade class, to the month’s worth of detention we got when we were fourteen for lighting Roman candles in our school’s first floor bathroom, to looking suave at Senior Prom, we were always together - a team. Ryan and me. Me and Ryan.

We ended up at the same university, on Canada’s West Coast, right by the Pacific Ocean. He was studying Political Science (he wanted to be UN Secretary-General someday), and I was studying History. He was way more excited about university than I was - he really felt that it would lead him to great things, that he was building his future here and now. It just filled him with energy. “Mike,” he’d say to me, “this is the start of the rest of our lives.” I used to think he was overthinking it, but now...well, now I try not to remember him saying that stuff to me. It hurts too much.

But, what won’t ever leave my mind, what can’t leave my mind, is that we had so many good times. So many great memories. I remember the time he wanted to spray paint “LEROY AIN’T SHIT” on Leroy Miller’s brand new BMW, that his parents had bought him, in Eleventh Grade, because Leroy had thrown his textbooks into a trash can as a way to look good in front of his friends.

“Dude, just let it go. Your textbooks are fine.” I said. 

“What? Let that asshole mess with me? You know me better than that,” he said back to me.

“Well, fuck it. You do this, count me out. I’m not gonna get myself expelled and arrested.” And he just smirked, turned and walked away. I swore to myself I wouldn’t give in, that I wouldn’t let him win on this one.

But sure enough, like the good and loyal friend I was, the next night, at roughly two in the morning, I was standing in my hoodie in the cold December weather, my hands tucked deep into my hoodie pockets, and looking back and forth to make sure no one saw us as Ryan spraypainted those artful words onto the windshield of Leroy Miller’s car. The next day Leroy was furious, cursing and yelling up and down over how he was going to catch whoever did it and “bash his fucking head in”. I literally had to pull Ryan into the second floor bathroom where he could safely laugh his ass off without being seen nor heard by Leroy.

So that was what we had. Everything was great, everything had always been great, and everything was always going to be great.

But then Ryan started getting scared by what was in his bathroom. Well, what he thought was in his bathroom.

See, Ryan was living by himself in student housing - a studio apartment in one of the newer buildings - his one had opened about three years prior, in the fall of 2010. I was living off-campus with some roommates. Now, for the first couple months, everything went fine.  He was loving his first taste of independence (his parents were kind of controlling and strict when he was a teenager living with them), and he’d always be inviting me over. He liked to host.

But then he started telling me, all freaked out, about strange things happening in his bathroom. At night, he’d hear sounds of metallic groaning, and shuffling sounds, as if someone was walking or moving around in there. This was even after he’d checked and made sure it was empty. Other times, in day and at night, he’d hear whispering in the empty bathroom, sometimes in English, sometimes in other languages, and then there were the times when he’d feel really uncomfortable looking in the mirror, feeling like - so he said - it was only a matter of time before his reflection did something on its own. He’d tell me how he couldn’t sleep, how every second in bed at night before he fell asleep, his heart would be pounding, and he’d be terrified that something was going to walk out of his bathroom and over to his bed. He even stopped using the bathroom entirely, choosing to use the building’s men’s changing room on the second floor, even if it meant getting dressed and going down there after waking up in the middle of the night. 

And there was more. He started having horrifying nightmares. He’d see all these terrible things in them - people getting slaughtered, dead relatives with eye sockets full of maggots and living dolls with smiles full of teeth made of razor blades. And that wasn’t the end of it, so he said. He’d be going about his day, going too and from class, and he’d...he’d see these things, these things from his nightmares, in the corner of his eye. And when he’d turn to look at them, they’d be there, clear in his vision for a split second, and then they’d disappear. 

All of this took a toll on him. I could see how it was affecting him, and honestly, that was what scared me. He’d visit me (he stopped inviting me over, and kept turning me down when I asked to come over) and there’d just be these bags under his eyes, showing he’d barely slept. His voice would be shaky, and he’d be completely wired - the slightest noise would cause him to jump, and he looked constantly uncomfortable and afraid. He looked as if he was about to break down crying any moment.

Me? I thought it was weird, but I didn’t think it was an actual haunting. I mean, that was ridiculous - ghosts weren’t real. I started to worry about him, that he had some form of mental illness, maybe. What else could explain him seeing things when he was awake, hearing whispers when no one was there? Maybe the stress caused by his school workload was causing this, or maybe this had been with him since he was born and it was just now manifesting itself - I didn’t know, I wasn’t a doctor. But I told him that it was stupid, that ghosts weren’t real, that sooner or later this stuff, this fear, would go away, but that he needed to be proactive about it. He needed to get the right help, and be bold and quit letting this stuff freak him out. This stuff that was bothering him, that was scaring him, it was all in his head, it wasn’t real. But he needed to get help before it got worse.

“You’re not there, you don’t know what this is like. I know what’s fake and I know what’s real, and this is real,” he told me. His hands trembled and his voice quavered when he said this.

“What do you want me to say?” I answered back, “That ghosts are real? That some evil spirit is living in your bathroom? Do you have any idea how ridiculous that is? You’re smarter than that.” I leaned in. “Please, you need to see the right people about this. Phone your Mom and Dad, go see a campus shrink, get whatever meds you need to, and get this taken care of. I’m here for you, you know that.” I was pleading. I really was scared for him.

That quieted him down, and he told me he’d consider it. Then he went home.

Anyways, he listened to me. About a month later, he told me that he had taken my advice. He had had a talk with his parents, had seen a campus shrink, and got prescribed a bunch of meds. And everything quieted down. Things couldn’t be better, he said. No more nightmares, no more whispers, no more seeing things. He’d walk into the bathroom when he heard even the slightest noise, check it over, and walk out. He even would get up in the middle of the night, walk into the bathroom - with the lights off - and stare into the mirror for minutes at a time, just daring whatever was in there to come and get him. And, of course, nothing happened. He became more and more confident that nothing was there, that there was nothing to be afraid of. After all, ghosts aren’t real.

The last time I saw him, he looked so alive. He was gushing over how he was going to apply for a First Year Internship to work at the United Nations Headquarters for a semester. “It’s the opportunity of a lifetime,” he said, “Where else can I really build the foundation of a career in diplomacy and international relations?” I was happy for him. Eventually, it got late, and he said he had to be getting home, and that he’d Facebook me the next day to make plans for when we would next hang out. I saw him out the door, watched him walk down the street toward the bus stop, then went back inside. I never saw him again.

I didn’t hear from him the next day. I figured he got caught up in work - he always was super busy. A week later, I still hadn’t heard from him. Neither had anyone else. After some asking, I found out from his classmates and his professors that he hadn’t been in class at all that week. More than that, no one he’d dealt with in his usual routine (classmates, professors, etc) had seen him during that week - not even once. Nor had they heard from him, including the professors who had e-mailed him asking why he wasn’t in class and why he wasn’t in contact with his classmates where group projects were concerned. So, knowing that he was struggling with mental illness, I got worried - real worried. Scared, even. I went to his family and laid out what was wrong. Pretty quickly, they filed a missing persons report, and within a day, the police got the university housing people to open up his residence apartment as part of the search. He wasn’t there, and there was no sign of a struggle or forced entry or anything like that. But they did find something. A large dried blood streak, on the floor of his bathroom. 

Right away, a criminal investigation was opened to investigate the possibility of foul play. But after about two months, there were no leads and no real evidence that anything criminal had happened to him, so the police closed the case. Suicide was considered, but that was discounted quickly as that theory didn’t make sense - if he killed himself, where was the body? And if he cut himself deep in the bathroom and moved out, why wasn’t there a blood trail, and why wasn’t the body anywhere nearby at all? The cops scoured the entire area of campus where the residence building was - every nook and cranny, and every room in every building. If it were there, they’d have found it. But they didn’t. So eventually they scaled back the investigation. They kept the posters and TV news spots up about him being missing, but aside from that, there wasn’t much more they could do.

Due to a bunch of campus housing regulations, his parents weren’t able to keep his studio unit registered to Ryan. Add to that that, as Ryan was missing, and the semester was over and he hadn’t registered for any more classes (because he was missing), he couldn’t be enrolled in the school anymore, and thus, legally speaking, he was no longer a student. So they had to move his stuff out of the unit. It was so tough on them, so I did everything I could to help out. I spent three days helping his parents move his stuff out of the apartment. It was on the last day of moving stuff out, when everything had been taken down to his parents’ SUV, and I was alone in the apartment, that I stepped into his bathroom. My heart was broken. This was my best friend. I loved him to death, and we were like brothers. What could have happened to him? What’d he do to himself? Did he do something to himself? I thought back to what he had said about his bathroom - this bathroom - and how silly it had sounded. But it seemed so real to him, I could see that plainly from when I saw him those times and what he had told me. But I shook that out of my mind - that was his mental illness at work, I told myself. But that notion left me very quickly, due to what happened next.

I looked into the mirror, at my reflection, trying to make sense of things. And then something happened. Something I would never believe if I were you reading this. As I was gazing into the mirror, my reflection - all on its own - smiled and winked at me. I blinked. What the hell just happened? What did I just see? Fully sane, fully cognizant and fully sober, I watched my reflection smile even wider, and step forward and reach out toward me. And then….then it spoke. It fucking spoke, and it spoke in Ryan’s voice. 

“Come join us,” it said. And as I looked into its eyes...I don’t know what I saw. I’ve never seen that kind of presence before, and I don’t think I ever will again.

At that moment, it kicked in. This was real. Ryan was right all along. It wasn’t mental illness, it was the real deal. My heart started pounding desperately as I froze, and then as its hand approached the mirror, it occurred to me that if I stuck around, it might actually reach out and grab me. Fight or flight kicked in, and I tore out of there in less than a few seconds. I practically pounded on the elevator button down the hallway, and once it arrived, I repeatedly pounded the Ground Floor button with my index finger, slamming myself against the back wall of the elevator as the doors started to close and the elevator started to move.

Ryan’s parents noticed my upset. They asked what was wrong. I couldn’t tell them. How could I? Given what they were going through, what they thought was the reason for their son’s disappearance, not only would they not believe me, they’d think I was joking about what happened in the most ugly and despicable way possible. So I said it was just stuff going on in my own life.

Within days, I had applied to transfer to a school across the country. My parents hated the idea and didn’t understand why I was doing it, but I didn’t care. I didn’t want to be anywhere near that thing, whatever it was. 

To this day, they say it was mental illness that made Ryan disappear. That right now he’s either out there, scared and alone, or dead, probably by his own hand. But I know better. I know that whatever it was that lived in that bathroom, it targeted Ryan. It toyed with his mind and life, and then when Ryan got on the meds, it pulled back as a way of playing with him. And then it took him. And I don’t care what anyone says, or any explanation anyone comes up with, nothing will ever change that.

Rest in peace, Ryan. I’ll never forgive myself for not believing you.

40a2ve,3,2016-01-10,I wanted to stop my dad from taking money from me. Can't say no.,substitute4throwaway,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/40a2ve/i_wanted_to_stop_my_dad_from_taking_money_from_me/,"EDIT: Rewrote some of the thread to add a few missing details.

I'm really mad at myself. 2016 was supposed to the year in which I completely put a stop to this behavior. Already failed this week.

My dad isn't being forceful or malicious. He genuinely needs the money, so I give him my debit card for him to withdraw whatever he needs and he gives it back afterward. I don't take the money out myself because that involves going for a ride to the bank with him to save gas and such. Only problem? He constantly criticizes the hell out of me, even if we're having a good laugh. He always makes a jab towards my lack of friends, my inability to complete college faster, etc.

It's common sense to kick his ass out of the car and not give him the money, but there's a little more to the story.

I have an autistic brother. Dad watches over him because mom's an absent-minded workaholic. She may cook and clean for my brother, but she still likes to leave him by himself. Dad actually makes the effort to play games, have fun, teach him things like how to ride a bike, etc.

Me? I'm at the point where I just want to be left alone all the time. Not just because I'm a recluse, but I genuinely want to be left alone and wallow in my own self-pity, self-loathing, etc. 

But since mom (divorced from dad) has to work all the time, I have to watch over him anyway for the majority of the day. The only thing I don't do is take him to and from school because I have morning classes. Plus, my dad does make the effort to take some of the weight off my shoulders by giving my bro car rides throughout the week. Even on the weekends when mom is available (but she constantly shops because she's that way in the head).

Oh yeah, and my dad's homeless. He's couch-surfing and living on some form of welfare. He's pretty secretative about it. Regardless, my brother can't stay with him. So, that's why my dad drives him around to places.

Currently, I get paid monthly for watching over my bro when mom's not around, but every time I get paid, I become broke again once dad tells me that he's (A) going through car trouble (B) has to take another trip to Sacramento to fix someone else's car or visit his newfound grandkids (C) needs gas money to take care of my brother.

Worst of all, my dad seems to be getting better. Finally got an internship and has 1-2 more years to go to get out of his situation. He hasn't asked for anything since September...until this week. He promises to give the money back soon, and he's pretty true to his word, but I'm still tired of this shit.

It's so hard. I have talked to other people about this, but they usually don't seem to give a shit (including two different therapists). Only person that did was my older sister, but I think she only gave a damn because she caught my dad in a lie (he took money from her too a few times) and not really because of me and our brother.

I'm just so mad. I plan to tell him about the whole cutting-off thing as soon as he gives the money back. 

But I don't know. He's such a morally grey person that I don't know if I'm just worsening the situation for the both of us, or if I'm doing the right (selfish) thing.

And no, it's not like my family can get a bus driver for my brother. Too many bad experiences with that. Plus, we live in the kind of neighborhood where no one gives a shit about the disabled.

**TL;DR**: Dad watches over my autistic brother to take the weight off my shoulders (I watch him a lot when my mom isn't home). He's in a bad situation, so I lend money to him every month - the money I earned for watching over my brother when mom (divorced) isn't home. As a result, I'm almost always broke. I wanted it to stop by 2016. I failed since I can't so ""no"". Now I'm frustrated."

###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Of course

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Purely for gaming, and maybe watching some Netflix/YouTube videos. I've got a Macbook for work and school related stuff.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

1080p 60fps gaming, preferably highest settings

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

€500 - €700ish

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

The Netherlands

**Current build**.

Part|Model|
:--|:--|
Motherboard|?? (See explanation below)|
RAM|6GB Samsung RAM (See explanation below)|
Processor|Intel Core i7 870|
Graphics Card|MSI GTX 970 GAMING 4G|
SSD|Samsung 850 EVO 500GB|
HDD|1TB Hard Drive (See explanation below)|
Case|NZXT S340|
PSU|Corsair PSU Builder VS550|

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

So, a quick explanation for this build. Two friends gave me their old pc and some parts, and I put something together with an old graphics card I had laying around (GTX 550Ti). Although the build was free, I couldn't play newer games anything higher than low graphics so I decided to upgrade. 

I first bought an SSD, to increase pc performance overall, and a few days later I bought a new graphics card and a new PSU (my old one only worked when the 24-pin cable was in a pretty awkward position so I would risk putting a new graphics card in there), and after that I bought a new case and put everything in it. The motherboard, processor and RAM are all from a stock Acer pc that came with a GTX 420. I'm pretty happy with the build so far, but I'm looking to make it more 'modern'. But, I have several questions about upgrading, and what to upgrade. (Also, I can't use the USB 3.0 ports on my case because my motherboard doesn't have the connection pins for it).

**CPU Related**

1. How is my CPU bottlenecking my GPU?

2. I'm interested in buying a Skylake CPU to be more future proof, is this recommended or is it better to wait some longer for the prices to drop?

3. Should I buy an Intel i5 6600, Intel i5 6600k of Intel i7 6700k?


**Cooling**

4. In case of the unlocked cpu's, I'd really like to buy a NZXT Kraken X41 (because it looks cool), but is it recommended performance-wise? (Also, should I get the X41 or X61?)

5. My case is kinda noisy (I'm using the stock fans), and I want to buy some silent fans. I've seen everyone recommend Noctua, so I think I'm going with those. How do these perform? https://www.megekko.nl/product/1996/621455/Case-fan-140mm/Noctua-NF-A14-industrialPPC-2000-140mm.

6. Should I fill up all fan slots? I want a 140mm for the top of the case, and only a 120mm fits in the back. I do have more space for 2 140mm fans in the front.

7. Can I put those Noctua fans on the NZXT Kraken X41?

8. How do I connect fans? Do they go into the PSU, motherboard or both?

**My list**

9. I actually have 2 lists of parts, what is recommended? Or do you recommend something else?

Part|Model|
:--|:--|
Motherboard|MSI Z170A GAMING M5
RAM|Corsair DDR4 Vengeance LPX 2x8GB 2400 C16
Processor|Intel Core i5 6600K
Cooling|NZXT Kraken X41

Cheaper:

Part|Model|
:--|:--|
Motherboard|Gigabyte GA-Z170-HD3P
RAM|Corsair DDR4 Vengeance LPX 2x8GB 2400 C16
Processor|Intel Core i5 6600

The reason I went with the more expensive parts is mostly looks. I like the look of the MSI motherboard and I think the Kraken (or just a water cooled processor in general) looks pretty sexy. I also want to buy the NZXT HUE+ for some lighting effects. My current case is black, with a red/black MSI graphics card in it, and I think going for that color combination with the motherboard looks pretty nice. I also use a black monitor with red LED's, and a Razer BlackWidow Chroma and Steelseries Rival, both are black and let me choose the LED colors. This way I can go with a Red/Black color scheme (or Rainbow/Black whenever I'm feeling fancy). 

Let me just say thank you in advance for helping me. I've always loved building computers, but never had the money for actual parts so I just rebuild my own a couple of times (didn't touch the processor and it's cooler though). Now that I have 2 jobs (internship and parttime job) I'll finally be able to realise my dream pc, and run all games on 'high' graphics settings, instead of hoping I can even run a new game.

1. What would be the best move here, stick with the company with which I am currently employed, or take the developer position with the other, less reputable, company?

2. Will having an internship as a Process Engineer help me get a job in the development world when I graduate?"

I thought this subreddit was more about talking about different technologies/frameworks/languages/skill-sets and how to properly develop your abilities over time. 

What I'm starting to feel like is that this subreddit is becoming a collegeconfidential-esque forum with humble-braggers and hilarious exaggerations.

Mentors actually working in the field repeatedly say that the prestige of your university or internships really only matter for your first job, and, if you aren't a shitbird/worth your weight, you'll be able to land those jobs anyways. After a bit it becomes a silly water-cooler topic: ""oh, good school, lets get back to work"". 

If you're smart and you have a good work ethic, you'll do fine. Yet this topic literally plagues the subreddit.

_______________

It's depressing. The quality has been decreasing and starting to become ""if you didn't go to Cal, good luck"" ad-nauseum. I go to a good school, and consider myself a good programmer eager to learn, and this subreddit constantly makes me feel like shit about myself and my abilities. I'm sure it does for other people, too. If I recall someone just posted a success-story on here not-too-long-ago and at the bottom he said not to read this subreddit... that's absurd.

There are a literal plethora of programming jobs that all pay really well and have fantastic benefits for literally any location. Just because they're not some hot startup or a monolithic tech-giant doesn't mean they're not worth it to work at.

Who would've ever thought that Philadelphia would have a good bit of tech jobs? Not me, but we do. 

We need to stop with this ""go to &lt;nutty university here&gt; so you can get &lt;cool job in SV&gt; or you're worthless"" attitude that this subreddit has and foster more genuine, informative conversation.

X-Post,Flagellum007,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/40cgwc/can_any_ubcs_computer_engineering_students_and/,"Hello everyone, I have a few questions that maybe some of you may know the answer to and could help me with.

I'm 30 years old, and my current profession is a Red Seal Journeyman Electrician. I've been doing this for about 10 years now, and as of the last 4 years, my interest levels have decreased rapidly. Although it's great knowledge to have, the job just fails to impress me anymore. Not to mention the beating your body takes in the trades.

I really enjoyed building things and electricity always fascinated me, so I thought this is what I really wanted to do. Now my realization is that Computer Engineering is what i've wanted to do all along and that electronics/programing is my true calling.

So, my questions for you are.

1. Have any of you taken the Engineering Transition Diploma at Capilano University? If so, How did you find the school and the professors? Was it an easy transition into 2nd year at UBC after completion? Are you glad you took it?

2. Would you recommend a different school to transfer 1st year engineering from or to just take my pre req's at UBC for acceptance? My reason for Capilano University is for their mature student acceptance.

2. Do you think that my knowledge of electricity and electronics from electrical school will benefit me in any way? Maybe the physics and math part of it? Maybe being able to build complex circuits? I also have some Arduino programing experience and built a few projects.

3. Would it be easy to get a job in Seattle after graduation from UBC, or is it harder because of UW and being a Canadian? Would doing summer internships in Seattle help with a sponsorship to live there?

I would appreciate any insight you may have for me. I'm looking forward to hopefully contributing to the community."

I just posted another post in r/GetEmployed, maybe I'll post it here soon. I am 27/F/NY, got my Masters in health administration, have been unemployed since (2 years!) There are personal reasons for that, but I've still been looking. The problem is that everyone wants experience (usually previous experience for the same job I'm applying for) that I don't have! I have related volunteer work and one internship that I thought would help, but didn't really. 

Everything I pursued before my Masters were majors with jobs that were more education-based, not experience-based, and I'm having a real tough time. I'm not lying on cover letters, but I feel like I'm stretching. 

I had one temp job as a receptionist that ended after one day because the lady thought I was ""overwhelmed"" and basically didn't want to take the time to train me (especially during an apparently busy time). It seems as though there aren't many companies out there that want to take the time to invest in employees - why must that be? Who decides these things? 

I'm just frustrated and want answers! lol. What else should I do? I keep e-mailing my recruiting agency about a program where I can sort of train myself on computer programs, but they say they keep sending it to me and I never get it, or the person to send me the login information isn't in the office, and I'm going out of my mind.

I went back to school for a master's degree and fell in love with programming.  My thesis advisor and academic advisor were recently contacted by a former professor they knew asking for computational linguists and they passed my name along.  

I sent an initial email with no resume/cover letter, and recently he contacted me back asking me to a lunch interview (!!!).  I imagine this is a low-key introduction but I plan to study my butt off for this.  My goal is to get an internship.

The problem is that my husband works for the same company.  It's a large company in Silicon Valley, they work on separate teams, in separate buildings but still on the same campus.  I don't want the guy (or his team) interviewing me to know that my husband also works for the company, at least not at first.

The problem I foresee is this:  How do I explain my background?  I moved to California because of my husband, and my BS was not in CS or IT so I can't make the excuse that I moved here because of tech jobs or something.  I'm envisioning this type of scenario:

Guy: I see you went to [East Coast University].  What made you move out here?

Me: My husband was already working at a small start-up when I graduated, so I moved out here after graduation.
Guy: Oh really, what's he do?

Me: He's a security engineer.

Guy: Oh yeah? Where at?

Me: Here...

What should I say instead?

Sergeant Mendez thought they were roasted pumpkin seeds. The wave of small, white objects broke over the edge of Greer’s locker and cascaded to the tile floor, clattering like a child's spilled M&amp;Ms. Greer’s gaping mouth and slow, confused laugh were enough to make me reach for my phone. We don't allow pranks to go unrecognized in our precinct. I needed a video for the next party.  And then Greer screamed.

“What the fuck is this? These are fucking fingers! Who knew about this?“ He turned toward me and Mendez. His right hand slithered down his thigh toward the butt of his gun like a deadly river asp. “One of you assholes? How did you know?“

“Jesus, Greer, chill the fuck out,” I said, consciously raising my hands away from my sides. I didn't want this to turn into a repeat of what happened last month at the precinct on Broad; a homicide dick fragged his girlfriend, a rookie uniform, and his captain for “conspiring against him”.

“We didn't do shit to you. I thought it was fuckin’ teeth,” I continued.

Mendez held out a placating hand. “Detective, calm down. Move your hand away from your weapon.“

“What?“ Greer asked, looking down at his holster. He ripped his hand away from his side like the gun had suddenly heated to glowing. “I wasn't…” Greer let the protest die in his throat and sat heavily on the wooden bench that ran between the rows of lockers.

“It's just not cool; those fingers. Shitty thing to do to someone.” Greer had lost his anger and, with it, his energy. He muttered his complaints to the tile floor.

“Are those real bones, Detective Chen?“ Mendez asked me.

I shook my head and shrugged, walked toward Greer’s open locker, and - ignoring the acrid scent of fresh sweat wafting from Greer - picked up one of the digits. It didn't seem like plastic or plaster, but I'm not a doctor. I told the sergeant as much and she tasked me with bagging each bleached phalange and sending them across the street to be analyzed for DNA. Mendez wandered off to pull the video footage from the locker room.

Eventually Greer came back to himself and helped me bag. He was quiet and diligent in our tedious work, like a cowed slave. Like a haunted prisoner. 

An hour later, I got a text from Mendez asking me to come to her office. I figured she wanted to review the security footage with me and Greer, but Greer didn't show. He didn't get the text. When Mendez showed me the video file, I saw why. No one had tampered with Greer’s locker since he left the day previous. The angle of the video made it possible to see into the space, which was devoid of the macabre digits a when the thin metal door was slammed and bolted.

That couldn't be possible. Literal handfuls of bone couldn't magically appear in a locker. “Someone screw with the video?” I asked. A bare-bones knowledge of something like Final Cut made it possible to create video loops that held up to visual inspection but minute irregularities in the pixels flagged manipulation. I didn't know much about it other than what Arnott told me when I delivered questionable recordings to him in the basement. 

“Didn't check it that thoroughly, but I did pull feeds that show the locker room entrance. Some of the night crew boys going in and out, but nothing that doesn't gel with this,” Mendez pointed to the video on her computer monitor.

I stood in silence for a moment, bouncing ideas around in my brain and mindlessly chewing my bottom lip.

“I'll check with the Desk Sergeant and see if any visitors stopped-”

“Already did that,” Mendez interrupted. “Nothing.”

“Alright,” I said, thinking out loud. “If they didn't come in through the front, that leaves the sides and back. Somebody *could* have been playing a prank and then clammed up when it got out of hand.” I knew we were both replaying Greer’s hand mindlessly groping for his sidearm.

“You think someone cut the sides of the lockers?“

I nodded. “Worth a look.”

We checked Greer’s locker for tampering, looking for small holes to scoring along the entire length of the side seams to everything in between and came up with dick. It was like the bones had just appeared. Like a medieval alchemist had made a grand discovery and hidden the evidence.

Nothing changed for a week; no leads on parties intentionally causing distress, no admissions of a prank. Greer himself didn't change from that day forth, either. Usually a good natured guy who started passing around the hoagie lunch menus at 9:30 AM, he barely said a word and skipped lunch on all but one day. His eyes began to look baggy and sunken like he spent each night laying awake in bed. Even his hair seemed to thin. 

Then Mendez got a call. 

“Chen, Greer! My office,“ she yelled. 

Once we had shuffled into the closet-sized space, Mendez addressed the phone on her desk. 

“Repeat what you told me, Doctor.“

“Um, alright,” a male voice flowed from the small speakers in the body of the phone, tinny and insignificant-sounding. I could feel my attention wane. “All 60 bones carried identical DNA.”

“OK,” I shrugged, “so they’re real and from one person. The rest of them is probably rotting in a shallow grave. Let’s get an ID and get the search going.”

“You misunderstand me, Detective,” the voice said. “All the bones are phalanges. A single donor only has 28. Furthermore, I’m fairly certain that each bones is a proximal phalange. It is impossible for all the bones to have identical DNA.”

“And yet, they do,” someone said. I wasn’t sure who. Could’ve been me. My skin prickled as the hair on my arms and neck raised and I fell into myself, trying to find a solution that made sense.

I didn’t notice Greer’s panting breath and blanching face until his eyes rolled back into his head and he collapsed on the floor of Mendez’s office.

“Jesus!” Mendez yelled.

“Sergeant? Is everything alright?” the tinny man asked.

I slapped Greer’s face lightly until he came to, then helped him sit on Mendez’s sofa.

“Doctor, was there a ID match with the DNA?” Mendez asked as I started up the Keurig for Greer.

“Yes, Sergeant. One moment.”

“Keelan,” Greer whispered into the steam of his coffee, the white whisps curling around his face and obscuring his eyes.

“What?” I asked.

The tinny man answered, oblivious to Greer’s hushed comment. “The DNA is a match for Roger Keelan. My intern just forwarded his file to you.”

***

Greer still sat on the sofa twenty minutes later. He stared into the murky depths of his mug like a bear during salmon spawning season, transfixed. Mendez’s read through of Roger Keelan’s record revealed that he had been wanted in connection with several occult-motivated murders. He was killed when his home caught fire during his arrest. Of the two detectives who attempted to make the collar, one also perished in the fire. The other was Greer. Mendez had asked him to fill in the blanks so we could figure out who was sending a message about the case. And why.

“Najjar and I were handed the murder in the park,” Greer said, still avoiding eye contact. His voice had dropped an octave and all the life had left his shoulders, letting them hang like pork loins from a butcher’s hook. “That was ten years ago. It was a little more brutal than most - the girl’s neck was hacked almost clean through - but nothing obviously special. Couldn’t tell shit from the crime scene, either; it was just a dumping site, not the actual location of the murder. We actually didn’t know there was something weird about the whole thing until we sent her body away for autopsy.

“Stomach was empty except for milk and blood. Some goat blood, some human. Not her own. The inside of her bottom lip had also been carved into with a blade to form the shape of a pentagram. The County Sheriffs were actually the ones to find the murder location, which was a 40 minute drive outside the city. On a bed of blood-soaked ivy, we found the corpse of the goat mutilated and strung spread-eagle to some trees. A few crude Crosses of St. Peter had been burned at the site and a closer look revealed baggies with coke and heroin residue in them. We were able to hook up with Vice and use the drug bags to trace back to a local dealer who gave us Keelan.

“When we got to Keelan’s house, the fuckin’ place was lousy with guns, ammo, and gasoline. He let us in with our warrant, then made a dash for his bedroom. He started popping off rounds in our direction, so we fired back. We must have hit some of the gas because a something caught fire. All that accelerant and wooden floors turned the house into a goliath funeral pyre for Keelan and Najjar. I got out, but only just. Third degree burns on my left foot.”

“What about the finger bones, though?” I asked.

“No idea, Chen. Really. News to me,” Greer said.

“But you knew the fingers were connected to Keelan.”

“Yeah. Sick Satanist shit like that sounds like Keelan. Or whoever he hangs out with. What are you trying to say, Chen?”

“Nothing, man,” I waved my hand, trying to diffuse his suspicions like a heavy odor. “Just trying to make sense of this.”

“Alright,” Mendez spoke from steepled fingers, “we know what we’re dealing with now. Someone is harassing Detective Greer for Roger Keelan’s death. I want you both to follow leads looking for next of kin and friends who might have a grudge. I’m going to have the bones sent for toolmark analysis at County; maybe someone with a knowledge of human anatomy shaped those bones on a lathe to throw us off.”

With that, we left Mendez’s office. I spent the rest of the day sifting through old records that were cross referenced in Keelan’s file. The following day I visited my sources in the city underground to see if they had information on Keelan from back in the day or current information on any of his crew. My sources provide information about random murders and small-time criminals like water from a faucet; they live in the middle of the shit and see me as a resource to keeping their neighborhood safe. Sure they clam up when organized crime is involved, but that’s probably a smart move on their part. That said, no one knew a damn thing about Keelan, though some remembered the murders. Like Greer said, they were more violent than most.

My last stop was a dive bar on Fifth. The owner had a murky past and a deep knowledge of the law. He had to be either a retired mafia underboss or criminal lawyer. A quick background check on the guy didn’t reveal a single entry older than twelve years, which made me suspect witness protection. Whatever the story, Tom usually gave me the straight dope.

I sat down at the bar and Tom slid a Newcastle in front of me without asking. I could be written up for drinking on the job, but one beer wasn’t anything. I think having that little hint of blackmail made Tom trust me. I took a deep pull from the pint glass and set it down.

“What brings you in, Chen?”

“Fellow named Roger Keelan, used to enjoy murdering girls in ritualistic occult settings. You know, the usual.”

Tom smiled, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “He died a few years ago I heard. Have there been more murders?”

“No, thank God. Another dick in the department was one of the officer who tried to arrest him. Someone’s fucking with him now. Sent him a late Christmas card,” I said, careful to keep the details to myself. I trusted Tom but information has a way of travelling around, even among trustworthy people. Especially something as weird as 60 finger bones in a locker.

“Probably just some nut, Chen. They really have you wasting your time on this?”

I nodded. “There are other details that concern us. Gotta take it seriously.”

Again that fake smile. Tom’s eyes weren’t just out of sync with his grin, they were contrary to it. They looked sad. Rheumy. He took a step closer to me and put a hand on my wrist.

“Drop this case, Chen. Please.”

“What? Why? Who are you protecting?”

“Just drop it! Nothing good can come out of this. I’m not protecting anybody but you, Chen. Let that other detective investigate, the one who was already close to Keelan. You just sandbag the shit out of this. Come here everyday. I’ll give you free drinks. Fuck, I’ll buy your lunches, Chen.”

I finished my beer and slapped a five on the counter.

“Keep it,” Tom said. “Just think about what I said. This is dangerous territory.”

I nodded and walked out.

When I got back to the precinct to clock out, Mendez called me to her office.

“Have you heard from Greer today?” she asked.

I shook my head. “I’ve been out all day.”

“He left early yesterday, said he had some notes at his house. Then he didn’t come in today. No calls, no emails.”

“Do you think he’s trying to go off-books with this one?” I asked. Off-books is our precinct’s slang for frontier justice, which is to say the unjustified beating or killing of a suspect. It doesn’t happen often, but some officers have a case that won’t get out of their heads. Last year, one of the guys from Vice shot a drug dealer point-blank in the face. The dealer was unarmed. The officer had just watched him sell to children too many times.

“I don’t know. You saw how upset he got when those bones showed up. If he found a lead, he might do something he’ll regret,” Mendez said.

“He’s on my way home. I’ll stop by and talk to him if he’s there.”

“Thanks, Chen. If he’s gone, give me a call. We’ll have to figure out something else then.”

Greer’s house was dark save for one lamp in the living room. The soft amber light diffused in the heavy curtains that hung in front of the window and gave the illusion that the room was ablaze. Tom’s words came back to me. Maybe I should have just walked away.

Instead, I found the front door ajar. Greer sat in a large, cushioned chair in his living room. In his left hand he held a half empty bottle of Glenmorangie scotch, in his right a pistol. He looked small. Not just dwarfed by the chair, but his sizable spirit had shriveled and blackened like a picked mushroom. He wasn't surprised to see someone enter his house. He was surprised, however, that it was me.

“Chen, buddy, I'm fine. Get out of here.“

He sounded like Tom.

I held my hands out to my sides, hoping an answer would fall into my arms. “Why do people keep warning me off this?”

Greer took a healthy mouthful of scotch, belched, and slurred, “Because it ain't for you. It's for me.“

I was pissed. I couldn't handle this cryptic shit anymore. “Goddamnit! What? What the fuck isn't for me?”

Greer sighed and motioned me to a neighboring chair. I sat.

“What I told you and Mendez isn't quite true. Najjar and I figured out Keelan was behind the murders but when I say behind, I mean behind. He didn't touch any of those girls himself. He convinced other people to do it somehow. Most of them killed themselves shortly after. Remember hearing about the Summer of Suicides when you were a kid?“

I nodded.

“That was Keelan cleaning house. But one person escaped. Middle-aged woman named Claudia something. We questioned her and she immediately confessed to killing one of the girls. Said she was drugged or brainwashed or something. She agreed to testify against Keelan. We had a uniform take her back to the precinct and we went for Keelan. When we got there, he wasn't worried. Said we had no case. He came with us, though.

“When we got to the precinct, we heard that Claudia had tried to escape the squad car and attacked the officer driving her. He was forced to shoot her. Keelan got off.

“Najjar and I decided he needed to be of the streets. I suggested staging a shootout and gunning him down like a diseased animal. Najjar wanted him to suffer longer. He wanted to break into Keelan’s place and plant evidence at one of the murders. One night, after a few glasses of this shit,” Greer lifted the bottle, “he went for it.”

Greer got quiet, wiped his weeping eyes. “Najjar didn't come in the next day. I thought maybe he needed to come to terms with breaking the law, but then he was absent the next day, too. He didn't answer his phone, wasn't at his place. I went to Keelan’s looking for him.

“I kicked open the door and found Najjar on Keelan’s couch. Blood everywhere. Najjar had his right hand in his mouth gnawing at the flesh, blood and tendons smeared on his face like barbecue sauce. The other hand was a stump. No fingers.” Greer sobbed and took a long pull from the bottle. “He looked at me like I wasn't there. Through me. Kept repeating that he was starving and ‘trapped in a prison’. Keelan was sitting next to him smiling.

“I pulled out my gun and blew the smug son of a bitch away. Right in the head. The shot woke Najjar and he started screaming this horrible sound, like the blood was clotting in his throat and fucking up his vocal cords. Then he calmed and he asked me to shoot him. I don't know why I listened. I should have called an ambulance. There was so much I could have done to save him. But I pulled his gun and shot him in the heart. Fired a few more rounds into the wall near the door, a few from my weapon further into the house. I drug Keelan’s body toward his bathroom and dropped Najjar’s gun near his hand. Then I lit the place up. Keelan’s chemicals took care of the rest.

“I called in the shooting, then sat in the grass in Keelan’s lawn and just watched it burn. I tried to cover up some of blood on my clothes with soot. I found one of Najjar’s chewed fingers in the hem of my pant leg. It was coated in blood, mucous, and bile. He must have coughed it up when he realized where he was. Those fucking fingers…,” Greer trailed off.

We sat in a silence punctuated by the hollow slosh of Greer’s sips from his bottle.

“Keelan’s body wasn't burned right,” Greer said without warning. “When they took it out of the house. The excellerants burned hot, scorched everything. Najjar was just bones. But Keelan was only singed. The fire investigator said the body was protected by the structure of the bathroom, but that fucker didn't even look like Keelan a few days later in the morgue. It was like a bad Xerox of a man, or a look alike like Saddam Hussein had. But the DNA matched Keelan from some arrest when he was a kid.

“I tried to convince the precinct commander to do a more thorough investigation of Keelan’s body, but he said I was distraught. Put me on leave with mandatory shrink visits.”

I shook my head, trying to make events line up like ice cubes falling back into a freezer tray. “Greer, you said you shot Keelan. How could you question the ID on the body?”

“Godamnit!,” Greer yelled. He slammed the butt of his pistol onto the coffee table between our chairs, sending a porcelain tchotchke tumbling to the hardwood floor below. It exploded into pieces. Greer looked down at the figure, a Scottish golfer that was easily 40 years old, and his eyes began to water again.

“That’s what Keelan does, Chen.” Greer wiped the tears from one eye with the back of his hand. “He fucks with you. Fucks with what you see. What you think.” He gestured at the jagged pieces on the floor, “Takes away your favorite memories and leaves you a shell begging for death.

“He made Najjar think he was trapped and starving. Forced him to cannibalize himself. I don’t know if I shot Keelan or some poor fuck Keelan pulled out of an alley.”

“Greer,” I started. I wasn’t sure where the words were going, I just knew I needed to derail Greer from his thoughtpath. The alcohol had loosened his mouth and his mind and he was spouting the kind of childish ghost stories that usually only creep in when you try to return to sleep after being startled awake. “You saw Keelan. You shot Keelan dead. You took him off the streets, Greer. Give me the gun, man.”

“Fuck, Chen, you don’t get it! He called me on my office phone about a year after I thought he died!” Greer yelled. He thrashed in his chair when spoke, hands slicing through the air in exaggerated emphasis. I kept an eye on the gun.

“That could have been anybody. One of his friends. Whoever put the…,” I let the sentence die in the air between us. No need to remind Greer about the bone incident.

“And remember that murder two years ago out in the sticks?” Greer went on. “The Sheriff's Office took it. Girl had her face removed and stitched to her stomach. One tit cut off and shoved down her throat. Old man walked up to the officers investigating the scene and confessed right there, then he was stabbed through the neck by a meth junkie at the prison. That was fucking Keelan! It’s his goddamn MO!”

I nodded, waiting for Greer to continue. It would do no good for me to talk sense to him until he had said his piece. He took a breath to continue his tirade.

The front door slammed, and Greer’s yelling, the sloshing booze, the sound of both of us squirming in the chairs died instantly.

“No, don’t stop!” a voice called from Greer’s foyer. “It’s not everyday you get to hear someone listing all your greatest hits.”

A tall, lanky man walked into the room. His dirty hair hung in his face, matted into wild imposters of dreadlocks. It took me a second to figure out he was Keelan as he strode toward us. He didn’t look like a Satanist. At least, he didn’t look like the ones I had seen in movies. There were no leather pants, no cloak, no eyeliner. Not even a pentagram or tattoos. Keelan wore ripped jeans and a stained flannel shirt. He looked like any run-of-the-mill, strung-out den rat I could have picked up for a parole violation downtown.

Once I made the connection, I pulled my weapon from its holster. “Don’t move, asshole!” I yelled, my voice chilled to the point of shivering from Greer’s stories and Tom’s warning. Who was this guy?

“Give me your gun, Chen,” Greer said, almost pleading.

When I looked over, he had his own pistol pointed at my chest.

“Are you fucking kidding me?”

“Give me your gun,” Greer repeated.

I handed him the weapon, my mind chattering with possibilities. Was this a plot to get me? What did Greer have against me? We were tight. Did I learn too much about the cover up? The floor felt like it tilted.

Greer ejected my clip and it hit the wood floor with the sound of an open-handed slap. He threw the gun across the room. Once it was out of his hand, he lowered his gun back to his side and picked up his scotch for another sip.

“Trying to save some lives, Greer?” Keelan asked.

Greer said nothing, just looked Keelan dead in the eyes.

“You always were headstrong. Too bad the same wasn’t true for the cop who wasted his captain and girlfriend. Did you know them?” Keelan asked.

Silence.

“The bitch was pregnant, you know. Too bad. Dumb fucking homicide dick should have minded his own business,” Keelan said, smiling.

“Fuck you,” Greer spat, a mixture of scotch and saliva dribbling down his lip.

“I’m going to enjoy this, Greer. You’re a fat fuck, you know that? You feelin’ hungry like your boy Najjar? Nom nom.”

Greer turned to me. He looked like a man falling apart; fluids oozed from his eyes, nose, and mouth. His face was red as a sunburn.

“Chen, you just sit there,” he said. “No matter what happens, you keep your hands in your goddamn pockets, OK? Don’t even brush up against this fuck.” He yelled the last two words into Keelan’s face, who seemed to relish in the spittle that fell on his face.

“Are you feeling trapped, Greer? How long has it been since you’ve eaten? How long until you can find food again?” Keelan stood in front of Greer, his left arm outstretched, the hand forming a claw.

Greer began to whimper and clutch at his stomach. He sounded like a newborn animal searching for milk. Keelan’s body began to quake and Greer’s moans kept pace.

Then Greer lifted his gun to his temple and fired.

Blood splattered the back and wings of the chair.

Keelan dropped his arm to his side, face slack.

Then he turned on me. Keelan took a step in my direction, then another until he was uncomfortably close. I could smell his unwashed stench, the odor from his old workboots, his sweaty groin. Then he kneeled to look me in the eye.

“You want to take a swing at me, boy?” he asked.

My hands clamped hard on the arms of the chair, whitening the knuckles.

“Here,” Keelan said, jutting his jaw out toward me and circling it, eyes closed.

After a moment, he said, “I feel like a stripper jiggling my wet ass in front of a man with no cock.” He lowered his jaw.

“You can borrow my shaft,” he said, then flung the flannel up over his hip and brandished a knife. He snapped it open with an index finger, tossed it lightly into the air, and caught it by the blade. The hilt was pointed toward me.

I tightened my grip, ripping the thin fabric of the chair.

“You want to, I can tell. Snatch it out my fingers and slice here,” Keelan ran a grimy pinky finger over his throat. “Watch me die.”

I could feel the knife pulling at me like a magnet. My hands were cold. So cold. The warm, bright arterial blood from Keelan’s neck would feel good on my frozen knuckles.

I closed my eyes.

“Fine,” Keelan spat. “Have it your way.” And he left.

When I finally left Greer’s house after calling Mendez and going over the night’s events with her, it was early afternoon of the next day. I didn’t want to go home. I wanted answers. Tom knew something about Keelan and I had to get it out of him. I had to get the bastard.

When I walked into the bar, Tom made eye contact with me. Something in his gaze told me he knew about Greer. His eyes were sad, but approving that I was unharmed. The anger left my body.

I nodded at Tom. He nodded back. I felt that he had been put in a position similar to mine. I knew it. He had the same pain of inaction hiding in the back of gaze, lurking in the shadows.

Tom set a pint of Newcastle and lowball of something dark and strong on the bar. I sat in front of it.

“These are on the house, Detective Chen,” he said.

I drank.

Some evil you can’t fight."

i'm a student and moving around a lot with internships and university. That's why i'd like a portable Laptop that's good enough for me when i'm not at home with my PC. I've got some money from my internship at the moment, but i'll go back to university soon, that's i want to spend as little as possible. 


I will most likely use it for watching youtube videos and some Programming. I also play some games, but i usually stick to older games. The newest game i'd like to play on it is probably xcom (1). And i don't care if i have to turn down the graphics.


But for work/programming i would like to plug in a keyboard and a 1920x1080 screen. I won't programm games and i will be able to test my finished programs on PCs with more Power, that means it's most important job is typing. If it can play a 1920x1080 youtube video i'd be more than happy with it.


I'll have a powerplug near me most of the time so i don't care about battery life. Even though i have a lot of expirience with PCs, i've never worked with laptops and especally not with lower end processers like a i3. So i'm not sure how low i can go without having a horrible expirience. 


Thanks for any advice (or expiriences with lower end processors and integrated graphics) i really appriciate it!





The cheapest notebook i was able to find is this: [a very cheap laptop](http://www.notebooksbilliger.de/studentenprogramm/notebooks/hewlett+packard/hp+350+g2+k9l04es+notebook)
i'd put in some more money to add an SSD and maybe more memory. But i'm not sure if the Processor and integrated Graphics can handle yotube and Programming, the price is really tempting.


**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: Germany 

* Budget range: 0-800€

* Purpose: mainstream/portable

* Screen size preference: none

* OS preference: Linux (any, i'll just install linux anyway)

* Gaming requirements: xcom lowest settings

* Other performance requirements: no

* Portability requirements: constantly carried and frequently moved

So I got into the college of my dreams and moved half way across the country in august. I LOVE it, the city is amazing and I can see myself living there forever. However, I'm kind of confused about what to do with my life at this point besides go to school.

It's a pretty well known highly selective school on the east coast with on campus housing required for all 4 years, so things are kind of frozen in time right now. Basically I'm ready to start making solid plans for the next 4 years so I can minimize the amount of ""surprises"" there may be down the road.

which includes but is not limited to(suggestions welcome!):

* Summer: Should I get a job? Or should I try and take a pre-med requirement during summer instead? (I only took bio this year because I really hate chem and wanted to feel my way out)

* Also Summer: I'm really not terribly spoiled, but my school has amazing financial aid (it's almost famous for this) and my parents have been paying for all my tuition which is actually cheaper than my high school tuition was. Should I maybe consider staying in my college city (washington DC) and getting a cheap little apartment for the 3 months? Is that even a thing? **where do most people live during undergrad summers...?**

* Internships - wtf? I understand most people consider them sophomore year, how do I even get started with that? How does that coincide with the whole summer job idea? Do people not make money sophomore year and dedicate their time to grabbing internships instead?

* Budgeting - How can I start making a reasonable budget to plan for the future with the money I've saved from high school/the pocket change my parents give me? It's not a huge problem now, but my budgeting method now is just telling myself ""ok spend 20 dollars this week on groceries, then put 40 dollars in savings. done."" Which doesn't seem very sophisticated and I'd love to start thinking more long term for my finances at this point.

* Credit - I'd really like to get a credit card and start building credit while my expenses are only like 20 dollars a week, but how can I get on the path to getting a credit card without a job? Apparently a bunch of credit cards have been sent to my house but my parents are super strict and won't give me the mail so I want to look into applying, but I have nothing to put in the ""income"" section really.

Sorry this is so long!! I straight up feel too embarrassed to ask any of these things irl, but it seems like everyone knows about it but me so I figured I might as well try!

40hpf4,7,2016-01-11,Hitting a wall in my first year of grad school and concerned I may have ADHD,Sestrichka-lisichka,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/40hpf4/hitting_a_wall_in_my_first_year_of_grad_school/,"I'm writing because I'm hoping maybe my story might resonate with people on this board.  Up until this year, the idea I might have ADHD never crossed my mind...

I'm a 26 year old woman in the US.  This year I started graduate school in a very competitive MA/PhD program in the humanities after 3 years away from school (I finished college in 2012).  I've been going to a therapist for probably 5 years and have been on SSRIs for anxiety and depression for probably the same amount of time. I've never felt that they completely worked and with the beginning of my program, I've gone back to a psychiatrist to get the medications adjusted because I'm really floundering.  I'm finding it absolutely impossible to get through my massive reading load.  A 30-40 page article will take me hours to get through because I get so distracted with god-knows-what thoughts.  My readings in foreign languages take even longer because any distraction means I couldn't understand anything I just read.  I can't skim (I've tried) because if I do this, I can't retain any of the information from the article, apart from the biggest, most general ideas. This is a problem for contributing to class discussions because I constantly feel stupid, underprepared, and like I can't get anything right anymore.  Most of the readings are in topics I find uninteresting (the classes this semester were more general studies and I'm interested in a specific subset of my field that my coursework last semester didn't cover). This subject is something that I used to love (for the last decade or so of my life it has almost been my identity) and I'm starting to get really depressed and feel worthless that I can't get this stuff done.  I try hard to schedule my time and ensure I'm studying at my desk, but that does not help productivity.  Often I get restless and have to get up from my desk just to keep my thoughts from getting so overwhelming that I can mildly concentrate.

At first I just thought this was a combination of anxiety and impostor syndrome as well as adjusting tograd school, but a psychologist at my student health center asked if I wanted an ADHD screening as part of my intake.  I said no at the time, having a misunderstanding of what ADHD is, especially inattentive type and especially in adults/women.  I thought that there was no way I had it.  I did very well in school as a kid and in college.  But I started reading about it out of curiosity (you can always get me interested in psych articles) and I was shocked at how many of the symptoms seem to fit me.  In college I had many of the same problems with focusing on reading, but since the load was lighter, I always managed to get through it, even though it took me hours longer than I always felt it should.  Writing has always been crippling -- when I finally focus and get into it, I produce really amazing work, but I struggle with really bad procrastination and this has caused a lot of problems with larger scale writing projects.  In college this caused me to miss a lot of deadlines. I was blessed with understanding professors, who must have realized I was working hard and gave me extensions, so I kept my grades up, but I always sort fo felt like I was ""getting by"" in college and not living up to my potential like many of my overachiever classmates.  The thought of getting involved with clubs/leadership in school was out of the question: if I did this, there is no way I would have time or mental energy to get through my readings, as they took so long. 

After college I got an administrative job at a law firm and quickly struggled.  I've taken pride in being a good employee and in internships with big picture/creative tasks, I always managed to keep myself focused enough to do a good job and get praise.  However in this job, the work was so tedious that I just could not focus and I think my supervisors found me lazy... I would get in trouble for not noticing typos and other executive mistakes, even though I would proofread my work 3+ times.  

In other parts of my life, I get really restless when forced to stay in one place for a long time (unlike many of my other introverted friends, I can't deal with ""days in"", I get bored and depressed), I've always been a big daydreamer, and close friends note that I have a tendency to ""zone out"" when I'm trying to listen to them.  I've also had a tendency since childhood to interject in conversations with random segues that make sense in my brain (my train of thought got me there somehow), but have no context in the conversation.  I had trouble sitting down and focusing on my homework since childhood, but I think as a ""gifted"" kid, I was able to overcompensate by getting it right when I finally did it.  I always felt guilty that I wasn't as focused as my peers.  

Anyway, I have finally decided to get texted after talking to my former therapist (we were doing a wrap up session at home, since I'm trying to transition to someone permanent at school) and she quietly suggested I get tested, as one of her adult clients recently got diagnosed at age 40.  I swas shocked she suggested it.  When doing the reading I thought I might have it but was worried due to my academic success in the past and was afraid people would accuse me of medication seeking and/or being a hypochondriac.

I'm going to seek a screening when I get back to school, but part of me is terrified they will laugh in my face or results will be inconclusive and I'll be back to square one.  My current medication is not working and managing school/life in general just feels hopeless to me right now. Just wondered if anyone had advice or similar experiences.

TLDR: I'm a 26 year old female PhD student and hitting a wall after all my coping mechanisms/habits have failed me. Wondering if I may have ADHD and looking to see if any folks heare had similar experiences"

I should mention that when I came to this company, I did try negotiating and they were firm on the offer even though the job description mentioned I could negotiate.

I'm coming from a strong java background having 2 years internship pre-graduation experience and 1 year post-graduation experience and I'd like to get your guys' thoughts on 2 things:

* If you were hiring for this or a similar position, how much knowledge of core java could possibly carry a candidate through the interview?
* Do you know of any great J2EE practice materials / sites that could be leveraged to brush up on everything?

This interview is huge for me so I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to succeed. And they apparently have 3 levels of developer I can ""make it"" into depending on my technical interview.

* Associate Software Engineer
* Software Engineer
* Senior Software Engineer

My goal is to fit the associate level at minimum but preferably the mid level SE role. I've studied every core java concept already except graphs - going to dive into that very soon. But I'm thinking J2EE might be better to study than graphs specifically.

Everything has felt right until now. I’ve always a knack for tinkering, creating, and mathematics. I graduated high school 4.2 GPA, went to the University of Nevada, Reno using only scholarships and grants. I’m graduating in 4 years and am going into my final semester next week. My degree will be a BA in Electrical Engineering. Current GPA 3.4

During my studies, I realized I loved working with micro controllers, Arduinos and such. I loved programming and troubleshooting problems with robots and other projects. I love to bridge the gap between hardware and software, but I am not a Computer Science kind of guy. Basic-moderate level programming for me. I just loved making actions happen by the use of circuits and machinery. 

I interned over the summer at a steel mill, working on big rolling sheet lines in their automation department. My favorite things to do were to program PLC’s and solve mathematical problems about their equipment, sensors, motors, anything I/O related. My least favorite things were meeting with sales engineers and long cubicle days in the bay area. It was hard work, yet good work. But environment and the quality of life were poor and not for me, thus I will not be returning.

Fast forward a semester and here I am, with a new internship during the school year that I was very excited to get through the career fair. It’s a small water control company. I explained my skills that I’ve learned and the manager was exited to hear about them, he told me how relevant my skills were basically offered me a full-time position after graduation. I was so excited to work close to home (family is very important to me). The engineers even work in the field, and travel often. It was a dream come true.
Here’s the problem.

I’ve been working full time during the winter break and the work is lacking. All I am doing is editing Autocad electrical drawings and updating documents for their old equipment. I could have done this work right out of high school. I observe the other engineers and see the work they do. I know for sure that the future work will be nothing like what I’ve done before, even if I do one day get to program PLC’s. I’m terrified that my brain will lose everything I’ve worked for this last 4 years, and only gain minimal knowledge.

Ideally I would be working on l micro-controller or PLC based equipment projects, Machines, aircraft, anything really. I would work at both a work bench and a computer, programming, building, and testing my tasks. I need to know if my dream job for exists, I have many skills and I don’t want to waste them.

Once my fiancé graduates in 2-4 semesters, we want to relocate anywhere in the West, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, California (non-big city). We are also considering New Zealand or other countries.

Is this possible? Where can I go? What can I do? I don’t want to work 9-5 in an office and hate my life, I want to do something I love, be with the people I love, and live a good life.

Tips?,jibberjabbery,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/40kpow/starting_student_teaching_soon_tips/,"I'm going to be with a 5th grade class at a Title1 school. I spent a couple days a week with that class last semester as an intern so I already know them. I never got great at handling them.

Most of the students are wonderful. No, all of the students are wonderful. Some just take a lot of extra work. There's one particular boy that everyone, even the vice principal and occasionally the principal have problems with. Talking, rude, insubordinate, distracting other students. He's my biggest worry.

We have a couple of special ed, I also haven't mastered being able to get them engaged. One girl I believe is at a 2nd grade math level for example. I never had practice differentiating instruction so I don't really know what it's supposed to look like.

My cooperating teacher is phenomenal. We totally click. Honestly I chose to stay with her because she's a great role model over staying for the school or class itself. I still truly love the kids. Working through the girl drama really makes me smile because I've seen my advice actually work. It's such an amazing feeling.

So any tips you have, no matter how basic, would really be appreciated!"

1. What do I even say? Do I go right up to the person and give them a spiel about myself? I feel from common sense alone that seems a bit awkward to do. Or should I say Hi, I'm ___, and have them lead the conversation. I've done a bit of research, and it all seems all over the place. Any insight to how a typical conversations should go would be great.

2. Who do I talk to? There are 50ish companies going to both of the career fairs looking for computer science students, and I feel like this is a huge list to tackle, and I should narrow it down. However, only being a sophomore, I feel like going to the more prestigious companies would be less advantageous as the upperclassmen are more qualified and will get an internship before me.

3. Any tips in general that will help me get an internship?

4. If anyone is willing to take a last look over my resume that would be great. Again I am only a sophomore with no experience, so this is really the best I could do. [Pretty mediocre...](http://i.imgur.com/eCP4kHF.jpg)

40lswd,17,2016-01-12,Start something in 2016!,ImportGuy,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/40lswd/start_something_in_2016/,"Hey fellow and aspiring entrepreneurs, I hope that your 2016 is off to a smashing start! I was thinking about my upcoming yearly plans and I thought I would put together something to (hopefully) inspire you to start your own thing this year.

First, a brief introduction, (trust me, it’s worth it).

Something important to remember in business is that there is nothing new under the sun (give me a minute naysayers). What I mean by this is that, yes, methodologies can, and do, drastically change how a given principle or industry is approached, but the principles themselves rarely change. 

Let’s take, for example, transportation. At the core of the industry is getting people and/or goods from point A to point B. At the turn of the century this usually meant carriages and trains, but then technology struck and we were given cars and, eventually, affordable flight. Not to mention all of the peripheral opportunities that arose like: travel agents, freight forwarders, taxi services, good storage, food and beverage providers etc. all centered around the basic idea of getting goods and/or people from one point to another.

So what, you ask? Well, instead of looking for ways to “revolutionize” an industry, look instead for how you can add value or efficiency to a principal that already exists.

**Tl;dr – Work from base principals rather than trying to re-invent the wheel**

Ok, now that we have that out of the way, here are some takes on established business principals that you could start in 2016 (for little to no money).

**Buy Low, Sell High**

-	Real estate
-	Retail and online arbitrage
-	Junk removal/scrapping
-	Wholesaling
-	Finding and buying spare jewelry
-	Private labeling
-	Re-purposing furniture
-	Fixing and upselling broken tech (read appliances, phones, computers)

**Service Industry**

-	Start a cleaning business (shout out to u/localcasestudy)
-	Learn basic diy and offer to do non-structural work for people
-	Premium car hand-wash
-	Lawn care
-	Tax organization services (basically doing all of the receipt and expense prep before someone gives there stuff to a CPA)
-	Photography, both B2C and B2B (B2B is where the money is at though)
-	Web services (you wouldn’t believe how many people do not know their way around a computer and the internet)
-	Create a VA business using local college students as interns

**Information Services**

-	Become an “expert”, then start a blog
-	Outsourced ebook writing
-	Price error finding (and selling) – shout out to u/twikken
-	Online courses on how to do “X” thing

These next two are a little too broad to have specific examples, so instead I will try and explain the ideation process:

**Brokering**

Basically connecting up people who have a good/service with people who want said good/service. This term is most commonly associated with things like stocks and the financial market but can be applied to almost industry. You make your money here on the (generally super un-sexy) legwork. Basically, you identify a process that is cumbersome for buyers or sellers (or both) and offer to do the legwork in exchange for a fee (usually a percentage of a sale). 

Here’s an example. Say you are familiar with general SEO and Google Adwords, you could approach local real estate agents and offer to create/manage their website and do a marketing campaign for them. They pay a flat monthly management fee of $XX plus a percentage (like 0.5%) of any business you generate for them. Most real estate agents like people and sales, not web marketing, so you are taking a cumbersome process (finding clients through the internet) and doing it for them.

While this sounds kind of silly, you would be amazed at the things people simply do not want to do, you just have to brainstorm.

**Product Improvement**

Big shout out to u/minimaterials for doing this very thing. The idea is you observe an existing product and see if you can make a modification or two to it to either make it better or transform it into a different genre. Using the concept of mini-materials as an example, they took the concept of Legos and modified it to make a new and interesting product. Another great example is goldiblocks, who took the concept of engineering for kids and targeted girls instead of boys. This can be done with almost anything but a good process is to ask “can this be made smaller/faster/lighter in such a way as to improve the experience of the consumers or to appeal to a different audience?” If yes, then how can I do it. 

A couple of good starting points to find initial products to improve are [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) and [qvc](http://www.qvc.com).

Hopefully that is enough to at least get the juices flowing for you! The most important thing, really, though is simply to *START!* You’ve got this, but you have to actually take action.

Keep on rocking out there!

**Tl;dr – read the post, it’s not that long and if you don’t have time to read 800 words you are A) already super successful and I wish you the best or B) Lazy and probably shouldn’t be an entrepreneur.**"

I need some advice regarding internships. This past summer I interned at an R&amp;D location for a small unknown company. I gained a lot of skills, and the work was interesting. The drawback was that it is small and unknown, and that it was quite boring since no employee was really passionate or close to my age. 

I was offered to come back this summer, and I need to decide whether to go back (safe option) or to try and pursue a different company. 

In my situation would you take the small technically challenging boring company, or try to pursue a larger company? What are your thoughts?

Background Info:
I go to a well known state school in the US, and have a 3.1 GPA. I am interested in DSP, embedded systems, and circuit design. I also do hobby electronics.

     -Systems Analysis and Design 

     -Networking

     -Security (I plan on taking CompTIA Security+ in a month or so)

I don't plan to be a programmer.  It's not my forte, I know I would work better in other areas of IT.  Ideally, I'd like to be a system administrator or Network admin.

I've been working a couple of help desks during my undergraduate studies...  the help desk at University, and a Desktop Support internship (over the summer) that I continue to work at to this day.

What kind of entry-level positions can I expect to find in Network/System administration?  I'm possibly looking to move to the west coast post-graduation...  Portland OR, specifically, and help desk jobs there don't have such great starting salaries.  I need to be making somewhere around $50k-$60k+ for relocation to make sense.

Did you do internships before you graduated? If so what field?

Internships after you graduated? 

How long after graduation did it take you to find a job?

What field did you go into?

Did all your fellow economics majors find work?

Was the work fulfilling intellectually?

I also do a little android development and have experience with Java as well, although I'm not too familiar with the language (I have to google to see how to sort an arraylist every single time I need to use it). As for C and C++ I've build a kernel with it for a course in school but it's been a long time and I can't remember the syntax at all.

I'm wondering if I should pick Python given how similar it is with Ruby. I know the interview questions will mostly be on algorithm questions, so the more simpler the language, the more time I will be spent on solving the actual algorithm rather than writing System.out.println() repeatedly on the white board.

I got an email from an advisor for a programming internship that focuses on Python, so I applied and sent in a resume. Within about an hour I got an email with a few code jam questions. One to re-order a set of numbers (123 =&gt; 321, 221 =&gt; 122, 1230 =&gt; 321). The other was a 'next largest number' (11234 =&gt; 11243, 142 =&gt; 214). It took me about 30/40 min and o sent it back to him. The next day I had an interview.

He said I did ""slightly above average"" on the code jam questions. I didn't account for negative numbers, but he said no one that he has given it to had.

So in the interview we talked about what I knew, did a few situational based general interview questions. And he told me what the company did.

Basically, he was doing freelance work on the side (still has a normal job that he works remotely). He was sick of being at home all day and needed an office, so he got set up at a startup incubator near my campus. He realized many of the companies in the incubator needed tech work done, so he added that to his load. He figured it would be great to get some interns to help him, also, its paid. 10/hr 10 hr a week.

So he was talking doing things like this... A guy has a sensor that he sends down a pipe with a manometer and accelerometer. He already wrote a script that graphs the data for the guy. Now the guy wants a 3D rendering of the pipe. I was like ""I've only ever worked in the console....never anything graphical like that...""

I did two summer internships during undergrad, one with a big US bank and the other with a insurance company. Both of them using SAS and SQL. I also have a lot of experience with python and R from my undergrad/graduate course works and research. 

However, as I start to look for jobs, I've realized that Data Scientist jobs are mostly senior level and requires 5+ years of experience, while entry level data jobs are mostly business analyst doing SQL. The few junior data scientist positions I've applied to all had tons of applicants, and I don't hear back from many.

Fast forward a few days and on a particularly quiet day I am left alone in the office as $OtherTech is taking a day off. As nothing is going on I am about to start imaging when the secretary of $BigBoss walks in with a keyboard.

I look over it however all the keys seem to be in good state.

She leaves and I put the keyboard down on my desk. I then realise that my computer doesn't have any spare usb ports - it has only 2 spare and both are being used by backup drives that can't be unplugged.  

I look around and see $OtherTech's computer sat there with a free usb slot. I go plug the offending keyboard into the computer and turn it on. $OtherTech's computer usually takes some time to boot up so I go across the street to get a coffee. 

I end up spending lunch there and several hours have passed when I return I look at $OtherTech's computer only to find a standard windows screen. I look around in panic and spot the usb for imaging computers sat in the other us port. I go into full panic mode and attempt to find a backup of his files. I find one however it is several weeks old and is missing some important documents. 

I call $OtherTech and tell him what happened. He laughs it off and tells me that he did exactly the same thing a few years ago. I never forgot to check for other usb's in a computer again."

I just can't help but feel a little bit depressed though, watching all of my peers graduate while I'm stuck here in school with very few friends. Also, it is going to take me a total of 6 years to graduate. AND I have yet to even find an internship. Anyone else in a similar position? Is it normal to take this long to graduate?

**UW GPA: ~3.95 W GPA: ~5.22** -school weights by adding 0.222 for each weighted class, it's strange

**APs**: APUSH (5). Currently in Calc BC, Physics 1 and 2, Macroeconomics, American Government, Lang Comp, AP Chinese (should be enough to get National AP Scholar this year)

**ACT**: 36 first shot (36E,R,M, 34S, 36 essay)

 **PSAT**: 1500/1520 on the new one

I'm planning on taking Math 2, physics, and one or maybe two other SAT II's based on classes I'll be taking. (Chinese? Idk what's recommended)

School doesn't rank but definitely in the top 40. I'd estimate I'm somewhere in the top 5 or maybe 10 in a class of ~800.

**Awards**:
National Scholastic Art and Writing Gold Medalist (fewer than 0.5% of people got Gold medals nationally) 

Published in Scholastic's Anthology (Best Teen Writing of 2015) which 63/300000 works are selected. 

NSLI-y Recipient (fully funded merit scholarship from the Department of Defense/State to spend 7 weeks in China) 

Nominated for the American Chemical Society Scholarship Exam (means I was one of the 4 best sophomore chem students at my school, out of 800ish) 

A bunch of Model UN awards from various conferences (won an award at every MUN conference since freshman year, some from international conferences)

**Activities**: Model UN - Co-President, easily my favorite club and biggest time sink.

 Robotics (I founded and lead a team that builds non-robotics projects in subjects we're interested in, like biomedical stuff) 

Bunch of Percussion and Writing stuff in general, don't want to get too specific 

Fencing (nationally ranked but not fantastic) 

Boy Scouts (tons of volunteer hours, leadership positions, going to be an Eagle Scout) 

Scholastic Bowl and Math Team (varsity with awards but not super dedicated, might leave off the application) 

NHS (lol) 

Internship with a Congressional Campaign (ties in with MUN)

**Schools I'm interested in**: Stanford, Princeton, MIT, UC-Berkeley, UIUC, UPenn, Northwestern, Duke, UT Austin, maybe Purdue/Mich/GA Tech/UCLA if in state Champaign isn't safe enough (I'm pretty sure it is tho, almost half our graduating class goes there most years)

**Mechanical/chemical/biological engineering** is my major, haven't quite figured out what exactly but if you're familiar with MIT's Course 10B or 2A-20, those would be my ideal majors. Will try to go for a humanities minor (that'll be different depending on school. Ex. Princeton has fricken awesome Creative Writing, so I'd go for the CW certificate there)


**ANYWAY, we're doing course selection for next year and I have: Multivariable Calc (UIUC Math 241), Physics C, AP Chem, APCS, Band, AP Lit, and ???.**

The state req is 4 years of gym, so I've been in **weights** since sophomore year and I've grown to really like lifting. Seniors can get an exemption (easy since I'm an athlete outside of school) so I could take **AP Psych**, but I'm not sure about the marginal benefit of the additional AP. I'm really interested in the material (and I like social studies and humanities, which could distinguish me from other Asian STEM applicants) but my course load is demanding as is and I don't know if it's a good idea to add more work and lose lifting/a potential homework period on a really busy day.

Should I instead ditch **APCS** for Psych and keep weights? Should I do Psych instead of weights? Or just skip psych altogether? I could also **intern for AP Chinese** (which I'm in this year due to my summer in China) and thereby keep up my language skills? Or if you have any other advice for the coming year, please let me know! (Sorry for the crazy long post, but I'll chance ya back so it'll be worth the time!)"

A little info about me first:

I'm a senior at my small private school. I'm a mathematics major, computer science minor with a 4.0 GPA. I've taken all of your standard proofs courses as well as other high level math classes. I've been involved in on-campus activities (honors societies, math club president, etc.).

I also recently took the general GRE and received OK scores (158V, 160Q, 5.5AW).

I interned this last summer at JPL/NASA and coded for them. I've been invited to intern for them again this summer.

Based off of this information, what are my chances at being accepted into mathematics masters/PhD programs? Which ones should I consider? From what I've seen, my GRE scores are just a little bit below the average for acceptance into top schools, but I don't expect to be accepted into these top schools (given my coming from a small private uni).

What should I do to increase my chances to be accepted into good/great programs?

Thanks!

EDIT: Although I'm not 100% decided, I think I'd like to pursue a degree in statistics. But I absolutely love pure math and applied math, so I can't quite decide."

So here's the deal: I have an offer that expires this Friday with 'X' company. I currently intern at 'Y' company. Y wants to offer me a full time job immediately after my internship ends (when I graduate, basically). However, I need to still prove my worth over the next month and a half before they officially hand over an offer in writing. The team likes me a lot and it's pretty certain they will give me an offer. It is with a big tech company in the Valley (not big4, but close enough).

The other company, X, has an offer for me that expires on Friday. I  have asked for an extension but will no longer give me any more time because they already extended my offer for 2 months.

I am uncertain with how to proceed, and I was wondering if anyone else had the same experience and would like to share their thoughts. Should I take the offer at Company X and renege if Y turns out to be better? Should I forgo X completely and just bank on Y?

Personally, I like the benefits and the team more at company Y, while the commute and work at company X is better. It's incredibly hard to decide and maybe some of the more veteran users can give me some advice.

40rrge,2,2016-01-13,5 Tips to start up your career in a hot startup,isss111,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/40rrge/5_tips_to_start_up_your_career_in_a_hot_startup/,"**1. Have a strong online presence**

You can take advantage of social networks when hunting for a job. Check if you have a high-quality LinkedIn profile: add detailed information about your experiences and skills, choose a professional-looking photo and ask colleagues for recommendations.

Adding your LinkedIn profile and website showcasing your portfolio (if you’re a designer or developer, for instance) to every job application makes you stand out from the crowd of candidates.

Make sure you have an account in relevant websites related with the position that you applied. For example: for developers, having an account on GitHub and Stack Overflow can make you a better candidate.

**2. Keep track of startup news**

Pay attention to startup news, especially the ones about funding. If a startup recently raised some funding, it means that probably the company will be hiring in the next months. Check the company’s website and send your spontaneous application – the sooner they have your resumé, the better.

To keep track of startup news, you can subscribe to the feeds of websites like TechCrunch, VentureBeat or Business Insider.

**3. Attend startup events**

Don’t miss any startup/tech events or seminars! You should attend as many events as you can, so you can make new connections, improve your skills, be aware of new trends and products, and, of course, hear about jobs.

From pre-accelerator programs – Startup Pirates, Startup Weekend or 3 Day Startup, to name a few – to well-known conferences, such as Web Summit or TechCrunch Disrupt, use these events to connect with entrepreneurs that could have a job for you.

**4. Create your own event or volunteer at events**

We know that creating an event requires much more hard work than to be a volunteer at a startup event, so you need to think wisely here. If you have the audacity to start an event from the scratch, go for it! You will have the opportunity to create strong relations with companies, entrepreneurs, speakers and media. And if you succeed, maybe you will be invited to join a startup.

Volunteering can be less stressful and also a good opportunity to make new connections. Plus, you could add the experience in your resumé.

**5. Embrace an internship abroad**

An international internship will immediately distinguish you from others candidates competing with you in the market. Programs like AIESEC Global Entrepreneur Program will give you the chance to work abroad in a promising startup and be mentored by real entrepreneurs. Even if it doesn’t turn into a job, the internship will certainly change your world’s view professionally and culturally.

* What could be the relation between the measured current and the wear/damage or crack growth of the escalators components?

*  If the integral increases due to fixed and variable losses what could be the limit to which this is allowed to increase to?

To give an example of what I'm trying to do: in you car there is a fan belt which needs maintenance before is breaks/wears and this limit is set to be around for instance 50.000km, this is what I want to achieve but  for escalators. Thanks in advance!

I wasn't respected at work and I didn't have a mentor in the entertainment industry who wanted to see me succeed, so I basically gave up when I got laid off (after trying to apply for a new job for a few months &amp; not getting one).

I decided to move home with my parents because I wasn't making any money. I've applied to over 200 jobs and I've only had one interview.

I've been dating around for years and I've also been in 2 very serious 2-year relationships, so I'm looking for someone who really wants to be with me (I know my worth in a relationship), but the guys aren't ready for that kind of relationship so we drift apart &amp; decide to ""be friends"".

Now it's only been a week since i was contacted, but the fact that the original email asked for my availability this week (and next) makes me wonder whether I should follow up in case my response email mentioning my availability was missed.

I thought I would take some time to reflect on my career path this fall Sunday, and more importantly, countless mistakes I had made with my resume.
This morning I found a file of old resumes as I was cleaning my hard drive. In fact, I was able to locate one from each year of college.


Let’s profile the progression of an undergraduate student resume to help you benchmark your current resume. Use this analysis of past resumes to identify best practices, learn when to seek help, and what mistakes to avoid.


###Freshmen Year^r^r^r^r

A lack of professional experience coupled with insufficient knowledge of resume mechanics will make it difficult to position yourself as a competitive candidate, especially for those who are seeking their first internship.


Freshmen don’t have time to worry about effective resume preparation, let alone educate themselves on tedious resume details. I was not an exception. Rather then grouping sections by experience, I chose to organize sections by competencies and use examples from various self-directed projects and organizations to support the claim. This approach resulted in some weird resume/cover letter hybrid:

[Freshman Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y11.png)
##Resume Elements include

• Objective

• Skills summary

• Skills and Experience

• Computer Skills

• Education and Training


Luckily, as an undergraduate, you’ll have many university provided resources at your disposal. I suggest reaching out to your university’s career advising center…but heed my warning, those guys are busy; really, really busy. If I remember correctly, they suggested I highlight any time I learned or used a technical skill.


###Sophomoreo Year^r^r^r^r

While freshman year should be spent integrating yourself into student organizations, exploring academic opportunities and developing technical skills (I suggest you take advantage of free university-provided software training classes. These courses will help develop a foundational technical understanding and can be included on your resume). Sophomore year is a time where the ambitious gain an advantage by applying to competitive internships or research positions. A proper resume is paramount to landing such a position…


Fall semester of my sophomore year I started an e-commerce business and was faced with a dilemma…how does this new experience fit into my existing resume? The answer: It didn’t. The resume of freshmen year had to go.


This iteration of my resume focused on proper formatting mechanics (poorly) more so than the content:

[Sophomore Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y2_Page_1.png)


##Resume Elements include:

• Objective shortened

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections. Organized by themes of freshmen achievements

• Introduced bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

If you’ve developed great experience but have little knowledge of formatting,  take a look at the [Rezi BETA Resume Template.](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) Let our knowledge of resume mechanics take care of the dirty work while your experience does the talking.

###Junior Year^r^r^r^r

Career fairs, mock interviews, networking…junior year should be your busiest yet. Hopefully by now, you are well emerged in student organizations and maybe your persistent dedication has landed you a leadership position (LPT: that’s the goal of student organizations).

Your chosen career path should be more clearly defined. Now that you’re past the halfway point, you should really think about want you want to do post-graduation. The summer following your junior year will be the launching pad of your career. Aim to use this period to excel in a position related to your vocational goals.

Keep in mind these positions are even more competitive. Your resume must be on point, master the tedious mechanics if you want to see results. Luckily, my roommate was a resume reviewer for the university business school. Here is the resume we created together:

40vkxm,1,2016-01-13,A Detailed Analysis of the Evolution of an Undergraduate Student Resume,ecoliz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/40vkxm/a_detailed_analysis_of_the_evolution_of_an/,"###A Detailed Analysis of the Evolution of an Undergraduate Student Resume


I thought I would take some time to reflect on my career path this fall Sunday, and more importantly, countless mistakes I had made with my resume.
This morning I found a file of old resumes as I was cleaning my hard drive. In fact, I was able to locate one from each year of college.


Let’s profile the progression of an undergraduate student resume to help you benchmark your current resume. Use this analysis of past resumes to identify best practices, learn when to seek help, and what mistakes to avoid.


###Freshmen Year^r^r^r^r

A lack of professional experience coupled with insufficient knowledge of resume mechanics will make it difficult to position yourself as a competitive candidate, especially for those who are seeking their first internship.


Freshmen don’t have time to worry about effective resume preparation, let alone educate themselves on tedious resume details. I was not an exception. Rather then grouping sections by experience, I chose to organize sections by competencies and use examples from various self-directed projects and organizations to support the claim. This approach resulted in some weird resume/cover letter hybrid:

[Freshman Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y11.png)
##Resume Elements include

• Objective

• Skills summary

• Skills and Experience

• Computer Skills

• Education and Training


Luckily, as an undergraduate, you’ll have many university provided resources at your disposal. I suggest reaching out to your university’s career advising center…but heed my warning, those guys are busy; really, really busy. If I remember correctly, they suggested I highlight any time I learned or used a technical skill.


###Sophomoreo Year^r^r^r^r

While freshman year should be spent integrating yourself into student organizations, exploring academic opportunities and developing technical skills (I suggest you take advantage of free university-provided software training classes. These courses will help develop a foundational technical understanding and can be included on your resume). Sophomore year is a time where the ambitious gain an advantage by applying to competitive internships or research positions. A proper resume is paramount to landing such a position…


Fall semester of my sophomore year I started an e-commerce business and was faced with a dilemma…how does this new experience fit into my existing resume? The answer: It didn’t. The resume of freshmen year had to go.


This iteration of my resume focused on proper formatting mechanics (poorly) more so than the content:

[Sophomore Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y2_Page_1.png)


##Resume Elements include:

• Objective shortened

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections. Organized by themes of freshmen achievements

• Introduced bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

If you’ve developed great experience but have little knowledge of formatting, take a look at a Resume Template. Let someone else's knowledge of resume mechanics take care of the dirty work while your experience does the talking.

###Junior Year^r^r^r^r

Career fairs, mock interviews, networking…junior year should be your busiest yet. Hopefully by now, you are well emerged in student organizations and maybe your persistent dedication has landed you a leadership position (LPT: that’s the goal of student organizations).

Your chosen career path should be more clearly defined. Now that you’re past the halfway point, you should really think about want you want to do post-graduation. The summer following your junior year will be the launching pad of your career. Aim to use this period to excel in a position related to your vocational goals.

Keep in mind these positions are even more competitive. Your resume must be on point, master the tedious mechanics if you want to see results. Luckily, my roommate was a resume reviewer for the university business school. Here is the resume we created together:

[Junior Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y3.png

##Resume Elements include:

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections organized by accomplishments

• Introduced well thought out and actionable bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

I was a bio/pre-med major up until I realized medical school wasn't for me at the end of sophomore year. I decided to explore more into the biotechnology and that is where I am at now. I don't *hate* biotechnology, but it really isn't for me as I thought it would be. I still love bio, but I'm not looking to get a PhD just to get a job. I'm pretty much so in deep that I can't really change my major at this point. It wasn't until last semester that I took a CS course because it was an option for my biotech elective and I absolutely loved it! My school has a bioinformatics option, but I don't see myself in that field.  Unfortunately, there would be no way I could possible major in CS. I'm already going to be staying an extra semester as it is. So I thought I would finish out my general biotech major and start a minor in CS.  I was thinking of working with a biotech/pharm company so I'm not straying far from my roots. So I guess my questions really are: 

* Does anyone have any tips on transitioning from bio to CS?
* What kinds of internships should I be looking into?
* Should I be thinking about grad school right after undergrad?
* Can I even get into grad school for CS as a biotech major/CS minor?
* What kinds of career paths would someone in my position be best suited in?"

During my last internship however, my manager didn't provide me with a lot of tasks though I persisted and often asked her for work.  Anyways I did not communicate much with my immediate manager.  So I ended up doing work for other full time employees in the same company.  I still did work for my manager and regularly attended meetings with her.  We left on good terms, and she never mentioned anything.

However, I recently asked her to be my references (as my direct manager) for a full time job I was interviewing for at another company. She declined and said she could not be my reference.

Do you think this will severely impact my future job applications? How can I get past this?

I'm about to enter my (probably) final semester of university. I go to a top 5 CS school, and I also have to take a pretty heavy courseload this term if I want to graduate on time. Lately I've been dropping classes and my GPA has taken a dip because of personal issues, and I'm sitting at a 3.2 now.

Last summer I interned at a big web-based company and really enjoyed it. Learned a lot and the people there were cool. However they're not really doing any cutting-edge stuff. It isn't an early stage company with a lot of growth potential nor is it a tech giant like the Big 4. I received an offer from them to start full-time this summer (100k-110k base salary in Silicon Valley/Bay Area, mediocre perks/bonuses). I have to decide on it by the end of the month.

The semester after my internship I had several opportunities to interview with top companies but didn't take them because I was really burned out. I feel like this was a mistake because that was the prime hiring season. But even now I don't feel like interviewing and would rather just focus on finishing strong with my classes, and sorting out aforementioned personal issues.

**TL;DR** Is it in my best interest to take advantage of my school's tech reputation while I'm still a student here and put a lot of effort into the recruiting process, OR accept a decent offer and focus on other stuff? Will the job search get easier or harder after college? I really want to relax right now but not if that means severely gimping my potential career path. "

*From the desk of Private Investigator Miles Krieg*

**Case Journal #1: 4 January 2016**

Normally I’d start out listing case notes and document control numbers for the official police paperwork. Let me start by noting that this is not an official police matter. I have not been commissioned, and don’t expect reimbursement for my time.

A close friend of mine died tonight. A good man, a man I’ve worked with on many cases in the past. Senior forensic pathologist Daniel West, at the city morgue, has given me more leads on homicides over the last decade than any amount of footwork. He was, quite possibly, the least selfish man I’ve ever known.

Certainly not a man who deserved to be murdered.

I’m getting ahead of myself.

At approximately 10:30 yesterday evening, I received a call from Daniel on my personal line. That in and of itself was an indicator that something was wrong. You see, Daniel never called me outside of the office unless there was a break in an active case, and I’d not taken any new cases since before the new year. There was nothing on my plate, so he had no reason to call me directly unless it was urgent.

I didn’t even have time to properly answer before he interrupted.

“No time,” he stated as soon as I picked up, his tone brisk and harried. “No time, just listen. I think something bad is about to happen.”

I remember my pulse quickening. Daniel loved to talk, always using ten words where one would do, so his clipped sentences caught my attention like a gunshot. “What’s wrong?”

“I saw something I shouldn’t have, and now I – aaugh!!” He cried out - a loud, nonsensical sound, pained but not urgent, like someone had just pressed on a broken bone.

“Daniel! Are you alright?”

“No,” he grunted. “No, I’m not alright. I’m afraid.”

“Afraid of what?” 

“I think I’m going to die next.”

My blood chilled at the sincerity in his voice. “Where are you? Are you at work?”

“No!” Daniel cried out, loud enough I had to pull the receiver from my head. “NO!!”

“At home, then? Daniel!”

“Don’t!” he shouted, and then he screamed. A long, primal scream of rage and pain. “Stop! Stop, damn you, why won’t you stop?!”

I heard the phone drop and bounce on his end, and knew I’d gotten all I would out of him. He hadn’t told me where he was, but he needed help, so I had to work it out for myself, and fast. I steeled myself, took a quick, slow breath to steady my pounding heart, and looked at the facts.

He’d said no about being at work, but given what had come after, that may have just been in response to his assailant's arrival. However, when he dropped the phone, it sounded like it had landed on some sort of thick fabric. I knew that the morgue didn’t have any carpets, and he wouldn’t have called me if he hadn’t known I could find him, so he must have been home. 

It wasn’t much to go on, but I didn’t have time to waste. I was closer than the local PD, but just to be sure I gave them a call on my way out the door. I told them about the call, and that there was possibly an intruder in Daniel’s house, and dispatch told me an officer was on the way.

I knew their response time was slower than mine, though, so I booked it to the stairwell, because I like my exercise. 

Okay, mostly because the building’s elevators were slower than cold syrup. Anyway.

I got to Daniel’s home in about five minutes. It was a tiny house, the sort you’d call a cottage if he lived in the woods rather than the suburbs. He’d lived there all his life with his mother, who’d left it to him when she died some ten years ago. The front door was locked, so I just grabbed his key from under the mat and opened it up. 

Side note: It didn’t occur to me until I wrote it just now, but there were no signs of forced entry. Locked door, no cracks on the frame, no broken windows. Well, that’s what these journals are for, to help piece things together after the fact.

I threw open the door and called for Daniel, but heard nothing in reply. I ran through to his room, threw open the door, and saw him lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

My stomach heaved at the coppery smell, but I rushed to his side to check his vitals. He had a pulse, but only just. Quickly, I checked the rest of him. No chest wound, nothing on his neck, so where was the blood coming from?

Then I saw. His right ear was missing.

“Oh, god,” I remember hearing. I suppose it was me. 

I looked around frantically for something to block the wound, and ended up grabbing his bedsheets. As I pulled them over to press against his head, something tumbled onto my lap.

His ear.

I don’t know how much time passed before the police arrived, but I’m glad now that I’d had the foresight to call them ahead of time. I was in no fit state to do anything until well after they dragged me away from my dying friend. My mind went somewhere else, screaming blindly into the darkness.

Numbly, I watched them load him up into the ambulance. I was herded into a police car, and we followed him to the hospital. Midnight came and went, I sat blindly in the ER waiting area for hours, barely blinking until a doctor came out sometime around dawn.

“He’s lost a lot of blood,” I was told, “but he’s stabilized. We’ve had to sedate him, so he’s resting now, but you can go see him if you like. Just don’t expect much of a response.”

I stayed behind at first, not wanting to face my mutilated friend again. The images of his pallid face, his ear falling into my lap were still fresh. I know they’d probably managed to reattach it, but I just couldn’t seem to drag myself up from my seat. I watched all day long as his coworkers and friends flowed in and out of his room, all teary-eyed but grateful that he’d survived the ordeal.

Finally, around mid-afternoon, I pushed myself out of the chair and went in to see him. Everyone else had gone by now, so it was just me and him in the room.

In stories, people often speak of how peaceful their loved ones look in a hospital bed, as though they’d be fine once they wake up. Daniel didn’t look fine. Even in his drugged sleep, with bandages wrapped around his head, he looked tortured.

I was scarcely there a minute before his eyed fluttered open.

“No,” he groaned, his voice terribly hoarse, as though he’d screamed all the life out of it. “No, no, no…”

“Danny?” I said. “You’re awake?”

“No, no…” It hurt me to hear him like that.

“Danny, who did this to you?”

“It was him…”

“Who?”

“The man… in the cell… Wilcox.”

“Who’s Wilcox?”

“Last week… died in the cell… I did the autopsy. Ever since…” his voice faded, his eyes scrunched up in pain.

“Danny, please, did you find something? Is someone after you?”

“I can’t… I can’t, you have to go, or it’ll get you, too!” He started getting louder, now, despite his hoarseness.

“What will? Danny, what is it?”

“Can’t you hear it?” he rasped. “The screaming… It won’t stop, it won’t stop…”

“What screaming? What do you mean?”

“It won’t stop… It never stops!” Power came back in his voice as he spoke, frantic volume pushing the rasp aside.

Then he started screaming. 

It was worse than before. Pain, rage, suffering, desperation, as though he'd lost all sense or reason. I saw his heart rate monitor start racing, but the tone completely lost under his voice. I raced over to the call button to get a nurse in, though I’m sure it wasn’t necessary at this point, but he fell silent before I reached it.

I mashed the button, one-two-three-four, before I realized what I was hearing now. A high ringing in my ears.

Daniel’s heart monitor had flat-lined.

I looked up, and he lay there, unnaturally still. Looking at him, something shifted inside of me. Outrage, fear, hatred. I had to find the man who’d done this to my friend.

The nurse was there in a second, ushering me out of the room. I waited around long enough to hear them officially pronounce him dead before heading home.

My first step was writing out these notes. As I said before, my involvement in this case is not police sanctioned. That’s one of the perks of being freelance – as long as I don’t get caught doing illegal things, I’m free to pursue my own cases. No, my involvement here is purely personal. I’m going to find out who would do this to poor Daniel. Once I do, well… we’ll see what happens.

My only lead right now is Wilcox. I’ll have to look into that in the morning. Hopefully I can get a look at his case file, but it’ll be tricky with my best contact lying dead on a slab. I’ll figure it out, though. 

I always do.

**Case Journal #2: 7 January 2016**

My head hurts.

I didn’t react well to Daniel’s death. After I finished my last journal entry, I had a whiskey to calm my nerves.

And then another. And then a few more. 

I ended up draining a fifth that evening, and passed out until late the next morning. Hungover, head pounding, ears ringing, I felt like I’d been laid out on the tracks and hit by every car in a mile-long train. I barely got to my feet to brew up a pot of coffee, which I drained in short order. The caffeine cleared my head a bit, but I knew I was in for a rough day.

I didn’t have much luck at the station that day. Even though everyone on hand was still in shock from Daniel’s passing, they were amazingly tight-lipped about this Wilcox fellow. Even the receptionist, Lara – a sweet thing, not too bright, but more than willing to do anything to catch my eye, poor dear – even Lara was less chatty than normal. Even my last-ditch effort of asking her to lunch in exchange for information didn’t bear the fruit it normally did.

For the record, I feel bad every time I lead her on to get case information, but sometimes you’ve just got to bite the bullet to get results.

I figured I’d come in too soon, the wound was too fresh, so I’d try again the next day (yesterday, now.) Plus, that’d give me time to kill my hangover.

Next morning, my ears were still ringing, but my head felt clearer. I hit the station bright and early to try and get more information, but was barely in the door when Chief Anderson pulled me into his office. The Chief was a lanky workaholic who almost never saw the sun, so he was pretty pale. We usually got along pretty well, despite my tendency to call him Casper now and again.

“Krieg,” he started – never a good sign, when he calls me by my last name – “You need to leave this alone.”

“Leave what alone, Chief?” Playing dumb often paid off with Anderson. He had a bad habit of letting out more information than he wanted to when I made him explain things.

“The Wilcox case. Leave it alone. It’s not your problem.”

“Why so nervous, Casper? You look a bit paler than usual.”

“Nothing. It’s nothing.” Anderson’s hands shook as he wiped his brow. “It’s just… you’re an asset, here, you know? I’d rather have you on less risky cases.”

“Risky?” I looked at him skeptically. “Daniel said that Wilcox was dead. What’s the risk?”

Anderson’s face flushed. I was on to something. But what?

“Look, Miles,” he said, struggling to stay calm. “Why don’t you go home? I know Daniel’s passing has to be sitting hard on you. You were his best friend around here, and I’m sure you need time to cope. Go on, take a few days. We’re not that busy here anyway.”

I knew this was futile, so I threw up my hands in surrender. I left with no argument and no information.

I went back that evening, around shift change.

The station was packed full of people who were used to seeing me there, so nobody batted an eye at my presence. I even made small talk with a few of them as I worked my way over to where the case files were kept. Lucky for me, the station had transferred over to electronic filing in the last few years, so the newer documents were all online. A couple of people noticed me messing around over there, but they seemed satisfied with my claim that I was double checking on one of my recent cases. A quick search for Wilcox, sorted by date, brought up a short list of names, only one of which was dated within the last month.

I hit print, grabbed the papers, and was out before Anderson even knew I was there.

My head was pounding again by the time I got back home, so I took a few Ibuprofen and laid down with an ice pack on my head. Before I knew it, I’d passed out. Residual hangover effects, I suppose. I hadn’t had much to drink that day.

Which brings me to this morning. Woke up with my head pounding, ears ringing again, and quickly made a pot of liquid revival before sitting down to read the case notes regarding one Henry Wilcox.

The cops like to fill the pages with official terminology and other things to cause headaches, so I’m just going to translate it here.

Wilcox had no police record prior to the third week of December. He’d never even had a reason to get in touch with them until one of his employees had apparently committed suicide at work. The intern, Keith Sanders, had been there only two weeks, and had seemed a little unstable the entire time, complaining about headaches and noises that no one else could hear. The day before they found him, he’d been aggressive, and earlier that morning he’d even gone so far as to violently shove a coworker aside who’d brushed against him on the stairwell. They were about to let him go at the end of the workday because of it, but Keith had no way of knowing that.

According to Wilcox’s testimony, he “was on the way to lunch that day, when someone screamed bloody murder in the middle of the office.” When he’d gone to investigate, he’d found the intern lying dead on the floor with his right ear cut off. 

Reading that, I had a flash back to Daniel’s ear falling into my lap. Already, I’d found a connection, but what about Wilcox?

Well, he was dismissed by the police without charges, and the death was ruled suicide by an official examination – by Daniel West.

The next page is where it got interesting, though. Apparently, just over a week later – the evening of the 26th, to be precise, a Saturday – Wilcox walked back into the station looking extremely agitated. He’d asked to talk to the lead on the Sanders case, claiming he had important information.

Well, they brought him back to the Officer’s desk for an interview, and that’s where Wilcox, for lack of a better term, lost his shit. They papers say he had “a manic episode,” attacking the officer and two other people nearby before he was subdued and cuffed. They took him to a holding cell under “suspicion of illegal use of narcotic substances,” and they held him there overnight.

Apparently, his condition worsened. Not long after 11 o’clock, he was shouting gibberish and crying, by midnight he was screaming and banging his head against the wall. He got so bad that they started processing him for transfer to a mental health institution.

Apparently, they weren’t fast enough. Wilcox beat his head against the wall hard enough to cave in the right side of his skull around the ear. He managed it when his guard wandered off for a cup of coffee, and was found by none other than my good friend Daniel West.

His death was ruled a suicide.

By this point in the case notes, I was already seeing a trend that I couldn’t believe the police had overlooked. There were plainly connections here.

One: Daniel’s call to me, and his final moments, didn’t sound like him at all. It was as though his mind wasn’t working properly.

Two: Henry Wilcox, clearheaded and calm at his initial interview, comes back with information and then goes mad before he can deliver it, ultimately killing himself.

Three: The intern, Keith, found dead at work, who had exhibited similar behavior to Henry Wilcox before his death. To a different extent, of course, but similar.

And, of course, the ears.

My theory at this point is this: Keith was murdered. So was Wilcox, and so was Daniel. The killer seems to like to use hallucinogenic drugs to make his victims susceptible to his approach. Obviously more information is needed, but I believe that the killer knew Keith personally, perhaps even worked with him. That would explain how Wilcox had gotten new information a week later, and how he’d been drugged before going to the cops – possibly in his coffee.

And Daniel, well… the poor man must have found the toxin in Wilcox’s system during the autopsy, and the killer then went after him to cover his tracks.

Well. That’s all for today, I think. I’m going to have to dig up more information on this Keith Sanders later. For now, perhaps a hot shower.

Note to self: make a doctor’s appointment to check for tinnitus. Your ear shouldn’t still be ringing like this.

**Case Journal #3: 8 January 2016**

It’s been a long day. I almost didn’t make it to writing this out, but I need to follow my own rules. Gotta get it out while it’s fresh, so I don’t forget anything.

I’d better hurry, though, before the whiskey takes hold. Maybe that’ll stop my damn ear ringing. Or at least make me not care. 

I swear it’s getting louder.

Anyway, today I followed up on the Keith Sanders lead. Chief Anderson didn’t give me any grief when I went to check the official records on the guy – probably because there wasn’t much to it. Cut and dry, suicide case, no other police record. Same as Henry Wilcox.

Same as Daniel. 

Luckily, Keith’s former coworkers were willing to volunteer more information than was found in the official records. Turns out, he and Wilcox worked at a traffic control center. Specifically, in tollbooth operations. Keith’s job was monitoring the live feeds from the cameras at automated toll crossings. Specifically, he monitored the high-occupancy vehicle lanes, looking for violators. Even more specifically, he had one-third of the city's main east-west highway. But that’s not important. I think.

Anyway, from what I could tell, Keith had only been employed there for a couple of weeks before killing himself, which matches the police report. Most of his coworkers told the same tale as Mr. Wilcox – that Keith was a strange man, increasingly prone to paranoia and violence, and that he was expected to be let go soon. Nobody really knew anything about him, though. He never spoke of friends or family, and other than other office workers he’d slighted, there was no clear sign that he had any enemies. Certainly nobody there seemed to have any real problem with him.

I double checked with the HR department, and was given access to his personal file. He had nobody listed as beneficiary on his life insurance, no emergency contacts except his now-deceased boss, and lived in a small apartment downtown. All in all, Keith seemed an extraordinarily boring man.

Then why would someone want to kill him?

Nothing was adding up, so I stuck around for a while, asking more questions. Eventually, I stumbled upon a lady named Evey, short for Evelyn, who seemed particularly put off by Keith’s departure. She seemed almost taken with the man, which seemed at odds with what everyone else seemed to say about him. A little more questioning showed that he hadn’t always been so strange. Apparently, in his first few days, Evey found him charming and sweet, and had fallen for him almost immediately. Her face soured when she told me about his gradual transformation over the next week.

Apparently, it started with him seeming distracted. A few days later, he started to complain about a ringing in his ears, and later still, pain. With the pain came agitation, and despite Evey’s pleas, Keith didn’t see a doctor. It would seem that he was used to living without insurance, and didn’t want to risk a large medical bill over something minor.

Roughly three days before he died, Keith closed himself off from other people completely. He never spoke without shouting, so he just came in, did his job, and went home.

At this point, I thought I’d finally found a connection, but it seemed not only weak, but frightening. Still, a lead is a lead, and I had to pursue it. 

I asked Evey whether Keith had witnessed a death recently, or found a body, within a day or two of his first symptoms.

I’ll never forget the confusion on her face, and the dawning comprehension. 

“Well, yes,” she said slowly. “On his monitors, he saw a woman run her car into a traffic pylon at the toll station. She was thrown out, if I recall, died instantly. Keith got a picture of it at his station, and called emergency services out to help immediately. You'd be surprised how common stuff like that is around here, one every months or so, so I didn’t think anything of it at the time.”

She looked at me with concern heavy on her face. “Do you think that had something to do with it?”

I shook my head, and quietly changed the topic, but Evey had already confirmed my worst fear.

There are only a few things each death has had in common so far.

First, each victim was the first person to find the previous victim after their murder. Yes, murder. I don’t believe any of these deaths were anything less.

Second, each victim suffered from similar forms of uncharacteristic and increasingly erratic behavior in the days prior to their death. Very likely, they were drugged. Possibly something psychoactive, nerve agents or something. In any case, they all had similar symptoms, from what I can gather.

Third, upon their death, their ears are removed or mutilated. The killer does not take it with him/her; the act seems purely symbolic in a way I can’t yet fathom.

After reviewing the facts, I’m left with only one conclusion. There is a killer out there, preying on innocent bystanders. His M.O. is to track down the first person to find his last victim, and make that person his new target. He poisons them, somehow, and strikes when they’re at their weakest.

Unfortunately that can only mean one thing. 

I was the last person to see Daniel alive. I was the first person to see him dead. And ever since, my right ear hasn’t stopped ringing. In fact, it’s getting louder. It’s starting to hurt.

I believe I have been drugged. I believe the killer is after me. And I believe I don’t have long.

I’ve got to dig deeper, find more information. I have to be ready before he comes for me.

**Case Journal #4: 13 January 2016**

I am about to die.

I don’t know who my murderer is. I don’t know where it came from. I don’t know if it’s human.

I’ve run deeper into my investigation. The woman on the tollway, Leslie Bates, showed the same erratic behavior as the others in the week before she drove her car into the toll station.

Almost two weeks before that, Leslie had found her infant child boy in her crib. The child had been increasingly agitated and inconsolable for almost two weeks before he killed himself.

Yes. An infant committed suicide. He’d found a way to wedge his own right ear into the clasp on its crib gate, and hung from it until his fragile little neck popped. The only reason the parents noticed is because the incessant wailing had finally stopped.

They’d thought it was a miracle, until they found him.

That infant had been born two weeks prior. On that day, an old man had escaped the hospital psych ward, stolen a security guard’s gun, and blew his brains out in the maternity ward. Guess where he aimed his shot? 

Yes, his right ear.

I couldn’t find any more leads after him. Not a jot, not a trace. But the signs are clear.

The first person to see the victim dies, within two weeks.

It starts as a ringing in the ear, growing more persistent over time.

It never stops. It just gets louder and louder and *louder*.

Eventually it changes. The pain caused by the sound becomes physical. The ear starts to throb and itch, like something’s trying to claw its way out.

Or in.

Until you scream.

Once you do, it changes again. The pain rises, the noise changes, like a cacophony of demons wailing in hell, clawing at the inside of your ear, as though it’s the gateway for them to escape hell itself.

I’ve already cut my right ear off, like the others, but I managed to stop the bleeding. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it didn’t help at all. 

If anything, it’s just gotten louder. The screams sound excited now. Like I’ve done well.

Like I’ve done what they want.

Well, I won’t have it. And they won’t have me.

This is my final entry on the case. Whoever finds this, you must know. You cannot come looking for me. You must not find my body. Or else this will fate will befall you as well.

It should be no problem. Very few people explore the deep woods this far north. Almost nobody could ever find the abandoned cabin from my childhood. And certainly no one would dig through the ashes that will be left behind to find my charred remains in the basement. But just to be certain, I will print a copy of these notes to keep with me in a fire box. Hopefully it will help whatever poor soul might happen upon me someday.

If you are that wretched soul, and you are reading this now, you’ve probably already noticed a ringing in your ears. 

If so…

God help you."

A little backstory: I work beauty retail for a pretty large grocery retail company in Texas and have been with them for the past 8 years. I graduated in 2014 with my degree in Communication and have been pursuing a corporate job within the same company since I graduated with no luck so far. I took a step back for a few months and re evaluated what I wanted to be ""when I grew up"" and realized I wanted to work in Beauty Procurement, which I also happen to have 4 years of beauty sales experience with the same company. So in July, I emailed one of the beauty buyers and asked if I could go see what they do and talk for a few hours and they were totally cool with it. I met all of the buyers and their boss and all-in-all had a really cool experience meeting them and talking to them about what they do.

So in September I noticed that they posted an internship for Beauty Procurement and I applied. They called me shortly before Christmas for a phone interview and all of the questions were ""tell me about your role and what you do now"", ""what was your GPA when you graduated"", etc, etc. to which I answered and I got this sense of appeasement from the guy on the phone that he was just there to ""check the boxes"" so to speak. I finally mentioned my desires to go back to school and get my MBA which he perked up and said ""well normally we don't hire post grads for internships (which on the job posting it says they do and I also emailed the recruiters to make sure) but since you said that I'm going to send off your info and set you up for a second in-person interview.""

So last Tuesday I had my in-person interview with the buyers' boss for an hour. He sat me down and immediately recognized me and asked me how my store was then proceeded to ask me how I heard about the internship and what I knew about it....and those were like the only questions he asked me besides if I had any questions about it to which I asked what the challenges were. Other than that, we basically had a conversation about things he knew I would understand about relating to the business because of my experience and what was expected of the intern and future goals and projects he wanted to conquer this year and next year. Then towards the end of the interview, he asked me about whether or not I was able to travel, which yes I am, and with my resume in his hand, he said ""I don't have any questions for you, because I already know you. You'll have an answer on friday."" And in my brain I was like, ""uhhh...what? Is this a good thing?"" He escorted me out and I told him it was nice to see him again and thanked him in an email.

On my way out, I asked my recruiter how many other candidates there were and she said it was just me and one other person...so I just don't know how to feel about it. I want to feel good, but at the same time, I've gotten a lot of no's so I don't want to get my hopes up.

TL;DR Interviewer said he ""already knew me"" and didn't ask me any personal or behavioral questions and I'm hella confused. What do you think?

It's been 9 days since the interview and I haven't heard a peep. Interviewer said I would hear by last Friday. I sent an email to the recruiter asking what's up, she emailed another recruiter and still nothing. This company is good about sending out rejection emails at least (because I've received them before) but I haven't even gotten that. My online application status even still says ""under review"". Perhaps an HR hangup?"

Whenever on their network not a single game can connect in any way. All PC games will fail to load multiplayer or will show errors stating failure to connect to the server. At one point I was using an older version of HotSpot Shield to VPN my way around whatever bull shit they had set up and it would work fine on almost every game; some still would not function with the VPN. However, now even the VPN is failing to connect. There is an automatic updated for HSS and once it runs, the VPN won't connect anymore and I have to uninstall it and reinstall an older version but even this is just a fix for a little while before the auto upgrade leads to connection failure. I have also tried a dozen other free and free trial VPNs with all failing to be able to make connections. I even tried to connect to game servers on my Xbox which also failed.

For some reason however, Gaming is about the only thing blocked. At times, YouTube and Netflix struggle but at other times I can stream in HD without hitches. I can also download about 10GB worth of data in less than an hour. So I'm not sure what I can do as I have tried everything.

After finishing my degree I decided to stay in school to earn an MS in Computer Science. Throughout this degree I still worked at my previous internship part time and while finishing up my degree worked full-time elsewhere as a Systems Quality Assurance Engineer.

After graduating with my MS degree, I struggled to find any companies that were interesting in talking with me for a software engineering position. I would talk to a company and express interest in being a developer, they would just reiterate how they were excited to talk to me for their testing department because of my experience. I ended up taking a job as a testing engineer hoping that working at the company would give me the opportunity to move into a development role. This hasn’t panned out. I have done some coding in this position, but not nearly as much as someone would with a developer role.

I started job searching again and am finding myself in the same position. Companies only want to talk to me because of my testing experience and are hesitant to talk to me about engineering jobs because of my lack of industry development experience. Trying to find an engineering internship is out of the question because I’m more than a year out of school.

I have been reading a lot of threads about the sub 3.0 GPA issue and I am worried about it, too. So here is a brief summary of my situation.

I am Emre from Turkey, a senior studying Chemistry and doing double major with Chemical and Biological at the highest ranked University in Turkey (according to the Times Higher Edu.). My undergraduate GPA is 2.81 with the grade average of the last two years being 3.04. The reason is that I got very low grades throughout the first two years of my study. The grades from the last four semesters are better. In addition, I am currently taking a few. classes that undergrads and grads can mutually enroll and I am expecting to get very good letter grades based on my assignment grades so far. One of them is closely related to my area of interest

For grad school, I want to study either computational biology or biomaterials (drug delivery). I have worked at four different laboratories so far and two of them are directly related to my future goals. However, I don't have any publications yet. I also completed a summer internship at the Clinical Trials department of Novartis.

My GRE scores: 154 in verbal, 169 in Q and 4.0 in AW

TOEFL: 112 (got 30 from the listening and the writing parts)

I have two professors and an associate professor who agreed to write me recommendation letters. Two of them are my current or previous research supervisors and the third one is my academic advisor. One of the professors will probably write a game changer recommendation, the other recommendations will be more ordinary (just making a guess here)

I am planning to apply to a lot of programs, here is the list:

I already applied to UDel PhD in Chem Eng.

Planning on applying to

University at Buffalo, PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences,

Stony Brook, PhD in material Sciences and Engineering

Illinois Inst of Tech, PhD in chemical Engineering

MSc in Chemical Engineering or Pharmaceutical Sciences at Waterloo (although it requires me to find a potential supervisor and that is very difficult to achieve as they either completely ignore my e-mails or they lack sufficient funds)

MSc in University of Alberta, Western University, Calgary, Queen's

Uppsala, Chalmers and Linkoping in Sweden (MSc)

Twente and Groningen in Netherlands.

Obviously I can't apply to all of them since it is extremely costly. So I would like to know if one or more of these options is far from realistic for my situation, so that I can avoid wasting money on them. Because of my GPA I am constantly being discouraged, telling myself ""should I even apply at all?""

I asked about the GPA policy to some of the universities above by e-mail but they simply responded by copy pasting what is already stated on their website.

Overall, I would really appreciate it if you could give me an idea about my chances and possible steps that I can take for the future.

Thanks in advance"

416fmr,6,2016-01-15,[Review] First month and a half on Adderall (M/22). (x-post r/adderall),overworkedintern,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/416fmr/review_first_month_and_a_half_on_adderall_m22/,"I am in my senior year of college. I've always known that I have had some sort of attention disorder. I have a 2.5 GPA and my academics have been horrible for as long as I can remember. I come from a medically conservative Hispanic family that does not believe in medication.

I have always done my best to make up for my shortcomings. I have some pretty insane intern experience and am an incredible networker (I'm a business student). In August, I scored an internship with a small investment fund with about $200+ million under management. The tasks I was given were within my abilities but for some reason there was just not enough time in the day. For months I struggled on to keep my head above water while taking a full time course load at my university. I continued to get reprimanded at work and although they were nice to me about my errors most of the time, I could tell that their patience was waining. Depression started creeping in and I felt like nothing was going right. Throughout this time, I wasn't even thinking that ADHD was the issue; I just thought I wasn't trying hard enough.

I needed someone to talk to but I didn't feel comfortable talking to friends and family (People see me as the perfect student; no one knows that I have terrible grades, they just know my great work experience) so I decided to use some of the money I was making for an appointment with a therapist.
I poured my heart out to this poor old lady and it took 3 sessions for me to paint the entire picture for her. She said that she suspected it may be ADHD so she tested me for it. Low and behold, I got a really high score and she prescribed me 10mg adderall/day to start.

I took it for the first time the next day right before I left for work. I started feeling really weird and energetic in traffic but thought nothing of it. When I came in to the office, I felt like everything clicked. An assignment that took me a month to get halfway through, took be a single day to finish. Eventually, I was able to handle 3 times the amount of work I was doing pre-diagnosis. Also, for the first time in my academic life, I made all A's
I noticed changes at home to. For the first time in my life, I was cleaning my room and folding my own clothes. Pre-diagnosis my room would always be a mess and I would take clean and wrinkled clothes from the basket and put them in the dryer to dewrinkle every morning.

I finally became the person I knew I could be and everything was going great.
Winter break started two weeks into my diagnosis so I was able to work full-time up until my last day which was the end of the year. I noticed that I would be very productive in the morning that I took adderall but I would start slowing down around 1 or 2 (I was taking IR). On days that I had tons of work to do I would self medicate and take an extra 10mg pill in the afternoon. Self medication would happen very rarely at the beginning but I started doing it more and more as I felt my tolerance increasing. I talked to my therapist about my issues and concluded that it would be okay to increase my dosage to 20mg/day (10mg in the morning and 10mg in the afternoon).

My internship ended 15 days ago and I have cut down my adderall consumption down to 10mg on days that I am studying. I have noticed that 10mg no longer gives me that initial hyperfocus that it gave me before. Although it's not nearly as bad as when I'm not on addy, I do have to put in a sizable amount of effort to get started on any task at hand.

In Conclusion: Adderall has changed my life. My tolerance is increasing faster than I thought it would be but it may only because I started with a very tiny dose. I actually like the fact that my tolerance requires me to put in extra effort because I am a part of the school of thought that adderall should be supplemental to your efforts, not a total replacement. I take addy only on days that I need it and since I am no longer working, I don't take it very often. My room is getting a little messier but I trick myself into thinking to myself ""What would I do if I was on adderall?"" and I can manage to be a little more productive. I expect to start taking my prescription as intended when school starts next week. I have experienced the euphoria feeling but I have never chased it. I think I can attribute that to the fact that I have an outstanding amount of respect for adderall since I started so late in life compared to people starting in primary or secondary school. When you start, make a schedule of the times you need to eat because you will forget. My general doctor was very concerned that I had accidentally lost 10lbs in a month. Good luck to the newbies. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me!"

I am a 22 year old Australian male in my last year of study for Computer Engineering. Recently I studied abroad in the US, and fell absolutely in love with the country. The goal is to work in the US for a year upon graduating at the end of 2016 (quite possibly longer, depending on how everything goes). I would like some sort of tech related position (experience in software development, data science, embedded systems, machine learning) and am not overly fussed on where I end up working (I loved Austin and Seattle, which appear to have a booming tech industry). I have a few questions that I’d like some insight on, and would be very grateful for whatever help anyone can provide.

Would it be hard for me to secure a job whilst applying from Australia? I expect this to be the toughest stepping stone in this process, however I was hoping that my work experience may make things go a bit more smoothly. I have completed 3 internships, and worked with a professor on funded research as a research assistant. I will also graduate with first class honours. Does anyone have any experience with obtaining/applying for these positions whilst outside of the country?

Which Visa should I go for? When I studied abroad I had a J1 Visa, and I know that there are options for recent graduates. This visa appears to need some sort of institution to sponsor you however (such as a university, which is what sponsored my Visa previously). This visa would allow me 3 months to find work however, which would make finding a job significantly easier. Anyone with experience/suggestions for obtaining this? I also liked the look of the E3 Visa (for Australians only), however it could be tough to obtain as it requires you to find a job prior to your arrival.

As far as budget goes, I have saved about $15000, and if required could earn more before I leave. If anyone has something else that they would like to bring up outside of the questions I listed, that is also appreciated.

I'm 25 and I've hit a stagnant point in my life. I need to do something to change it. I've been working in a role unrelated to Chemical Engineering, and I'm on the fence on whether I should continue to pursue that or take a different career path.

**Bakcground**


I graduated ~2 years ago from a smaller university with a B.S. in ChemE with a 3.0 gpa and absolutely no experience (outside of foodservice/retail jobs)


A month or two after graduating I got an internship at a company that develops proton therapy systems for treating cancer. I got this job because the physcist needed someone to take a whole lot of field measurements on there electromagnets, then compile and analyze the data in excel. I took ~20hrs of programming classes and could automate all the analysis in excel, so the hired me for that. It took ~6 months to finish all the magnet testing.


My internship ended and they hired me on as a temporary contractor. At this point the company was preparing their application to register their device with the FDA (see here for description on what thats like). This involves describing how you will test your device and what you expect to see, carrying out the test and recording the data and results. I got to help out in every step of the application: writing/editing test protocols, coming up with realistic requirements, figuring out how to test device requirements, carrying out the test, documenting results. We got to use some pretty sophisticated software to keep track of all this.


Recently I've started helping the physics team commission the proton system. They have some idea of how to test it and check that all the systems work. So every night we turn things on set up beam diagnostics, run beam, cross our fingers and hope nothing breaks. The beam diagnostics is using some special sheets or other device to see the beam and record an image. Sometimes they'll give me the image to analyze (I'll use Python/Matlab or some other tool like ImageJ). Its been interesting, I've gotten a lot of experience, but it does nothing for me as far as chemical engineering goes.


I've been working here for almost 2 years. I won't be able to work here much longer. They will not promote me because I do not have the right pedigree (Typical hires are EEs, MEs, or Medical Physicist.
I think my most realistic option is to look for a job at a medical device company (where 510K experience is a huge plus) in some kind of Quality Assurance role. I don't think I can stomach a QA role. I can't say if I will enjoy working as a ChemE, because I've never actually done it. Writing programs has always felt more like a game than actual work, but I hate the thought of living inside a cubicle for the rest of my life.


**To sum it up the directions I think I could go in are:**
+Continue looking for entry level ChemE related jobs (I've been doing this halfheartedly with little success)
+Go back to school and get a B.S./M.S in computer science and see where that goes.
+Look at other medical device companies for any QA roles.
+Say fuck it and join the Navy/ Army; or sell my car, buy a plane ticket and backpack through South America.


If I choose the computer science route, how should I go about this? Grad school, try to teach myself then look for a job, or...?

Others Say that I am naive, akin to a docile lamb, and that makes me easy prey among the wolves of society that are ready to take everything from me by hook or by crook. 

The truth is that I just tend to focus on wild, awesome, crazy ideas inside my head. I am so obsessed with these that I completely neglect socializing with others and this one thing has led me to lose everything. I never expected that to be the reason. I just thought I could take on the entire world by myself and I ended up crushed totally.

So now I have a lot of free time to spare while I try to pick myself back up. During the process of recovery there is a lot of waiting to be done. A LOT. During all that waiting, there is a lot of time to kill while I get money, paperwork, etc. Seriously not even a job can kill time anymore. 

So i would like to restart my life by becoming a positive, social person since I am literally starting from the bottom. A whole other person, so to speak. And I would like you guys to help me out. 

Tell Me everything you can about conversations and social rules. Right down to the very details. Give me personal experience, books, articles, all the way from the science to philosophy to media, music, movies, everywhere. Give me the wildest sources and examples of what not to do. 
Tell Me how conversations have saved lives, how subtle it is, how dynamic things get, etc. 

Thank You and have a nice day."

41goqt,2,2016-01-17,Coming from an Asian-American: how do I change my mindset about college and my future?,ducaro,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/41goqt/coming_from_an_asianamerican_how_do_i_change_my/,"I’m an Asian-American sophomore who attends a “very competitive” high school in the heart of Silicon Valley. The school is (supposedly) one of the best in California, and we’re 70-80% Asian.   

The sole purpose of everything we do in school is to get into a good college. We live and breathe for a chance at the Ivy League universities; if a student isn’t doing well, we joke about how he’ll “only end up at a community college”; we claw our way to the top … acceptance letters from Harvard, or Yale, or Stanford, or MIT, that’s what we strive for! Success in your later years is absolutely DEPENDENT on which college you go to!   

A 4.0 isn’t enough; don’t even think about getting B’s; take as many AP classes as you can; take the SAT and ACT, you need perfect scores on both; volunteer, volunteer, volunteer, that’s what colleges want; what are your extracurriculars?; have you gotten any internships yet; science olympiads will look good on your application; apply for only the most prestigious summer programs, the ones that are easy to get into are USELESS –– college, college, college, college. 

This whole attitude, to me, just seems so closed-minded… I know there’s nothing wrong with having a goal. I know there’s nothing wrong with attending these coveted colleges. But when we’re manufactured like this, forced into the “perfect applicant” mold, checking off boxes on a list of what colleges want to see… there’s got to be more to life than that; what happens after? What if I do end up in a community college; what if I’m not successful? What if I don’t amount to anything? 

I have no idea what I want to do when I grow up. My mom told me today that that was unacceptable, by my age, 15, I should know which major I want to declare; that I should have my life figured out already; but really, I don’t even know my choices. The only career option I really know is “engineering” or “computer science”, and even that I’m not truly familiar with…God, I’m so ignorant! I can’t think of any career that’s not STEM related, how pathetic; 

I don’t know what the point of this question was, I’m sorry; I just feel really desperate, and trapped; I don’t know what to do with my life; I’m just trying to think beyond colleges…is success truly strongly tied with what college you get into? I don’t know. 

Any comments or advice regarding anything relevant would be greatly appreciated. "

41ihgw,0,2016-01-18,Well I'm a 15 year old boy and I'm bi and I think I could be trans and well I just need some advice one what to do,kirito1342,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/41ihgw/well_im_a_15_year_old_boy_and_im_bi_and_i_think_i/,Well I guess if u want to help you need to know my story. Ps i legit made this account just to ask this question i want NO ONE i know to even have a hint this is happening the chances they would see this is small but idc lol. It all started when I was around 9 and I had fantasy's and dreams about becoming a girl. I hid my feminine self as a kid. I wanted to take my pic with the princesses but was to embarrassed. One time as a joke my sister asked me to put on a dress so she can take a pic and joke bout it to her friends and I got so excited. This may sound hella retarted but I was young and I still find it dumb to this day. But I tried to stay on my laptop 4 a long time then put the hot bottom lol hot bottom. I put that on my... Well you know. I had a plan to mess up my you know what then the doctors would change me into a girl cuz my dic was so messed up. You can laugh I know I even laugh thinking back to it. Then at 12 I just kinda got used to acting really manly. I tried to never let my feminine self get out and I just lived with it. Now I'm 15 I now am clearer on who I am. I have experimented and sometimes I like girls sometimes I like men. I like girls majority of the time. But for the past half year I have been worried about my gender AGAIN. I act feminine in my daily life but not to much. I do act more like a girl when I'm alone. Ps most people may not understand but I have dressed as a girl and still will because it just feels right and think I do actually look like a girl pretty hot one also. Also when i see a hot girl I'm not like other men (I dont think) I dont think man I wanna f that. I think what would it be like to be that. Pretty funny story I txted one of my friends over kik that I wanted to talk I had some personal stuff ill tell you when you get on. Then I pass it off as I almost died and I just wanted to think bout life. Then like a week later I txted him that I lied bout that txt and I told him I thought I was trans. Then I told him im lesbian. Then I passed that off as a huge joke cuz he thought I was joking. So I was like ahh you fell for it you actually felt sorry for me your gay. Well back to the story it just weird 4 me cuz at one point I feel I'm a girl then the next I feel I'm male. I'm just confused and the more time I wait the more I get frustrated bout this. Its like I don't know if I feel male cuz I was born male or I feel female to cuz its something different. Its like I'm arguing with myself I have just been going back and forth but lately I have been trying to reveal my feminine self I have been hiding to my parents cuz my brothers and sister are to old to be living with there parents. So basically I have been playing my music so they can hear talking more feminine wearing necklaces and jewelry. But my parents have been unreasonable lately. My mom just screams at me telling me I'm doing nothing with my life but when I do something like make a YouTube with 1000 subs or getting 1st place in the state for an art contest. Or me getting a job and making 30 dollars per hour at 15. She just doesn't care all she does is sit down on her bed with a tablet. But I do like to play games. Video games are my life but I all she brings up is that all I do is play games and do nothing else but b%&amp; I work out and do stuff with my life i make sure i dont become fat and lazy like her all she does is sit down on her tablet and never works out and eats healthy. But that's a different problem for another day. Well basicly my mom its just like I can't talk to her. And my dad he is very helpful and we fight sometimes but majority of the time we hang out talk go go karting and he actually was the one who got me the job. But I go with him when he goes out because he like to talk. I just agree with his options cuz he tells the most safest storys bout his childhood and I just feel bad for him. And today I was going to tell him I want to see a gender therapist. But yesterday we were talking. And to see on how he'd think of me being bi and trans I started a convo bout my brother who is bi he has straight out said he was. He acts WAY more feminine than me and he got fired from Disney world cuz interns were comin in and they made cut backs. So he said that oh he wouldn't have gotten fired if he didn't always wear Minnie mouse hat like where did he think to do that. This is why I dont want to talk to him he just acts to gay. But I should have expected that. He is very racist. Like one time when he came to pick me up from school just as a surprise. I usually walk like 1 mile but he likes to help me. Then my friends where saying bye and stuff and most of them were black. Then my dad says you really hang out with these n words then he laughs and says there n words why do you even talk to them. So in short of an essays worth bout my parents they would not understand me being bi or trans and its just I don't know who else to talk to or tell for some advice. Like is what I'm going though normal or wat. Ps if u post f up shiza u just wasted time in your life to post something that someone would not care and just ignore. Ps man I posted alot I was just sitting here watchin a movie while typing this and I didn't realize I typed so much lol.

I'm a new grad with 1yr of internships.

First off: It's in Madrid, they offered 22,000€ a year before taxes. Southern Europe has low CS salaries even for Europe, but this may be way too low.

It's supposedly a startup, and they claim to offer the usual such as flexible hours and the possibility to work from home sometimes, not many perks though.

For context, the guy was half an hour late to the interview, and randomly interrupted the interview because he was apparently busy with something else. Not the end of the world and I hate to be judgemental but it's kinda telling.

He called with the offer and I asked for a few days to think about it because tbh I don't think I will take it. He spent literally 20 minutes giving me explanations for the low salary, how I'm just too unexperienced and will be costly to train, how a lot of other cs companies are worse than them so I should work with them, how he will give me the salary I want if I take this and do well for the first 6 months, etc. Hinky as fuck tbh.

41kg87,0,2016-01-18,I was indirectly promised a full time job; still no follow-up on that promise.,cheesysalsa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/41kg87/i_was_indirectly_promised_a_full_time_job_still/,"Quick(ish) backstory:

I work as an ""intern"" in a large private manufacturing companies' corporate office. We have roughly over 1,000 employees in our corporate office (not counting franchisees or remote locations). I work in their IT department from which I was originally hired as an intern for a temporary large-scale deployment project.

I ended up achieving great things with the project and got to the point where they let me take over the entire project completely. After the project slowly came to end, they put me on other things and kind of just kept me since as a long-term intern with no real official contract expiry.

I've done amazing service to this company. I've improved and developed workflows, programs, systems, etc. to increase efficiency for all of my team members. I can name a handful of things that my team uses on a day-to-day basis that I was a part of improving or creating. I've been treated as the ""star child"" (for lack of a better word) and this is evident by the numerous personalized thank-you letters written to my manager(s) about my outstanding work, customer service, etc.

This company is going through a reorg since about 9 months ago. About 10 months ago I was in talks with my old manager (who has since been promoted) about getting a full time job since one of the positions for the support team I was working with had opened up. I went through the whole interview process and then this reorg happened and it was completely put on the back burner which I completely understand because with a reorg comes new management, talent redistribution, hiring freezes, etc. so that made sense.

Flash forward to December I had a meeting with my new manager to discuss where we were at with getting me a full time job and if that was still an opportunity I had. He went on about the hiring freeze and blah blah usual excuses when I finally just decided to put him the spot.

I told him I understood that and all, and I emphasized how much I loved working at this company and the relationships I've established with the people I work with and work for are better than anything I could have hoped for. I also told him that being an intern means I'm a contract worker. Contracts end. And so can my job at any point for any reason if they decide they don't need me anymore. I asked, if he really valued me as much as he was saying, then how do I make the decision between staying at this company and accepting a full time job position from another company that wants to invest in me?

This question stopped him in his tracks. He began fumbling over his words talking about how I should do what's best for me, but if it were up to him, he would ask that I stay. During the next few weeks after this meeting I get called in not only by my old manager, but by our current Director as well. Both of them tell me to ""hang in there"" and that they ""have plans"" for me and whatnot and that things ""will change."" They basically keep telling me I'm going to get the job in the most indirect ways they can possibly say it without actually saying it. A couple weeks later when I was called in to get a review for my bonus (which was originally supposed to be ~$350 since I am an intern) my manager tells me they bumped up the bonus to over $1,000 (exact number wont be specified for privacy reasons). They tell me this number was supposed to be a message ""to not look for other jobs"" and I told them the message was well received.

It's been over a month now as we're coming into the new year. Our official soft launch is approaching as our reorg comes to a spot where we can finally see the end. There has been no discussion over this topic since then, but the burden of responsibilities laid upon me have grown exponentially.

I am now working the exact same responsibilities/schedules/tasks as someone who would be hired full time, except I'm still working as an intern and hence being paid as an intern (like crap). Not only that, but now the new manager is giving me crap about my scheduling which hasn't been brought up before by my old manager (who officially changed over positions 2 months ago). Since I'm non-exempt and non-salary, I have to log my hours that I work. Normally, I would work a full time 8 hour shift and leave. Usually I'd work 8-4:30ish with a 30 minute or less lunch and leave then. Some days I wouldn't take lunch at all (I eat a nice breakfast before coming to work) and just work 8-4 and leave. Just FYI: I live in a state where it's not required by law to give employees lunch breaks. Yet, my manager wants me to work the full 8-5 shift and is requiring me to take a 1 hour lunch. This is problematic because since I need to log the hours that I work, and if I don't work lunch, I would be working over time. Here's the catch: they want me to stay under 40 hours. This is where my problems start coming into play. How am I expected to tackle all these responsibilities on top of projects that I've been personally assigned and stay under 40 hours while doing it? 

This obviously would not be a problem if I were an exempt employee, since I wouldn't be getting paid hourly, and I would be required to work 8-5 (or whatever time by schedule) anyway. But my manager continues to treat me as if I were one and I think it's really unfair and that I'm being taken advantage of. I shouldn't be doing this job without the job title.

I feel like word had spread pretty quickly that I must be looking for other jobs or something because the day after I told my manager my dilemma mentioned earlier, many of my higher-ups have been encouraging me to stick around.

The decision to hire me full time is not up to my manager, since the hiring freeze was placed by the new Director or IT and new CIO, but what do I do in a situation like this?

Do I keep pressing my manager to press his managers? Do I just keep my mouth shut and wait until something good happens like they say it will? I just fear that if I keep waiting, I will keep waiting, and nothing will happen.

I understand the implications of a reorg and that there are way higher-level things these executives are worrying about, but it just seems unfair all this new work that they are piling on me and somehow expecting me to work LESS hours than I had been working before they had piled all this stuff on me.

Thank you for reading."

41kiqw,6,2016-01-18,Remain a biomedical technician or start an elevator mechanic apprenticeship?,mynameistag,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/41kiqw/remain_a_biomedical_technician_or_start_an/,"I'm in my early 40s, but just started my first ""real"" career a couple of years ago as a biomedical technician at a hospital (I take care of medical electronics in the hospital). I like it ok. As a work-to-live job, it's pretty good: Reasonably varied, a bit over $50k/yr, 40 hours per week, good vacation time, good working environment, and I like the people I work with. In the next year, between a raise and being put into the after-hours on-call rotation, I will be making mid-$60k.

On the downside, I'm kind of bored with the job already (I tend to get bored easily) and increases will be minimal in this position after the raise this year. I could shoot for a management position, but that doesn't really interest me. I could work on learning more IT and networking and find a position that combines biomed and IT more and probably increase my income a good bit...but I don't find IT particularly interesting. I much prefer the hands-on, working with tools, fixing stuff aspects of the job. I could also try to work my way into becoming an imaging technician (MRI, CAT, Radiology). It's considered hard to break into, but I think I could if I set my mind to it. As far as money goes, that's probably my best bet if I'm generally staying in this field.

And then there's the unknown: What career twists and turns will come along that I'm not expecting or just aren't on my radar yet?

One thing I believe any of these things will have in common, though, is more work hours and a less favorable work/life balance. That wouldn't be a big deal if I was passionate about my job, but I'm not. I'm passionate about my free time and my hobbies; I want my job to fund my hobbies and give me time to enjoy them. And I don't want to make my hobbies my job.

So...let's say all of the above is generally the ""stay the course"" path. That is, stick with my current job and see where it goes.

The other option I'm presented with is becoming a union elevator mechanic. I've passed the apprenticeship aptitude test and have my interview next week. If I ""pass"" the interview, I get put on the union list according to how well I did and, when my number comes up, I start my 5-year apprenticeship. That could be a month from now, a year from now, or longer.

I've talked to people in the industry and done a bunch of reading online and, from what I've been told, it seems like I could potentially really like the job. It's very hands on, working with tools, mechanical. I'm told that even after many years on the job, you're still challenged and learning every day. It's physical. It's varied - you do electrical, plumbing, HVAC, framing and finishing, digital and analog systems, fabrication, etc. If it lives up to all this, I could actually see really enjoying it.

As far as finances go, you start at low $20/hr with a $2-3 raise per year for the 5 years of the internship, then make over $50/hr as a full mechanic. The person I know who's been doing it for 15 years says he's never made less than $100k as a mechanic. Overtime is double rate, but that same guy says, by choice, he almost never does overtime anymore...so it sounds like a 40-hr week is possible. That all sounds very good to me.

I guess the dilemmas are: Is it too soon to bail on this career I just started (after 2 years of school to get a biomedical technician degree)? As a person who gets bored easily, what if I get a couple years into this apprenticeship and find myself in the same position I'm in now - kinda feeling ""meh"" about the career? People said similar things about biomed as far as new everyday, challenging, etc...but I don't really feel that way about it. So, am I just interested in the elevator mechanic career because: Ooh! New! Shiny! And then I'll get bored and want to change again and have just wasted more time? I guess that's the main risk, really: I'm 2 years of school and 2 years of work into this career. If it's just my personality that the best I can hope for is a ""tolerable"" career, maybe I'm better off just continuing on my current path. At 40, I know I still have time, but I'm not 20; I want to make a good living and the prospect of continuing to start over (particularly when it comes to salary)...well, it gets less and less appealing as I get older.

So...any advice, thoughts, questions? Any ideas for where else I could go from biomed in the next 5, 10, 15 years? Or, if *5 years to good income and career* is the timeframe, any other thoughts on paths I should look into? Thank you."

I graduated from my University in 2013 with Applied Math &amp; Environmental Hydrology with experience in GIS and spatial analysis from a few years of internships in environmental science.  


I was never able to parlay an internship into fulltime work, and took jobs as a warehouse worker and bartender in my hometown. For the past year, if I wasn't at those jobs, I was behind my computer teaching myself web design, github version control, mapbox.js, leaflet.js, and a number of other programs and computer languages. I used public data from an old internship to produce this worksample. 

I feel presenting GIS data is moving in the direction of web-maps and web-apps. (compared to static powerpoints, reports, jpeg images). And since I'm trying to ""email my way into a job"" I feel I need a supplement my resume and cover letter with a ""wow factor"". Its been *a lot* of work, but I'm glad I've made it this far.

Do you guys have any thoughts? Advice on improving this project further? (or just words of encouragement are very welcome!)

41kwdp,17,2016-01-18,Best way to spend my year off from college?,juneflares,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/41kwdp/best_way_to_spend_my_year_off_from_college/,"So I decided to change to a CS major relatively late in my college career but since I had finished most other pre-reqs I was able to map out a plan to finish the entire major in 2 years. I finished my first year, which had some intro programming classes in C++ and Java, and some ""theory"" classes like stats/probability for CS (and other math topics like predicate/propositional logic, a bit of regex, a bit of algorithms etc). A lot of the more advanced classes would be taken in the 2nd year (more programming, data structures, networks, advanced algorithms, systems), but I've decided to take a year off of school for financial/personal reasons and return next fall. 

As of now part of my plan is to definitely study ahead so that when I get back taking so many CS classes won't be as painful. But what else would be a good use of my time? I've started looking at languages like Ruby and Python, am looking into a lot of sites recommended on here for various levels of learning to program. I'd also want to do an internship but I've always felt that I don't know enough to even apply or do the interview, since the beginning parts of the CS major are very defined and you can only take a couple classes that don't have prerequisites. The FAQ/Wiki was very helpful but this situation is kinda unique so wanted to see if there were other answers. Thanks!"

Currently, I am an actuary.  I have been here for 1 year plus a couple internships, and I'm 1 year out of college.  I hate the open-ended projects I do, and I'm looking for a job with more defined work.  The things I do like are:

* updating files (repetitive, monthly, usually in Excel) or creating a new file based off of a previous version

* consolidating things (making files with inputs/macros/etc. easier to use and to look at and read, making spreadsheets as automated as possible)

* running code (programs), but not writing them (updating them or making small changes is ok)

* writing (I have superb grammar/writing communication skills, so something with writing up reports or something for higher-ups, or writing reports in simpler language)

* I'm very good in Excel.  Not an expert, but I know my way around very well and am willing to learn even more (specifically macros)

* Doing stuff with numbers - summaries of data, calculations, etc.

* fast-paced projects (I don't do well with month-long projects that are really big.  I do best with week-long or shorter projects that are smaller, but have a quick turn-around)


That's about all I can think of at the moment.  I really don't know what kind of a job I would use all of that for, so I'm asking if anybody has a suggestion of a good fit for me.

I've recently got 2 offers for a PM internship for next summer and need some help making a decision. Compensation difference isn't significant.

Company A (large, reputed company in SF)

Pros: 

* I'm much more passionate about the company/brand and its products
* Already interviewed with my manager other lead engineer and hit it off really well (haven't spoken with the PM people of the team yet though)

Cons: 

* Not getting to work on the core product, but rather one of the Infrastructure teams

I was told by the recruiter I could possibly do this Infra team for this summer, and they can help me explore core product opportunities for full time if I do well this summer.

Company B (Known B2B company, many companies use their software)

Pros: 

* Get to choose 2-3 options from a list of choices on team placement (such as Mobile, Analytics, Business Intelligence, etc.) so I'll likely get to work on cooler stuff for the summer

Cons: 

* No idea of team members/colleagues
* Not quite as excited about the company/its products itself

If you guys could help me with this decision or provide some insight, it'd be appreciated. Thank you!"

Now what I have found is the questions for which I get the intuition right away I am able to do those very quickly while other ones I have to end up looking at solutions most of the times. Now even after having solved it, I find that when I try to do the same problems later(ones which I didn't get on my own), I'm still slow with them or don't get them at all. 

Do you face problems like these? What would be the best strategy to deal with it? Periodically come back to the same questions again later or don't leave a problem till you are sure that you can do it in your sleep? 

Also, if others could share the strategies they used while prepping, it would be very helpful.

I wanted to take pictures with the princesses and I always dreamed of being a girl and dressing up exe. But I always hid that me and never told others what I wanted I told them the more masculine thing to say. So I just got used to doing this and now I'm 15 and its just like I get more feminine and more worried each day. I know I'm bi but I'm not sure if I'm trans. Its like I argue with myself each day. One point I tell myself its a phase, then the next I tell myself im trapped in a mans body. I can't tell if seem masculine cuz its instinct for years of acting. But when im alone I love to dress and act as a girl. Even going online pretending im a girl. But is this just my mind's sexual fantasy (I do get pretty aroused by the thought of me as a girl). This is why I want to see a gender therapist it has been REALLY bothering me 4 almost 3 months. I have seen YouTube channels about if your trans and took quizes and asked others online. Those signs point to im trans. But that's just the internet I need a real person telling me and giving me professional medical advice. But I need my parents to get me into a gender therapist. My mom I think not care or try and bring me down from getting a therapist. She just hates me and I dont know why. I help her with her work and when she gets any chance she just yells at me. Like if I talk to a friend on Xbox too loud even if its one word she makes a big deal. If something falls out my pocket even if its just lint she starts yelling OMG WHY ARE YOU DROPPING S$&amp;* ON THE FLOOR DO YOU WANT TO LITER. Then even if I get a achievement in my life like getting a job that pays 30 dollars per hour AT 15, or getting 1st place in my state in a art contest, and even starting a YouTube channel and do what I love. She either doesn't care or finds a way to yell at me like saying oh you have a job well that's more of a reason for you not to clean. But all she does is sit down in her bed ALL DAY doing no work playing games on her tablet. She does foster dogs but all she does is put them in a room and make my dad and I do the work and pick up after her. Then there's my dad, dont get me wrong he is a great guy he helps me alot, always believe in me, help me get that job I mentioned b4. I mean we argue sometimes but mostly we r good. The thing is he is racist and sexist. One time he picked me up from school even though I can walk home its like less than a mile walk. Then my friends were waving bye and most of them were black, so my dad says ""you really hang out with these n word (laughs) why there n words"". He talked on how he couldn't get my sister a job cuz she is a girl and will only be eye candy. Then just a few days ago I asked him on how he felt bout my brother who is admittedly bi and acts very feminine. All he talked bout is on how he probably wouldn't have gotten fired from Disney if he wasn't so gay PS. My brother got fired from Disney cuz interns replaced him and they had to many workers already. Then my dad talked on how he can't even talk to him he acts to feminine and that he knows he didn't learn how to act that way by him. And I have been trying to reveal the feminine self by wearing jewelry and acting on how I act when im alone an listening to my music which is kinda feminine, I did this so my parents could see something was wrong and they would ask. My mom never said anything and my dad sometimes said to stop playing that music and listen to real music and another time him saying to take off that necklace I look gay but that was in a joking way I think. But I think I REALLY NEED A GENDER THERAPIST but how can I get one with my parents being like this. I have told them something I wrong and I think I need a therapist but I think they forgot. My dad was very concerned 4 me and wanted to help. I didn't tell them what was happening or I wanted a gender therapist. So any advice or any thing at all I just need help plz."

* Our projects are all [open source](https://github.com/NebulousLabs).
* The main product is a decentralized storage system, [Sia](http://sia.tech/), that works off a cryptocurrency we call Siacoin that [can be bought and sold just like bitcoin](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_sc).

**What:**
[Sia-UI](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-UI), a graphical front end to a decentralized, crypto-currency based cloud storage system, [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia). We're like AirBnB for file storage!

* [Technologies Sia-UI uses](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-UI/blob/master/doc/Technologies.md).

**Why:** This is my first large js project and I would love it if the project got more attention, pull-requests, and/or positive criticism/feedback! I'm unsure of many conventions I'm using, given the context of being a JS desktop app through electron and so a lot of my code is experimental and could use some polish. 

**Also:**

* I was the only dev experienced in JS at the company (a startup with only 5 employees/3 devs so far)
* I'm leaving the company to work elsewhere (just graduated college)
* NebulousLabs needs my replacement! **Pm me for details if interested**. The pay is competitive and not through sweat-equity!"

I've graduated with a honors degree in software development and I am currently looking for employment. I have always struggled with coding, I had a 8 month internship last year where I was put on a software test role which is something I enjoyed and done well in, but I would ideally like to get into an actual development role. I have been applying for jobs for the past month, and I have a few interviews coming up, one of which I was told will include writing code on a white board. I've never done this before and I'm quite nervous about it, but I was given a lot of tips about the interview and what to prepare for, stuff such as difference between encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction etc all pretty basic stuff. 

I thought this all seemed relatively easy to me until I sat down to revise, I cannot remember how to explain the difference, how to implement each or generally how I would go about explaining it to an interviewer. I have a lot of stuff from college that I have looked at, just basics like using methods, loops, arrays, event handling, sockets - I cannot code any of these at the moment. Even just writing Java code in general I seemed to have forgotten everything and I am seriously worried that this will effect my chances with getting a job.

I was hoping would I be able to get some help from this subreddit in regards to how I can go about improving my coding skills? Is there any books that would be recommended that I could read which contain projects and explanations, any websites that I can use which would help improve my coding? I know of a few sites which have interview questions but I want to learn properly instead of revising off something that I may be asked in an interview. I know a lot of people recommend creating a GitHub account and start working on projects on that, but my coding skills are so bad that I wouldn't know where to even begin to do that, so I want to get back to the basics and be a confident programmer. 

This is a long post and if anyone has read it and can give me any information, thanks a lot. 

TL;DR - I'm a graduate with very poor coding skills and want to improve, is there any books or websites which could be recommended in order for me to improve my coding ability."

I'm looking to start applying for a full time IT related job, but I need to update my resume. From August to December I had a paid IT internship that was fantastic (they loved me and there were many discussions about trying to keep me on as full time starting this year, but unfortunately it didn't pan out :/).

When adding the internship to my resume, should I list it as a paid internship or as a part time job? I was involved in a broad range of CS related fields during the internship. I worked a bit in Active Directory, interfaced with their data backup/restore system/rack, managed the licensing database for the company's font library (Universal Type Client), managed their Help Desk ticketing system, along with phone calls, and general user related issues (password resets, software/OS updates, software/hardware issues...).

Also, this semester I'll be finishing my Associates Degree. The program at my college is listed as ""Computer Science: Networking Option"" is that how I should list it on my resume?

I'm also not sure what type of IT jobs I should be looking for now? I'm assuming Help Desk, but since I'm finishing my degree this semester, I think maybe I should also look for something networking related?

What sort of pay I should be expecting? I just accepted an Assistant Manager position at my current retail job and was somewhat surprised at how little they offered me. I don't want the same thing to happen while looking for a IT job (my current employer is aware I'm looking to move forward with my IT career and frankly, has been super awesome about it).

There's currently a Help Desk Customer Support job listing that's local to me. It's listed as:

&gt;""first level technical help desk support in all aspects of the setup and use of a computerized POS (Point of Sale) system, computer operating systems and hardware, and other Retail Technologies""

Would that be a good place to start my career?

Any help would be great :D"

**GPU**: I need something with 4GB VRAM. This is almost the most important aspect of it. If there is less than 4GB VRAM, it won't work.

I   desperately need some advice and I hope that someone can help me out. 

My quick back story. I graduated in May 2015 from a large state school in the northeast with a BSEE. I have been working for a large defense contractor in a southern state as a Test Engineer for the past 7 months.  Initially I hated my job, it has gotten better but I can't see myself doing this forever. I have the opportunity to reapply for a rotational leadership development program that they have. Along with the increased responsibility, I will be required to get my technical masters. This would be online and completely paid for up front by said company, assuming that I made the grades. I would be expected to do my rotations within Test Engineering but I have spoken with some people and there is potential opportunity to rotate into an EE role. 

As of now, I doubt that I could see myself staying in the defense industry long term. I focused mainly on controls in school with some power and signal processing classes. I had internships with agriculture company and also at an automobile manufacturing plant doing PLCs work but had a bad experience there because I did next to nothing. 

Is it worth doing the program for the Online MS even if I plan on changing jobs afterwards and all the rotations could potentially be in Test Engineering, which I want to get out of?

Working on IS degree, just joined a tech startup in the healthcare industry.What are some windows of opportunity in the next 1-2 years?",Atraidis,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/41sid4/23_m_working_on_is_degree_just_joined_a_tech/,"Hi all,

I'm currently a Junior in college finishing up my degree. It's taking me relatively long compared to some of my peers because I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do for awhile. I finally settled on Technology and honestly don't know why I didn't start with it. I have a real passion and interest for a lot of the subject matter I've come across in classrooms and the work place, and started hustling hard core to get real working experience 2 years ago.


I landed two internships in 2014: a gig at a fortune 500 company and another one at a consulting firm. At these two places I did a lot of SQL reporting and learned a lot of data warehousing, analytics, etc. I also got to put to practice what I learned in school about system analysis, project management ( by watching projects being managed), and software development life cycles.

Around new years in 2015 I saw what I believed to be a window of opportunity to appeal to full time openings as a young adult who had been working full time since high school to put himself through college and had just the right amounts of work experience and education to be a good fit for junior/entry level positions. It paid off and I received several job offers paying $50-60k in the Houston area. I got hired full time in 2015 as a System Analyst. I made some good friends, learned a lot of life lessons, gained a ton of experience and had a great time. My best friend at work joined a tech startup as their Director of Product, and hired me as part of the new technology team he's building.

Right now I plan on easing off the pedal in my professional life and focusing more on graduating with a 4.0. I transferred universities recently so am starting over with a fresh gpa. When I graduate I *will* have a 4.0. I was one of those kids growing up that was one of those ""naturally smart jack of all trades"" or picked shit up faster or whatever, and never studied and cruised with B's and C's. I wore my lack of effort like a stupid badge of honor and eventually other kids who worked harder and developed real skills and habits for being successful cruised past me. 

Anyways, maybe a year or two after I graduate I plan on going for an MBA, hence the desire for a high GPA. I'd like to eventually pivot into a high level strategy type role and feel like my background in technology would help me in our society that just gets more and more tech oriented. I'm wondering what kind of good opportunities are out there that I could work to make myself qualify for in the next 1-2 years. Specifically, I'm still researching about and not 100% sure what benefit an MBA would bring me and what roles it would most suit me for. I know that management consulting firms pay well for MBA grads from top programs. Although, I have heard people characterize getting an MBA as ""telling the world you want to be a worker drone.""

Looking forward to any advice or criticism anyone has to offer. Thanks Reddit!

41slsn,2,2016-01-19,"[Question] Rejection after internship due to ""budget constraints."" Advice?",kubed_zero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/41slsn/question_rejection_after_internship_due_to_budget/,"I'm looking for a bit of advice on a problem I'm helping a friend out on. I'll write it as first person for the sake of clarity. 

I had a great internship this past summer in the Bay Area at a Fortune 500 tech company. 

After my final presentation at the end of the internship, my manager and the manager's supervisor had nothing but positive things to say about my performance and my project. In fact, I was even invited to work remotely for the team during the school year and was told that I was wanted back on the same team after I graduate in Spring 2016. 

All good news, right?

I heard from the company a couple weeks after my intern friends (who had started earlier at the same company) got their offers. However, I received a rejection letter from HR. After inquiring with the manager and the team, who in turn asked HR, nothing could be found out as to why this happened. The team told me to talk to them in the Spring when they'd be hiring based on their 2016 budget. 

I just recently received an offer with another company. Yay! However, I wanted to follow up with HR from my summer company to get a final verdict on the rejection, since there was never any formal reason for rejection. I had hopes that there might have been a screw up since I received a number of duplicate rejections from the company at which I interned.

HR responded that they wanted to bring me back into the same team but were unable due to budget constraints. 

It doesn't seem to make sense. They hired a bunch of interns but accidentally had fewer full-time offers than they anticipated? They thought I did a bad job but don't want to say that? How do I respond to them?

End of story, I really want to work here and don't want to accept my other offer since that means writing this company off, even if they come through with an offer in a month or two. Is there any way to get them to do anything for me in the next couple weeks? 

**TL;DR:** Heard back after internship at huge company that I was rejected due to budget constraints. What do I do?"
41sn2n,5,2016-01-19,"Switched majors, deciding on whether to take an extra semester or a full year extra.",enory,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/41sn2n/switched_majors_deciding_on_whether_to_take_an/,"I switched majors ~1 1/2 years ago rather than this being my last semester (end of 4 yrs college), this is my situation (bachelor degree for CS, hoping to be software engineer):
 
* Regardless of option A or option B, I will need to take 1 semester extra (1 more semester after this one, for a total of 4 1/2 years of college) due to course requirements and credits

* **Option A** - graduate after taking Fall 2016 (fastest route to graduate)
* **Option B** - graduate after taking Spring 2017
* I never had an internship before--absolutely nothing I can put on my empty resume.

Obviously the biggest problem is I never had an internship before. I have very little confidence in my coding ability and knowledge of algorithms (I struggled with homework assignments and I hadn't been programming much--it's really embarassing how little I know despite taking ~4 classes that involved programming my entire life). I know that I messed up but I have already changed my lifestyle drastically to commit 100% to learning programming so I hope anyone who can offer advice know that I am willing to put in hard work and am committed to programming.

The problem is if I take **Option A**, I can't really get an internship since I still need time during the semesters to really improve my skills.

 If I take **Option B**, I don't know what that means in terms of being able to land a decent internship (when should I apply? Could I get one where I start working for them during Spring 2017 semester)? I am thinking that taking 1 more semester provides me with internship opportunities that I couldn't have with Option A *just because of the fact that internship opportunities are for students only*--what do you guys think? An Option C is just skip internship and try to find something decent after graduation. I don't think this is a viable option but I'm mentioning it just so I can hopefully get a sense from you guys what this option entails even if it is a bad one. 

Any advice is much appreciated because I am in the dark here--I have no idea what to expect and I have a lot of plans that are probably based on false assumptions. I really don't want to graduate with a poor start that will continue to hinder or set me back for the next several years. I have been depressed over this issue for a long time especially since I told my parents I will need to take an extra semester or two. I'm not looking for words of encouragement and prefer honest opinions and realistic options. "

This is what I've figured out so far about getting a formal Comp Sci Education:

1. You will not get a job on the merit of your degree alone. Experience goes a very long way, so supplementing your bachelor's with open source projects or internship work can distinguish you from the mass of recent graduates.
2. It's important to seek out and secure an internship during your summer breaks while studying CS - they give important experience with real world code and may offer you a job if you're a good fit.
3. Form study groups and social circles within your CS cohort to tackle difficult problems together.
4. Be prepared to spend at least 10-20 hours a week coding.
5. Treat your school like a job, or a craft you intend to master. Your education doesn't stop outside the classroom, and it needs to be buttressed by lots of self-study.

Anything you'd add or amend to my list?

41va7z,5,2016-01-20,Something's fishy at my sister's church,MongooseBrigadier,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/41va7z/somethings_fishy_at_my_sisters_church/,"This is going to be long, so sorry in advance. But it's really weighing on my mind, so I would love some advice. 

So my sister is 18 years old, and she finished school in 2014. She did university for 6 months, but didn't really like it so she dropped out. She spent the last half of last year out of a job and directionless. She got a lucky break when an internship opened up at her church for an administrative/pastoral support position. She applied for it, and got the position. She's been doing it for a couple months now.

I'm just giving that backstory, because it might be useful for context. So, onto the problem. 

I'm not a religious person these days, and my family are perfectly fine with this. When I was younger I used to go to the same church that my sister goes to now, so I'm familiar with the basic philosophy of the place. Was never anything particularly ""heavy"" or anything, just singing songs and having an old white guy tell us something from the Bible. It's been well over half a decade since I was there though, so obviously there's been multiple changes in leadership. I've never really had much of a thought about the leadership of the church until the most recent change. 

At the beginning of last year, the leadership of the church was entirely fired (for complicated reasons that aren't relevant) and a new team was brought in to lead it. This team was made up of 3 people, a new leader of the church, and a married couple that would run the youth ministry. The only notable thing about the entrance of these people was that the new leader of the church was notably more ""old fashioned"" than the church was used to. He'd wear robes and asked the church to use ""thanks be to God"" at the end of prayers. But, hey, whatever. I only have to see him at Christmas (and Easter if mum feels I've sinned a little too much hehe.) And if the church likes him, that's their prerogative. As far as I know, the new leader of the church is brilliant and not at all involved in this broader story. But, you know, context etc. 

The two youth pastors are the real thing I'm writing about. I've met them a handful of times over the past 6-12 months, as they've become increasingly involved in my sisters life. It was them that supported her getting this internship, and have both been in a 'mentor' position with my sister since she dropped out of uni. So it's only natural that I would cross paths with them occasionally. They seem like pretty normal people: a couple of kids, an SUV. Nothing out of the ordinary. But I just could never shake the feeling that something was a bit... 'Off'. About them, about their relationship with my sister. It was always a little... Weird. 

The guy is one of those really earnest people. I've never once seen him make a joke. I like to laugh at everything, so our conversations tended to be short and awkward. We just would never make a connection on any deep emotional level. Which is fine: not my church, not my problem. 

I know specifically what I don't like about the woman. She has a fake accent. I don't mean this like ""she talks with a posh voice"". I mean, in suburban Australia, she talks with a Canadian accent. Except when she doesn't. She'll begin a sentence with her bullshit Canadian accent and end it with her actual Aussie accent. Apparently she visited there for six months when she was a kid. I'm not trying to draw any connection between this part of her personality and the rest of my concerns... But, like, what kind of person fakes an accent? 

Anyway! I'm easily sidetracked. These different threads all come together here! My sister recently went to a camp with the guy pastor and a couple of her friends, and it was my job to collect them all from the bus station when they got home. They all get in the car, and they can't wait to tell me about the amazing things that happened at ""Jesus School"" (I wish I was making that name up.)

Apparently on this camp, they were running around the small town they were in ""healing people and bringing people to Jesus"". One of them proudly announced that she no longer needed to wear glasses after being ""healed"" at the camp. She offered to do the same to me, but she decided against it because I was driving. 

So, that was intense. This is the kind of thing that I classify as ""heavy"". Not the kind of thing that I remember the church being like at all. I'm not sure where all of the ""faith healing"" stuff came from, but it made me suuuper uncomfortable. 

What made me more uncomfortable is the knowledge that this particular girl couldn't have had her eyes miraculously healed, because she didn't ever wear glasses. Like, seriously. I've known this girl since she was in diapers, and she's never worn glasses. Was nobody in the car going to mention this!? Were we all going to pretend that not only was this girl apparently cripplingly blind before this week, but the hands of some guy at ""Jesus School"" had cured her? That was weird. 

So then the pastor decides to have a chat with me. 

""Hey Mongoose. Do you have a connection with Mongoose University?"" 

""Ah, yeah. I study there."" 

""We just drove past Mongoose Street, and I felt God giving me a gift of knowledge to ask you whether you went to Mongoose University."" 

[Leaving space for dramatic pause] 

Let's talk about all the things wrong with this. Firstly: out of my five previous conversations with the guy, at least three of them have mentioned my uni in some way or another. He knows for a fact that I study law at Mongoose University. He's had indepth conversations with both my sister, my parents and me in which this topic has come up. He knows this, but instead is going to pretend that he's been given some important message from God to ask me about it? Just make awkward small talk like every other acquaintance in the world, asshole. 

The second thing wrong with this, was that as the conversation continued it became super clear to me what he was doing. I've had a couple of experience talking with ""psychics"" in the real world, and getting high and watching Psychic TV at 3am on a Tuesday night is my #1 hobby. So I've come to learn a little bit about cold reading, and it was super clear that he was cold reading me. He wasn't even good at it, I wasn't playing along so he kept getting his guesses wrong. 

He had a couple of wild guesses: ""has university been weighing on your mind at the moment, Mongoose?"" 

""I'm actually in the middle of my holidays, so no.""

In the end, he just gave up. But the conversation left a really bad taste in my mouth. Having experienced that, it seems to put a lot into perspective: 

This internship that my sister is doing was offered to two young people: the one that had her perfectly functional eyes faith healed, and my sis. Recently, a job opened up at the church for a worship leader, which was filled by another 18 year old. So there's a lot of very young, very sheltered, naive kids being brought in as ""leaders"" in the church. According to my family, my sister and her other young friends are also the only people from the church that the married couple actually interact with personally. They don't have friends their own age, they'd rather spend time with teenagers. 

Meanwhile, the guy has apparently been bitten by a holy spider and gained mind-reading powers, and also they can apparently heal disease by praying about it. 

I don't know if it's all hitting at once, and that makes it seem stranger than it really is, but these young people deeply, deeply admire this family. Yet this man is clearly not afraid to use his faith to manipulate others and fabricate religious experiences. 

I've discussed it with my mum a little, and she agreed that the family is a little bit creepy. 

I suppose the last bit of evidence I have is from the words of my girlfriend, after watching the new team of young people perform an Electronic Dance music version of 'Silent Night' on Christmas Eve - macbooks, electric guitars, designer clothes and stylish haircuts in tow: ""it's a little bit Manson, isn't it?"" 

So, help me reddit. Is there something to be concerned about here? And if there is, wat do? 

Thanks in advance. 

Tl;dr: new pastors at my sister's church claim to be performing miracles, and are likely manipulating the people around them using their faith. Is it 2culty, or just the usual amount of culty? "
41vbff,6,2016-01-20,"26/M, Accounting Degree, interest in data sci: Further education or certs?",needscareerguidance,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/41vbff/26m_accounting_degree_interest_in_data_sci/,"I graduated several years ago with a B.S. in accounting, pretty good GPA, but made a huge mistake in skipping an internship to graduate a semester earlier. I had trouble finding work; in the meantime, I continued to work in healthcare, gaining some experience in purchasing &amp; data analysis. Had trouble moving up, but over time I began to realize I may have gone with the wrong major.

&amp;nbsp;

I began taking classes to facilitate a career change to data science/data analysis; my math and comp sci background was pretty light, and I figured if I couldn't find a related career, I could eventually work towards getting into a grad program. I later picked up a new job with a niche retail business - while the title is nice (upper management, went with CTO), I'm not sure if the experience is relevant enough (mixed direct mgmt/spreadsheet wizardry/minor web dev/data mining/marketing). Pay is not bad, still feel it's not enough to move out, starting to feel like a loser at this point though.

&amp;nbsp;

My course progress has been mediocre. I largely held myself back with distraction (both entertainment and too much of a focus on work) and self-defeating thought patterns. I've gotten up to Calc III as well as a couple intro CS/Database courses at this point, but my GPA for the classes I've taken is god awful (several repeats/drops, could not balance out my work schedule; was working about ~70 hours/week during most of the last semester; I cut my hours since then to just under 40/week).

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I'm still feeling lost, and as I rapidly approach my 30's, I can't help but feel incredibly anxious about it. I passed several of the CPA exams a couple years ago, but would need to retake them; I've also heard that pursuing an actuarial route might be more in line with data science, haven't looked at the exams yet though. Several friends have stressed that portfolio items are more important than anything else, and I'd be better served just working on an independent project (I have a couple ideas and some minor experience in python &amp; C++, but haven't had time for it).

&amp;nbsp;

I need to make a registration decision today, but I'm getting cold feet again. Should I keep going with a few more classes? Maybe just take calc? Work on portfolio items, or a cert?"

I can guarantee that many other CS majors here will agree with what I have to say.

1. **Join CS or IT clubs**: This is very important if you're looking for a job or internship. Most campuses will have an ACM chapter or some other type of CS club. If your school doesn't have one, *start one*; not only will ""I started the ACM chapter at my school"" look really good on a resume, but CS clubs are great if you don't understand an assignment or you want to just collaborate on a project with other CS majors.

2. **Programming Competitions**: This is something I wish I had started doing earlier. Programming competitions look good on resumes (if you feel like adding them) but also if you win there's usually an awesome prize that you can receive (usually a scholarship). 

3. **Undergrad Research/Tech Jobs**: Most professors are going to be doing research on *something*. If you impress a professor by getting A's in their class they'll probably ask you if you want to research with them, or they'll probably say yes if you ask them. *Key Tip: don't just wait around for professors to ask you.*

4. **Ask Good Questions**: This is more or less for your studies, but make sure that if you don't know something that you ask. Also it's always better to know more than you need to know. 

5. **Ask Your Advisor or Fellow Students About Courses!**: This is fairly important if you actually want to graduate within 4 years. Some schools only offer certain courses during certain semesters, some teachers teach certain courses during certain semesters, so ask around about who to take and when to take certain classes. Most upperclassmen will be able to tell you what teacher for what class and which classes you should take at the same time. *Class pairings can be important*. For instance: If you take Data Structures and C++ at the same time, you'll cover recursion in-depth at the beginning of the semester in Data Structures, and then you'll be prepared to cover recursion not-so-in-depth at the end of the semester in C++. 

This is all I have at the moment, but I'm sure other CS majors have some useful tips as well.

Bit of a long story, but my fiancé and I are looking to become game developers together and he is now studying for a degree in which he learns to program and 3D model, etc. He's becoming really very good at what he does and I want to catch up to him, so that I don't hold him back. He is aiming to work on the more technical side of things - eg programming - and I am looking to take the creative lead. Before this, however, we would like to work for others and gain lots of experience. We would also like to be able to help each other with our fields and cross over when necessary.

I've been studying character and environment design for animation at home, and have studied classical drawing, so as to brush up on my anatomy, and I have now started a college course that concerns all aspects of game development, on a very broad spectrum. The course teaches us to be generalists, so that we can understand all aspects of the industry. Each student is required to undergo an internship during the summers of the course, in order to continue.

For the last two years, I have been trying to get into a very prestigious animation school, in which I have been applying to the CGA bachelor degree, where character and environment design, 3D modelling and rigging are the main focus points. I thought I could then teach myself to animate on the side, as the course doesn't teach this. However, this course is more aimed towards film based jobs. If I apply again this year, I am 90% sure I will finally get in. I love both schools, so I am having a hard time deciding what to do. Both courses are also 3.5 years long.

I should also probably mention that I live in Denmark, where the game dev industry only consists of about 300 people.

So, I have some questions for developers in the industry, as I would really like an insight into what you look for in employees and what makes a good developer:

1) Is a bachelor degree in animation more relevant than a dedicated game dev college education?

2) Is it more important to be an expert in a limited field, such as character design, or is it better to be an advanced generalist, who can work on lots of things, such as concepts, 3D models, rigging, animation and programming?

3) Is it possible to be self taught in areas such as animation and programming, and be just as good at them as somebody who has learnt these things at college?

4) What would you do?"

I'm a junior CS major, I already have a summer internship set up at the place I've worked since my first year(1.5 yrs worked there). I have a good relationship with everyone I worked with and I'm content there.

One of my parents knows someone at a start up company, it sounded interesting and I was introduced to them and ended up sending them an email about visiting which said parent suggested. Which I almost immediately regretted, because I didn't really think it through. 

At first I thought it was just going to be a casual visit but I get an email response asking me to send in my resume and also letting me know that I'll have a coding evaluation. Which in hindsight I should've seen that coming. 

The main reason I want to bail out is because my GPA is low( below 2.5) and I don't feel like dealing with another interview process. I had a pretty bad year and I was struggling with depression/anxiety the whole year, which I don't feel comfortable bringing it up as an excuse for my academic performance. In general I feel pretty drained of energy and motivation. I don't really feel like going through another hiring process/interview and this person knowing my family complicates things in my mind. I don't really want to talk about GPA to them and my parents don't know. There's no financial issues connected with that, I'm mostly financially independent besides insurance.

I'm mostly afraid as coming off as rude because I asked about this position and he responded in earnest and now I no longer want to pursue it. I'm not very confident in my social intelligence especially when it comes to sending emails.

I'd like to be able to not burn any bridges, would it be suitable to say something like ""I just decided to commit again with my current place""?

I graduated from my Master's program in Information Science in December and began working full-time in the new year. I worked there as an intern for all of 2015. I enjoy the work but they pay me less than I think they ought to although that is a common grumble across the office. I have no problems with the job that I wasn't aware of going into it full-time.

The real issue, to me, is that my girlfriend, her family, and my family all live 4 hours away in the same area. Initially, I had planned on living here another year and a half as my lease is up this June and thought it would be shady to leave a new position only 5 months into it so I thought I should renew it one final time. But I'm nearing my third week into it and it is starting to drag on me that I'm far away from all of them. It was different when I was finishing up my program -- I had something actually keeping me here yet now I don't feel that way. I didn't take  the job feeling this way; it was security and I still have a lease so I thought it was a smart move at the time.

I've read and heard that oftentimes people get one free pass on job-hopping so soon. Would it hurt to start putting in applications near there? Would potential employers understand my reasoning or would that look bad? I'd sooner be stuck somewhere for a short period of time than weaken my resume badly just as I'm entering the job market but I really don't want to do this any longer than I have to do so."

I'm a recent college grad so my work experience is based on these past few months and a few internships in college. My company never helped me move to NYC so when I first moved here I had to sell my car and most of my things in order to make the move. I subletted for the first few months and just recently signed a one-year lease on my apartment last week. 

The following week my Manager informed me that they were going to be moving the Office about 50 miles outside of NYC in order to be closer to clients. Now, I'm not sure what to do especially after I just resigned my lease (My manager was aware that I was in the process of signing a lease). My commute is a little under an hour, if I were to stay in the same place and commute to work i'm looking at 2+hours both ways. I'm a little ticked for two reasons. 

1) I took the job because it was in NYC. That was the draw originally. If I had known in advance of such a move I would have taken a job down south where the COL is cheaper and the weather is much better, I digress.
2)I sold my car in order to take this job. Now with this move I'm going to need a car in order to get around. I don't have an extra $2K laying around for a car payment or another $2K to break my lease and move to a new location. 3) I'm a recent grad and have little saved. After student loans, food, rent and other assorted expenses I have a few hundred bucks left over for any real savings. So making another move on my own again would be a real drain on my bank account. Overall, I feel kinda irked by the fact that the move seems to have been in talks long before I started at the company and the fact that they never told me about the possible office move sorta ticks me off.

So where do I go from here? I'm torn. Do I stay with my current Job? Do I find employment elsewhere? If I stay with my current employer can I ask for relocation and car assistance? I make pretty decent money in NYC for a new grad (55K-70K). My job has a lot of perks in terms of traveling and what have you, but I don't see myself staying here for the long time (5 Years Max). Any advice would be great!

I have never done any ""intern"" level work, and have been treated like a regular employee in every way (deadlines, responsibilities, etc) except pay. That sucks, I know.

My internship ends at the end of May of 2016. At this time, I am supposed to be converted into a full-fledged employee, but it does not appear that will happen for me.

My boss has been dropping a lot of hints that I won't be coming on board as a normal employee, telling me that my job is not guaranteed and then suddenly not paying for my final semester in school (more on this below) . She prefers to have contractors that can be hired and fired quickly, rather than government employees that are hard to get rid of. Basically, I've been finding out that I am cheap labor for them, and will not be useful once I can't be paid less than a normal employee. 

I've asked her many times about my future there, and have brought up my good performance (we are a weird experimental type of team that makes back the money we get from the government, so everything we spend and make is tracked), but she usually just changes the subject immediately or tells me we'll talk about it another time, closer to May. She's even cancelled meetings with me to avoid talking to me about the subject and lately (since I've been bringing up the issue more and more as the time approaches) I feel she'll do anything to avoid me.

I have no problem leaving, in fact, I would love to leave because my boss is not a nice person, and has gone out of her way many times to tell me that ""anybody can cut code"", and is basically rude and demeaning to everyone in my team. The problem is, I made the mistake of letting them pay for my graduate school (I got about $12k from them before she welshed on the deal), in exchange, I signed a document saying I'd stay until the end of May, otherwise I'd have to pay them back the money they spent on my schooling.

So my question is, if I will need to get a job at the beginning of June, when should I begin applying? I know the interviews typically take a long time to schedule and go through, but I haven't gone to one in quiet a while. Should I begin in March or April or now even? Also, has anyone ever dealt with having to stay positive and focused in bad environments? I want to do the best I can until the end of May, but knowing they're kicking me out, and that all my work is for nothing, is a bit demoralizing, honestly.

41ynht,1,2016-01-21,I've screwed up. I need a lot of advice...,the_expletive,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/41ynht/ive_screwed_up_i_need_a_lot_of_advice/,"Here is some background on me. I'm a 25 years old. I went to school at a good four year university and graduated with a B.F.A. in Graphic Design. I really enjoyed college. I was faced with many challenging design assignments, but I got through them and moved on. I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to be out and in ""the real world"" so that I could start doing design that mattered. 

It seems like I've always made poor choices. Not in terms of doing drugs, drinking too much, or the likes, but more on the side of being lazy. I actually landed a great internship in college, with a nationally recognized company, but the work that I was doing was dull and unfulfilling, so I chose not to stay on with them after the allotted time period. Many students took internships during the summer, but my internship was during the final two semesters of college. I feel like this really screwed me over, because I wasn't working as hard on my portfolio or applications. I was trying hard to balance my final semester course load with that of a part-time internship. When college ended, I made, arguably, one of the stupidest mistakes I could have. I did nothing. I did nothing all summer. I lived at my apartment with my roommate and didn't reach out to anyone about jobs. I had no idea the repercussions of such a thing. By the end of my last semester, I had a good portfolio and resume ready to go. I just wasn't. Maybe I was scared. Maybe I was lazy. Likely, I was both.

When the time came to move out, I chose to move back home. I wanted to move on and pay off my loans quickly. Plus, I figured that I would only be home for a couple months at most. It turns out that getting a job is much more effort than I anticipated. Charlie from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia sums up the situation perfectly saying, ""Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on little jobbies?!” To me it's always appeared to be a similar hopeless situation, where getting a job is easy, but getting a job in my field that I even remotely enjoy is impossible. 

Eventually, I landed a job working at a local screen printing company, designing and setting up work for screenprinting. A job for which I am very much overqualified for. I get paid next to nothing because my boss has no respect for or understanding of Graphic Design. After about 4 months I felt trapped. I was mentally tired after work and I had no drive to complete applications or improve my portfolio. I had no desire to even be creative. I just wanted to lay down and watch tv, play video games, or listen to an audiobook. 

I knew at some point, after living at home and working at my screen printing job, that I had to move forward. I thought that maybe moving out would help. I moved into a friends house where I currently rent a room. I have even less money to work with now. I enjoy being away from home, but my move was less than lateral. I thought that moving would help me to jumpstart my ambition. I envisioned the move giving me a chance to restart. It has not. My time is almost entirely consumed with either chores or video games. When I'm not doing things I need to do, I'm generally away in the fantastic world of video games. 

I feel like I've give up on my career right now. Since I've graduated college, I've applied for over 70 places, and had probably around 10 -15 interviews. I've also had several second tier interviews. Each time, I've been astounded by the lack of job offers. I was confident that I would, at least, be extended a job offer with a number of places. However, after the second interview, I have always been rejected. 

Regardless of interview level, I seem to receive the same response by the interviewing party. They all tell me that I have great work and they wish me the best of luck. This concerns me greatly. It makes me question my personality. I have difficult time preparing for interviews, but I've always felt prepared and well practiced for the jobs I really wanted. Yet, even then, I fell short. I tend to have a very reserved, even stiff personality. I would describe myself as ""vanilla"". I've always been this way. I don't act with a lot of flair and showmanship. My design work does. I know what I'm doing as a graphic designer and I'm not afraid to be different, bold, or crazy. I'm not sure that companies see that. 

Anyways, to make matters worse, my 26th birthday is coming up this year and I need to find a place with healthcare. As a fallback option, I can get a better job, that allows me to afford obamacare, but I'm scared. I need help. 

Ever since I started in at my current job, I've been using tons of free resources for job. I subscribe to glassdoor, indeed, and more. I even get daily updates. About every week I find jobs that appeal to me, but the task of applying becomes monumental. I push them aside for lack of ambition. I know that I will have to revise my cover letter to appeal to each place. I know that I will have to take hours of my time, to work for it. I just don't seem to have that motivation, even foreseeing my impending doom (that is, the lack of good pay and benefits).  

One final thing that I want to note is this: Once I get started in on something, I tend to be passionate about it. I don't feel that I have ever even landed a true design job. I think that once I get that first design job, it will change me. It will inspire me to move forward and to be a true designer. I know that it has to be the right place and the right people or I will just go back to making design my job and not my passion. 

Since this is just a long winded spiel, I'll break it down on things I want advice on. 

1. 26th Birthday is coming up and I need healthcare or better job.
2. How do I motivate myself to apply to new jobs?
3. How to land that first job that I care about?
4. How can I prove that I am an excelent fit for the job regardless of my dry personality? Or, how to I do a better job of showing the side of me that is less drab? (I'm really a mellow person, but I get passionate about the occasional thing)
6. How do I improve what I have out there (my portfolio and such)?
5. I moved out. I love it, but I'm afraid of not even being able to make rent. 

**TLDR; Screwed up big by not applying to jobs right out of college, moving home, taking a bad bad job, and then moving out.**

As a reference: My ideal job would be a small design firm, specializing in branding, preferably, in a location with affordable living. 

If anyone wants to see what kind of work I have done, I can PM you a link to my online portfolio.

I'm really, really stressed out because recruitment season is basically ending for all the good summer internships. The bad part of that? All the good full time positions seemingly hire from their summer interns, or at least require some experience in the summer. I recently had 2 interviews (one was for my dream position) but didn't get either. Dream position basically said I interviewed very well, but I didn't have the finance experience. I fucking knew I nailed all the technicals in the interview, but there were just too many good candidates who DID have experience.

It's especially tough for me because I'm in Alberta, where our local economy is absolutely terrible. Also, in this city especially, connections are literally everything. Unfortunately, I have never had a person/relative/friend actually willing to push/pull my resume for me. Well, actually I did have two referrals but this was just after oil crashed.  Sure, tons of nice professionals will give me advice (which I appreciate), but there is very limited value to that.

I am at somewhat of a crossroad, where the possibility of having my ideal job (full-time even) is somewhat being stolen from me. It's not necessarily my fault, but if I could go back I would 1. Try even harder to get good experience 2. Go to more prestigious university 

So, the way I see it I have 2 choices:

1. Try as hard as possible to get into ideal job: Probably work my ass off the next 14 months, have more awkward interviews why I have to explain why I don't have experience, join a ton of finance clubs, etc. Cold-call a bunch of fucking random people in banking, hope that someone will actually for once be willing to help me.

2. Just live my life. This means that I will sadly probably have to give up on the aspirations I once had, but at least I won't work my ass off for something that probably won't work out. I'll still get solid grades and stuff, but I'll just focus more on internal satisfaction. I'll probably just keep involved with the clubs I really enjoy, etc
 
So, basically, should I let go of my aspirations and just live my life? Or should I try to cling on to the last bit of hope that I have left, and put everything towards it?"

These past few weeks, I've been applying to some software engineering internships, around 30 or so, and I've received 1 coming up on site interview, and the rest rejections so far. Everything I submitted in the fall was turned down as well.

I feel like it's almost impossible to get interviews for the type of jobs I'm applying to. It's rough since I can't even have the chance to prove myself, as all I get are generic ""you don't fit what we're looking for"" messages. I'm going through LinkedIn primarily, as well as my school's job listing page. Do you guys know of any good online resources where I can find and apply to software engineering summer internships?

Also, what do you think about startup jobs for sophomores? Should I look at them as well, or just focus on established corporations? Most of my programming experience is in classes, so I don't have super expertise in anything right off the bat.

He pays in full for my tuition btw and he is willing to pay for my masters too. I don't want to do a masters. Doing cutting edge research does seem appealing and I might consider it but first I want to know if it is even realistic at this point.

I study Computer Engineering at a university that is ranked in the top 400 in the world by QS world rankings. It's in the middle east. My GPA is 2.61. I have 2 semesters left. Even if I get 4.0 in my next 2 semesters My GPA will only rise to 2.83.

Luckily, if I look for a job, I have stuff other than my GPA that may make up for it. I have projects, programming competition experience and a previous internship (and hopefully 1 more). I don't think my GPA would hurt me *that* much.

I don't think academia is for me. My peers think I'm smart. People ask me for help with homeworks and labs and stuff but my grades are mostly Bs and Cs. A professor who used to organize programming contests was disappointed when I got a C in his class. The thought of working on cutting edge research is appealing but I think I'd be too lazy to actually do well.

[x-posted]",UnicornToots,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4200cz/id_take_a_pay_hit_if_i_take_a_new_job_should_i/,"I've been in my current job as a Quality Manager for 3.5 years. I had two promotions in that time and have gotten 115% of my merit bonuses each year, due to doing a good job here. It's my 2nd job out of college; I was in my first job for about 4 years. Although I'm a manager level, I don't manage anyone but interns - I have a hunch they gave me this promotion and title change so I wouldn't leave. (We have a really high turnover, so someone like me who has been here for a while is more valuable as time goes on.)

At the start of this month, I recently switched to a different area in Quality but kept my title. I just wanted a change in the type of work I was doing, a spot was open, I'd worked for the director before, so I figured it would be a good spot. Plus, I've been bored for quite a while.

Well, last week I got an email from a recruiter that actually sparked my interest. I have a phone screen today with HR before I presumably move to the next level to an in-person interview with the hiring manager.

My issues are:

1. I'd take a 10% pay hit if I take this job. (Big con.)

1. I'd have a title change back down to a Senior Engineer. (Slight con.)

1. My work-life balance would be immensely better. (Huge pro.)

1. My commute would be 40% of what it is now, and I wouldn't have to pay tolls each way. (Pro.)

1. The job responsibilities are nearly identical to the one I just switched out of internally at my current employer; the only difference is that it's in a different industry with all sorts of regulations I've never dealt with before. (Neutral.)

1. They've been looking to fill this position since November, so they are likely really eager to hire someone with my experience. (Slight pro.)

If all goes well in the interview process, I'll likely accept this job. My two questions are:

1. Would I be burning bridges by accepting the new job? I just started a kinda-new position at my current employer and I feel like I may be screwing them over by leaving so soon after this switch.

1. Given that they are likely really eager to hire someone for this long-open position, and given that I'd be taking a pay cut (and they'd be aware of this when I tell them my salary requirement) do I have an opportunity to negotiate salary, benefits, etc. with them? I've never had to do such a thing before, and part of me would like some extra compensation for taking the pay hit. However, given that my title will no longer be a ""Manager"", would it be ridiculous of me to still want to be compensated like one?"

For the class that I got a C in, the professor was nice enough to offer me the chance to do some extra work in return for a better grade but I didn't take that chance. That course was also an experimental ""pilot"" course, and was never taught before, maybe that's why he offered a re-grade. Anyways, after that my GPA dropped from about a 3.3 to a 2.9

The next semester (Spring '15), I wanted to retake the 2 courses that I got a Ds in, because I hardly learned anything and they were required ""core"" classes. I didn't retake the class I failed as it wasn't offered that semester. I had little run-in with the police at a store that sells guns, and they sent me to a mental hospital. I ended up very-late-withdrawing all my classes and so it didn't affect my GPA.

Last semester (Fall '15) I did alright, but not good enough to raise my GPA by much, so I still have a pretty shitty GPA. Maybe I could've done better if I procrastinated less, or maybe it's just in my nature...oh well

About a year from now (after the end of the Spring '17) semester, I will be graduating. That means I need to get a summer internship or co-op by this summer. If that doesn't happen, I might kill myself. That might sound kinda lame and stupid, but I will do that cause if I don't get some kind of job experience in my field of study before I graduate, that will not go well with my future career prospects. Also, I don't know how I'm going to explain my shitty GPA to recruiters, and if I have to hand in my transcript, I don't know how I will explain the Fall '14 semester where I did horribly. There's no way I'm going to tell them that I was suicidal or undecided about living. Also not sure how I'm going to explain the withdrawing from the entire Spring '15 semester...

I don't have professional experience of any kind, and haven't done a whole lot professionally outside of studying, besides this little small project. I don't really have any ""strengths"" besides being able to draw better than most people. But that's not going to help me out. I'm a Computer Engineering/Comp Sci double major, and thanks to what happened earlier I've fallen a year behind.

Shit I'd rather not kill myself, but I'll do what I must."

Do I have a shot in hell? I mean honestly. I'm not a great ""networker"" and I get a knot in my stomach at the thought of getting to know people for the sake of career advancement. I feel as if I am deceiving people and fake.

421sv3,2,2016-01-21,Looking for feedback on the idea of transitioning career path from controls engineer to programming.,thr0waway3344,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/421sv3/looking_for_feedback_on_the_idea_of_transitioning/,"Hello Reddit,

I graduated from a state school with an ECE degree two years ago this spring.  I have since worked in the midwest as a controls engineer with a very large company.  I initially went the ECE route over CS because I wanted a ""hands on"" job more than sitting at a desk programming for 8 hours a day.  Ironically, I now spend a ton of my time filling out safety related paperwork and very little actually doing something enjoyable.  Other negatives such as a toxic atmosphere, working with old tech and being around large amounts of nasty chemicals has me questioning my future not just at this company but in this field.  I still very much enjoy programming and will often start projects or read about new things.  This is what is calling me to change paths to something CS based.

&amp;nbsp;
I am looking for feedback on the outlook of me transitioning to something involving programming based on my education and lack of specific experience outside of school.  My two internships were also controls related and focused on electrical design.  In terms of course work and projects, I have experience with embedded software and C++/Java, but those were more than two years ago.  I have spent the last few months starting some projects in my free time including an iOS app written in swift and a portfolio website in HTMLS/CSS/JS to serve as part of a resume.  I was able to pick up these languages rather easily, and although I am not a master and very much using a lot of googling to manipulate examples into what I want, I feel like it would be fair to list them on a resume and be able to talk about them.

&amp;nbsp;
How do you think I would come across during an application/interview at a place like VML for example (standard front end type job)?  I don't have any ""real world"" experience outside of college, but I can show that I am driven and able to learn quickly.  At my current employer, I was moved after a few months to be the only controls engineer on one of the most critical processes despite being new to the controls software.  That is something I feel could be worked into an interview.  This ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated, but thanks for any insight you can offer!"

How best to position yourself to take their place?,LL_Train,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4228fc/seniortitled_colleague_about_to_leave_how_best_to/,"**TL;DR - Coworker with a senior title directly above me is about to leave the company. What are some tips on positioning yourself so that the execs give you a promotion to fill in for him/her?**

&amp;nbsp;

I've been with my current company for 6 months officially, 9 months overall (3 of them as an intern). We're a small-ish marketing agency and I hold a ""coordinator"" role, specifically in content (writing). 

&amp;nbsp;

There are two other writers at the agency, and both of them are above me and hold the same title – Senior Content Coordinator. We'll call them ""John"" and ""Jane.""

&amp;nbsp;

""John"" is not only the senior in age between the three of us, but he's also been with the agency the longest. ""Jane"" has been here for for under a year – she was brought on full-time about a month before I began my internship.

&amp;nbsp;

We are a small office of *about* 25 people, and as I'm sure most of you who have worked in a smaller office know, it can be difficult to keep secrets. Office gossip has never been my thing, but it's impossible to avoid overhearing things.

&amp;nbsp;

There's a rumor circulating that ""Jane"" is actively seeking employment elsewhere. In fact, some say that she's practically already two feet out the door. She herself hasn't made any sort of announcement, but there are several signs indicating that this may be true.

&amp;nbsp;

My goal is to position myself as best as possible to ""fill in"" her role once she leaves. My workload will inevitably go up anyways, but if it's going to do so I believe I would deserve some sort of promotion. 

&amp;nbsp;

My concern is that I myself have only been here for under a year. The quality and overall amount of work I'm responsible for already exceeds that of ""Jane's"" (which is an entirely different story, but I digress). However, I fear that my experience will prevent me from receiving proper consideration for advancement. 

&amp;nbsp;

What is the best way to handle this if or when it happens? How can I avoid taking on even more work without receiving an appropriate amount of compensation?

My issue here is that I have recently become involved in 3 side-venture startup-type things in Boston that would all work fine with a Boston internship and would certainly provide a range of experience (and maybe profit later on) that look good on a resume.

Basically I'm wondering if I should drop all Boston stuff and go to SF for an internship or try to get one in Boston so I can continue my work with the side-ventures. Eventually I think I want to be working in California.

I work for a well-recognized but small consulting firm. I've been at the job for a little under a year and a half. Like any jobs, it's had its ups and downs. At the moment, I'm particularly dissatisfied with it, though, oddly enough, it has nothing to do with my usual gripes (which mainly focus around the complete lack of work/life balance or respect for weekend/holiday time).

What bothers me is my station at the office, meaning my standing in the eyes of my managers and the folks who assign cases. A little extra background-- I entered the company as a last-minute hire. I joined a class consisting of 5 other associates, one of which was not present for my first 4 months (working on a political campaign), and the other 4 of which were all summer interns together at my company the previous summer. I say this only because our system of case/work assignment rewards familiarity with managers.

Now, I try not to be the kind of person to make excuses, and I would like to think that I've worked hard over my time here. However, it has been clear from Day 1 that I was always a second priority in staffing. This completely hamstrung my development, which has snowballed a bit into the point that I am at right now.

I'm 1.5 years into the job, and afraid both to leave and to stay.

I'm afraid to leave, because despite my resume experience, I just haven't learned enough here. I'm also very self-conscious and aware of the fact that I am not held in as high a regard as the rest of my associate class. I've asked my managers and our staffing manager about what I can do to get better cases and better workstream assignments, but all they ever say is to just do my best to make the work I am doing perfect, which is just an excellent piece of non-advice.

I'm also afraid to stay, as, despite doing everything short of begging on hand and knee, I cannot seem to get on good projects or to put myself in a position where I can prove my salt.

So, r/advice, what do I do here? I know that I'm good at my job, but I just can't shake the feeling that I've found myself in a position from which it is near impossible to find sustainable professional success."
422rtg,615,2016-01-21,"Need advice. New ""IT admin"" at a small business and my boss wants me to install keyloggers on employees computers without telling them or HR. (Ethics)",Mishniv,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/422rtg/need_advice_new_it_admin_at_a_small_business_and/,"First of, I apologize for grammar and sentence structure, it has never been my strong suit....

Some background info... Graduated college in August 2015 with Bachelors in IT and have my Sec+ cert. From December 2014-June 2015 I served as an IT Intern for a nearby National Park. Could not find a job in my city from June - September, and already wanting to move away, moved to a more bustling city a few states away. Desperate to find a job ,with hardly an IT experience, I finally landed a job at a family owned manufacturing company acting as the only IT support for about 10 workstations and users.

Recently, my boss (owner of company) told me how employee production was down, yet everyone's hours were the same, and that he would like me to install keyloggers on a few machines and also capture Internet history. That it was to be kept between him and I (typical right).

I was initially taken back since I have not been in this scenario before but then quickly realized that it is actually a common practice for businesses to monitor the productivity of their employees.

He asked me to research different methods and that the point of this was not a ""gotcha"" type deal, but instead to ""audit"" employee productivity. So I went to research the different software out there. While doing so, I remembered about Acceptable Use Policies and how they are good policies to have in general but are also a good deterrent to misuse of company equipment. So I plan to tell boss about implementing an AUP and include that the employees may be monitored (I am a firm believer in letting people know they are being monitored) so they will for sure not misuse equipment.

The next day, I tell my boss my opinion is to implement a AUP to send to all employees and then implement monitoring in stages (low monitoring - internet history, medium - internet history/bulk up content filter, and high (spectorsoft 360 shit)) or something like that. And then begin monitoring employees after AUP is in place. 

Boss gets on the defensive stance and states that he has known people longer than I have and that his tactic is to not threaten people, that he should just have to tell people not to do something and if they do it they get the ban-hammer. Goes on to say that if they are wasting time, they are stealing from him since hes paying them to do a job and he deserves to know if an employee is writing an email to his attorney or checking his/her bank online (weird examples for him to bring up right?)

I state that content filters can be put in place to block any unproductive sites ( I checked firewall earlier and only social media sites were blocked). He states they already are and that he wants a keylogger to know just exactly what they are up to.

Now I am on a timeline to find a proper solution and to hide this from all employees and HR! If there was a employee productivity issue, shouldn't he be consulting HR first and then to IT if the problem couldn't be fixed? If checking a bank account online was such an issue, shouldn't a content filter be put in place so they can't go there? I'm concerned about unnecessarily obtaining personal banking information.

This whole situation seems very unethical to me, and there may be an ulterior motive at play. I need this job reference so of course I must comply, but is there anything I can do or just be controlled like a puppet?

Thanks!

Edit: I have not been able to find any information online clearly stating whether or not it is legal to do so in my state. Could I be fired for telling HR about this? (BTW, HR dept only consists of one person and we do not have a legal dept)                          Location: North Carolina, USA

At the beginning of last semester, my mom and I decided not to take out a parent plus loan in addition to my federal ones because we calculated I would only need about $500 to keep up with my rent for the semester. The thing is though that my parents are divorced and my mom has confided in me since I was young about her problems. She didn't have anyone else to talk to and I wanted to be there for her and feel mature listening to adult problems. Being a single mother, one of her main problems was money. So I've always heard about my mom's money constraints and I always felt so guilty asking for anything, so I just didn't.

Anyway, last semester when I started to need that $500, it was during a time when my mom had been telling me how tight money was. I brought it up once trying to feel her out and she didn't seem to remember what we had decided. I didn't want to ask her for it and I felt so trapped.

I'm not telling you all of this as an excuse, I just hope that maybe with some context you won't judge me as harshly.

I stole a wallet from the lost and found of the school library I worked for. I used the credit cards inside to buy some things I needed and some things I thought I needed but were really frivolous purchases. It just felt so good to buy groceries without worrying about the cost and to get things I had wanted for years. I didn't know that when the wallet had been turned in, my employers had used the ID inside to look up a student email and inform the student that the wallet was at the library lost in found. With a narrow pool of suspects (a dozen library employees), the police used videos from the stores I visited to identify me as the thief.

I lost my job and am currently suspended from school for the semester. I'm being charged with theft and fraud. My lawyer is meeting with the prosecutor in a few weeks to determine a plea bargain. He hasn't said much about the outcome but I feel I will at least end up with a misdemeanor and be on probation.

Some positives in the situation: I was never arrested, I found a new job before the prosecutor filed charges (allowing me to pass a background check), and I was able to leave a bad housing situation because I am no longer a student at my university (letting me out of my contract)

I go back and forth between hating myself, being scared for my future, and deluding myself that this is all just a bad dream. I told my mom about stealing the wallet and about my suspension but I haven't told her about using the credit cards or about the current legal situation I'm in. She told me that I'm not a bad person, that I just made a mistake, but I feel like a pretty shitty person.

I'm trying to stay positive and tell myself that this doesn't have to define me or my life. But I'm pretty sure that I won't be able to have my misdemeanor expunged (if that's all I end up with) for 3-5 years. I don't know how I'll ever get a job or even an internship, even in the competitive field I'm studying.

Please understand that in these past few months, I've had a lot of time to ""think about what I've done."" I knew it was wrong as I was doing it and I know it now. I don't want it to sound like I'm blaming my mom at all - she only ever taught me to be a good person and do the right thing. This transgression is due completely to my own selfishness and disregard for another's property and feelings.

So, while I encourage advice on any of what I've written, my main question is this: how do I come back from this? Like everyone, I've had some hard times in my life and wondered, ""Is this what rock bottom feels like?"" But as I'm sure anyone who's ever truly hit rock bottom has understood, there is no doubt in it, and so I know that this is my own all time low. Please help me find hope."

42355f,5,2016-01-21,"Interested in relevant careers, potentially switching from medicine",constantlycopacetic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/42355f/interested_in_relevant_careers_potentially/,"Hello everyone,

I got my undergraduate degree in neuroscience and went to medical school. I am currently a first year medical student in the United States, and I am increasingly unhappy with the school I have chosen, the location, the people, and I have doubts about my desire to commit myself to a life (or at least another 6-7 years) of medicine. I am currently taking a leave of absence and exploring other opportunities. I am early in my medical school career so I have ""only"" accumulated around $70,000 in loans ($30,000 from undergraduate and $40,000 from medical school).

I have always been interested in technology and have been a hobbyist since I was a kid making simple visual basic programs, assembling computers, or fooling around with SQL server for private game servers. I understand none of this has prepared me to pursue a formal career in a computer science related field, but it is at least important to point out I have not been completely estranged from technology. I committed to medicine around my junior year in undergraduate, and I didn't really take the time to fully flesh out my other career options. I would like to investigate some starting points for a career transition primarily with consideration to translation from my background (i.e. neuroscience or cognitive science) and income potential (i.e. I have to be able to pay off these loans).

Right now all I have to show for myself is my undergraduate degree, some related research, some medical school experience, and some odds jobs in between. I have been looking at job and internship openings in various locations, but job requirements seem so specific these days, and I lack many of the pre-requisites the computer science or engineering related jobs seem to require at a basic level. For these reasons, I have primarily been looking at masters programs that would provide an accelerated track to learning the fundamentals I need plus providing more specialized training for a specific field. Some things I have been looking at are: bioinformatics, human computer interaction, bioengineering, and analytics/data science, but I would like some other ideas.

Thank you for any and all help!"

I've been applying to all sorts of different companies (mostly firmware) but I havent gotten any luck. No call backs, not even rejections.  I regret that I didn't apply to places when I was a junior. I kept having this feeling that I don't know anything and I'll never get past the technical interview. I still feel that. Anyway, should I just delay my graduation until I get an internship? Or should I just graduate and look for an entry level jobs afterwards. I'm applying to Spring internships still, but I fear it's too late. I'm lost at what I should be doing. I feel like I should have an internship before graduating. Thanks."

[I love your plan to tackle the national debt. However it seems really hard to get people in congress to approve cutting back on things. How do you plan get congress to approve budget cuts to lots of programs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/422tnb/i_am_senator_doctor_and_presidential_candidate/cz7621k?context=5)|Thank you! The first thing you have to do is have a plan. I've written detailed 5 year budget plans that have spending cuts in every department. We have to reverse what's going on in congress. The left and the right make deals: the left gets more welfare spending and the right gets more military spending. It's going to take the leadership of a president who isn't afraid to cut spending across the board.

[IT’S HAPPENING!!! Rand Paul, thank you for taking the time to enter a forum with potential voters. It certainly helps us to feel like our concerns are being listened to and that we may actually have a chance of being represented.  It should be obvious to you, but I want to make it clear, that many of the people here are quite tired of politics and what normally comes with it. AVOIDANCE of questions/details being a large one. You would do yourself a great service and to this community to address what might be more difficult questions and to answer any questions you respond to honestly *and* in detail. Reddit users can get quite ornery when they believe they are simply being played with. Anyway…  QUESTION: Which one of your political views do you believe catches the most flak *from the general public*, but doesn’t deserve the amount of criticism it has received? Why? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/422tnb/i_am_senator_doctor_and_presidential_candidate/cz75ovb?context=5)|Foreign policy. There are so many people who misrepresent my views as being isolationist and not being for a strong national defense. We make ourselves stronger by not being involved in every civil war around the world and not being the world's policeman.

I always had a passion for IT and now I have the ability to pay for school (GI Bill) and go after my dream of being a Sysadmin. Growing up, I was always the ""computer guy"" to everyone. I would tear down a computer and build it back up just because I enjoyed learning about it. Eventually I decided to join the military and I wanted to try something new and get into aviation and potentially fly. Well I got to fly and fix Blackhawks. It was a fun job, but there was something missing. The passion and the drive. I didn't have the passion or the drive to want to fix helicopters at all. I realized that I made a huge mistake. Any who, I rode with my decision and still did the best that I could do and eventually got awarded a maintenance award by the manufacture Sikorsky. 

Well now I have about 2 months left until I depart the Army and transition to become a civilian. I have built a resume and I've been posting it everywhere I possibly could. I had the local workforce center help me in creating it but still no call backs. I'm looking for part time or an internship. Something! I just want to be surrounded in that life. While I been in the service, I been attending college to better myself, and I'm about a year away from my Associates (First in my family to get a degree woo) and I'm going to transfer to Seminole State College of Florida for their B.S. in Information Technology. 

Well I'd like some feedback on my resume from IT Pros who are in the field and at least try to get some feedback on what I'm doing wrong. Everything on my resume is all true but I do not have any Certs or Degrees just experience.

42472j,1,2016-01-22,Just looking for some moral support I guess...,moonage_daydream_,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/42472j/just_looking_for_some_moral_support_i_guess/,"Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster, new anonymous account (original account was made years ago and the username is a huge giveaway amongst friends/family)

Anyway, this has gotten overly frustrating. I've always suspected myself of having ADD but my parents refused to get me treated. When I was a kid, I went to private school. A few of my teachers would tell my parents during parent-teacher conferences that my mind was constantly ""on the moon."" My grades were great but I think it's because I've had a personal tutor (my parents don't speak english very well and they couldn't help me with my assignments once I got to a certain age.) My parents would get upset with me. My dad would blame my mom by saying that she wasn't stern enough with me, my mom would blame me for not paying attention the way I should and I felt like something was wrong with me. I remember feeling awful because I felt like I was the root of the problem. My mom would always tell me ""your sister studies, gets good grades, and is responsible"" as if wondering why I couldn't be the same.

I have to admit, I find it a little difficult to type this out because my thoughts are a little scattered or are going 300mph and my fingers can't keep up so I'm constantly proof reading. Apologizing in advance if something doesn't make sense.

As I got older, the problems grew worse. I had moved to a new home and started to attend public school. I almost repeated the 4th grade (which my parents now blame my teacher because they thought she was racist) and I kept missing homework assignments. Not because I didn't want to, but because I would constantly forget. I struggled with learning the material my teacher taught and my grades were awful. I didn't know what was going on in class anymore. I kept taking extra classes to help me in whatever areas I needed help in. I remember waking up early, taking 2 early morning extra help classes and 2 after school extra help classes. I was exhausted but the teachers I sat with couldn't figure out why I was in these classes. I knew I wasn't stupid, I just couldn't concentrate. So what's wrong with me? My mom had bought these 'natural' pills from her country to help me focus. My dad found out about these pills and was furious. ""MY daughter isn't going to take those pills. She doesn't need any of that, what she needs is a good smack."" He would literally hit me because I couldn't concentrate. He would sometimes insult me and say ""Why can't you do this right? What are you? Stupid? It's like you have down syndrome."" He was a dick but it seemed like he knew something was up. I knew had too much pride to get me checked out. I had problems in the 5th grade as well but it wasn't as severe. 

By 6th grade, my best friend had told me that her family suspected her younger sister of having ADD. I didn't know what that was. It wasn't until she explained it to me that I seriously started to think that I had it. I told my mom and she didn't know what ADD was so I explained it to her. ""ADD? What? No. You don't have shit. You're just lazy and put everything off at last minute.""

I had tried to bring it up to my mom again about a year later (since my dad would get so furious at me if I brought it up) but my mom said the same thing. I tried again about a year after that but I would get the same response from my mom. My grades plummeted once I got to high school. All throughout high school I've maintained about a C average. I've learned to accept my fate. I've stopped bringing it up and graduated from high school with a 2.8. (Nothing was said about my grades by this point because my parents went through a nasty divorce.)

Years into college and I'm still experiencing the same thing. I still space out a lot during school, work, and my social life. People would talk to me and I wouldn't even know it. When I think i'm paying attention to a conversation, they would mention something I've never previously heard in the conversation. Others would then ask or say ""have you been paying attention?"" or ""We just talked about it 5 minutes ago."" I would get embarrassed and say something along the lines of ""I didn't hear you. I have really bad hearing""

It's gotten to the point where my boyfriend would look at me and ask if everything is ok. I'm going to be honest, I'm kind of ashamed to talk about this probably because my dad has ingrained in me that ADD is bad and having it means I'm stupid. I know it's not true but it can be hard to shake off something that's been ingrained at least once a week from childhood. I recently told my mom and boyfriend that I think I have ADD and really want to get checked out. Of course my mom started this huge fight about how I'm lazy (meanwhile I'm a full time student and full time intern.) She's still skeptical but even then she said ""What if you're diagnosed with ADD? Are you going to drop out of college???"" I think she's scared because she doesn't understand it. I tried to get her to research it but she refuses to. Regardless, I'm an adult and can make my own decisions. My boyfriend is extremely supportive and agreed to accompany me on my appointment. I did a bit of research on ADD and found a list of symptoms (I know I shouldn't do this but I wanted to seek some comfort in making sure I wasn't crazy.) I even read that people with ADD tend to have trouble in their relationships. This explains my difficult relationship with my sister and mother. This kinda explains my temper. I showed my boyfriend the list and he immediately said ""moonage_daydream_, I didn't read the entire list but from what I've read, it sounds like you have those symptoms.

I've scheduled an appointment and am worried that the psychiatrist will say I don't have it. I know what I have isn't normal. I guess I'm worried about coming across a psychiatrist who's like my mom or dad.

TL;DR

I think I have ADD but my parents don't believe me.

Stuck on how to succeed in this field.,Financejobs101,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/425e3z/recent_graduate_stuck_on_how_to_succeed_in_this/,"So, a little about me. I've just graduated from a semi-target school. A 3.65 GPA cumulative with a degree in finance. Im now applying for entry-level positions and i am having trouble finding any that don't require work experience (something i knew, dont bash me). I wasn't able to secure a paying internship during my school years, sadly, which was my only option because of financial difficulties and having to come up with the funds to pay for the cost of college. Therefore, as of right now i have no direct financial industry experience at all. I do although have no gaps in my resume and have at one time worked 2 jobs at once. I did my best to try and show the relevance of my skills from my current job as best as i could.

My question basically is: what now? Do i continue to apply for entry level positions and hope i get accepted to one of them? Are BB's out of the question even though i did make some BB superday final day interviews for a couple of internships (which i ended up not getting). I feel as if i am an attractive candidate based on my work ethic displayed on my resume but the lack of financial experience i feel will ultimately deter someone away.

Any advice?

When cold-emailing boutiques how can I mention making final superday interviews but not getting them sound not terrible. I feel as if the fact that a BB thought I was qualified enough to make it so far could help some boutiques be confident in myself. Should I not include that at all?

I've had two other internships that aren't listed on my resume, but that's because (1) I really wanted to keep my resume to one page and (2) they aren't really software development experience (one was QA, and the other was Supply Chain Analyst). However, I do apply both through my school's application system (which would list these jobs, and my transcript) and externally (on the company's websites).

Note: For the Game Boy project, that is a project I'm actively working on, but because of school, I have to go at a much slower pace on that project. I'm just wrapping up my research phase, so I'll be able to start pushing code very soon.

(Ethics) [xpost from r/sysadmin]",Mishniv,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4263gz/need_advice_new_it_admin_at_a_small_business_and/,"First of, I apologize for grammar and sentence structure, it has never been my strong suit....

Location: North Carolina, USA

Some background info... Graduated college in August 2015 with Bachelors in IT and have my Sec+ cert. From December 2014-June 2015 I served as an IT Intern for a nearby National Park. Could not find a job in my city from June - September, and already wanting to move away, moved to a more bustling city a few states away. Desperate to find a job ,with hardly an IT experience, I finally landed a job at a family owned manufacturing company acting as the only IT support for about 10 workstations and users.

Recently, my boss (owner of company) told me how employee production was down, yet everyone's hours were the same, and that he would like me to install keyloggers on a few machines and also capture Internet history. That it was to be kept between him and I (typical right).

I was initially taken back since I have not been in this scenario before but then quickly realized that it is actually a common practice for businesses to monitor the productivity of their employees.

He asked me to research different methods and that the point of this was not a ""gotcha"" type deal, but instead to ""audit"" employee productivity. So I went to research the different software out there. While doing so, I remembered about Acceptable Use Policies and how they are good policies to have in general but are also a good deterrent to misuse of company equipment. So I plan to tell boss about implementing an AUP and include that the employees may be monitored (I am a firm believer in letting people know they are being monitored) so they will for sure not misuse equipment.

The next day, I tell my boss my opinion is to implement a AUP to send to all employees and then implement monitoring in stages (low monitoring - internet history, medium - internet history/bulk up content filter, and high (spectorsoft 360 shit)) or something like that. And then begin monitoring employees after AUP is in place.

Boss gets on the defensive stance and states that he has known people longer than I have and that his tactic is to not threaten people, that he should just have to tell people not to do something and if they do it they get the ban-hammer. Goes on to say that if they are wasting time, they are stealing from him since hes paying them to do a job and he deserves to know if an employee is writing an email to his attorney or checking his/her bank online (weird examples for him to bring up right?)

I state that content filters can be put in place to block any unproductive sites ( I checked firewall earlier and only social media sites were blocked). He states they already are and that he wants a keylogger to know just exactly what they are up to.

Now I am on a timeline to find a proper solution and to hide this from all employees and HR! If there was a employee productivity issue, shouldn't he be consulting HR first and then to IT if the problem couldn't be fixed? If checking a bank account online was such an issue, shouldn't a content filter be put in place so they can't go there? I'm concerned about unnecessarily obtaining personal banking information.

This whole situation seems very unethical to me, and there may be an ulterior motive at play. I need this job reference so of course I must comply, but is there anything I can do or just be controlled like a puppet?

Thanks!

... I have not been able to find any information online clearly stating whether or not it is legal to do so in my state. Could I be fired for telling HR about this? (BTW, HR dept only consists of one person and we do not have a legal dept)

I am a senior planning on graduating this spring. Posting on throwaway for obvious reasons. I interned with a major corporation that has a lot of prestige in my field last summer. Unfortunately, due to a few issues with adjusting to the culture, I was not given a full-time offer at the end of the summer. I was devastated, but, knowing I still had to figure out a work situation, I began to search. I've been fortunate enough to land several interviews with some great companies, but the dreaded question ""did you receive a full-time offer from X"" always comes up. I'm honestly not quite sure how to answer it--there's not really a good way to say no, of course, and saying yes runs the risk of me getting caught. 

Now, since it has been several months since my internship ended, my offer would have expired even if I had received one. I am wondering if a potential employer could verify that I received an offer, and if so, how likely it is for them to ask. 

I've learned from my mistakes and grown quite a bit. Unfortunately, that question keeps coming back to haunt me, and I just don't feel comfortable answering it either way.

Any help you could provide would be much appreciated.

I'm one year away from graduating from a B.Sc. in CS (Fall 2016). I have a data science internship lined up for this summer. During the winter I'd like to finally travel Southeast Asia before I start working full time.

How early do you think I should start looking for full time positions in order to have a job lined up for Spring 2017 *before I leave for Southeast Asia at the end of 2016*?

I've recently had two ""Big 4"" recruiters reach out to me and ask me to interview for internship or full time positions. However, neither of them replied after I mentioned my graduation date. I'm assuming this is a good sign about my CV (recruiters are finding me on their own), but that my graduation date is still too far off. Is this true?

Lastly, do you think this is a reasonable objective? I would really like to get into a ""Big 4"" company either for software engineering or data science/machine learning (if I can snag one of those jobs), but I'm concerned that it might be difficult to get an offer ~4-6 months before I start.

My CV will include this sort of content:

* B.Sc. comp sci degree at a decent university
* 1 data science internship in industry
* 2 years computer science research experience (+2 years neuroscience research experience)
* ~5+ machine learning projects and reports (in IEEE journal format)
* A compiler written with two other team members
* 1 website built 100% on my own with user auth/database querying/discussions/etc.
* 1 working app prototype I (and a cofounder) designed, secured funding for, hired developers for, and presented at national and international conferences
* Random GitHub projects accumulated over the years (e.g., simple games, large school projects, Project Euler solutions, implementations of machine learning tools to understand them better,  etc.)

427y50,37,2016-01-22,5 Simple Interview Tips,hawktalentrecruit,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/427y50/5_simple_interview_tips/,"
1.        Define your aptitude prior to an interview.
A hiring manager will ask questions about skills that have not yet gained in other jobs or through schooling.  If you want to convince them to give you a chance, you will need to describe to them your learning process. Before you go on your next interview, try to read through your resume slowly. Take notes on what skills you utilized in your past positions. Write out how you went about learning those new skills. Given the circumstances of why you needed to learn the skill and how long it took for you to master it. These examples will give the hiring manager a picture of you will handle learning new skills in the role with his / her company. This process works well for all categories of job hunters, especially entry level candidates with lighter experience.
Defining your aptitude has saved many people in a tough interview. If the manager asks about a specific skill that you have never heard of yet, ask them to describe what they need in more detail. Try to think your examples of learning new skills and give them the strongest parallel to what they are describing to you.

2.       Focus on a solution for the hiring manager
The stress of a job hunt can cloud your ability to think about other people’s needs. This can happen during the interview and cause you not to get the job. A hiring manager is under the gun to make a big decision. This could be the first time they hired someone and the pressure is on from their boss to make a perfect decision. They also could have made bad hiring decisions in the past and as a result they are now are “gun shy”. During your interview, you should focus the conversation on how you can help them do their job. How you will make them look good. And ultimately giving them confidence that you will not let them down. Ask simple questions during the interview to help recognize where you can support them.

“What is the most stressful thing you have to handle in your role?”

“Where could I help with relieving that stress?”

“What kind of problems could I help resolve if I was on board here?”
 
3.       Research prior to the interview and memorize facts about other employees
Research the company prior to an interview. Read through their website, etc…. This is very important. The next level is researching people that work at the company. Use Linkedin.com or Facebook to search for employees of the company. Physically write down names of people seem to work in the same business unit or division of the company that you are going to interview with. Also write down how many years they have been there and where they went to college or the type specialty they focus on. If you write down this information one time before you go, chances are you will be able to recollect a fact or two about the actual person that is going to interview you. Just showing the effort to find out this information will impress people you meet.
 
4.       Engage with everyone you meet as if they owned the company
Hiring managers will ask their team to vote on whether you should receive an offer. Not every team member has the same pull, but they have a voice in the decision. The office administrator, the intern, team members that would be your peers, and the other managers besides your potential boss may all have veto power when it comes to you getting an offer. Do not down play your interaction with anyone that works at the potential company. A quote from “How to be a Rainmaker” to remember when walk in the door for an interview: “Everybody is somebody’s somebody.” In other words, try to impress everyone you encounter as if they were the ones making the decision to hire you.
 
5.       Ask your key questions to everyone that you meet.
A major pet peeve of hiring team members is that you don’t have any more questions because they were answered by other people already. You need to have a list of simple back up questions for every person you meet. Again, the intern, the other team members, and the other managers all want to hear how you engage with people. Examples of simple questions that you should ask everyone you meet:

“Could you tell me more about your position here?""

“What’s the toughest challenge for new people at this company?”

“What makes people successful here?”

“How can I make a positive impact if I got the job here?”

As a part of my curriculum, I have to finish a 9 week internship at a company working with CS. 

Since I love programming, I contacted a company that I've worked with before last year, and had a great experience with them. They invited me over to an interview with the project manager and a programmer of the project that I'd be working on. They asked me some basic questions about my skills, and then explained the project to me. It sounded like I'd be programming in languages that I really like and am very familiar with. However, they said that if I accept the offer, they fully expect me to get a full time employment at the company after I finish college. I thought to myself, ""You're getting a job offer before finish college, you should take it!"", so I did. 

On my first day, I was a assigned a mentor, who is guiding me and giving me tasks. I had to do a lot of setting up and reading for the first couple of days, before they actually explained what I'm working on. The project is way different that what I got from the interview - there is barely any programming. It's just using a bunch of tools to design things that I don't really understand, and I really struggle with producing anything remotely useful (I have only been working for 2 weeks). I feel like I'm wasting my potential working on something that I don't like, and I don't see myself working on this after I finish my internship.

I wanted to ask: do you guys feel like data science is rewarding and intertwined with data science? If I were to have a job, I'd love to have the two married to each other and be able to do both. I wouldn't mind working on new computer architecture in the context of, say, machine learning as well as the algorithms. I'm still mostly undecided, though.

As for what I mean by ""engineering,"" I mean the traditional large-scale companies with Lockheed Martin and Boeing and such. I'm not so sure where I fit in, but my interests are data science and differential expression, static program analysis, design of computer languages and archtitecture, artificial intelligence, and educational theory. I wouldn't feel comfortable doing, say, only structural analysis all day or design of only power systems."

I talked to a number of recruiters there, one of which was X. From that experience, I got interviews with three major companies, one of which was X. Two ended up rejecting me, but X would not give me a straight ""no"". Instead, they told me that they would were trying to figure things out. I got the strong impression that they wanted me, but were having administrative/logistical problems.

Fast forward till today. I have been interviewing with other companies. Today, I got invited to the third interview with a big finance company, Y. They are going to fly me out (with other candidates) to their hq for a dinner and final interview. Literally two hours later, X calls and tells me that they are sorry for the delay but have an internship position available for me this summer. The problem is that they need my confirmation before the interview with Y.

Now, I really like the industry of X, but it is very far away from home, and I have a family, so leaving is very tricky. Company Y seems like a great place to work, and they also do things that interest me greatly. 

The way I figure it, my options are either to ask X to delay the deadline for my acceptance by a couple of days (allow me to interview with Y), or accept X, and if Y offers me a job, inform X that I won't be able to carry through with the internship.

What do you guys recommend? I could really use the help."

For example, about a month ago I had a technical interview for a company in Chi-town and we used google hangouts and a shared coding environment so she could see everything I typed as well as see me on video. She gave me a coding assignment and I couldn't for the life of me code that problem while she was there watching my every move, and I ended up draw a huge blank. I was mortified. When the interview was over I pulled up a text editor and ended up coding the entire problem perfectly in under 5 minutes. Needless to say I didn't get that internship.

I don't have issues getting internships, they're just usually from companies that don't have extensive technical interviews but the types of companies I ultimately want to work for I know will have technical interview like the one I just mentioned and I'm going to have to find a way to get over this shortcoming I have.

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before? How did you overcome this."

I haven't done anything with it since.

It didn't help that I was stuck in a small town for 3 years with virtually no jobs related to CS around here (or at least ones that I'm qualified for). All I've been doing is labor jobs while living with my parents. But next month, I'll finally be leaving this town for New York. I'll be living close to Manhattan, probably in Jersey City, but close enough.

Currently, my plan is to hold out for a few months working low-paying jobs until I can make a 3-month commitment to a coding bootcamp. That seems to be the most straightforward solution at the moment, especially considering my lack of work experience. The downside is that not only does it cost a large sum of money, I'm sort of wasting my degree since you don't even need a degree to attend.

Is there any other possible things I can do in the meantime? Somewhere within the city that isn't too expensive, but could help me make myself more appealing to hire. Anything that would help me get into the work force and build experience, like an internship of some sorts. (Except not an actual internship because virtually all of them require you to be an undergrad or in school).

Of course, actually getting a job would be the best solution, but I have zero hopes of that happening without any sort of help, considering I have nothing to show for."

42dcwo,23,2016-01-23,My story as a young entrepreneur,Dezzyn,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/42dcwo/my_story_as_a_young_entrepreneur/,"I am a 19 year old entrepreneur currently studying business at the University of Western Ontario. I have always loved creating things and have realized that the community around me isn't as creatively inspired as I would like it to be. Although, my buddy from Queens University (commerce) is the only person with the same drive, motivation, and interests as me. 

This past summer, Michael (my buddy) and I launched our product on Kickstarter : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/buddies/buddies-a-functional-and-stylish-sunglasses-compan/description It received about $10,000 in funding and a ton of support and satisfaction from all of our 500 backers. 

After manufacturing and shipping out all of our products (September), we focused our attention back to school (second year). During current year of study, Michael and I (my name is Elijah by the way) started to grow pretty aggravated with the lack of innovation and opportunity to create, at our current universities. This sparked our idea to put school on pause next year and move to a different country for a year to pursue our next project. After researching for many hours and studying other like minded entrepreneurs, we came to the conclusion that we would move to Thailand come August 31st, 2016. 

Before setting this destination in stone and letting our parents know our plans, I decided to try to reach out to some of my most loved entrepreneurs. This included Elon musk and Mark Cuban, which both of whom obviously did not respond. My strategy was to find the full names and companies ran or founded by the entrepreneurs I wanted to contact, and enter them into a random email combination generator that spit out 50 email combos for each person. I then sent out a short and to the point email to each of them, and waited for a response. One of them responded. 

The convo went: 

ME:

""Oren,

I will get straight to the point because I know how valuable your time is. My friend and I will be putting university on hold, and taking a year to create as much as we possibly can. It is our passion and life goal to avoid living a life without risks or adventure or uncertainty, and make sure we get as close to the fire as possible (entrepreneurship). Our plan is to work this coming summer to fund ourselves for one year in a country that is cheap, full of opportunities, and inspiration. My simple and only question to you, is which country you suggest we go to. 

This trip for us in the beginning to a life we've dreamed of but never found the guts to turn into reality. Your advice would mean the world to us and inspire us that much more. Please let me know what your thoughts are, and I hope to hear back from you soon.

Regards,

Elijah""

OREN:

""Thailand. ""

This shocked me. First off, a very successful person (Oren Etzioni is an American entrepreneur and professor of Computer Science and Executive Director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence) just responded to my email! And second, he just told me the country we were planning on going! This was a huge motivator for Michael and I, and really confirmed that this idea might not be so crazy after all. 

These last few months until finals are months for Michael and I to begin to design some of the stuff for our project and apply for some grants in the meantime. Although, the only obstacle left is money. We figured that our trip next year (just living) would cost about $9000 each. Any extra money would go straight to the product - and maybe to some camera gear for the documentary we will be creating documenting our every experience. 

The reason why I am writing this post is for some help. I am and always have been an extremely hard worker. The only thing I need to continue this life that Michael and I are making, is a strong summer occupation. I am heavily into design (illustrator, photoshop and after affects) and marketing, and want to work so badly for a startup where I can grow with a team of likeminded individuals and learn anything and everything they have to offer, to better equip myself for the year ahead. If you can't offer me anything for the 4 month summer I have coming up, I would still appreciate any comments regarding entrepreneurship or even some good companies or startups that you recommend I apply to for a summer internship.

42dlur,3,2016-01-23,Help,doglova258113,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/42dlur/help/,"I'm currently not in any immediate danger, but I'm just scared that anything could push me over the tipping point. 

I am an extremely unattractive female.

In elementary in middle school, I was blissfully unaware of my intrinsic facial hideousness. I knew I didn't look great, but I thought if I cleaned up and wore makeup, I could be beautiful just like my classmates.
In high school I become aware of my unattractive face which makeup couldn't fix. Everyone preferentially wanted to be friends with the pretty girls in my grade; they were included in anything, they were invited to lots of parties and never shunned as a social outcast, they had all the fun, and boys would do anything for these girls. They actually COMPLAINED about all the attention they got. 
I made 0 friends because I was absolutely hideous, but I didn't care, because I found something else on which to base my self-esteem. I thought I was smart and ambitious, since I got straight As and was captain of the cross country team in addition to holding leadership positions in several other clubs, and that set me apart from everyone else. I thought that later, my hard work would pay off, and people would want to be my friend. I could live a comfortable lifestyle in the big city, go on fancy vacations, and I could use my intelligence to contribute back to my community. If it turned out that looks did matter as an adult, I could get plastic surgery. It almost seemed that my dreams had materialized when I earned a perfect score on the SAT, graduated as the salutatorian, and was the only student in my grade to get accepted to an ivy league school. 

However, in college, things quickly spiraled downward. My first semester freshman year, I did relatively well. I never went to a single college party, I worked 16+ hours a day even on weekends, and made several friends in my major. Most of my friends were male, since I am studying computer science, but at the time I didn't see this as a problem.
Second semester, things went downhill fast. Classes got much harder, since now everyone knew college was harder than high school and no one can breeze through classes without studying. One of my male friends misinterpreted my friendly actions and thought I had a crush on him, even though I absolutely did not and would never dare to flirt with a male because I am painfully cognizant of how irreversibly unattractive I am. Nevertheless, he took this opportunity to start a rumor within my relatively small major about how I am a female sexual predator. Since he was popular, everyone believed him, and I lost all my friends. Even girls didn't want to be friends with me anymore. I attend a large college, but even outside my major, I couldn't make friends because friend groups had already formed and I am unattractive and had nothing else to offer. 
Since most of our assignments were group based, and I had no friends in addition to classes being harder, my grades dropped dramatically second semester freshman year, even though I was still working 16+ hour days 7 days a week. For the first time, I realized that I actually wasn't smart at all; the only reason I ever did better than anyone else was because I worked longer and had no distractions. I have no social life due to my genetic misfortune and my parents were rich, so they were able to provide me with the materials and environment to succeed. I reached a new low and felt completely worthless. 
In a glimmer of hope, my freshman summer, I had an internship at a prestigious consulting firm. I was placed in a project with one other girl, who happened to be extremely beautiful. However, she wasn't very smart; the only reason she had this internship was because her dad was a partner in the company. Even though I worked harder than her and objectively did more than her, in this male dominated firm, everyone was somehow only interested in her and what she did, and as a result she was able to take credit for most of my work while watching netflix for most of the day. When I overcame the shyness caused by years of bullying and tried to fight back, everyone either ignored me or treated me as an antagonistic nuisance. At the end, she was given a much higher performance rating, and offered into a full time opportunity. Even though I used my comp-sci background set up a system which saved the company over $500,000 dollars, she took credit and I was not even offered a re-internship opportunity.
By that point, I was convinced I could never be happy, or succeed, because of my irreversibly awful looks. I spiraled into depression and tried to OD on medications. However, I failed and woke up later covered in vomit with a massive headache. I also tried to strangle myself, but it was long and painful and I was too weak. 


Right now, I am a junior in college. I have 0 friends and nobody ever talks to me. I still work 16+ hours a day because it's what I've always done but it never pays off. At this point, I have no ambitions. Over the holidays and summers, I try to pre-study for my classes and read all my textbooks before the semester starts, since I have given up on applying for internships/summer jobs, but I still can't do well because I'm just not very smart. I have accepted my predicament as a loser, that life is not fair, and have lost touch with reality.

I would end it now if I could. Even after extensive research on suicide techniques, I still can't. I'm too scared if I OD, I may end up with irreversible brain damage. I'm too scared to try to buy a firearm. I'm not strong enough to manually end my life. So yeah.
The only joy in my life came from doing well in school. Now that the joy is gone, I have nothing to live for and nothing to offer anyone.

I'm sorry that was so long and wrought with egregious grammar and syntactical mistakes. I wrote it fast. It's ok if no one replies. I just needed to vent my frustration. And I'm sorry I just made it longer."

I graduated from Software Engineering in Canada, had an internship while studying which transitioned into a full time job as a Software Engineer here. I've been at this company for about a year now (including the time from my internship). During my internship I was working Javascript, HTML, etc. and I learned a lot on how to architecture things properly, trade-offs in various situations, patterns, and even communicating technical concepts/ideas to others from my team lead whom I respect a lot. However 3-4 months ago we were required by upper management to start using a new technology which is a proprietary procedural language from which I am learning absolutely nothing. The design, architecture, and everything is just given to us as input and we literally translate the design into code... I don't feel like an engineer anymore, more like a translator. 



This is my first full-time engineering job (not counting my previous internships) and I feel like if I stay here too long it will hinder my learning and my future career but I've also only been here for a year. First of all, does it seem to you guys a good idea to look for something new?


To me it did, so I decided it would be a good time to get my foot in the door to San Francisco/california because I'd like to go there sooner or later. I've applied to quite a few companies in the past two weeks but I don't seem to be hearing anything back.


I'm just looking for some advice for what to do in this situation? I have 3 development internships behind this one so I do have some experience... Does the fact that I'm in eastern Canada effect my ability to get a job in SF (I feel like this might be a factor)? I'm interested more in working for tech giants (similar to Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc.) but I don't seem to be getting interviews or hearing from them. I've applied to a few medium-sized companies as well but haven't heard from them either. Another factor might be that I don't have connections in SF so that might be hurting me as well... Do I just kind of actively keep trying to apply and see what sticks? I feel like looking for a full-time job is much harder than internships. 


I'd also appreciate if anyone has some time and who's good with resumes could look over mine and give me feedback privately.


I apologize for rambling! Thanks in advance. :)"

I am 17 years old and have stuttered almost my whole life.

I am in a dual enrollment college program where I take full time classes in college although I am technically in high school. I have already successfully completed almost 2 years of college as a Computer Science major and expect to graduate in 2018 with a Bachelors in Computer Science by the age of 19 (sounds crazy right!). I want to be a software developer in the future so I am looking for an internship over the summer to get some job experience, but I have a stutter. Whenever I speak, my face tenses up and I block on every 3-5 words for a second or two and I feel like it could get in the way of me finding a job in the future.

I want to know how much this effects interview process and what bosses/recruiters care about when it comes to the technology field. I am becoming self conscious of the way I talk because I feel like I wont be able to make it in the job field and I am scared of never being able to find a job because of this.

I genuinely want to know how big of a deal this is and how professionals deal with these kinds of things. I am scared for the interview process because as you know I have to speak and I want to be able to share what I know and ultimately get the job, but if I stutter and they don't see me as a good candidate, they will just hire somebody else.

I should combat this. Am I screwed, or do I have a chance. Any tips that you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

My problem is that I know that alot of jobs here who accept computer engineering majors essentially equate us to computer science dudes so I'll be subjected to the same coding procesures and all that stuff this subreddit is very good at supplying information of. Thing is my major literally did an intro to C and then a Data Structures course in my sophomore yr then the rest of the curriculum was Electrical Engineering stuff(the circuit stuff killed me lol) and VHDL programming for fpga digital logic stuff and embedded C stuff. Oh and operating systems

So here I am recently trying to review my data structures (most of which i forgot) and my most recent internship experience dealt with just Unit Testing some source code written in C++ so that was my only exposure to object oriented stuff (i learned it just enough to understand the code... I never developed software using object oriented design). My classes never covered the whole time space complexity stuff or hash tables for some reason and barely discussed sorting so im trying to catch up while reviewing the other things.

Data Structures was one of my favorite classes ever  so that really shouldve told me to switch majors but the whole prestiege with Comp Eng, convincing from my engineering peers, and ""what if Im wrong?"" type of thinking that kept me from switching... My plan was to take some CS classes as a tech elective but ol and behold apparently our CS department and engineering department are legit mortal enemies and both departments make it extremely hard for the other to enroll the opposing departments' students into any of their courses -__-  

So im asking how realistic are my chances here in scoring lets say a job that pays around 70k at the minimum in nyc? I would be living home so living expenses are nothing to me therefore i dont desire 6 figures. I could honestly care less about getting a job at google, fb, amazon, bloomberg and all those companies that are known for their competitive interviews. Maybe theres some other positions that dont ask as many data structure/OOP questions that I could look into?

I know this may sound like a dumb question and I may get ridicule for it but staying home means alot to me. It honestly means slightly more than my career growth to me. But ive been applying nationwide and am mentally/emotionally ready for the worst case scenario of moving across the nation just to get a job (since i am aware hardware/embedded system companies are all over the nation) but i will be extremely sad to do so....

On the somewhat bright side i got an interview with Microsoft(that im probably gonna bomb with this last minute preparing lol lets be real here. But i do feel extremely honored just to be chosen for an interview and will do my best to prepare) and am awaiting feedback from my interview with Qualcomm and am scheduling a 2nd round interview with a job up in Syracuse.

I finish in November this year.

I think teaching would be a great career for me, perfect alignment of my talents, passions and values. But I'm having a little trouble deciding on the best pathway into teaching.

My plan right now is to apply for **""Teach For Australia""** (Australia's version of Teach For America/Teach First UK/other) OR **The University of Melbourne's Master of Teaching Internship** (almost identical work-based pathway) to earn my Master of Teaching.

However I hear criticisms of that method of entering teaching as difficult, and a waste of time in cases where graduates don't end up teaching for very long afterwards. Also I'm sure there are considerations about being 'dropped in the deep end' rather than being properly prepared as well as working in a disadvantaged school as a good way to kill my desire to teach.

Basically, I'd love some thoughts on each of the following pathway options:

* Teach For Australia
* UoM's Master of Teaching (Internship)
* Regular Master of Teaching (Probably also at UoM)

Here's some info about the internship programs if you're unfamiliar
    
**Teach For Australia**

* 2 years of 80% full-time teaching (paid as starting teacher) in a *disadvantaged Australian school*
* Concurrently complete Masters units online, through Deakin University, *on scholarship* (no fees at the end)
* Apparently also includes impressive leadership development program
* Selection is highly competitive but I'm quite confident in my chances for getting a place

**UoM Master of Teaching (Internship)**

* 2 years of 80% full-time teaching (paid as starting teacher), potentially in a less 'extreme' school in terms of educational disadvantage
* Concurrently complete Masters units online, through Melbourne Graduate School of Education (Up there on the world stage for education research!), but not on scholarship (I think I'd have fees of ~50k AUD for the whole degree)
* Extra 3rd year of study while working 100% full time, with emphasis on research (keen to study digital education)
* Selection is almost as competitive but I'm actually guaranteed a place based on an undergrad scholarship I already have


I'm comparing these pathways to

**UoM Master of Teaching** (Non-internship)

* 1.5yrs of full time study for a regular Master of Teaching degree at Melbourne Graduate School of Education


I'd love your thoughts on the Teach For Australia Program and the UoM MTeach Internship degree structure as opposed to a standard Master of Teaching, but for a person who is *very passionate* about education, who will either become a teacher forever or else work *somewhere* in education (e.g. creating digital educational resources, being a digital teacher I suppose)

I know the syntax and the concepts involved in almost all languages, thing is that it's the final year and I've wasted almost all my time in shit like self-help/MLM (I know... I know. I curse those numfucks too). I know almost a little bit of everything (even stuff like after effects/music composition etc. etc.). I'm from an Electronics and Communications Engineering field, so concepts aren't a problem.


The problem is a lack of projects and internships.



It's my 8th semester and all I'm doing these days is exploring libraries, trying to learn them (in an extremely quick way-just the functions and all, not even trying to do anything on my own. Just following along the book and trying to complete it).


I feel extreme urgency and anxiety relating the career stage. I haven't even lived my college life to the fullest and now the end is near. I tried engaging with some people who have done projects on openCV etc. but I could clearly tell them using the c word behind my back as soon as we parted the last time (that just means no respect for a newb: extremely common among nerds).



I know deep inside that I have the potential and this is something I want to do (because coding in one way connects all the fields together) and all I know is the syntax and some common stuff. I've tried solving problems online but it just feels like a waste of time now that the clock is ticking. (It just feels like the 'In the end' song by Linkin Park: I tried so hard, and got so far; but in the end it doesn't even matter).



I just want to gain some project experience in this field. I'll later try to move to my native (electronics) where I know almost all concepts needed. I was part of the rebel crowd all along (the kinds who say that 'college me padhai sirf ghissu log karte hain).




And that has ruined me completely. I regret that stage and I want to get back on the wagon as soon as possible.

Recently a internal recruiter at one of the major tech companies reached out to me. The job posting I was linked said the position was for n years experience, with n being a year or two more than I've been out of college. I thought the gap was fairly narrow, as well as internships being a reason to beef up my years, so to speak.

I then proceeded to have a tech screen with the hiring manager that I passed as I will be doing the on-site in a week or three (due to weather). As part of the official process, I needed to formally apply for the job, at a different link than the original link, where I noticed it is listed n + 3 years experience which is nearly double what it was before! Reading over both links, they are for the same position it looks like - I think the former is more a internal/draft for the position since it is new.

If you consider each year in college a ""year of experience"", then I'd be okay but I doubt that is the case. People I've spoken to have said to just ignore it since recruiter+hiring manager have okay-ed it, but I'm a bit worried I'll show up, an interviewer will look at the years, and basically dismiss the interview on the spot (mentally if not physically).

The position seems like an absolutely stellar fit for me so I do not want to pass it up. Along those lines, I have not mentioned this to the recruiter to not second-guess them (and a bit of a fear of being dismissed as a ""Oh I didn't realize"" scenario).

To be clear, I did not once lie in the process. My resume and I were very clear on dates of graduation, employment, etc. 

What should I do in this situation? Just ignore and go to the interview? Inform the recruiter and hope it's either a wrong link or okay given my employment history?

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy CS and do believe that I have picked the right major for myself, but at the same time I have many other interests and hobbies that I'd rather spend time on after dedicating so much to CS already. I may do a little review to perhaps refresh a concept or prepare for an interview, but I never feel the drive to dedicate tons of free time to personal projects or things like GitHub. Nevertheless, I've still managed to land good internships so far while doing just about no coding in my free time, just projects from classes.

I will go through host matching like everyone else. Two conditions of the guaranteed offer are that I must be open to working at any North American location, and I will be placed in an unfilled project if host matching doesn't work out by the end. I figured only hosts in Mountain View headquarters would call me and I would probably end up there since it's the biggest location with the most interns, but I got a host matching interview with someone in New York.

Don't get me wrong—I've heard that New York is the most desirable office and don't doubt that it would be absolutely thrilling to spend a summer in NYC, but I don't want New York. I want Mountain View. Not only because I want to get the full headquarters campus experience with all its perks, and will be around my friends and family:

My family lives in Silicon Valley, so if I intern there I can just live with them rent-free and not have to worry about food, housing, relocation, transportation, and all of the other necessities that are non-issues at home. Google pays interns a $9k housing stipend (maybe $5k after taxes) regardless of location, but I don't have to spend it if I live at home. I'd get to keep it all. However, in New York I would have to worry about all of those things, and it's an expensive city, so paying for 3 months of living accommodations is a pretty big opportunity cost. 

As I said earlier, I recognize that New York City is attractive and this is probably the only opportunity to get to spend a summer there without committing, but it would cost me several thousand dollars. I'm probably not the type of person to make the most of it. I don't care about concerts, I've never been invited to a party or gotten wasted (if that's a thing in NY), stuff like that. It'd be cool to venture out to explore the skyscrapers and stuff like Times Square, but I'd probably stay at home on my computer all the time. I heard New York has the opposite gender ratio of SJ/SF (not that I've noticed), but I've never had a girlfriend and probably wouldn't know where to find one.

Now, I don't actually *need* all the money, as my parents are financially well-off and could support/assist me, but I'm a greedy little bitch who likes money, and as much of it as possible. People also say things the gist of which is it doesn't matter which office you get, Google is Google, try to find the best project. Really the project is the main thing making me hesitate; I don't know how effective their host matching system is, but I feel like whoever reaches out to interview me after seeing my skills and experiences probably thinks I'd be a pretty good fit for their project, and vice-versa. I wouldn't want to give it up if nothing else aligns at all. 

Of course, all this only matters (for me, at least) if the host is happy with me and offers the opportunity to join their team in NYC. As of now I haven't even had the interview yet and am hugely overthinking things, but it seemed like the recruiter wants me to decide shortly after the interview so I'm posting proactively. If the interview goes well, I'll see how interesting the project sounds and decide what to say from there.

Can you tell me about intellectual property rights and part time interns? 

These events took place in the United States, in Oregon. 

My situation is this: 

I was hired as an intern at a large company where software is not their primary concern, for a specific job: design and build a web-based tool for them.

I was hired by a department that did not usually hire software/computer science interns, but needed one to do this specific job. 

My supervisor has now left that company for a similar one.
We still communicate, and she has let me know that she wants to buy the tool from her previous company (although there is no love lost between her and the company). 

I retain the source code for the tool, and would like to sell it to her new company (in a license-type agreement, retaining intellectual property rights). 

My current software job has a long contract that discussed intellectual property, do not compete, and other things. 
I do not have any memory of anything similar in my intern paperwork, but I also don't have a copy of it. 
I was a part-time intern, and did not receive benefits. 

Do I own this piece of software, to sell or redistribute?

Thank you for any guidance you can provide on this matter.

The next class I would take is Advanced Computer Science, which is a college class which can earn college credits.

Our computer science teacher tells us that if we take the advanced class we can get internships right out of high school. I have a few career paths in mind, and this is one of them.

What I'm wondering about is what the career/internship is like? Also, don't sugar coat things, just straight up tell me. I think programming is fun and I enjoy it quite a bit but from what I've heard the career can be pretty dismal. 

Thanks in advance!"

I'm a Junior in college applying for summer internships. I've gotten several interviews and a handful of disappointing offers from companies that, during the interview process, I decided I didn't want to work for. I haven't gotten interviews with any whales (Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Riot Games, etc.), much to my disappointment. I think I need to circle back on my resume and how I approach applications honestly, but I digress.

I currently work (roughly) 3/4 time doing software development for my university. This job was listed on their website; I emailed the hiring manager, interviewed, and got the job. It wasn't placed through Career Services or anything like that. I've been in my current position for nearly 2 years while being a full-time student.

Additionally, I have two other software development jobs (one being an internship out of high school) that I list on my resume.

My question is this: Should I be looking for outside internships more aggressively? I'm looking to impress future employers, but I've been operating under the assumption that my current level of work experience would be enough. Given the lackluster response I've been getting from large organizations, I feel like this might not be the case. I've been limiting applications I send out to places I really want to work at, as my current position might be gone when I return after summer. Should I be looking for more diversified work rather than being content with my current position and aiming high? I'm hesitant to take a lackluster internship and vacate my current position, since it helps with rent and groceries.

I have a few concerns with sticking with a single position for too long as well; I'm working with the .NET stack right now, and I worry that I might look shackled (?) to it from an employer's perspective. I'm certainly not; this just happened to be the best paying, most convenient job I've applied for since I started school. However, that doesn't mean a hiring manager sees it that way. Can anyone comment on this aspect?

Also, if you think it might be a writing issue (eg. I come off as pretentious or overconfident), please let me know. I'm terrible at analyzing my own writing and try to be as matter-of-fact as possible, but people have told me I do that sometimes. I'm working on it.

Thanks everyone. Please let me know if you need/want any other information."

I also want to make it clear that I am expecting a good salary, not 500 a month or something. As a lot of companies outside of north america pay interns low salaries, I think this is important to tell them.

So should I send companies an email a few months before the jobmine process starts, including that I need a final decision before date X, and I expect a salary above $y? or is that too blunt?

Currently, I have free tuition and make around $5000 every semester from scholarships. After completing around ~120 credit hours (3.5 years) for Supply Chain Management, I decided I didn't enjoy it so I changed my major to Computer Science. Just to note, I have a 3.75 cumulative GPA. I applied to UIUC and was just notified today of my admission denial. It was my dream to attend UIUC, so I'm kind of devastated and not sure what to do right now. (I didn't apply to any other schools because I was confident on being accepted to UIUC. Turns out I got denied because I didn't have enough prerequisite courses completed.)

So far, I have completed the basic CS courses as follows:    
- Data Structures I   
- Data Structures II (current)   
- Calculus I   
- Calculus II (current)   
- Discrete Math

My school has a pretty poor rep, and doesn't do much for career services. For example, there is a career fair next week with ~50 companies attending and not one company had a software development internship. Also, the CS classes, from what I've seen so far, seem like they aren't the best. I feel like staying here holding me back.

I have seen a trend of schools not accepting transfer students with over a certain amount of credit hours, which is a problem for me. Since I am making money from the school, it is making the decision to transfer more difficult. I haven't found many schools around the Illinois area that have a good CS program and aren't upwards of $35,000/yr. 

**Is it worth applying to other schools in the Illinois area, or should I remain at my current institution? Recommendations for schools would be appreciated if suggesting to transfer.**"

HR from company 1 told me I will be getting the official offer soon, will it be wrong for me to tell them at that point that I need an extension because I haven't finished interviewing everywhere? I have already received the offer details verbally like pay, important dates, team, etc.

Is the 3-year A+ certification worth my time and money or should I go straight to studying CCENT and hope to get an entry-level Help Desk/Desktop Support job without the A+?
--------------------------
I am a recent Networking grad (minor in I.S.) and have been applying at entry-level IT jobs for the past month. Not having a ton of luck mainly because of my lack of experience (only real I.T. experience came from an internship) and no certifications (my opinion). I did extremely well in school (3.705 GPA and class scholar) from hard work but am noticing that my education doesn't really mean squat in landing a job in I.T. because even some of these entry-level jobs require previous experience and certifications which I lack.

I think studying strictly networking (even though I took CS courses too) may be limiting my job search.

ANYWAY, with me applying for entry-level jobs (Help Desk Support, Desktop Support, Technical Support), should I try to go for an A+ certification? I think it might help me get one of those jobs. My goal is to eventually be a Network Engineer but I'm realizing that there aren't really any network entry-level jobs to help my way there, and some others on Reddit have told me I will need to start at Help Desk or something similar and start my career path from there.

Or can I get a Help Desk job (or Desktop Support) without the A+ certification? I mainly ask since it's expensive to take both tests, they still take a lot of time to study for, and they do expire after 3 years.

I eventually want to get my CCENT/CCNA but I feel that would take longer to prepare for and would love to be able to start on it right away and skip the A+ now.

The program is very econometrics heavy and I chose it mainly to improve upon my technical skills for help in applying to jobs in the energy sector (my under grad studies relate to this). 

I was also lucky enough to be offered a research assistant ship, so school is paid for and I receive a stipend which is fantastic. Per this agreement I am supposed to work with my advisor on his research, TA, etc. Back in October I was asking my advisor what usually occurs for students in this program over summer, as our contracts only last 9 months (September - May). He was saying that most students have a temporary contract to work on their research for a thesis over summer, and specifically for me I'll have to stay in town under a separate summer contract to perform experiments for research pertaining to my thesis. 

This is all well and good, and obviously I'm lucky enough to be paid, but part of me really wishes that I had the opportunity to apply to internships outside of schooling. I do not wish to stay in academia and it worries me that I haven't had a big internship on my resume, even during undergrad. 

So a few questions i have, is it possible that I'll be able to project this research assistantship positively for a government or private sector job a year down the line when starting my search? Has anyone else had experience using a research assistantship on their resume or Interview?

Hey /r/cscareerquestions! Long time lurker and I feel this is a good place to vent and seek some advice on a problem I've been facing.

A bit about myself: I've finished my second year studying software engineering/commerce at a top university in Australia and I managed to land an internship at a startup over the summer break.

I'm a part of a relatively small dev. group. Everyone on the team is very tight knit and it's great to work with them. I have guidance from a very very smart lead dev. I look up to him because of his expertise. When I mention the fact that I'm working as a dev for a startup, my friends exclaim: ""*Oh! That's so cool. You'll have so much work to do and you will have a good grounding basis for many different types of technology!*""

I mean, I should feel lucky, right?

**I don't**. Sometimes I don't think I have a real job - I feel under-utilised to an extent. I'm just doing bitch work and wasting most of the day. I've gotten to the point where I sit at work and think about what my degree entails me with and my future as a software engineer. Am I just going to be making useless features for products all my life? Designing and implementing features just so 'Suzie from finance can click 3 buttons less than she already does'.  Analysing and writing up test cases, moving cards from one agile column to another. Yada yada yada.

Then I tell myself: *Maybe it's just THIS company. Maybe if I worked at some place like Google, I'm sure I'll feel much more satisfied!!* But I ask around those who've worked at big companies like Google and their reactions echo those in **[this article](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worst-things-about-working-at-google-2015-2#/#they-can-hire-the-very-best-people-so-everyone-is-overqualified-1)**.

It doesn't stop there. I tell myself: *Maybe it's just Australia. I'm sure I'll feel much more satisfied if I work @ the marvellous Silicon Valley! Gosh how cool would that be?!?!?!*  But, keeping up with tech news, it looks like there's going to be **[trouble](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/22/silicon-valley-500-startups-tech-companies)** this year with startups with no viable source of income. Is it even worth attempting to dream? The industry feels very volatile.

The bottom line is I am young, lost, underwhelmed and disillusioned at the moment - both at my internship and in the tech industry.

In need of some counsel.

42rylx,4,2016-01-26,First year grad student a little worried about researching and not interning over summer. (X-post r/jobs),Akronn,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/42rylx/first_year_grad_student_a_little_worried_about/,"Hi all, I'm currently a first year graduate student working towards an MS in Applied Economics. The program is very econometrics heavy and I chose it mainly to improve upon my technical skills for help in applying to jobs in the energy sector (my under grad studies relate to this). 

I was also lucky enough to be offered a research assistant ship, so school is paid for and I receive a stipend which is fantastic. Per this agreement I am supposed to work with my advisor on his research, TA, etc. Back in October I was asking my advisor what usually occurs for students in this program over summer, as our contracts only last 9 months (September - May). He was saying that most students have a temporary contract to work on their research for a thesis over summer, and specifically for me I'll have to stay in town under a separate summer contract to perform experiments for research pertaining to my thesis. 

This is all well and good, and obviously I'm lucky enough to be paid, but part of me really wishes that I had the opportunity to apply to internships outside of schooling. I do not wish to stay in academia and it worries me that I haven't had a big internship on my resume, even during undergrad. 

So a few questions i have, is it possible that I'll be able to project this research assistantship positively for a government or private sector job a year down the line when starting my search? Has anyone else had experience using a research assistantship on their resume or Interview? 

Hopefully I'm stressing out over nothing but its been on my mind a bunch the past few months..."

If you got an internship freshmen year, I hope you won't mind answering a few questions that I have on how you did it. I included the answers to my own questions as a comparison to you guys to see if I'm on the right track, or am doing something wrong?

* How long have you been programming? What programming skills did you have?

I started programming in AP Computer Science senior year, so I only have 18 months worth of experience. However, I use CodeAcademy in my spare time and I learned how to use Python, HTML, Javascript, and am working on Angular right now. 



* What were some of the projects that you had?

As of now, I developed a small game on Unity and developed two IOS apps as a student of Codepath University(IOS app development course).



* What extracurriculars do you have?

I'm part of my school's ACM group, programming team, and software engineering club. No leadership positions though.

* Any previous job/work experiences?

I never had a paid job before, but in high school, I obtained roughly 400 community service hours, some of which involved tutoring students in math club, and volunteering at local and state math competitions. I highlighted this in my resume, though I might feel like its irrelevant.



* How many companies did you talk to at career fair/applied online? How many interviews did you get? How many acceptances?

I talked to maybe 15-20, no interviews.



* Did you remain in contact with the recruiters after the job fair? Did you have any friends who interned with them before that recommended you?

I never kept in contact with any recruiters, mainly because I forget their name. I feel like its kinda important. I also don't have many recommendations, mainly due to a lack of friends :/



* Side question: At job fairs, how long are your conversations with recruiters? Have you ever felt you were lied to by a recruiter, just to send you away?

For me, the maximum amount of attention a recruiter will give me is like 3 minutes. I can see that a decent amount of recruiters lose their smile when I tell them I'm a freshmen, and try to make it less than a minute. My freshmen friends also tell me which companies are looking for freshmen, and I often notice that when they hold a conversation with the recruiter, they can hook them on for 5+ minutes, but when I talk to the same recruiter, they say they aren't looking for freshmen. This happened twice so far, and I feel like I'm being lied to just to be driven away.

Anyway, I wanna hear how you guys managed to do it."

My problem is that I got hit hard by the recession-- right out of college-- and I ended up having to take a lot of low-skill, temp-hell jobs to pay the bills.  And since that's the only thing I had ever done, it's the only kind of thing people would give me a shot at doing, and now I'm in a recursive loop of undemanding jobs I loathe with every fiber of my being.  I need out, badly, but I also need *up.*

I know that the traditional path to progressive responsibility is being willing to take on more tasks, but I have had jobs that actively discourage that.  For example, my first job after college, as a document clerk for a large corporate law firm, we had departments for everything.  Roles were very rigidly defined, and they didn't *want* document clerks to try to, say, cross-train in the law library, or get actively mentored by paralegals so they could take on more complex tasks.  A lot of people struggled with the compartmentalization, and as I came to find out from a number of attorneys, the firm had high turnover related to this (and other) management practice and lack of departmental cooperation/communication.  When they started shedding support staff, us paid interns were the first to go, and that left me with just shy of a year's experience doing very, very low-level clerical tasks (Plus a little over a year as a volunteer with the DA's office, but...volunteer).

I got right on the job hunt applying to anything I could find, anything I could do, and...it was 2.5 years of demoralizing nothing.  Eventually, I got assigned to an environmental consulting/testing company through a temp agency, again doing low-skill clerical stuff.  The office manager there practiced ""divide and conquer,"" and fought the scientists every time they requested that I get OSHA training (So I could collect field samples), and the senior admins when they wanted to give me their non-accounting tasks so I could move into more of an office manager role.  I was there for a year and a half and made no grievous errors; my coworkers respected me and really did try to help me expand my role.  But the office manager eliminated my position behind everyone's back, and didn't tell me when I came in and started work that Monday.  I found out when my temp agency called me, more than an hour into the day, and told me what she'd done.  They told me in our meeting that they had not had any complaints, but that she cited ""reorganization"" as a reason for eliminating the position.

So I got back on the temp-hell rollercoaster, and picked up an assignment here and there, all short-term, all very low-skill clerical stuff.  I also picked up some freelance work as a set PA for an ad agency, which I was extremely good at, and which I like much more than dead-end desk work.  Eventually, I ended up in my current position as the front-desk person/bookkeeper (No formal training, I'm just good at being broke) for a small specialty construction business.  There is nowhere for me to go here, even if I wanted to stay, which I emphatically do not.  Every time I have tried to implement better practices, my asshole boss blocks me (Which he does to everyone, to be fair), and really, there's not much extra for anyone in a business this small.  In fact, no one has ever left this company for a better one, despite trying, because our roles are so limited and our reputation so bad.  I've been trying to get out for over a year, and in that time, I've had one interview.  That's it.

I think my problem is that it looks, on paper, like I don't know anything and can't do anything.  I have no measurable proof that I'm not a) a complete idiot, b) lazy, c) unambitious, or d) any combination of the above.  I've had to take dead-end jobs to keep the lights on, but I worry I am doomed to have nothing but dead-end jobs.  I need to figure out how to at least get in on the shitty level with a company that would let me grow.  I cannot *stand* being chained to a desk all day, repeating myself on the phone with people who assume I am a moron.  But I don't know how to convince people to at least talk to me, because I *can do* more than I *have done.*  Help?"

I know both schools don't offer much as far as name recognition is concerned, but UCF is known to have a better CS department. Would this create more opportunities for internships and jobs?

The downside with going to UCF would be that I would have to pay for living expenses. If I go to school locally I will be able to save money by living with my parents while I go to school.

I was hired as a full-time intern during college and stayed with the company after graduation. When I started, we were about 10, now it's about 40. I've also been there longer than anyone except for the CEO and one coworker.

But as a 23-year-old who officially finished school in December 2015, I'm still one of the youngest people there.

The awkward part is that we've been adding more upper management. Which means that things I used to handle are now being done better by a 40yo VP of Product. Which is great.

But first of all, I feel like my voice/opinion matters less than it did when we just had a handful of people. I used to be included in more planning meetings, but now it's basically just management. And it's not as though I feel like I have the right to have my opinions given the same weight as the new VP of ___. And it's not as though they treat me like the intern (especially once they learn that I've been around forever and know quite a bit about the inner workings of the company). In general, I'm treated with respect.

But it's a weird shift. In a way I feel like I've been demoted. Whereas before I might be the one to come up with the idea, discuss it with the designer, talk about how it will impact clients, and then write the copy. And now they come up with ideas in a meeting without me and they're like, ""hey can you write the copy?"" Which, to be honest, is the least fun of the steps above. 

I don't really know how to adjust. I also don't know how to take initiative in an environment where things are basically being handed off to higher-level people. I can still offer to help when I can, but coming up with projects or ideas seems sort of presumptuous.

I am in my second year of an associates degree program. (Cisco Systems Computer Networking Technology) After reading some advice about how important getting real world experience under my belt was, I contacted several local MSP's in my area to ask for possible internships. I got a interview from one company, who are supposed to call this week to discuss scheduling and I am supposed to get a call from another company this week to have an initial conversation with them.

Right now I have taken courses like the full CCNA college courses (Called CCNA 1-4 where I am), IT essentials (Cisco's A+), Network+, and installing and configuring windows server 2012. While this semester I am taking another server 2012 class, along with CCNP routing, and operating system security. However I have not gotten any certifications yet.

My question is whether to focus on the internship side of things (As in devoting more hours to this) or to start working on knocking out some of these certifications? 

So far I love the IT field (As a young guy who has been spinning his wheels career wise for a number of years) and I am eager to start getting some experience. I want to try and get some advice on how to focus my efforts."

Been working since December of 2015 and it's pretty fun. Feels good to be with smart people, and getting paid too. Got my desired salary which is slightly above the national average. 

Background and tips (warning: haters gonna hate): 

* STEM major, not CS. 
* Been studying on my own for about 1.5 years, but most of my current knowledge was accumulated in the past year over research projects.
* 0 internships
* 1+ research assistant gigs
* 2 papers, not very interesting but related to data analysis
* applied for at least 5 months, probably sent out nearly a hundred applications. 
* Got very few on-site interviews, several phone call interviews, huge amount of rejections ... likely because I have no experience and perhaps because I was applying to more advanced positions than I'm qualified for
* been coding for fun since early high school days, so I have somewhat of a decent github profile
* read a lot of books, but mainly textbooks for the past 2 years
* shit gpa that wouldn't get me into even the easiest of grad schools - mostly because I tried to just get by. Nobody asked about it except on the applications for banks, at which point I just exited the browser tab knowing that I would be wasting my time. Also did not apply for positions with descriptions talking about a minimum GPA, which aren't many.
* did not apply to any jobs which deal with Excel and SQL as the main tools
* top 15% general GRE scores, not that anyone asked about it. 
* literally did not do some final exams because I knew I would be able to get a passing D grade without them, so minimal school effort all the way through... except for a few courses which were of particular personal interest because they had to do with data analysis or they might have helped with my personal projects for fun. Hell I accidentally showed up for class one day where it happened to be the midterm, aced it (introductory Java). 
* reading textbooks instead of going to class can suck a lot when the professor doesn't follow the book, so showing up just to figure out which chapters are covered in what order helped a lot. 
* rate my professor is absolutely accurate. 
* Finding 2-4 good professors is a very very very very very very very very very very very important thing to do by junior year. If possible, take courses with them as much as possible. Either it ends in a research opportunity, good connections, or better grades. It rarely can go wrong. 
* taking useful courses is extremely important. Automata, number theory, compilers, etc. does not find employment easily. It's better to spend your tuition money on practical courses instead, and to learn that stuff on your free time if you find it interesting. 
* clubs on campus are often a waste of time, especially ESPECIALLY the political ones. Anime club might be fun though for organizing comic con or anime expo rides/meetups/cosplays. 
* it's worth the wait of a year for a good professor to cycle onto the required and important course such as an algorithms class, instead of taking it with an overall terrible professor (see ratemyprofessors). If they weren't bad, they wouldn't get so many damn bad reviews. 
* it's better to take the easy A course if it's between two GE electives. A harder and more interesting one can kill the time necessary for more important required ones. If you like the subject, just buy a book on it and read it at your leisure. 
* class projects should be geared towards ideas which might shine on a resume in the projects section
* avoid sharing answers for homework or tests etc. to not get accused of cheating, and to not lessen the curve of the course against your favor

GE courses were a complete waste of time. They don't make a person more well rounded if the subject matter is forgotten almost entirely in a year or two, unless by some miracle you find one out of the 30 you take to be interesting and develop a reading habit out of it. I did that for history books in high school, but that stopped when I realized that I was wasting my time with stories instead of spending it on textbooks to develop the skills necessary for a decent job straight out of university. 

Dorming is a bad idea - lots of distractions. If you need housing, pick a spot outside of the dorming area where you won't have the opportunity to live directly next to partying frat boys.


On a special note regarding data analysis: 

* Finding a good book is really really hard. Good as in both comprehensive and at-your-level understandable. They are also extremely expensive online. It's easier to find a free pdf. Introduction to Statistical Learning is an excellent introductory book. 
* Find a book which uses both programming and data analysis. Oreilly/ Packt/ etc. has a whole ton of them online. 
* Coursera/Udacity is not your friend. Most course are started and not finished. Pick up a book instead, you'll probably have more motivation to read it.


Thanks for all the tips from asking questions over the past... maybe 2 years. 

* Glassdoor was helpful for salary expectations and for applying to companies which didn't pay shit. It also gave me tips on interview questions to expect. 
* Linkedin has a ton of good jobs.
* Indeed is good too. 
* Craigslist is sparse on data analysis jobs. 
* Recruiters are often shitty at their jobs of finding you a match. They see ""Python"" in a data analyst resume and they'll send you a hundred Django web jobs. 
* It's best to just take the time and apply directly to job postings on linkedin or indeed or glassdoor.

After 8 hours this week of being on the phone with every MS department, trying to get 2 different machines with OEM Office License keys activated, I was ready to go postal. (Thanks Dell, for shipping 2016 office keys that have already been activated on another account)

However, at the end of it all, I eventually got a contact number for Office support that is absolutely *magical.* I've used it 3 more times since then with incredible results.

Office Support #: 866-425-4826

Some of the issues we've run into just this week so far with OEM license keys:

- Dell machines shipping with 2016 sometimes ship with keys that will validate, but are already linked to another live.com account, making them unable to be activated. The support reps here were the only ones that were able to look this up, realize it was an issue, and issue a new key no questions asked.

- Re-installing office and trying to re-activate an already registered OEM key is a giant pain; most of the time this number seems to simply issue a new key and activate for you.

- At one point, another MS support rep couldn't activate a copy of office2013 for us, so they simply issued a new 2016 key. This broke the customer's Project2013 standalone install, as they're not compatible. Calling this number got them to simply upgrade project to 2016 and issue a new key to a new live.com account.

It can still take a little while, so I recommend making your interns call, but it saves a TON of hassle otherwise. Best of luck. Fuck Microsoft OEM licensing; I'm so sick of dealing with this.

I feel like I'm in limbo.",thegirlfromchicago,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/42ydq8/one_of_the_first_hires_at_a_startup_but_still_the/,"I've worked for my company since April 2014. I was hired as a full-time intern during college and stayed with the company after graduation. When I started, we were about 10, now it's about 40. I've also been there longer than anyone except for the CEO and one coworker.

But as a 23-year-old who officially finished school in December 2015, I'm still one of the youngest people there.

The awkward part is that we've been adding more upper management. Which means that things I used to handle are now being done better by a 40yo VP of Product. Which is great.

But first of all, I feel like my voice/opinion matters less than it did when we just had a handful of people. I used to be included in more planning meetings, but now it's basically just management. And it's not as though I feel like I have the right to have my opinions given the same weight as the new VP of ___. And it's not as though they treat me like the intern (especially once they learn that I've been around forever and know quite a bit about the inner workings of the company). In general, I'm treated with respect.

But it's a weird shift. In a way I feel like I've been demoted. Whereas before I might be the one to come up with the idea, discuss it with the designer, talk about how it will impact clients, and then write the copy. And now they come up with ideas in a meeting without me and they're like, ""hey can you write the copy?"" Which, to be honest, is the least fun of the steps above.

I don't really know how to adjust. I also don't know how to take initiative in an environment where things are basically being handed off to higher-level people. I can still offer to help when I can, but coming up with projects or ideas seems sort of presumptuous.

Has anyone else been in this situation?"

After several different internships, I got my first job in Oil &amp; Gas right out of school. 


After I left that position (fortunately ahead of the price per barrel tank), I leveraged my previous programming experience to land a job for a big defense contractor as a System Test Engineer. My previous experience had been with creating in-house tools using VBA, XML, and some SQL. Simple stuff though.


As of now, I'm working as a test engineer getting test procedures, scripts, and documentation done in order to present software releases to the government. It is a good gig but just not technically challenging..


Fortunately, due to my interest in development, I was given a project to develop a content management website to host training material for our main program. All in two months, I developed the whole thing using .NET, C#, SQL, and IIS. 


Now that this is wrapping up, I'm looking at next steps since this was definitely the most fun and reward project I've ever been paid for! I had an informational interview over the phone with a senior director of software development at a company I could see myself working for. And here's where my confusion or lack of direction rears its ugly head.


The main points I took away from the call was that I needed to get some sort of further education in order to even apply for entry-level backend dev positions. He suggested either a night-school CS degree (I won't have to do gen eds) or a coding bootcamp. On the other hand, I could try and stay with my current company and transition in to a developer role as soon as I can. The main drawback is money since I'm already paying off my previous student loan and am having a hard time swallowing adding more onto that.


Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you break into a junior development role?


**tl;dr**: I would need more student loans to go back to school or a bootcamp. I could maybe transition into a development role in my current company. What would you suggest for someone trying to break into the industry?


**Thank for any replies; I'm just trying to wrap my head around this whole thing.**

42yui5,8,2016-01-27,Decision Between Offers,seenut,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/42yui5/decision_between_offers/,"I have two very different offers for summer internships and I'm having trouble deciding which to accept. I'm getting advice from as many people as I can in hopes of making an educated decision. I don't expect you to give me an answer of ""X offer is definitely better"", but I want to bounce my thoughts off of someone who knows the field so I know whether I'm thinking about the right things and whether my thoughts are rational.

&amp;nbsp;

One offer is for a small-to-medium-sized company called Squarespace (which I'll refer to as SS) in NYC. SS creates a platform that helps people make elegant websites, so the work I do there would be primarily web development. SS is considered one of the best places to work in NYC and has a reputation for treating their employees well. I will be compensated at 1850/week plus 1500/month housing. Some positives of this offer are: I get a ""foot in the door"" of a rapidly expanding company, I get to work at a place with ""startup culture"" (is this an advantage?), company treats their employees very well (free lunches daily + unlimited snacks.. is this trivial?), and NYC seems like a fun place to live. Some concerns I have about this offer are: high cost of living in NYC, low turnover rate of interns receiving fulltime offers (I'd have to stand out).

&amp;nbsp;

The other offer is from Cisco in North Carolina. The compensation is 22.65/hr with 6000 signing bonus. I don't really have any concerns about this offer, and some advantages are: larger breadth of work, I'd feel less pressured to stand out at Cisco, the cost of living in NC is much lower, and I'm fairly confident that I'd be able to earn a fulltime offer.

&amp;nbsp;

To normalize the salaries so they're easier to compare: the SS offer is 2225/week, the Cisco offer is 1406/week. The wage for the Cisco offer is much lower than the SS offer, but this is likely because of the huge discrepancy in cost of living (I've done brief research online and apparently a 90k annual salary in NYC is equivalent to a 30k annual salary in NC).

&amp;nbsp;

I think an ideal situation would be something like me interning at SS over the summer if I could somehow guarantee that I'd be able to get an interview for a fulltime position at Cisco next year, but I don't want to be naive and assume that just because I received an offer this time around I'd be able to again. SS is definitely the ""sexy"" option, due to higher salary and living in NYC, whereas Cisco seems like the safer option.

I'd thoroughly appreciate any input/advice."

I haven't learned how to make GUIs yet, i wont learn until next semester, and the prerequisite for this course, i am in right now.

I have been generally good with coding though, however, I just got into the CSE major, I took my first few computer science courses in the fall.

So benevolent computing is all about computing for social good. This semestsr we are expecting to look for a social problem or cause, and then research it. Then we are supposed to come up with a protype of mobile app or website to help resolve this issue. It has to be functional though and serve its purpose (even if its in beta).
The professor said if coding was a problem (like GUIs) we have other tools like Dreamweaver.
Also we are supoosed to work in teams, normally i am extremely shy, i am okay with one on one but I can't even speak in group conversations...its really difficult for me. I dont know if i can work solo but he is stressing people work in groups, and thats his main focus.

Originally i was going to drop it because i didnt really know what it was about, to be honest i thought it would be much lamer. If i drop it i would just have much more free time, and id be okay with it because im still considered full time. But maybe this is a good time to challenge myself, step out of my comfort zone, and show potential employers for an internship something good.

What would you do? Is this something you think will look good for employers? Do you think this sounds like something I am ready for?

The reason for this is to allow for 3 paid internship opportunities in my major. Each internship will last 6 months. 


My first two were at the same company and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. They asked me if I would be interested to return for my third internship, but I told them I would like to take the opportunity to explore different company cultures and they were extremely understanding. They told me to contact them once I graduate. Now at my current company, I am about 4 months into it and I like the work that I do. The team I got into are all great people. During one of my meetings with my manager, he asked me what my plans were when I graduate. I told him that I would be contacting a couple of companies 1 year before graduating to see what kind of technical skill sets they were looking for to better prepare myself once I do graduate. I told my manager that my current company is definitely on the list, but at the same time, I do not want to limit myself. I don't graduate until Spring 2017 which is plenty of time to add more skills under my belt and to better increase my job prospects.  


My manager has always been an easy going and straight forward guy. So he told me that my plan wouldn't be possible since I would be getting an offer letter to work full time with a salary ranging from 65k-70k. I have 10 days from receiving the letter to make a decision. Basically, would it be a better choice to accept a guaranteed job or take the risk and search for a job I would enjoy more? I like what I do here, but I feel like there may be places I would enjoy even more. Also, is 65k-70k a decent offer? I currently make $24/hr as an intern so to me, that's a pretty decent offer, but I don't know what is typically offered for new graduates with similar experiences.

This is something I have never considered because I have always seen myself teaching 4th or 5th grade being a male.

My issue is that I am doing my first internship half way through the school year. These students have routines for every subject and I am having a bit of trouble keeping up. It has gotten to the point that it's diminished my confidence in teaching because I constantly have to ask if I am doing it correctly. Yesterday, I brought it up with the teacher I am working with in confidence and she said she would help me out. After we talked, we seemed to be at a mutual understanding and I left feeling like I had the support I needed.

Today I go in and in the first lesson she asked me if I was comfortable doing one of their calendar routines and being honest, I said ""not completely"". It's at this point she basically told me that I should go home and think about all of this and whether it is something I truly want. I have been working at this for the past 4 years of my life. I'm completely out of my comfort zone being in a grade that is far beyond my level of intent and not being there from the beginning to learn her routines. I have always wanted to be a teacher and to have someone say that is a little unfair.

I am only there 2 days a week and have only been in the classroom 5 times total. I just don't exactly know what to do.
I am meeting with one of my internship advisers to see what my options are in hopes there is some sort of resolution.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

* Graduated in May 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

* Been trying to get an internship or job 2 years since before graduation. Never managed to get one.

* Tried to get staffing firms to find me something. Had multiple Skype interviews and onsites. No one ever managed to find me anything.

* I get interviews, but never can pass them for whatever reason. I never get any feedback.

* I did bomb two interviews. One was a technical for Amazon, and another was a behavorial for an ecommerce. As far as I know, I haven't bombed anything else.

* I've only ever had one technical interview (Amazon).

* My resume should be fine, considering I had it personally reviewed by a CTO, several managers at Oracle, and a recruiter.

* I have 0% success with referrals.

* My last interview, had to be rescheduled twice due to the recruiter not being able to make it on time. They were supposed to interview me yesterday, but never showed up and stopped replying.

* The above company was http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/lbi-software

* I'm not a special snowflake or anything. I did everything I could, regarding my situation. My school sucked, and I had no school projects. I graduated in two years due to transferring from community college.

* Also my GPA sucks, but I blame that on the poor quality of my school. I actually had a 3.6 GPA and Dean's List in community college, and a 4.0 in high school.

* In order to compensate for the above, I worked on two websites, did an unpaid internship, and volunteered my services for a non-profit.

* I've talked to neighbors, family friends, friends of friends, alumni, classmates, and random people from LinkedIn. I've also been to two meetups. No one knows anything about any job leads.

With that out of the way, my mind is basically rotting, and depression actually exists as a consequence. Any words of wisdom? Do I just keep on creating more projects and pray to find something?

I'm really conflicted about my summer plans right now.

I originally planned on working at a high-end chain restaurant and working with management to do an ""internship"" program where I explore the various roles in a restaurant setting. This job works nicely so I can leave to go back to school at the end of the summer early, because the job is more lenient. Also, my boyfriend planned a trip for me to go to Peru, which I am super excited about (I've never left the US before). This job would give me good experience, as well as the flexibility to do other things I'd really like to do.

However, I just secured an internship for this summer. This internship is a very rigid full-time program. Realistically, I wouldn't be able to go to Peru if I were to take this job. It's an 8-5pm day. 

I'm really confused about what to do here. I'm only a freshman and I don't want to be too hard on myself. I think that going to Peru will be good for me. I've never left the US before, and I want to learn more about other places. I want to travel while I'm still young and can. My boyfriend has discounted plane tickets as well, so that's a major perk. This would also be a major step in my relationship with my boyfriend; I would get to learn about the place he was born, and also meet his family members that don't live in the US.

I also want to have an internship though. This is all very hard on me, and I don't know how to decide.

&gt;Hello Heavy Iron,

&gt;    As someone interested in doing a programming internship with you down the road (later this year perhaps) I understand based on what I've you use C++ (as is the case with a good chunk of the industry). However, I was curious what engine is primarily used when you make games. Is it something like Unreal, or something developed in-house? In the past I've seen Heavy Iron use the RenderWare engine, but I have no idea if that is till the case.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;AskMeAboutBallsy

Their reply:

&gt; Hi AskMeAboutBallsy,

&gt; Thank you for your interest in Heavy Iron Studios. As the studio has been making games for over 16 years, there has been a wide range of technology/game engines we have used. Typically the code we write for the engine and gameplay is in C or native assembly, and the editors are written in a combo of C/C++/C#.
 
&gt; The last Heavy Iron game to use the RenderWare rendering engine was The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer in 2005. All of our THQ games after that, starting with Ratatouille in 2007, used a proprietary engine built in-house from the ground up.

If you don't know who Heavy Iron Studios is basically they make movie/tv games. One of their most notable ones is SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom, Disney Infinity, Epic Mickey 2, and [some other titles](http://www.heavy-iron.com/games.php). Anyway down the road I am looking to do an internship with them, and I wanted a bit of insight on what engine they use, and things like that. Anyway it's just nice to reach out, and try to make some sort of contact to get your name out there sort of.

Anyone else do this sort of thing with smaller developers?"

After that internship, I got a full-time role there and was making $70,000. I left after 2 months to intern at Intel in California. I've been at Intel for 6 months and my total compensation is currently what I was making before. I can stay at Intel for another 6 months if I want to. Languages across all of these internships/roles include C#, T-SQL (for the DB in ASP.NET web apps), Python (for Django and system level scripting), C (for firmware code), Java (school and personal projects).

I'll have a B.S. in CS from a decent school. GPA is currently 3.87. 

I'm aiming for $100,000 base salary if I stay at Intel, or if I get a comparable role elsewhere. Is that too high based on my experience already? Can I attain it as a FAIR wage? I'm not looking to make a bank, but I do want to be compensated fairly for my experienced level, passion, and most importantly the fact that I strive to produce great results. 

Is that too high even if I have more than one offer to leverage? I saw that ASP.NET developers in the area where I used to be get paid an average of $90,000. But California salaries are higher. Please advise so that I don't give the impression that I'm being greedy or overly confident.

Edit: I realize that this depends on location, so let's assume that the location is either Silicon Valley or a few hours outside of the Bay area, or Chicago."
431wvz,1,2016-01-28,Accept return offer or work elsewhere for internship?,fakieswitch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/431wvz/accept_return_offer_or_work_elsewhere_for/,"For some background, my school has a 16 month internship program that I am enrolled in. This means that starting this summer, I will spend 16 months working. Now, I interned at Company A last summer and now have a return offer for this summer, with the possibility of extending it for the full 16 months. I also have an offer for Company B that is a guaranteed 16 months. 

My problem is that although I really enjoyed working at Company A, know they pay well post-graduation, and could see myself working there full-time, I feel like it would be more beneficial for me to branch out and try working at different companies and in different industries. 

So basically I have two choices:

1. Accept Company A, and hope that they either extend my work term or I get a 12 month offer elsewhere starting in September
2. Accept Company B, and hope that I don't burn any bridges at Company A
 

The biggest factors in favour of making each choice are:

1. Accepting Company A will basically guarantee me a full-time offer, and it would pay well and although it's not necessarily a job I would stay at forever, it certainly wouldn't be a bad start to my career.
2. Accepting Company B means I can try new things, and also I don't have to worry about doing more job hunting.

This is probably the hardest decision of my ""career"" thus far and would really appreciate some help. Thanks!

I found this subreddit and am extremely happy I did. I'm finally realizing that I need to figure out what I want to do in life and am hoping to find some input/suggestions here to put me on the right path. 

I am going into my second semester at a small private liberal arts school. I'm a math major and last year decided to add exercise science as well seeing as I enjoy sports (play football) and lifting. While these two don't connect I plan to continue with both. 

If i were to start over i would definitely go the computer science route seeing as I've always played around in coding and technology and I could see myself doing something like IT or developing applications. However it's too late for this in my undergraduate program. 

I really have no idea what I want to do. I'm currently in talks with Willis about an internship this summer to see what it's like to be an analyst or actuarial work. I also know of a few collegiate level strength programs that I maybe able to intern at with my exercise science interest/major. 

What do you guys believe I should do? 

How should I go about continuing my learning in programming? I want to be sure that employers know I'm tech savvy and am able to quickly learn and pick up a needed language.

I'm just starting my second year of college and will have my AA in Computer Information Systems at the end of the year. I'll then be transferring to a university for my BSIT.

I've been a hobbyist for the last 10 years or so. I know several programming languages. I've always built my own PCs. I've used Linux extensively and worked for a short time as a system and database admin. I've configured and managed FTP, SSH, and HTTP severs, among others.

In short, I have a little experience with almost everything. I reviewed the A+ exam objectives and I'm estimating that I know 70% or more of the material. My only qualm is that I don't yet have much *formal* experience or education.

My question is, when would be a good time to focus on getting my A+ certification? I know that it would be a huge advantage to getting my foot into the door as far as entry-level positions and internships go. I'm thinking about taking a semester or two off before transferring, and using that time to get my A+ certification. Is this a good idea, or should I wait until I've taken some of my BSIT courses?"

* I have done a 3 month internship in an European project related to nuclear fusion. I worked for the Systems Engineering department.
* I am very passionate about software engineering.
* I also have a Github account with a couple of personal projects, but they never got any attention. I think I'll start contributing to other people's projects.

* Spotify
* Uber
* AirBNB
* Facebook

I am a senior in college that is graduating soon. I just found out about this subreddit last week so I had a question about the offer I recently got. This is a throwaway account but will be reading/answering responses!

Some background: I was an I switched majors a ton of times in college up until my junior year. I was everything from molecular biology to electrical engineering. I settled on CS because it sounded interesting. Luckily I did okay in my classes and I am graduating this semester. I had a software dev internship last summer (my first internship related to software dev) at a company in the bay area. The company is near Hayward, CA and is relatively unknown (at least I had never heard of them until they came to our career fair).

Anyway, after my internship the company made me an offer of $88k/yr with a $7k signing bonus. I didn't get any stock since the company is private. I signed the offer a couple of months ago since it was the only offer I had. I felt that as someone who had just recently gotten into the CS major and not had a lot of programming experience, $88k/yr was a lot of money! That said I will be living with my parents in Palo Alto, CA so living expenses are not an issue. However, I constantly see $100k/yr or better offers with significantly higher starting bonuses thrown around on this subreddit in the bay area. Quite honestly, that makes me feel like I am a subpar software developer.

Anyway, I was wondering if the offer I signed is seriously that low or not. One of the main reasons I signed it is because I thought that even if I didn't like the job much, I could apply to different jobs while working there and maybe get a better paying job. And it isn't that I hate the job or anything. The people there are nice are the work life balance was nice according to the full time devs on my team. However, since I have been using Unix-like operating systems at home and for school work, I strongly ended up preferring programming on those platforms. At this job we mostly use Microsoft software and dev tools. I actually didn't mind C#, it's just that my gut tells me that I shouldn't limit myself to Microsoft software in the software dev industry, if I want to be successful.

Anyway, thanks for reading my post guys! Growing up in Palo Alto, CA, I have always been surrounded by tech, and that is why I want to make something of myself. "

I have a car and I also work at Target which they would let me transfer my application to the nearest Target there. I'm pretty set to be independent while attending Cal but wanted to know a couple of things that am confused from the Summer Session website.

I'm currently a junior attending a large public research university. I have been a CpE (computer engineering) major since I started here as a freshman, however lately I've been beginning to doubt my choice of major.

I've completed the software portion of my degree and had one software internship with a mid-sized company, and I did not enjoy it at all. After that, I hoped that the hardware portion of my degree program would interest me, and after taking Circuits, Signals, and now into Digital Logic, I can say that I definitely am *not* a fan. The remainder of the CpE degree is also pretty much all digital hardware.

I know IE gets lot of flak for being ""pseudo"" engineering, but after investigating IE / ISE, I really think the idea of ""big-picture"" thinking and optimizing flow of processes, etc, is really interesting, along with the blend of business acumen. The potential to work in a lot of different industries also intrigues me.

I'm really not sure of what I want to do as a career, which is why I want to get into consulting or a product management type of role. 

However, I'm unsure if this is ""grass is greener"" syndrome or what. If I switch, I can probably make it out of undergrad within 5 years. Should I do it? Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR: 3rd year CpE major, ~3.5 GPA. Don't like software, not liking hardware. Think I'm interested in IE / ISE. Can still make it out in 5 years total w/ ISE degree and CS minor if I switch. Yay / Nay?** "

- I was supposed to stay 6 months. For certain reasons, I left after 5. This was a rotational internship in various departments, such as food &amp; beverage, member services, etc.

- I didn't have very many office clothes for when I was working shifts that didn't require a restaurant uniform.  I thought that it would be easy to buy clothes when I got over there since it wouldn't have fit in my luggage anyways. Turns out, its not that easy to buy clothes in East Lothian, especially without a car and not much time off of work.  This is important to note, as I was given a bag of clothes from the girl who trained me on reception and then left the company shortly after.

- I was given a contract to sign and hand back in the beginning for a *restaurant* uniform.  (Side note: Never ended up receiving some items on that contract so I never actually gave it to them signed for fear that I would get charged in the end. I told them very politely that I would not be signing it because so many items were missing from the list.)

- It's also important to note that I never received the clothes directly from her; our schedules didn't meet up so I picked it up from the front desk indirectly.  This means there was never any conversation in regards to returning the items, etc.  She did tell me, previously, however, that she was moving to London and had a bunch if clothes she could give me.  I was gracious and accepted, even if most of it didn't fit properly.   The bag of clothes was comprised of random office clothes such as suit jackets that barely fit and a few logo'd shirts from the company pro shop. As well as, a pink Galvin Green jacket with the company logo.  Herein lies the big commotion. 

- I ended up wearing this jacket a lot due to weather and long commutes walking to work.  The jacket already had some noticeable wear as it had been worn by the previous owner for at least two seasons. The other receptionist has the same jacket. She mentioned to me one day about how they picked it out together (and from what I can remember)  *bought* them together a few seasons ago. So the entire internship, I'm thinking, cool, I have this awesome new jacket.  Not, 'I'm renting out this jacket and have to return it back to the golf shop at the end of my internship.'

So fast forward to the present. I have received a few emails from the pro shop inquiring about the jacket.  I replied initially before Christmas saying that I had no idea it was part of the uniform and had I known I would have left it with my roommate, the other intern.   I also nonchalantly asked  if he (the pro shop manager) knew  any word of when we would be receiving season tips in the same email.  Of course, he said he did not know and to contact someone else about it (never mentioned who, just said he wasn't the right person to ask). He's right, however, I wanted to plant the seed of my reluctance to send the jacket back without getting wages owed to me. 

(This same manager last season prevented the company from knowingly not paying season tips to a loyal coworker just because he was going to school in the states because the company thinks that they will either forget, not care, etc. apparently.  This coworker ended up dropping out of school and returned to Scotland to continue working at the club. So the company is already notorious for not paying wages) 

- A key reason that I left the internship early, other than being treated like cheap seasonal labor, was finances.  I planned out my income budget in the UK thinking I was going to be making tips from restaurant shifts. Of course I was sadly mistaken.  And I had to put all cash tips I received into a pot, that I feared I would never see again
  And turns out I was right! 

- The way the company handles tips:  every time someone gives an employee a cash tip they must hand it in to their department. At the end of the year,   the club members are asked if they want to add tips to the pot.  The money is divided as the owner/general manager sees fit to each department. For example, the golf employees make a lot of cash tips, pocket probably half of those tips, and end up receiving the largest payout during the holidays. In my circumstances, I put most of my tips in the food and beverage department pot, so I would have received it from that department.  I did, however, put tips in from the housekeeping department as well. 

- one of my previous coworkers from the club said she would message me on Facebook to let me know when she got her season tips so we could compare if I had got mine also.  Of course, its well after January and no word from her.  I received my W2 in the mail from the company a few days ago.  Spoke to my old roommate/fellow intern on Facebook yesterday and he said he had not received season tips, holiday pay, and had to email several times just to get paycheck stubs.  I had already been involved in a flurry of emails and phone calls with them during the internship to get those paycheck stubs and I never ended up receiving all of them and they were very shady paycheck stubs (dates were messed up, etc) 


So from what you can assume, the company is shady. All of the finances will get sent back to their Florida office at bank of america and then get resent back to the UK to pay the employees. The two interns from the US get paid directly through bank of america and those wages never circulate back to the UK. This must be illegal in itself somehow.  Also, the company used to employ many us citizens on visas to work during  the peak season but later got in trouble and are now only allowed two 'interns'.  Which they now mask as being a 'rotational management internship'. Far from it. 

Those are the major facts.  I really don't want the jacket necessarily, but I'm more concerned with getting my wages that are owed to me.  I have an acquaintance from the club who is visiting in Florida that wouldn't mind taking the jacket back with him.  I also recently met a colleague, a doctor from England, who is more than happy to mail the jacket for me and has also recommended that I contact the Citizens Advice Bureau.  



TL; DR:  Company notorious for not paying season tips.  Didn't pay mine or the other intern's.  Now they are constantly emailing me to send a jacket back that I was never told was part of a uniform. ~$500 in unpaid tips, used jacket  now becoming collateral, probably worth around $100.  Starting to think I need to lawyer up before I take any further action!"

439yr7,3,2016-01-29,What is genuinely the most important part in choosing/getting a Tech Internship for the Summer?,shamansa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/439yr7/what_is_genuinely_the_most_important_part_in/,"I'm a junior computer science student applying for Internships for the first time. 

I have been rejected by many of the big companies (Not sure why. I have an okay GPA (3.3) and go to U.S top 20-30 school. I don't even make it to the technical interviews usually). 

But I have received offers from some companies. They aren't really big names but I loved my interview process with them, meeting the team and the managers. What they told me was really exciting: They wanted to develop a new IT security team and from the looks of it I, as an intern, would be closely involved in that. 

Now here's my confusion. No one genuinely wants to Intern for this company. They're a no name, they pay half as much as the Google and Facebooks and well it's just not a sexy enough name. 

I am currently in the interview process for Amazon (just did the online assessment and got 6/7 and not expecting much) but I am genuinely more excited for this company than from what I've been reading about Amazon. 

To get to my question, I don't have experience and this and I could be missing something. What are some of the major drawbacks of Interning (or even working) for a small/ish company and is all the talk such as ""making a new team. You'll be closely involved"" just BS to entice me?

Bachelors in Information Technology - overall score : above Average.(~60% marks) 
Diploma in Computer Technology  - overall score : Good (~68% marks) 
2 internships (1yr and 3 months respectively) 
Working as a 2D game developer since September 2014.
Also have been working for a social organisation, satisfying my urge to contribute towards the society. 
   
Ever since I was doing college I had plans of pursuing a Masters in either CS or Software Engineering from any good university across the globe.
 As most CS grads plan to, I also wish to do it from the USA. But can't, due to the average marks and not so great financial backing (I am single, but kinda have partial responsibility of looking after my parents). So I took up a job as a developer.

 After having worked for just over a year and started exploring the software industry, I realize how very little do I know and feel it even more important to study further and broaden my existing toolset.

 This led me to look into Germany. With almost all of the universities government funded with no or nominal tuition fees, I only have to think about my living expenses(all of which are manageable). With a little further research I found out that German universities are broadly classified as : TU(Technical University) &amp;  FH(College of Applied Sciences). With TU more theory and research oriented(More difficult courses with drop off rate of two-thirds) and FH more related towards the practical implementation of things in the real world.  Going to Germany also would require me to take a student loan so wanna play it safe and would be great if I someone could tell :

- How is the German education scene. 
- How are the chances of me getting an admit at a good University with the above mentioned information. 
- Paid internship during study. 
- Job prospects post study. 

I will also take up German classes (level A1) if things look bright. Thanks. "

43az4o,0,2016-01-29,Desperate for advice - should I leave my internship with Intel early in order to intern at SpaceX?,csthrowaway39901,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43az4o/desperate_for_advice_should_i_leave_my_internship/,"I've been a software engineer intern at Intel for 6 months. I am supposed to stay another 4 months. I got an offer from SpaceX. I'd love to work at SpaceX but it's a hard choice because it'll be hard financially. I make $28 per hour at Intel and I have PTO and great health benefits. SpaceX offered me $25 (and I can get overtime pay) but no benefits. My rent at Intel is $220 a month because I'm renting a room from people I know. My rent at SpaceX would be $1155 a month unless I stay somewhere cheaper, in which case maybe $700 a month instead. SpaceX pays for the first month so I'll be okay for a month.

If I leave Intel, I might have to pay a portion of the relocation package they gave me. It was $4000 since I came here from the other side of the country. I would probably pay a prorated amount. I already have money saved so I could do that if I absolutely had to, but money would be tight.

So, is SpaceX a good enough software engineering opportunity to go ahead and pull the trigger even though it'll be a lot tighter financially speaking for a few months? It's a 3 month internship. I could probably ask my manager about continuing my Intel internship afterwards, since we have a great relationship and since the lab likes me. 

Or does it look better on my resume to stay at Intel longer and to eventually get a permanent role there? I am really passionate about what SpaceX and Tesla are doing and I'd love to get in on the action, and I'd be working on some cool problems in their supply chain (as a software engineer), and I'd be learning a tremendous amount...but I'm hesitant to pull the trigger without asking advice from more mature people.

Should I explain all of this to SpaceX and see if they'll bump up the hourly rate? Is it improbable that a company would do this for an internship?"

The bad thing is that my GPA is 2.9 and many internships I come across require a 3.0, but I'm working to bring that up this semester. The relevant courses I'm taking this semester are Web Development, Database Management, and Computer Programming (all introductory courses.) Here's what we are learning this semester in those courses:

Web Development:
The syllabus doesn't list the topics, but this is the textbook we are going by: http://www.amazon.com/Development-Design-Foundations-HTML5-Edition/dp/0133571785
However, I don't have the textbook because the professor says we don't need it, he just posts everything online, so I'm not sure what we are learning, but all I know is we are doing HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript.

Database Management: (using SQL Server 2014 and SQL Management Studio)
Textbook: Murach's SQL Server 2012 for Developers

* Design a relational database
* Implement a relational database
* Query a relational database
* Secure database management systems
* Integrate relational database into applications
* Apply appropriate problem solving skills in Database design, administration and integration

Computer Programming: (taught in Java)
Textbook: Big Java, Late Objects
&gt; The course introduces students to object-oriented computer programming and problem solving.
Students will learn about the basic elements of a computer program such as data types, basic
control structures, graphical user interface, event-driven programming, and program debugging. 

* Looping
* Decisions
* Methods (creating methods)
* I/O, Exception Handling
* Objects
* Classes
* GUIs

This is the 2nd semester I'm taking IT courses (the CS courses are only eligible for students enrolled on the main campus, which I'm sadly not.) The only IT course I took last semester was an intro to IT, where we learned various small topics in IT.

Based on what I'm learning this semester, would I be able to easily find an internship in IT/CS for this summer? (Would employers hire me?) If I can't find an internship in IT/CS, I will have to go back to working my horrible summer job at an amusement park, and I would rather work for relevant experience."

In the last six months, she's studied HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and a little java. Over the last month she's created the 4 apps and 3 websites on her [portfolio here](http://www.bernadetteengleman.com/).

She's looking for any advice on the individual websites and apps, as well as on the portfolio as a whole. 

Next, she's thinking about going through the udemy web developer material(We know the material is available for free on the site) but she's not sure if this is the best next step for her. She's also thinking about just getting some good reference books on HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and reading them cover-to-cover. She'd like to get a job as soon as possible(we're in NYC) so she'd trying to figure out what she should study next, to make the best use of her time to get her up to that level of knowledge needed to qualify for an internship or job. 

Please be as honest as possible, whatever she needs to learn and know that will help her get a job or internship is what she wants to hear.

I am currently an undergraduate student with aspirations of working in the financial services industry. I have just completed an internship at a medium sized wealth management company where imo, I definitely upgraded on my excel skills. I became more aware of keyboard shortcuts and formatting tools and I even learned and applied on a daily basis the often mentioned VLOOKUP formula. I was not 'wowed' by VLOOKUP, seemed straight forward to me and after using it, it seems like a regular excel function (yes ok there can be issues with VLOOKUP if there are whitespaces where there shouldnt be, but there are ways to get around that - there seems to always be a way to get around issues with Excel), very useful formula though for sorting through hundreds of thousands of rows of data. 

Based on my aspirations, and also looking at job requirements for fields I am interested in, VBA seems to be a tremendous asset to have in your skill set. Now, I have done a few introductory CS courses in university where I was able to familiarize myself with languages such as Racket and Python although, I am NO CS major.  My question to those who have insight to share, where is a good place to begin learning VBA based on my career goals? What are the main functions of VBA that will increase my employability and productivity within the financial services sector? How is VBA used in the financial services sector by an analyst?

Looking forward to hearing your insight!"

Throughout my college career I've really struggled in keeping up with the demands of the program due to general lack of motivation, so now I've reached a point where I'm finally looking seriously for positions, and my GPA is pretty garbage (below a 3) compared to other candidates due to semester after semester of doing just enough to pass, and I have pretty much no out of class personal project experience. I do feel like I've learned quite a bit during my time here, but I'm definitely not as good as some of the other students I've seen in terms of programming experience. I've had 2 internships in the past 2 summers where I assisted teams in various portions of the software development process, but it was mostly just office type work, so I didn't really do any coding, and one job the summer after my freshman year where I helped educate kids about technology related subjects as part of a nonprofit. I've also had experience from classes on computer security, web databases, database management systems, computer organization, artificial intelligence, data structures and algorithms, agile web development, etc... but I'm honestly clueless as to what specialization/field of CS I want to focus on, which has been part of my struggles in finding internships in previous years. So based on this background information, I have a few questions:

1) If you were in my position, what would be the best options for me in terms of gaining experience in ""real world"" software development in an internship? What companies should I be applying to (small, large, Big 4, startup, etc.)?

2) What kinds of things can I be doing outside of class to improve my resume? I feel like the general answer is to code your own app/game, or work on making tons of contributions on GitHub or something, but I don't really know where to start.

3) Will most employers see my current resume and toss it? Or do I actually have a chance against other students? I'm probably going to start pumping out applications to various companies in the coming weeks, but I'm not sure if I should even bother with trying to apply to some of the Big 4 companies like so many other students are.

4) Am I as screwed as I think I am? Part of me constantly worries that I've ruined my chances of actually being successful in the field.

I just figured I'd try to get some advice from other people in CS on what they would do in my shoes, because I'm feeling like an outsider compared to other students, and I'm just generally intimidated by the whole process."

I've been applying to internships like EA, Dolby, or Pixar , but I'm finding that these internships (at least those for summer undergrads without portfolios) are largely just quality testing positions where you'd just give feedback on other people's work, and possibly helping with finding/fixing bugs. 

All in all, that sounds like I'd actually do very little and I'm thinking I could just go home for the summer and try to start applying what I'm learning in my classes to make a mobile game that I could say I developed from start to finish, and submit to/show recruiters in the future. I'm really learning quite a lot in my classes, and while I may not have a product I could sell by the end of the summer, I definitely think I could get to the point where I could show it to recruiters. 

The main reason I want to do this is because there was a position I saw on pixar's site I was interested in (I think mobile developer intern?) that required a mobile app portfolio to be uploaded, and I feel like summer's the only time I'll have the opportunity to actually start building such a portfolio. The games we're making in class are primarily for computers, so I don't know if that would count (they're also not going to be ready for applications season anyways :/ )

But on the other hand, I want to dedicate at least a majority of my summer to this, so would a whole summer without work experience hurt my job prospects in the future, even if I do end up with something to show for it? Have any of you guys taken time off from school and work to work on a personal project? How'd it turn out? Thanks! "

Im the type of person that needs some guidance when its comes to programming since I cant come up with any creative ideas and I saw this. I want to start learning more languages so I can put more on my resume and hopefully end up getting an internship. Is it worth my time going through this program or should I just focus on learning other languages?

43db1t,1,2016-01-30,Chance me for some sooper high places (JHU/Dartmouth/UChicago/Columbia/CMU/GT),Detrinex,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/43db1t/chance_me_for_some_sooper_high_places/,"Hiya friends. I'm a senior from a top-ranked Maryland public school. For demographic purposes, I am a White/Asian Male in the upper-middle class, and both my parents went to college. Nothing's changed since we last spoke, except I removed Northwestern and UW and replaced it with Columbia and Dartmouth, and I nailed a 4.0 this semester.

**Numbers and Stuff (Part One):**

GPA: 3.73 out of 4.00 as of the end of junior year

First Semester Cumulative: 3.76ish out of 4.00, because I got a 4.0 this semester.

WGPA: 4.47 out of 5.00 as of the end of junior year (not that it matters, but hey).

First Semester Cumulative Weighted: probably like 4.51-4.55 or something.

SAT: 2250 (720 CR (!), 780 Math, 750 Writing)

ACT: 35 (35 Reading, 35 Math, 35 English, 34 Science + 33 combined E/W)

* Because my ACT is more impressive than my SAT in every/almost every way, I submitted both the ACT and SAT to schools.

SAT II's: 800 Math II, 750 Chemistry, 800 World History

Languages Spoken: 2.05 (English, Spanish, bits and pieces of Russian)

Memeness: UBER-DANK

Class Rank: N/A, since my school doesn't do class ranks (everyone's a winner!) but it'd probably be pretty high.

There are quite a few people at my school with GPAs ranging between 3.7 and 4.0, so I'm more or less banking on the fact that I've been taking hard/challenging courses for going on three years now, and that most of my B's are in certain subjects (Spanish and Math). Luckily, I have an **upward trend** now because of a 4.0 I got this semester. Moving on...

**High School Classes:**

Middle School:

* Spanish I (A/A) (7th grade)
* Algebra I (A/B) (8th grade)
* Spanish II (A/B) (8th grade)
* ""Advanced English 8"" - not sure why this class is even *on* my *high school* transcript, but it appears as an elective (A/A).

9th Grade:

* Spanish III Honors (B/B)
* Honors Geometry (A/A)
* Honors Chemistry (A/A)
* AP United States History (A/A)
* Honors English 9 (A/A)
* PE (A/A) (basically a meaningless class, but you knew that already)
* B.S. ""Technology class"" requirement (A/A) (see above)

10th Grade:

* Spanish IV Honors (B/B)
* Honors Algebra II (B/B)
* Honors Biology (A/A)
* Honors Physics (A/A)
* AP United States Government/NSL (A/A)
* Honors English 10 (A/B) (That B is not *really* my fault but it's not really worth the time to explain)
* AP Computer Science (B/A) (that one's my fault)

11th Grade:

* AP Economics (Micro and Macro) (B/B)
* Honors Precalculus (B/B)
* AP Chemistry (double period) (AA/AA)
* AP World History (A/A)
* AP Art History (A/A)
* AP English Language (A/A)

12th Grade:

* AP Statistics (A)
* AP AB Calculus (A)
* Honors Programming III (formerly AP Computer Science AB) (A)
* AP Comparative Government (A)
* Molecular Genetics (double period class, teaches in-depth genetics - we do PCR and stuff!) (A)
* AP English Literature (A)

Regarding the AP classes, I have 4's in AP US History, AP Computer Science, and AP NSL, and I got 5's on the rest. Taking the AP Bio exam this May as well.

Compared to the rest of my high school class, I'd say I've taken just about the hardest courses available to me (there were two cases where I could have taken more rigorous courses - but I didn't feel like taking BC Calc or an accelerated Spanish 4 class) and I did pretty well.

**Awards and Honors:**

* National Merit Commended Scholar (for not failing the PSAT)
* AP Scholar (+ with Honor/with Distinction/National AP Scholar)
* A glut of quizbowl-related honors/distinctions: Semifinalist for It's Academic TV Show ('14-'15), Finalist for ""Montgomery Academic Beltway League"" ('14-'15), et cetera. None of them mean anything by themselves.
* I honestly cannot think of anything else of note. The County Attorney's Office gave me a certificate in honor of a month-long internship I did there, but that's not really anything.
* Order of the Silver Wossname for defeating both the Hippies and the Frat Boys in the Kingdom of Loathing online game.

**Extracurriculars + Internship:**

* Academic/quizbowl team (2014-2015, 2015-2016). Co-Captain of the team last year, Captain of the team this year. It actually does a lot of things (competes in three competitions, tutors middle schoolers in relevant topics, etc) and it usually brings home a medal/trophy to the school every year or so. This is **by far** my biggest selling point, because not only has it defined my entire high school extracurricular presence, it has given me a supplementary recommendation letter. Also, that's the only reason I got 'shipped off' to a quizbowl camp in shit-nowhere-ville Pennsylvania for five days.

* Been writing for a super long time. Working on two books (a novel and a Quizbowl study guide) with the intent of publishing both eventually, and sending a writing sample to UChicago within the next 40 hours or so (as of posting).

* Month-long internship at the local County Attorney's Office. Didn't get paid, but I learned stuff about law. On my first day of work, Donald Trump launched his campaign for President, so no other day could really live up to those comedic heights. They did, however, give me 132 ""student service learning hours"".

* Secretary of the school's Asian-American club. If it doesn't sound important to you, then you're probably on to something here! We watch movies and eat food once a month or so...

* Member of the school's English, History, Engineering, and Science Honor Societies. Tutoring and stuff a coupla times per semester, no big deal.

* Member of the school's Math/Tech/Science Academy, which usually doesn't do a whole lot (they did have this project thing in 10th grade where I created a scientific experiment about how heat weakens magnets, which was neat) but comes with a snazzy green stole at graduation.

**Major(s):**

This is the part where I barely even have a clue. When I applied early, I was leaning towards business (so I'm all for Chicago, Ross at Michigan, etc) but I'm not too bad at Computer Science. My 'pipe dream' of a career is to be a fiction novelist, but I don't want to be poor for a living so this would be a pretty good ""second choice"".

For my regular apps, I kinda had a change of heart and applied with indicated top-choice majors in medical/scientific fields, generally Biochem as a first choice and CS or History as the second and third. Biochem has some significance for me, because it can serve as the starting point for a career in medicine, particularly as a GP or as a medical researcher looking for cures for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

**Rec Letters/Essays:**

* Rec letter from my AP World/AP CompGov teacher. She's super cool and really nice, but I haven't done anything to *stand out* in her class aside from getting good grades, participating a lot, and such.

* Rec letter from my AP Computer Science/Programming III teacher. Technically, I only had her for a year (plus this year) but I was also in her class for bits and pieces of 9th and 11th grade to do some extra programming. Should be a glowing letter, after all I really like that class.

* Supplementary rec letter from the coach of my Academic Team, who seemed to be really impressed by my abilities in the team/club and said so. This was sent to UChicago, CMU, and Michigan.

* Peer rec letter from a friend, sent to Dartmouth as they requested. It's glowing, well-written, and I adore it almost as much as I adore its writer. The writer of the rec got into Dartmouth ED, so that's great.

* Essays should be pretty decent. I'm a good writer, and for the schools that matter I did my best to avoid cliched/overly-wordy essays. For the University of Chicago, I went totally nuts with a conspiracy theory which they damn well better have loved. For Dartmouth, I talked about my name (which has origins in the royalty of feudal Okinawa and talked about WW2 and stuff). For JHU, CMU, GT, and Columbia, I went into great detail about Core classes I liked on top of Russian culture/language programs that each school has, and made sure to talk in some detail about my present drive for biochem.

**Schools:**

I got accepted into Michigan and Maryland, and deferred from UChicago - none of these decisions are terribly surprising, but it might provide the beginnings of a benchmark for these other schools. For Columbia and Hopkins, I know my chances for each are slim, but I'm mostly posting because I want to see what my chances are for Georgetown and CMU. I'm also wondering how well of a 'chance' I stand at Dartmouth, and how my EA deferral/additional-material-thing may impact my shot at UChicago.

*Early Action:*

* University of Chicago. First choice *by far*, if I get in, I'll *definitely* go - worth the massive drives and such. I already paid it a visit, and I've prayed to the gods of chance and luck (complete with burnt offerings). **Deferred EA**, going into the regular admissions pool. I'm submitting a short 1-2 page creative writing supplement as well, and I had a decently well-written deferral letter basically saying how this is my top choice and all that jazz. I also got a 4.0 this semester, which is more or less what I promised the counselor.

* University of Michigan. **Accepted into LSA, waiting on Ross.**

* University of Maryland. In-state, safety. **Accepted into the Finance LEP and their Scholars Program.**

*Regular Decision:*

* Carnegie Mellon University. Applied to the Mellon College of Science (Biochem) and the School of Arts and Sciences (History) with a neat essay involving research and genetics and stuff. Didn't apply CS because I don't want to die. I was gonna apply to Informatics, but I have almost no experience in the field to talk about it in any way, so I decided not to.

* Dartmouth College. Sweet peer rec and a nice essay about my name. Worth noting that I'm risking punishment from the gods by wearing a Dartmouth shirt some days.

* Johns Hopkins University. I am wary of their rising rank on USNews among other sites, and how difficult it could be for me to get in with my grades, but still. Applied to their main school with the indicated majors of Medicine/Science/Humanities and the History of Science and Technology. Indicated interest in pre-med.

* Georgetown University. Applied to Georgetown College, had a generic good interview, with indicated interest in the pre-med track.

* Columbia University. Visited a while back, if that helps (spoiler-note-to-self: it doesn't)."
43e4bl,4,2016-01-30,Third year IT major musing on IT jobs aside from coding/programming,Ginnjii,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/43e4bl/third_year_it_major_musing_on_it_jobs_aside_from/,"First off, a little background on my situation. I'm currently following what it to be my third year in my IT degree, even though I really wanted to follow something along the lines of Psychology, Psychiatry or Cognitive Science but since I couldn't afford the tuition on any of the latter and the job security in those seemed rather shaky I opted for IT since it felt like the best option at the time because I'd always been generally good at IT and interested in computer science. Nothing hardcore, just your average superuser in a sense.

Fast forward three years or so and I've been looking at jobs in my area and all of the ones related to IT involve programming or system adminstrating, none of which I feel comfortable at being capable of. Maybe it's just preemptive nerves but it all feels like so much, so overwhelming, all the languages to be familiar with, or rather the paradigms, keeping up with the trends or being left behind. And in certain cases, having as many certifications as the next guy or not even qualifying for an interview, all of which seem to ask for atleast five years worth of work experience. Furthermore I'm having a harder time looking for an internship since more companies here seem to prefer picking up computer science majors or software engineering majors from the state universities as opposed to the private ones which I attend. So I'm not sure what to do, or how to proceed, I feel so lost when I browse through posts from people working in the industry and it seems so daunting because I'm terrified of being hired and not being good enough for the job, or worse, not being hired at all despite having the major but not the skills. I've been good enough to get past my coursework, with A's and B's, nothing special and I don't fancy programming for a job, but I don't mind being a code grunt of sorts if I'm being told what to do or code but I don't know if that's a thing.

So I suppose I'm lost here and I'm not sure what I want to do at the end of this, I just want a job of sorts so I can have a steady income and job security to study something I really want to. The only thing I can say I'm good at is being a jack-of-all-trades because I'm not particularly good at anything but mediocre at just about everything. And I'm sorry if this happens to be the wrong subreddit for this or if what I've said seems so vague and unanswerable.





**TL;DR** *Unsure IT major looking for advice on how to get into the industry but is daunted and terrified at the expectations that seem in place and isn't really a hardcore techie. Advice on getting into programming more would be appreciated too. Or just.. any advice, really.*"

I talked with the IT and software developers and I really want to do that. After I learn the basics and some code I can shadow/intern with them. This is a financial company that programs the software for their stores and company (customer service) internally. They work on large to small company projects along with troubleshooting. I'm trying to intern with them as soon as I can. 

The problem is I know HTML and CSS. I'm ready to teach myself this. The Senior developer said to learn C# first because its more clean and will get me used to having code etiquette. I also need to learn asp.net, asp, vb.net and SQL. Maybe a little more but those should be a great start. 

I have a decent amount of time to teach myself this and usually a few free hours a day. I'm wanting to set it up in daily lessons. 

I'm going to learn the best and the faster when I intern with them. 

Here are my questions.

Where can I find some definitions to get familiar with the courses and videos I learn from?

Should I also look into some computer science to learn and understand the works of things?

How are the different codes used?

Different syntaxes for the codes I'm learning?

Different meaning in syntaxes? (capitalizing)

How to tell codes from another?

What you can do with each?

Algorithms, equations, and formulas.


Thanks for any tips, suggestions, courses, links and more!"

Taking a flight across continents sometimes messes with your mind. Anyway, this is the last part of the Consult story (not withstanding a proper epilogue which will quickly follow afterwards). I’ve been looking forward to it for a bit, as I’ve wanted to move onto the next ‘phase’ of the story in this universe. I’m fleshing it out more and more.

Fair warning, this part may seem completely out of character for the Consultant, but I hoped that I dropped enough hints in the previous chapters that it won’t be. 

I’d greatly appreciate any feedback and such.

&amp;nbsp;

“Are you sure you can handle this? That this is a good idea?” the question ran through John’s head once more. He sneaked a peek around the corner from the stairway and saw dozens of Korvani pirates nearing the lobby’s entrance. Their weapons raised and aiming, they were intent on retaking him and the other humans as hostages, as well as finding out what exactly had happened.

John would’ve normally used this moment to throw some gas grenades and order the humans twelve stories up to start shooting at the approaching enemy. Not to kill or endanger themselves, but merely as a distraction; John thought about using the covering fire and the obscuring smoke to go outside and into the nearest building, letting the pirates past. After a minute or so, the humans would blow some pre-set charges and John would use that second diversion to go into the office building opposite the plaza where the pirates’ captain or commander was currently interrogating a dear friend of his. 

John didn’t really know why he had so easily agreed to change the plan to help out the others a bit more. He hadn’t protested or tried to accommodate them in some other way either. He wondered at that while donning the contents of his suitcase and was still wondering as he watched some of the pirates tentatively enter the lobby. They looked angry, but they weren’t rushing in, they were not that foolish. Some of the deep dark purple gas from the previous fight was still lingering around and these pirates quickly donned a gas mask of some kind. It looked strange on their smooth gecko-like faces. 

John preferred to work alone, or if necessary, with other highly professional and highly trained black ops personnel like him. So why was he so willing, so eager, to change the plan and stay a bit longer with the others? Empathy was part of it; though the older humans were all former soldiers, the younger interns and assistants all looked quite frightened. The skill of the soldiers was also questionable; it had been a decade and a half since the war ended and almost no one carried or trained with a weapon on Nova Terra. John did free the hostages and some of his friends and colleagues were among them and he didn’t really want to see them hurt. 

The Korvani were moving towards the middle of the lobby and the gas obscured John’s vision. He tuned his comm unit to that of Julia, who was upstairs still goading more aliens into coming. 

“.. that’s right, I said it! You’re all without balls, no testicles! I see all of you coming and I don’t see a single bulge in any of your freaky alien lizard pants! You’re all a bunch of impotent losers! You’re not men; you’re a bunch of children pretending to be men. No wonder so many of you lost to a single human who was blindfolded and had his hands tied behind his back!”

“Give it one more minute Julia and then move to the second phase,” John whispered with a smile and turned his comm unit off again. John couldn’t believe it was working at all, let alone so well. Trolling, goading, and perhaps even other forms of mental abuse all worked exceptionally well on these aliens. 
And that all helped with what he specialized in; psychological warfare. Scaring or goading human was much more difficult and more akin to long term strategies rather than tactics. Create a terrifying reputation, and then create a feint with that reputation while your real forces take advantage of the opponent who made the wrong maneuvers to counter this fake threat.  

Maybe that was why John agreed to changing the plan. By having a few handfuls of humans not just holding off squads of ruthless pirates and asking Earth for help, but actually defeat them on the ground, John could plant the seeds of another terrifying reputation that equaled his own back on Earth. 

Still, the mission was to rescue Miranda, also a friend, and to use the only quantum communication line open to Earth that was available in this young colony. If he had access to it, he could request assistance from Earth who could send ships to the rescue through the warp gate and take care of the 50 or so pirate ships in orbit. A victory on the ground would mean nothing if it meant an orbital bombardment crushed that reputation in an instant. That was why speed was so important and why the first plan of distractions and sneaking was better. If the pirates found out sooner rather than later that they were losing then they might destroy the QCD (quantum communication device) and remove any immediate hope of rescue that the fifteen million humans had on Nova Terra. 

John had other, more paranoid or esoteric thoughts and doubts in his mind that told him why he so readily changed the plan. Maybe Earth had abandoned them and wouldn’t be able to send any ships, because the chaotic aftermath of the war hadn’t truly ended. After all, it was the reason why so many had fled Earth in the first place. Or perhaps this was all just a strange dream and fighting strange looking alien gecko pirates would end it. 

John heard slight and cautious splashing sounds, accompanied by whispered questions of what it was that the pirates’ had just walked into. It marked the start of the second phase of the plan, and John did as he told everyone. He click the last parts of the tubes into place, checked his bracers that had metal batons attached. He quickly looked over the wrists and then the gloves that had small buttons on side of the index finger, and then put on his own breathing mask and special visor that had a head-up display. Then he reached for the final element of his get-up. His mask. He put it on very slowly as an old sense of calm and purpose descended on him.

Made in the style of an old samurai mask it had a pair of small horns on top, was completely black in colour and had a surface that resembled burned and charred skin that either appeared to crack or melt in places. Instead of eyes it had holes through which John could look, instead of a mouth and lips, there was an opening large enough for the breathing part of his gas mask to fit through, including the tubes at the side that made it look like something long and spindly was crawly out of its mouth. The lack of a nose made the entire thing look ghastly and haunting. Like a tormented being that clawed its way back out of hell seeking revenge. More than once it had visibly upset humans before. 

But none of that distracted John from what he actually suspected the real reason was. What he would never say to another person; his deepest shame, his greatest fear. He was sure that if anyone found out, that they would instantly label him as the monster that he thought he truly was. 

“KROOOAAAGH!” one of the pirates screamed out from the midst of the gas cloud. “They finally stumbled upon the first mutilated corpse,” John thought, “about time.”
“It’s blood! It’s blood we’re walking on! Oh Gods, Oh Gods, I can see his intestines, oh, oh-“ another one said until it was interrupted by sounds of hurling and vomiting. 

As the consternation grew from the first wave of pirates, John inhaled deeply through his nose, and even though it was through the gas mask, he could swear the air tasted a tiny bit sweeter. That sweet air was the real reason why John so readily changed the plan. It was the same reason he was so good at psychological warfare and why he both loved and hated his demon mask. 

&amp;nbsp;

The real reason was that John loved to inflict fear and terror in his enemies.

&amp;nbsp;

Not to scare people or give them a small fright, but to get pants-shitting, vomit-inducing, or night terrors kind of fear. Fear that was labeled terror and turned grown men into alcoholics. Terror so profound and deep that it actually made a difference on the battlefield. John loved it, all of it. He’d caught himself more than once being giddy during planning phases, of anticipating the moment; he could hear it, smell it, *feel* it. And when he actually did inflict it, the moment itself? He had relished it, savoured it, and he had remembered almost every single time he did it and how. Each fear-stricken face he saw was his, each memory turned into a trophy. It all made him feel that tiniest bit more alive. 

He was savouring this moment as well, that moment of curiosity; how would alien fear taste like? John pressed the smallest button, on top of the furthest knuckle on his left index finger. As he did he could hear the soft howling of wind and wolves as it slowly rose in volume. And the aliens were shifting and stumbling around at the sudden sound. John smiled; the micro speakers he had purchased back in Amsterdam was the most underestimated weapon in his arsenal. The soft whispers of the alien pirates were increasing and John pushed the furthest button on his right index finger. 

---

“What’s that sound?” one of the pirates said. “Wind? .. and some kind of animal?” another answered. The squad leader looked around; he couldn’t believe it. That damned gas hadn’t disappeared yet so they had to wear those stuffy gas masks that cut your vision to the side. Visibility was less than a meter, and they were walking around in blood. The blood of their fellow pirates; one of them was a friend of his. When he saw the bodies all cut up and displayed like that he almost puked. One of his underlings did and it made the mess they were stepping in even worse. 

“What in the name of the gods are we doing here!? We shouldn’t be here, this is obviously a trap!” another one of the pirates said, now louder, no longer a whisper. 
“Shut it!” the squad leader reprimanded, “We came here with a mission! Find that human troll and kill her. Restore our honour, wipe away the insults and hold the Long Knife’s name up high. 

“Sharp and sticky!” a new pirate in the back spoke, indicating reinforcements and not a target. Still, two of his five underlings pointed their weapons  at him; they were jumpy.

Another sound popped up from the ceiling, and somewhere along the walls. No… it was echoing around. It was a low gurgling sound. The underlings and the squad leader were looking around, but with the masks and the purple gas they couldn’t see anything. “You, tell the rest that we’ll secure the lobby and that the rest can move up the stairwells according to plan. Except for the fifth squad, I want that one to check where the damn sound is coming from” the squad leader grunted out. 
From the corner of his eyes he could see the youngest of the bunch shivering their scales. “Hey, this is all just a trick, all right? Calm down and it’s all going to be fine. What can these humans really do huh?”

“Kill you.. sloooowly.. like the reeessst.” A voice suddenly said. It was hoarse, and gurgling with an electric underbite, as if it was fed through a broken meaty radio receiver. All of the squad raised their weapons at some point in front of them, unaware of where it was coming from. 
“Noooo… look beloooow,” the voice said as it rang out slowly and hoarse again, as if someone said it while inhaling. The squad leader looked down and was staring at a fellow Korvani corpse. “Yeeeesss..”
“HuuUH! HuAARGH!” the junior underlings shouted in surprise as they began shooting its lifeless head again and again until it was burning. 
“Huuuuurgh, whhyyyyy? It.. huuuurts” the coarse voice said again, clearly coming from the body, “huuurgh, you.. ssshhoouuld ruuuuuun. The.. deeemooon isss cooommiiing..”
The junior underling wanted to run; the squad leader could see it. They were flexing their legs and ready their stance; their scales kept shivering. 

He aimed his rifle at him, “No one runs. This is a trick, its dead.” All around him he could hear the steady footsteps of the other squads moving to the stairwells. “Squad five, have you found the source yet?”
“Yes..” a voice on the comm said, “scanners detect some electrical and radio business going on. Not sure what, but I think I can shut it down with the jammers without compromising our own comms. Didn’t really think we’d need it against a handful of humans, but I’m glad we brought along this enormous jammer. Now we just need to unpack it, so hold steady for a minute or s-“

A scream rang out. 

It was back towards the northwestern part of the lobby, right next to the entrance. The flashes of laser fire that immediately followed gave away their location through dull flashes in the purple gas. The squad leader and his underlings raised their rifles and aimed at the same corner. 
“Hold your fire, we can’t see anything-,” the squad leader said. 
More screams rang out. In the span of ten seconds the light of laser fire died one by one and for a single second there was an awful silence. “Squad five.. you there?” 

No response.

“Open fire!” the squad leader shouted as he trained his rifle on that corner. “Shoot at the sides as well!” Six rifles showered a continuous rain down upon the corner, lighting it up once more in a gloomy light, still obscured by the gas. The squad heard the impacts of their fire upon the walls and the glass window, cracking and breaking. They kept their fingers on the triggers and kept firing, again and again, but nothing happened. 

“Hold. HOLD!” the squad leader shouted after being ignored. The dry-heaving clicks of the rifles echoing their disobedience to their owners and the squad leader. “I don’t hear anything. Let’s reload our heat sinks and check it out.” 
“Wait, boss, you want to go over there?” one of the underlings squawked out. 
“Yes, damnit. We go check it out and keep the back clear for the squads that are moving up. Tactics still apply when you’re a pirate,” the squad leader grunted out, “besides, I don’t hear anything.”

“Are you sure about that?” a low and growling, howling voice said, its voice coming from the pirate corpse again.
The squad and their leader instantly aimed at the corpse, still startled and confused, if not extremely unsettled, at the sound coming from the mangled and bloody remains of their former comrade. 
“What are you? Where are you!? Show yourself you coward!” one of the underlings shouted. 
“Oh, I already have..” the low voice growled out. “Do you wish to see me again?” the voice said, this time from behind the group of pirates. 

On instinct, the pirates turned around, trying to pinpoint any movement or sound. Their backs against each other as they nervously looked back and forth over every inch before them; but all they saw was the purple gas drifting all around them, obscuring every detail. 
Then an obscure shadow drifted right past them, and three of the pirates took aim and fired, before it fled from view. 

“Wh-what was that?” one asked. 
“Stay calm, it’ll show itself eventually, it has to get past us to get at the rest up the stairs,” the squad leader answered. 
“Are you sure?” the voice growled out, this time coming from behind them. As the squad turned around and realized it was coming from the corpse again, they quickly turned forward again just in time to see another shadow come towards them. But this time they were too slow to react, as they missed it before it reached them. It hit one of the underlings in the chest and with a thud hit the floor. 

The underling didn’t understand what had just hit him as he looked at it. It had eyes but they were unfocused and off colour. A tongue that drooped, but for the rest it had all the familiar characteristics of a Korvani, except for the clean cut at the neck. 
“.. HRAAAAGH!” the underling shrieked, “IT’S A HEAD! A HEAD!” and started shooting off his rifle in random directions. 

The deep voice growled out once more, angrily rather than amused, “That is how you thank me for my gift? You dare spurn me!? How about I take your head since you won’t accept mine.” 
The squad leader screeched out, “Stop shooting! It’s trolling us; it’s just a human tactic!”
“This is not trolling, this is something else!” said one underling. “Call for backup already!” shouted another. 
“Fine. Squads one through four, we’re going to need some backup, what is your situation like?”
“We are nearing the top, it seems they are on the twelfth floor like we thought. I’m sure we can send squads two and three down. We’ve only encountered light resistance so far; nothing but potshots and fleeing humans.”
“Alright send them down, something bad is happening here and we need help.”

---

“John,” Julia said through the comm unit, “they’ve reached our floor. If you’re going to do something, do it now.”

John pressed the second button on his left index finger. He whispered, “Do you not know who I am? What I am? .. I am a demon and live in the depths of hell. If you truly wish to see me, then first I must make hell come here.”
John smiled as he pushed the second button on his right index finger, triggering the small satchels of explosives in the stairwell doorways on every floor between the ground floor and the twelfth floor. 

---

The squad of Korvani pirates stood around the mutilated corpse confused, tense, and slowly, afraid. With their backs against each other, there wasn’t much that the human could do, if it was just one human. But with the speed that the last squad was taken down; the squad leader had doubts. Then he, it, had spoken again through some hidden device in their fallen comrade’s remains, about something that the comm unit translated into ‘a place of eternal suffering, only for humans’. 

But before they could fully process what that meant multiple explosions rang out through the lobby. The closest to them were loud and powerful, sending chunks of concrete and wood flying towards them, from the direction of the stairwells to the sides of the reception desk. Half of the underlings had fallen down and seemed to shiver their scales so much that it was clear that they’d prefer to stay down. 
“Get up, get up, get up! Check if the stairwells are still open,” the squad leader shouted, struggling to keep his scales still. 

The squad leader frantically looked around as the wind from the explosion blew away some of the purple gas cloud, only to be replaced by slightly more transparent dust and debris. He kept scanning as only one of his underlings responded to his commands and moved to the nearest stairwell. “Come on, get up, you sand lickers, none of you are wounded!” he shouted once more. 
He tapped his comm unit, still looking around as the purple gas slowly mixed with the dust, “Squad 1 through 4, what happened?”

But instead of the reply he wanted he received a different ping and accepted it, “Squad 5,” a gruff voice said, “this is Captain Korqinus, I am unable to re-establish contact with the other squads after we heard the explosions, what’s the situation?” 
“I’m not sure, but I think it’s just the doorways that collapsed sir. None on my team were injured, so it wasn’t serious and I’m having one of my underlings check it out,” the squad leader huffed out.
“We’ve also been trying to raise the jamming squad before the explosion, what is their situ-“
“-NOO, HRAAH,” the squad leader screamed out as he saw his underling get impaled by a long thin silver blade that came out of nowhere, as if the gas cloud itself had spawned it. 
The blade retreated in an instant and faster than a Korvani could swing or stab a blade; it reappeared and without a sound slipped into the side of the underling’s neck, killing him instantly. 

With a wordless shout the remaining squad members opened fire, recreating the same eerie gloom of light in the purple gas cloud. “Hrah! Where are you!? Show yourself you coward!” the squad leader shouted out once more. 
That very same instant the squad leader spotted a shadow in the clouds to his right, towards the entrance and started firing at it, only to realize to late that it was a small thrown object. The squad leader stared at what seemed to be a small canister, as it landed in the middle of the squad. “Grenade!” one of the underlings shouted out, as they all scrambled for cover.

The canister popped and merely produced more of the thick purple gas. The squad leader, trying to find out where it came from was taken by surprise by a kick to the side. In an instant he was on the ground and with a few sharp kicks and punches to his hand from sources he couldn’t see, he dropped his rifle. A last punch dropped the squad leader to the ground.

But even the Korvani are outmassed by the humans by roughly ten percent, they were considered hardier thanks to their armor like scales. A scant few seconds later the squad leader opened his eyes again and tried to re-orient himself and find out where all the screaming was coming from. 
He snapped his neck around, realizing once more in what kind of danger he was in. It was just in time to see a dark shadowy figure, obscured by the purple gas, moving with the grace of a professional dancer, ducking and twirling, crouching and then jumping up again, like the gas itself, flowing between the underlings. And every time its arms stretched out, those same blades popped out with amazing speed. Like an industrial piston his blows landed, pushing out with frightening speed and retracting just as fast, and often immediately followed by horrid screams of anguish. 

Much like the jamming the squad, the screams were over in ten seconds. The shadowy figure then slowly turned towards the squad leader, whose eyes were now bulging in shock and fear. He was crawling on his back, trying to get some distance, to get away, but all he did was make more sound for that *thing* to find him. A handful of dreaded footsteps later and the squad leader could begin to vaguely see the figure through the gas cloud. 

With each step more the figure became clearer. It was wearing a black suit and definitely had the form of a human, though its head and lower arms were too big, probably because of a gas mask and the blades that it was holding. Then he could see what he was wearing, a skin tight black suit of some kind that seemed to suck in the light itself. “No..”, the squad leader stammered out as he finally saw the face, that horrid and grotesque face that resembled molten and charred flesh with an agonized expression, eyes that dimly lit up in the dark and disgusting tendrils that came out of its mouth, writhing with every step the beast took.  “What are you,” the squad leader shouted out, his eyes bulging in surprise as he noticed the horns that this creature had, “you aren’t human, you can’t be human, WHAT ARE YOU!?”.

A low growling voice came from its mouth, somehow along with numerous other human beasts howling along with him, “Like I said.. a *demon from hell*.” 
As the demon started laughing, the squad leader’s scales shivered as he saw that same dark purple gas pouring out of this ‘demon’s’ mouth. It wasn’t a gas mask at all, it was something else entirely, something horrifying, something so gruesome and terrifying that he didn’t have a word for it. It was simply a human demon, a creature of nightmares.

“No! NO! Have mercy, please! Mercy!” the squad leader begged.
“Run,” the demon growled out in answer, “run and tell the rest of the galaxy that I have found something other than humans to torment. Tell them that I am coming.” 
As the squad leader scrambled up and ran towards the entrance, towards his other pirate comrades, he could hear nothing but the mad howling laughter behind him.

&amp;nbsp;

“Sweet indeed,” John said with a truly wicked smile. Trouble was finally here. 

&amp;nbsp;

He opened another channel on his comm unit and made contact with the captain on the twelfth floor. “Hey captain,” John said as he shrugged his shoulders and let out some tension and stress, “I took care of the squads downstairs, so you can come down and pick up the bodies for the next phase. I take it we took no casualties upstairs?”

“That’s correct, special commander,” the captain said with a gruff voice, “though we did have some close calls and slight burn marks. You could’ve triggered those explosives a few seconds earlier. But I guess it’s hard to time those things properly. Well, don’t wait for us, we’re re-activating the elevators and coming down and we’ll tell you when we’re ready. You still think they’ll fall for the next trick?”

“They fell for Julia’s insults to their masculinity, didn’t they?” John answered. “Besides, I sent them a little messenger to help set the mood.” John strolled towards the corner where he had first hid and opened up his black leather suitcase. He checked the gas and pressure levels in his remaining gas canisters on his HUD and decided to be prudent. He popped out a gas canister from under his mouth and one at his back side and replaced them both with some more from his suitcase. He clicked them into place and re-checked his HUD again, lighting his visor up once more. As he redistributed some of the gas levels he heard a few valves opening and closing and the flow of pressurized gas moving back and forth. 

He smiled, “Time for round 2,” he said to himself as he pushed the closest buttons that were on the side of the closest index finger knuckles, popping out the thin silver blades out from the batons that were attached to the underside of his arms. He pushed them again and the blades retracted back into the batons and started walked towards the lobby’s entrance and headed for the plaza.

---

Captain Korqinus’s day was getting worse and worse. In response to the earlier ridiculous hostage breakout of the humans, where his men claimed that an ‘ indestructible big black blob that spewed gas’ was responsible, he had wanted to send dozens of squads to retake them. But reports of noxious gasses meant that he could only equip a mere handful of squads with gasmasks. He didn’t expect that, because really, who in their right mind uses gas warfare these days? 

He wasn’t a captain just because his uncle led the Long Knife pirate clan however; it was also because he had some good instincts and tactical expertise. On a hunch he had sent a jammer team along, as he was quite suspicious of the strange reports that just a single human was able to take out his own squad, whilst unarmed and blindfolded. It didn’t make sense and was beyond fantasy. The humans were clearly playing a tactic of sorts, it was clear, but Korqinus simply didn’t have the time to prepare. Honour demanded he respond now as the humans dared sling their insults over an electronic magnifier, using their disgusting trolling trick. A trick or a trap they may have set up, but Korqinus was confident that the humans had little to no weapons, and any resistance would quickly fall to a mass assault of 5 squads. 

But just as the squads were entering the lobby more bad news came about. It seemed that the local police had finally summoned enough courage and were staging assaults. This wasn’t so bad since they had prepared for this and were in entrenched positions around the plaza, if not for the fact that they recalled ship patrols on the other side of the star system. They only had 10 ships, equipped with outdated tech and going pitifully slow, but it still warranted a response as they could still pack a punch if they fought together and isolated some of the pirate ships. 

Counting only fight worthy ships, Korqinus was in command of 24 ships, but if he wasn’t careful with his maneuvering he would expose the many troop transports and empty freighters that were supposed to go back to their hideout full of loot and hostages.  Still he had the advantage in both numbers and firepower and the matter was quickly being settled, until he heard the explosions. 

Squads one through four were not responding, nor was the jamming squad. The only one who responded was the squad leader of the fifth squad and he, well, Korqinus regretted not shutting off the channel to his comm unit. He and his men, along with any other of his underlings that happened to have turned to his frequency could all hear the events as they unfolded. At first it was slow and confusing, until the tense silence was broken by screams and laser fire. Then silence for just a single cruel moment, until it was broken only by the pleas for mercy by the squad leader. Then came a warning: “A demon..”, Korqinus thought to himself. 

“What nonsense,” the captain said out loud, unwilling to show weakness as he suppressed the urge to shiver his scales, “We have the numbers and the guns, we’ll take them down. We’re pirates, gods be damned, and no one is as ruthless and cunning as we are!” His men cheered along with him and went for their guns, preparing for battle. But somewhere deep inside his mind Korqinus couldn’t help but wonder if this was some kind of bad omen, this demon. 

He believed he could muster enough courage in his men to make sure they could recapture their prize, just so that he could finally go back to why he left his spaceship in the first place; interrogation. That human bitch had probably recuperated somewhat by now and he’d have to start all over again. 
But bad news kept pouring in. The same squad leader that was made to run, to flee like a mewling coward had crossed the plaza and was now screaming nonsense, warning all the other men to run and flee. Shouting that he had never seen anyone fight like that ever before. That his underlings never stood a chance. That he witnessed a dance of death, of guts and steel and nothing but fear. 

By the time the captain had arrived he saw a few of his men already glancing about nervously, or making questioning glances towards him. Korqinus sighed internally, for he had only one option left for that poor man. Korqinus had taken out his side arm, aimed it at the back of the gibbering squad leader’s head and pulled the trigger, flash frying his brains in an instant. He looked down at the squad leader’s tongue that drooped out of its mouth and grunted, suppressing his sigh. “We are Korvani! We are pirates! We are the Long Knife! We are raid, pillage and plunder!” the captain shouted out loud in front of dozens of men, “No cowards in the Long Knife, nothing but ruthless bastards!” Once more his men shouted and cheered, but the captain couldn’t help but notice that it was a bit less of them this time. 

“Ca-captain,” one of his underlings stammered out as the captain returned to the top floor, “th-the scouts are re-re-re-“.
“Out with it!” the captain growled. He could not afford to show weakness, that was not the Korvani way.
“Th-the demon, he’s at the pla-plaza, sir!”
The captain aggressively stormed towards the window to get a better view. What he saw made his eyes bulge in surprise; one of the few things they had in common with humans. 

A human shaped *thing* walked across the plaza, towards the large human statue of a female in the center. It had a black suit that seemed to draw in the light itself, so dark it was. On the sides of its arms it seemed to carry blindingly reflective metal bracers or a long tube of some kind that shielded its face as some of the underlings started shooting at it. But behind it was an enormous cloud of purple gas that drifted a bit, but mostly hung to the back of the creature following it like a billowing cloak. The slow pace was agonizing, confusing, more so when the captain saw it taking multiple hits. 

“Heat dispersion armor,” the captain grumbled, realizing he had gotten an answer that only raised more questions. “Where did the humans get such advanced nano technology?” he grumbled once more. He waved one of his underlings over, “get the kinetic weapons, now!” As Korqinus turned back he saw the human climb up the statue in a surprisingly swift manner. Then again Korvani didn’t evolve such long arms and were not used to climbing, which was probably the main reason it seemed so fast.. a bit too fast. Perhaps it was the gas that flowed freely from its hands, making the human seem like it had flown straight from the clouds itself. 

&amp;nbsp;
But then it had finished its climb on top and lowered his arms that were covering its face. In its place a nightmarish vision appeared and for once, Korqinus visibly shivered his scales. The day only seemed to get worse and worse.

&amp;nbsp;

A horrifying face that didn’t move, had glowing eyes and a mouth that had gods damned *tendrils* coming out of it, or going in, Korqinus didn’t really know and didn’t really care. He aimed his laser pistol and was about to shoot when the creature [spoke]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHR7GKEG89o). It began with a.. howl of some kind, from a creature that Korqinus did not recognize. The only thing he could imagine, as the howl subsided and the growls became louder and louder, was that of an ancient great beast, like those in Korvani prehistory that had hunted them with an unrelenting bloodlust leaving only carnage and ruins. 

“Come then, you Korvani, my dear and precious new prey. Come, and be *murdered*,” the beast growled out impossibly loud. Korqinus, along with many others, had trouble suppressing their scales from shivering. He swallowed and fired from his pistol, shouting into his comm unit as he opened all lines, “all squads, fire! Engage it now! It’s only one human!” having completely forgotten about the kinetic guns waiting in a box nearby. 

---

“All right, captain, Julia, you can begin giving covering fire, my armor is slowly overheating,” John whispered, “and make sure you don’t let them see that it’s humans who are shooting.”

“Yeah, yeah, we got it,” Julia grunted out as if he was lifting something heavy. “Are you sure you can handle the rest alone?” the captain asked.
“Are you kidding me?” Julia asked, “Did you not see the mess he left behind in the lobby? Poor Max over there is still puking.”
“Yeah, sorry about that,” John muttered, feeling a slight pang of guilt and shame. He wasn’t used to having witnesses to his work. 

“And what the shit was that wolf howl? Was that you too?” Julia asked.
“Yep,” John said.
“What?” Julia asked.
“Uh, can’t talk now, gotta move on to the next part,” John answered quickly and closed the comm line. 
“*What!?*” Julia asked once more. 

John opened his arms wide, as if he was welcoming the incoming deadly fire and quickly selected ‘werewolf sounds &amp; emulator nr.2’ from his HUD as he turned on his megaphone once again.

I've gotten A's in every class I've taken so far, but I always feel like I need to work significantly harder and longer than other people to get the same grades. When we get a large project, I may have to stay up late working on it every night after classes for a week straight just to get it done. 

Somehow I managed to get an internship last summer with a big financial company. The interview had no technical questions and was entirely behavioral. They suggested that the internship itself would be the technical interview. During the internship (2.5 months), I made two CRUD web applications using tools/frameworks I had never heard of (I think they made me use some of them just to see if I could figure them out). I felt like this was pitiful performance, but they asked me to return for this summer. 

While I have that internship already lined up, I've been applying to different ones just to experience something new. Many of them want me to do some kind of online programming challenge. I got the email with a link to one of them today, and i was given 4 hours to complete 4 challenges. I ended up quitting after an hour and a half because I was making such slow progress. I hadn't even finished one of them, or even gotten close. 

This is making think I'll never make it as a software developer. I don't know what to do at this point. I can probably finish my degree because there aren't such strict time limits on projects and I generally do pretty good on exams because I understand the theory behind the topics. But if my programming skills just aren't up to snuff, what's the point? Should I just drop the CS degree and finish with IT and a CS minor, which will only take me a couple extra courses? IT at my school is seriously lacking, so most of my technical knowledge will be from my CS courses regardless. "

* Recent graduate (June 2015)
* 6 months experience in finance + internship in a legal service software company
* Got an interview next week with an Investment Bank and I know they will ask for my salary (I already mentioned my previous salary and the person on the phone said it will be higher than my previous salary, but not going to tell me what it is at this stage)
* I have researched the position and checked for average salary - Yeah its higher than mine.

Now, how do you negotiate salary in an interview? 

I dont want to ask too much and put myself out of the competition for a lesser skilled candidate. On the other hand, I do not want to get the lowest percentile salary bracket as they might think I am not skilled and don't want to under represent myself.

What to do in this case?

43hhms,23,2016-01-30,My friends and I regret majoring in the humanities,throwrockaway,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/43hhms/my_friends_and_i_regret_majoring_in_the_humanities/,"I did it with no debt, yet still I regret it. The only job I found, after almost being unemployed for 5 months after graduation, was one paying $10 an hr in retail. Now I make $12, but I do a lot more. One of my friends who I met on the job, almost age 29, the same major as me (god, I don't even want to say what it is, it's that embarrassing to me now) has never had a paid vacation in her life, and is only now making more than $8 an hour finally.



 My other friend, from college, was going to be a bartender. That was the only job she could find. We both graduated from one of the top colleges in the nation, like it did much for us. She was also a language major. Another friend, a French major, has only found a job for 4 hours a week part time and works an unpaid internship after she graduated in May. 


That seems to be the only thing hiring. There is no money in the humanities, unless you are already rich and well connected. If you need to take out debt, or a lot of debt, and you want to be a history / art / philosophy / English etc major, well, it's ok, we can all work near minimum wage together. 



I am not happy about this at all, trust me. I thought graduating debt free from a top college would help me, or at least not hurt me, but it seems that my choice of major is hindering things. Almost everyone wants computer science / engineering / finance/ accounting. 



If you are not either of those, too bad, no one seems to want us. What do you all think? Do you have a similar experience, or a different one? 


Edit:

I'm not even really saying this for me, I feel like it's too late either way. If anyone else is struggling in picking a major, I want them to make a good, informed choice, and not have people say pick whatever you want, since it did not work out for me or others I know. My area is not the best, but I already moved halfway across the world once, and I don't want to do it again. "

43lj48,1,2016-01-31,Should I switch jobs out of Indirect Tax Accounting?,stonehilljason,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/43lj48/should_i_switch_jobs_out_of_indirect_tax/,"I graduated in June from college with a degree in math/econ. Between June and September I didn't do much career-wise. Since October, I have been working in a very entry-level job (lots of training, I knew nothing about my job's subject matter beforehand) doing taxes at a Tax Software company.

I don't know enough about the job industry / wages for recent college grads with some internship experience to know if: 1) I am being paid reasonably/generate raises 2) There is potential for growth in my department 3) If it's worth looking into other positions at the company 4) The ""best"" strategy to approach potential new employers (if I should be).

43lme6,2,2016-01-31,Working on time line for what I should be doing from now till graduation,RUreddit2017,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43lme6/working_on_time_line_for_what_i_should_be_doing/,"So title sums it up. I am in process of getting a 2nd degree in CS. Since it is a 2nd degree, and I dont need to take random elective classes it is a bit accelerated. I will complete the degree  May 2017 so in all it will be 4 semesters. I am somewhat worried about my ability to get a good job because I have zero time for side projects or building out any sort of portfolio since my course load is a bit insane. I want to look into internships, but kinda at a loss what point/knowledge I should have before being ready to apply for internships.  Also any general advice on what I can be doing to improve my credentials before graduation with a very limited amount of spare time."
