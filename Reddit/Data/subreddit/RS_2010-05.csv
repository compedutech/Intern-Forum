_______________________________________________________

This semester has been a nightmare for me. I'll admit that I did way too much partying and not much of attending class. I have always been somewhat of an intelligent guy, never needing to listen in class and still able to easily obtain a 3.5 GPA. I never expected myself to be in this situation, ever. I just hit a road block this year, without even realizing, I was no longer able to score high on Exams. Well, now after this semester, I know that I have to attend classes now, and actively listen.

I earned under a 1.5 semester GPA this semester, it was my second semester of my Junior year, and my parents have cut me off. I'm not sure as to what actions to take. I want to continue school and retake my classes, but being cut off doesn't quite help the cause.

Oh yeah, I did have a few internship interviews that will give back to me within a week. Hopefully I get one, as that would help my financial situation.

What should I do? Any advice?

I was fortunate (lucky) enough to land a 16/mo internship at IBM doing software development. First, let me say... I'm a finance major, who has taken some CS classes and had some IT jobs in the past. I'm nowhere near as experienced as pretty much everyone on my team who is some kind of engineer/cs major and have never worked on a 'large-scale' project in my life. Started on Thursday and I'm overwhelmed to say the least...


In terms of the actual job, it's mostly php and databases, which I am familiar with.. but once again, on a small scale. During the first few days I pretty much did a lot of nodding and didn't really understand anything that was going on. When I used php before it was mostly for adding OO functionality to the sites I worked on to reduce redudundant coding... my IBM projects are much more complicated.


I'm kind of scared because I really want to do well and learn a lot but I feel that I won't be able to get up to speed with all the technology and start contributing for a LOOONG time. I guess the ONE good thing I can say is pretty much everyone I've talked to feels overwhelmed. Any advice on learning as much as possible as fast as possible besides going through these .php files line by line until I understand what's going on?"
c1ncx,1,2010-05-08,Reddit: have any ideas on how to teach East African's to use ultra cheap laptops?,oivaizmir,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1ncx/reddit_have_any_ideas_on_how_to_teach_east/,"Reddit, I need your creativity,

I've gotten an internship in East Africa starting in August with the NGO One Laptop Per Child (www.laptop.org). My job will be teaching children, aged 6-12, how to use the ultra-cheap XO laptop.

While OLPC is giving me tons of training, I think it would be a mistake to not make use of that constant ingenuity and inventiveness that pervades Reddit. I feel like it would be hard to find a community that has benefited from the internet revolution more than Redditor's, and that it would be a worthwhile task to actually see what sort of ideas we can come up with.

I'm really looking for any ideas that will work to educate these kids on how to use these computers, and to stimulate their curiosity. My ambition is to give these kids every tool I can think of to develop their intellectual curiosity. 

So far, my lesson plans consist of things like scavenger hunts across the internet. I'm sure the Reddit community can do a lot better than that. I am bringing things like a projector, movie camera, movies, etc, to let the kids in on a window of what else there is in the world. If you can think of any novel ways to use things like this, or other things I should bring, I'm all ears.

Any ideas would be more then appreciated; if I make use of anyone's idea I'll definitely give a full report back on how it went. I feel like there is no greater learning tool then the internet, and sincerely believe that it could work to liberate these children from the physical and educational poverty that they are immersed in. To do this, I don't want these kids to be limited by my sub-par teaching skills, or inadequate instruments, but rather only their own curiosity and creativity.

I need a hand Reddit!

c1tr8,13,2010-05-09,"Boss found out I'm looking for a new Job, HELP!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1tr8/boss_found_out_im_looking_for_a_new_job_help/,"***Preface:*** I'm an accountant and I currently work for a staffing firm doing temp work on a salaried basis. It's similar to working at an accounting or law firm minus the defined career path, network and vacation time. I also took a big pay cut (~25%) to get this job and I pay for my own health insurance (I was one of those people who got their Anthem Blue Cross Insurance raised ***over 39%*** last February)

I've been with the company for 7 months. In that time I've exceeded expectations at both clients and I just had my contract renewed with my current client for the second time (supposed to end in March). Problem is, I have no real sense of job security at the firm. They seem to be very concerned about shareholders and not so much about the people earning the profits (high turnover rate). 

For my own career's sake I need to position myself so that I don't get left behind. There is a wage freeze and at some point I need to start making the money that someone in my level of responsibility makes or I'm going to be perceived as damaged goods in the job market (most people make 30% more than I do in the same position nationally, adjusting for the regions cost of living, it's a little higher than that, source: firm's 2010 salary guide). I don't make the rules, but most employers seem to make snap judgments about a person's abilities and skills based on their pay. I made more money as an Auditor Intern in college than I do nearly 4 years out of school as a Senior Accountant. When I asked about a raise my boss mentioned that there is an indefinite wage freeze going on for the *salaried temp staff* because of the economy.

I got a phone call on Friday from my boss mentioning that my contract with the client was extended again. She also mentioned that we need to *""talk about where I see myself in the company""* and I would be meeting with the branch manager this afternoon. So I arrive at the branch after lunch and I spend 4 hours waiting for the manager to come. I asked her coworkers where she was and everyone else in the office. Apparently she was out of the office at a client. I'm only obligated (paid) to put in my 8 hours, so I left at 4:30pm.

I'm pretty sure they found my resume out there during the time I've been applying for jobs (past month or so). I'm wondering what I should do. When I do meet with the manager I plan on playing up the angle that: ""I am concern about my job security and I'm doing what I need to do to protect myself in case I do lose this job, since I'm not sure that I'd be employed after this current contract is up (was just extended recently, was going to expire at the end of May)"".

**Edit 1:** My question is, what should I do when I am confronted by the manager? What are the odds that they are going to outright try and fire me?

**Edit 2:** I just got a call from one of the places I applied to over the past month (well known company in town). They want me to come in for an interview on Thursday of this week. I feel a little better knowing that I have two potential places of employment if the staffing agency situation deteriorates (the second being the current client which is still looking for a senior accountant. The staffing agency loses out on their $20,000 referral fee if they fire me and I end up getting hired by their client). 

***Summary:***  I'm a salaried temp worker at a staffing firm with little job security and the lowest pay I've had in my professional career, with the most responsibility I've ever had. I suspect my boss found out I've been searching for jobs and wants me to meet with the branch manager to discuss my future with the firm. What should I say to the manager when she confronts me?"

TL;DR version at the bottom.

So I'm about to finish my third year as a computer science student at a tier 2 UC. I interviewed at this company that does user verification(stuff to battle against fraud and such). I had an interview with the head of operations(a CS guy also but does more management stuff now) and he seemed to like me. After I talked to him, he brought in two of the programmers who asked me questions I had answers to. I was quite charming with the interviews as I usually am, getting chuckles out of them every now and then. They left the room and the head of operations came in saying that they really liked me and he was going to give me a little assignment to make sure I knew my stuff. He gave it to me on monday night and said to have it to him by thursday. I finished it on wednesday telling him that I really enjoyed the assignment because I got to learn(mentioning that it was the first time I had to run an apache server and code in a J2EE environment).

he said he would get back to me in a couple of days so I followed up the next monday asking if they had filled the position or not and that I was still interested.
His response to my follow up was that they haven't decided yet and are having a directors meeting the next day so they should have an answer soon.

It has been 6 days since that response and I haven't heard anything back. I'm beginning to worry that they are passing over me which would be normal except that I interviewed at a bunch(about 4-5) of internships over the year and this one felt really good(even offered them my full time over summer and part time over the year).

so my question is, should I re-follow up with them or just wait; if I re-follow up, what should I say?

TL;DR version: I followed up with a computer science internship I was very confident on about a week ago, they said they were going to have a directors meeting the next day and would have an answer soon. It's been about a week and haven't heard, should I re-follow up?"

I'm working on a special project with my parent's wireless home network.  Turns out my summer internship is close enough to my parents' place that I'm going to be living with them and saving on rent... the only problem is their dinosaur of a Linksys WRT54G they have burried in the bottom of the kitchen closet underneath what might as well be a lead bucket for all the signal strength I get in my room at the other end of the house.... 

I purchased a NETGEAR WNDR3700 at BestBuy today to play around with the possibility of using a newer, stronger, more capable and feature-rich router to piggy-back and establish a second, private wireless network in the house just for my computers.  If what I'm outlining below doesn't work, I'm just gonna return the new router and forget the whole thing, but having to wait ~20 minutes for hulu to load is ridiculous. 

NOTE: Hard-wiring is obviously not an option, and I only plan on utilizing the ""wireless-G"" 2.4 GHz capability of the new box. 

I've changed the LAN IP address of the new router to 192.168.1.99 to avoid the conflict with the default address of the dinosaur downstairs.  I also shut off the new box's DHCP server.  Is this all I should watch out for?  Besides the obvious, (modifying the SSID and security settings for the new network) I can't think of anything else that stands in my way of just plugging the new box into one of the old box's ethernet jacks via one of it's own ethernet jacks.  Am I right?

Thanks in advance!

Extra info:  (Will edit to answer questions)

I've changed the wireless channel to 1 for the new network, as the old network is currently configured to use channel 11."

I got an internship for a well known company doing software development. I got this job almost entirely through networking (basically my prof gave me an in). The thing is, I'm not a CS/SE major and my skillset doesn't even come close to my co-workers. I'm taking business with a minor in computer science, but I haven't done any programming for well over a year.


I've been there for 2 weeks and I'm really struggling with it. Since a lot of my team members are global, I have around 2 hours of meetings a day, where I pretty much just sit around twiddling my thumbs because I have no idea about anything they're talking about. I guess I could rationalize by saying this is pretty normal and all the other interns are experiencing the same thing but it feels really shitty to sit around being a mute for 2 hours.
Now my actual work, I'm coding at like snail speed. It's incredibly difficult to jump into the middle of a project that has multiple ten thousand line function lists and being productive when you're working with such knowledgeable and experienced people while I'm sitting there trying to figure out something basic like why this relative path won't work for a good two hours.


I've been trying my best to catch up and have been reading a few PHP books but when I observe some of my team members working on something it's embarrassing how much more productive they are. They are all very nice and answer all my questions, but the questions taht I really want to ask are sometimes so simple I often end up trying to figure it out on my own since I think it would be embarassing to ask. I guess the positive side is that I have an amazing company to put on my resume and I'm learning a ridiculous amount everyday in a challenging and fun environment, but it sure does feel shitty knowing that I can't effectively contribute to my team as much as I want too.


Anyone been in a similar experience? 16 month internship, btw... i want to hopefully make it through all the way without getting canned!"

One of our major clients is a school district, comprised of six different schools, including a high school.  Two days a week for the next few weeks, I'm on site deploying new software on all of the computers.  This involves entering each classroom during class time and touching the teacher's computer and any student computers that are in the room.
The other day, I was on site, and getting lunch at a local burger place by myself, when I saw four built, football player-type kids eating, whom I had seen earlier that day in class.  Now, I am required to dress nicely for the job.  I'm well groomed, and I dress well.  I am certainly not gay nor do I project any sort of gay vibe, to my knowledge.

I kinda look at him, and he goes ""just kidding"" and turns around to eat, while his friends snicker.  I blow it off as kids being stupid and go to order. On my way out, they say the same thing as I'm walking out the door. I keep walking.
Two days later, I'm on site again, and see the same four waiting for me outside of the school.  I walk by, and after I pass, they yell the same.  I turn around, and one of them yells ""DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, FAGGOT"".  I kept walking and ignored them again.
I'm about 5'11"" and a climber.  I'm in good shape, but not built.  I couldn't take any of these kids, assuming that confrontation is even the best option in this scenario, although it might be what my testosterone suggests...  Obviously, they're minors and I am a contractor for the school, so anything of that nature would definitely not rule in my favor.  I feel shitty ignoring these kids, it's hard to do.
