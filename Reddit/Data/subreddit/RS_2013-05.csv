1dicz2,167,2013-05-01,My time at a public elementary school,workaccount45,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1dicz2/my_time_at_a_public_elementary_school/,"I had graduated from college about a year before and was desperately looking for full-time employment.  I should note here I studied marine engineering, not computers/networks (did take a C++ VB class at one point), but I know my way around them pretty well. So like many others who post here, I'm not IT, but savvy enough with google to figure it out.  


In any case, an opportunity popped up for an ""internship"" position at a local elementary school whose district had just gotten a fat load of grant money for tech upgrades across the board.  The goal was to help select and implement hardware improvements across the district.  

My responsibilities included, but were definitely not limited to, researching and selecting age appropriate classroom hardware/software, instructing teachers in use of existing systems and programs (normally on the day that I learned of them and figured out how to make them work myself), troubleshooting minor issues, exchaning bad/faulty/worn hardware, maintaining the local website, etc.  The list goes on and on; I basically did whatever I was asked to do, no matter how innane. I didn't even spend more than 6 months on this job, but I still managed to get a few tales.  

The first is just silly:

So I'm sitting in my closet/office using one of three computers set up for the ""grant team"" working on the website content when suddenly a Wild Educator (WE) appears!

**WE**: ""Mr. Work!  Oh, good, I found you!""  

I was assigned the ESL school in the district, and this teacher had a heavy accent but was intelligible. 

**45**: ""What's up?""   *it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere*

**WE**: ""My screen is just flashing."" He opens and closes his hands rapidly to emphasize this. ""Flashing, and I can't get it to do anything""

**45**: ""Hmm, could be the video card failed...""  It had happened to a machine earlier in the week, so it wasn't outside the realm of possibility.  Some of the machines the teachers used were quite old and not well maintained.    ""Well, lets go take a look,"" I said, fearing the worst.

I sit down at the computer and look at a screen that could be used to induce epileptic siezures.  Wiggling the mouse... it moves just fine.  I notice Word is open and the search/find box is open.  

**45**: ""Has it ever done this before?  Did this just start?""

**WE**: ""No, never.""  He shakes his head earnestly.  

I close the search/find box and it instantly re-opens, screen still flashing, but i noticed something.  I hold down the mouse button down and the flashing stops.  

I look down at the keyboard.  I see the lower edge of the moniter devouring the F5 key.  I remove the keyboard from the gaping maw, flashing stops.  Everything works fine.  

**45**: ""Well that seems to have fixed it, let me know if you need anything else.""     He looks slightly ashamed at this point, and thanks me as I head back by my closet.  

~~                                                                                         ~~

The other story I have for you involves a teacher of particular brilliance.

**TOPB**:  ""Mr Work, I think I have a virus.""

Great, I'm thinking.  The network was pretty secure, so I'm puzzeled as to how she managed this.

I get to the computer and find all desktop icons missing (This teacher normally had her entire desktop filled with icons), startbar missing, default background, and a cursor.  

**45**: ""Can you tell me what happened right before this occured?""

**TOPB**: ""Yeah, I was trying to open an email I got from my friend about herpaderp activity for the kids.   I tried to open it at home but my antivirus wouldn't let me.""

**FACEDESK**^FACEDEsk^FACEdesk^FACedesk^Facedesk^facedesk

**45**: ""Let me get this straight.  Your *antivirus* at home detected a *virus*, and so instead of deleting it, you sent it here to open it?""

I call up the district admin over our school and tell him the situation.  After much facedesking, registry cleaning, and ultimately reimaging, the machine is functional.  

TOPB received some coaching in common sense.  

**TL:DR: THESE PEOPLE TEACH OUR CHILDREN!!!!**

1diblg,58,2013-05-01,Thank you all.,dcastro9,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1diblg/thank_you_all/,"You're sitting here, Freshman year, thinking, wow, this is going to be impossible. It feels like every professor is out to get you, it feels like you won't have the strength to power through it, I get it, its near damn impossible to succeed. What will I do? Your first exam is a 40, when you've never done below an 80. Everything you saw in orientation was far from what the reality was. You are going through the worst, you think to yourself, there's no way I can actually do this.

That's fucking bullshit. Listen very carefully, the classes you will go through at this place will seem impossible. It will seem as if highschool was a silly joke. They will test your ability to plan ahead, to be organized,  to know when each and every exam is, and to utilize every resource in your power to come even close to succeeding. You will go through a hundred impossible scenarios and still come in far from being able to answer that question on that one exam where the professor could have given less shit about you.

Sure, you can be mad. You can be angry that this place had no sympathy for your skill. You can leave, drop out and change schools, if you don't have the willingness to put in the strength and dedication that it takes to succeed, you will not make it. But if you do, there is nothing in life that will fucking stop you from tackling the future with a tenth of the effort you put in here.

But you think you have it bad? Look around you. Please, do me a favor and have a look at the world. You’re at an institution that will mold you to be the best, and you think you’re suffering? You have no idea what suffering even means. Toughen up because its now or never. Don’t make a decision you’ll regret, when your sheer willpower could push you to bigger and better places. You’ve fucking got this.

Like I said, this place is built to make the best of the fucking best. Georgia Tech students are far more hard-working than any other people I have met in my life. This place has prepared me for anything. I’ve gone through internships and it felt like I was on vacation. This place is like an unforgiving father who wouldn't take no for an answer. Georgia Tech didn't take my shit, it told me to toughen up and actually read every paper, chapter and word the professor sent out. It told me that the half-effort I had put in through highschool simply wouldn’t be enough. You’ve grown up living a lie if you think high school was hard. You need to buckle up and actually figure this shit out. The spoon-fed bullshit is over. This is real life.

Georgia Tech told me that studying would not be enough, that success required that you went above and beyond your strength and put in 110%. It molded me into a stronger, more confident individual that I would have not been had I gone to any other school. I've visited friends at various competing institutions and I have never seen the dedication that I see here. I'll be graduating in three days, and all I can say is thank you.

Thank you all for helping me push through this school when all else was against me. Thank you for helping me keep going. For all of you who are fighting the tough fight, keep on fucking going. This is a difficult institution for a reason. You will learn far more than Physics when you take the class, you will learn discipline. Trust me, keep pushing forward. Don’t let anybody stop you from succeeding. Push away from every single distraction, the end of the road is fucking worth it.

I know that when I look in the eyes of another Georgia Tech graduate, I know what they've been through. We've been through this battle together, and we've fought each and every professor, together. We have defeated the roughest of times, and we have what it takes to succeed. There are very few institutions out there that come even close to this privilege. Don’t take it lightly. However many years you spend here will change your life forever once you’ve graduated.

Thank you all. My undergraduate career has been a phenomenal ride, and I simply would not be here if it wasn’t for each and every one of you out there. Keep pushing strong."

Thank you for looking at this!

I'm a Junior attending a somewhat reputable university pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science.

It's hard. I'm not a savant by any means, but I love what I do, and I want to do this for a living.

It's always been my dream to work in the tech industry.

Being that I'm graduating next year, and that I'm absolutely certain I want to live in California post-graduation, I want to do an internship in the San Francisco area this summer to begin making connections and acclimating to the area.

I started applying to internships as early as February. I haven't given up, but I'm really discouraged. I know I could do really great things if I got the chance, and the advising, but I'm supposed to in a week and I still have nothing.

I have a passion for design, writing, graphics, web development, and working with a bad ass team on really exciting things.

I know I'm naive to expect this would be easy, but I'm lost as to what to do now. I'll continue applying everywhere I can find.

Again, thank you for looking at this. I appreciate that you even read this far :)

Warm regards,

Vaude

EDIT:

I've applied at internships through interhsips.com, internmatch.com, monster.com, indeed.com, craigslist.com, careers.stackoverflow.com, careerbuilder.com, and a few proprietary job boards.

I am a junior undergrad math major I go to a top liberal arts school and I haven't thought about what I am going to do after I graduate until now. 

My internship search this past semester has been horribly unsuccessful. I tried mostly for finance internships but due to my lack of experience (who knew that mattered) I didn't get any offers. 

So here is my situation: I know some CS, some functional programming, some java, etc. I don't know algorithms but am willing to work on that over the summer. 
These happen to be the only hard skills I have. 

My question: Should I take a gap year to gain more experience and study for interviews or should I just go into my senior year and hope I get a full time job from on campus recruiting?  

I am feeling pretty bad right now since I spent the last few summers learning languages and doing research in labs, instead of spending time at an internship. I guess I just bought into the whole liberal arts thing a bit too much.

What do you recommend I do??

In a couple weeks when I graduate, I will have a lot more free time, and want to use some of it to learn a new language/framework. I want to learn a new language/framework for the fun of it, but it would be nice if that language/framework can increase my value as a developer.

I have a few web/mobile apps I wan't to build as personal projects using this language as the RESTful backend. (I want to learn REST too).

I am very experienced with Java, however I have not used a lot of mainstream frameworks. I know how to use servlets, JSP scriptlets, JSF, Tomcat, and an unheard-of web service framework that my company uses. I also am pretty familiar with Groovy because Groovy is used in said web service framework.

I know basic javascript and jQuery, but I am definitely no expert. 

I have played around with Ruby and done a few homework assignments in the language and was very, very pleased with it. 

I know lots of C and little C++

I know a little Python, Perl, PHP, and Scheme from various school projects.

I am interested in exploring Spring, Play!, Scala, Lift, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, node.js, clojure, or dart. 


Basically I read /r/programming and all of the blogs, but never have enough time to actually learn one of these things.

What technologies actually have employment incentives? What technologies are just fun to learn?

Taking that job was the biggest mistake of my life. I hate computers, and once you've been labeled a computer guy, your life is over outside of the industry. 

I scrimped and saved and lived like I was poor so that I could get out of computers. I planned, and waited. I set up a (non-paying, of course) internship in an industry I like, and quit. I got out. It was glorious. I spent a year at the internship, and when that was up I went looking for jobs where there were none. At least for me.

I took classes and submitted resumes. I did gratis and freelance work to pump up my resume. I took more classes in related fields. I watched the other people I interned with get hired and do well while no one would take a chance on me. 

After 4 years of that, my money ran out and I started looking for anything I could get. I couldn't get clerical jobs in the industry. I couldn't get coffee shop jobs to keep me afloat. I couldn't get any kind of job whatsoever. I did manage to get one job that really wasn't too horrible, and the owner of the company paid me in bounced checks and moved to Africa.

So I tried to kill myself. I was locked in a hospital for over a week and sent an embarrassingly large bill for it. The state refused to cover me for reasons I never really figured out; I just got stuck with the bill.

So now I'm back in computers. Because, apparently, hard work and dedication are worthless. Skill is worthless. Talent is worthless. All that matters is where society decides you should work. You're done doing anything else. And just to rub salt in the wound, since I'd been out of the computer industry for nearly 5 years I'm now getting paid shit. At the end of the month, I have $20 left over.

This is not a life worth living."

I'm a CS undergraduate in Scotland. Just about finished my second year with averages of around 80%, was on the deans list last year.

At the minute I'm doing little bits of freelance web development work for people I know, and finding some work online.

However, as for looking for a proper job for the 5 months of summer I'm finding it impossible. I don't want to travel far which makes it more difficult.

For fixed term developer work (mainly web), most require a degree or a certain number of years experience in certain technologies. Companies don't seem to understand that you someone can do work to a high level without these things.

As for internships, pretty much all companies seem to be looking for students in between 3rd and 4th year, and ignore students before this stage. The university offered work for 2nd year students and then took it back and made it only for 3rd year.

I need some help in how to network for technical jobs, and how to get work without a degree. Tips on getting more and better freelance work would also be helpful.

I've been out of school for almost a year now and I haven't been able to land too many interviews. I've had my resume critiqued by my professor, engineering professionals, as well as friends. I guess it's time to see what Reddit has to say. 

As of today I've submitted 170 applications to various engineering companies and organizations throughout my state. I've had a total of 3 interviews. Company A was a one and done interview, Company B had me come back for a second interview but I didn't get the job, and finally the interview with Company C was straight up bad. I've also tried to apply to as many internships as I can but a lot of companies want students.

In regards to my resume:

* I had a crappy GPA (&lt; 3.0) so that's why it's not listed.
*  I didn't have any jobs/internships/research/volunteer work while I was in school (yes I'm kicking myself for not getting an internship; I had to take summer school practically every summer)

I am back in my home town in the summer.  My parents are poor, I live broke but I do what I can to make sure that I stay in school which means that I have to try to work as many hours as I can during the summer.

For the second summer in a row I am returning to Giant Tiger, they offer me about 20 hours a week but with call ins I almost always end up with around 35 hours a week. 

I recently have been given the opportunity to take up a job as an intern for a downtown development position which has to do with dealing with numerous local businesses and event planning which would be amazing experience for my resume as I am a business student.  This job is 35 hours a week guaranteed, sometimes more.  So my plan was to work weekends and occassional evening shifts at Giant Tiger and work the intern job racking me up about 50-60 hours a week.  The main catch with the intern job however is that it ends at the beginning of August.

I didn't see it as a problem but when Giant Tiger found out the managers started bullying me about it. 2 managers each one at a time confronted me on the floor telling me that I better not take this intern job as they want me to cover shifts and if I am not available to the shifts they want me to then they don't want me here.  The managers seem completely unwilling to negotiate but I want to try to explain to them my situation more formally.  

I have been working with Giant Tiger for years, am a known hard worker and well loved among the staff, not to mention that I always take extra unscheduled shifts without even a grunt and this is the way they treat me.  They have many other staff with barely any hours who are looking for more hours but insist that I be there to take them rather than just giving the hours to the other people.

I am broke and need to make all the money I can, so if I stay at Giant Tiger I will likely make more money however I can not get a second job while there.  If I get a job with the city it is great job experience for my resume but it ends in august and now I'm unemployed for a month.

1dn1s2,3,2013-05-03,2nd Bachelor's vs. Potential job offer?,IcyRadish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dn1s2/2nd_bachelors_vs_potential_job_offer/,"So I just got out of a job interview for an entry-level Software Developer position that seems like it would be a great fit for me (I love the working environment, the people, the hours are flexible, I feel like I could learn and grow a lot from working there) except for one big catch -- since it is a consulting type position where I would potentially have to fly out and work with clients on-site for weeks at a time, it conflicts with my previous plans of going back to school for a BS in CS.

Some background on me: Previous BA in Biological Sciences at a prestigious almost-Ivy school. Realized after graduation that what I really want to do is be a programmer, instead. Took a bunch of CS classes at the local community college and was planning on transferring to the state university (it has a pretty highly regarded CS department) this upcoming fall to pursue a post-bacc BS in CS. 

Tentative plan was to graduate by 2015 (with work/internships on the side), then potentially pursue an MA in HCI (looking at CMU's program), then move out to a location I'd like to live for the long-term (Bay Area, maybe) and settle down (by the time I finish all that I'll be in my late 20's... I'd like to start having children by my early 30's).

Now here is my big question - job or degree? I have no previous job or internship experience in the CS field and I had been hoping that being in a respected CS undergrad program would afford me greater opportunities to get my foot into the door, but if there's already a potential job that seems promising, do I still need it?

I know that not all companies care if you have the degree as long as you can code, but I've also read that that in many cases you need to get past the HR first before you meet the people that determine whether or not you can code? I'd rather have that security already there in place and get my degree when I'm still relatively young, than come to regret not having a degree and going back for it when I am much older. At the same time, from reading this subreddit, it seems that work experience is super-valuable as well, and I don't know if I'd come to regret passing up this opportunity to work at this growing company where I'd get to wear a lot of hats and learn a ton of things I can't learn in the classroom.

Unfortunately the university doesn't offer nighttime or online classes. There was always the option of a Master's (since I already have a BA) but even with evening classes I doubt they'd let me disappear for weeks at a time. The only other alternative I can think of is online classes - I've been considering the BS at UMUC (I'm also a Maryland resident) and that seems feasible, except I'm worried about whether getting an online degree from there would be a positive or negative on my resume? And what the quality of their education is? Does anyone have any experience with their program? Would places like Google/Microsoft bother being interested in me with an online degree? Also, would it affect my chances of getting into a top grad school?

Apologies for the wall of text, and any answers to my questions or extra perspectives would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much!

**TL;DR: Currently trying to change career paths, decent background knowledge but no work experience. Potential developer job (that requires travel) incompatible with my plan to get a BS (2nd degree) in CS at a decently-ranked school starting this fall. What should I do? And would an online BS in CS at a lesser-known school be an advisable alternative?**"

[You've met Edward James Olmos. Does his voice rumble through you like a distant thunder when you are in his presence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r6aq4?context=5)|Eddie and I are pretty close.  He's an amazing man, and yes, he does exude this natural gravitas that's undeniable.  We call him the Admiral.  He even signs emails like that.  He's awesome. A very inspiring guy.
[How did that Watchtower cover come about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4p55?context=5)|It was a Ron Moore idea.  He had wanted to use it since Season 1.  Finally, Season 3 gave him the perfect chance.  Oddly, though, he gave me no real input for what it should sound like, so I had complete creative freedom to interpret it and change it as I saw fit.  
[Bear, will you score my life in real-time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4gr5?context=5)|Solo accordion and banjo work for you?
[Of the entire Battlestar score, what was your favourite piece to compose, or what were you most proud of? Me and my friend personally love Kara Remembers and are in the process of learning the duet. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r551a?context=5)|You guys are learning the duet!?  Wow!  Will you post it to YouTube and send it to me.  I wanna see!

But, I know your voices are being heard. This fanmade facebook campaign is probably the best place to start right now: [Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Walking-Dead-Fans-cry-out-for-a-Soundtrack-Album/283650395045737?fref=ts)
[Do you think its a possibility we will ever see a Bear McCreary walker cameo? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r560z?context=5)|I've already pitched this idea to Greg Nicotero.  I want to be a Walker ACCORDION PLAYER.  As soon as the right script comes along, we're gonna do it!
[Are you alive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r545k?context=5)|(cue #6 Theme)

I would be honored to continue working in that franchise, but I must admit... I want to continue the series more than I want to work on the movies.  I very much miss working with my Sarah Connor Theme.  I have variations of it still rolling around in my head.  I wish we could've done more.
[The ""reverse melody"" of Da Vinci's Demons: Fascinating. From whence did that germinate?  Also, do you now only compose with the aid of a mirror?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fg3?context=5)|I got the idea from studying Da Vinci.  I was fasicnated that he would write forwards and backwards.  In trying to write a theme for the man (not just the character) I thought that was an intriguing idea to apply to music.  I haven't resorted to a mirror just yet, but maybe for season 2.  it might come in handy!
[Any chance on doing another BSG live performance along with a DVD/CD of said performance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fmu?context=5)|We're definitely working on some exciting live performance and DVD projects.  Hang in there! 
[Hey Bear! Enormous fan of your work on BSG. I think it's some of the most perfect, atmospheric scoring I've ever heard.  Can you score more video games, please? That would be awesome..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5etd?context=5)|Ok.  Because you asked. :) Stay tuned...
[Hey Bear - I love the gamelan and eastern sounds you use in the BSG series, as well as those incredible booming war drums. For an amateur musician who would like to explore and learn those eastern scales, what's a good way to go about it and is it possible on typical instruments like guitar and piano?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fpt?context=5)|You have to go find the instruments.  You can't write for instruments you don't have access to, and that applies to orchestral instruments as well.  Find some players, some ensembles, in your area, and just hang out.  Ask them how their instruments work.
[Hi Bear, What is your favorite band? (Please say Dream Theater\) :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4x8f?context=5)|Hard to choose.  A random list... Oingo Boingo. Queen. Pink Floyd. System of a Down. Guns N Roses. Dethklok.
[Has your music ever gotten you laid? cause then it'd be a score-score.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4lku?context=5)|Why else would someone go into music? ;)

That took a lot out of me to write.  Then again, the entire final episode did that too.  That series was an emotional roller coaster and completing it was an incredible feeling.
[Hey, Bear!  I love your work!  I know you get asked this all the time, but what would be the best way to push for an official soundtrack of your music from The Walking Dead?  And why do you think AMC is so reluctant to release one?  It's pretty obvious that people want one, right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4f8f?context=5)|[Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Walking-Dead-Fans-cry-out-for-a-Soundtrack-Album/283650395045737?fref=ts)
[EDIT:  Also - what's it like working on something as hugely popular as TWD?  Do you ever get the chance to interact with the cast?  Any good stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4f8f?context=5)|This is the best way that I know of right now. 
[Which composer would you say inspires you the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4g4d?context=5)|Probably Jerry Goldsmith.  Also Elmer Bernstein, Danny Elfman, Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone to name just a few.  Oh, and Basil Poledouris.
[Seriously no mention of Human Target?  I still think the show was canceled because they replaced the theme.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r9p5e?context=5)|I loved that score.  Every once in a while I bring it up on my iPod just to remember how much it kicked ass. I am very honored to have worked on that show for a season.  :)
[What is your most favorite piece you have scored? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4ez8?context=5)|Wow, I don't think I could ever pick.  Most composers will always tell you that their favorite piece of music is the one they're working on right now.  That applies for me I think. 
[**MILD BSG SPOILERS**  Hey Bear, I'm a little late, hope you get around to answering this but I was wondering where you got the inspiration for using All along the watchtower for the cylon song. Was it the plan all along to use 1123 6536 5321 as the coordinates, or did that come up organically?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r6ev4?context=5)|Ironically, very little of all that was planned from the beginning.  No one knew when I arranged that song in Season 3 that it would be required to generate coordinates in Season 4.  Perhaps I was guided by the lords of kobol?  Because the melody I wrote to represent the final five and introduced in that arrangement happened to have exactly the number of digits necessary to create the coordinates.  Spooky...
[Will they ever release the BSG score on Spotify? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r7ub1?context=5)|Hopefully.  We're working on it.
[What's your favorite music genre to listen to when you wanna relax??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4hj7?context=5)|Relax? What's that?
[Hey, Bear! Thanks for doing this AMA. Your scores are absolutely brilliant in every way.  2\) If you could, would you score for Ron Moore again ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4r6p?context=5)|That was a blast.  My brother's voice was just perfect for that song and he has since been a featured singer, with his own original music, on ""Caprica"" and now ""Defiance.""  you guys will hear one of his songs featured in a big way in a few episodes from now.
[Thanks for responding Bear. I have a 7 year old who's trying to learn ""Kara Remembers"". When we both first heard it, we fell in love with it instantly. Thanks for being awesome Bear. Your music truly gives the stories more soul.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5ams?context=5)|Wow!  That's very impressive.  I imagine your 7 year old is playing the upper part right?  :)
[How do you generally become involved in a project? Do the producers generally seek you out or is there some kind of auditioning process? Thanks :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4vad?context=5)|All of the above.  Sometimes I'm brought in very early and I'm the top of the list.  Other times, I'm asked to submit some music that might be similar to what they're looking for since producers are casting a wider net. It varies from project to project.  Other times, as was the case with the ""Angry Video Game Nerd Movie"" I reached out to the filmmakers and said I wanted to work with them right from the get go.
[Can I just say that I love your wife's blog?  (Yours too.  But yours is more educational while her Florence entries had me on the floor laughing.\)  You two are awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r56bh?context=5)|I know!  Raya's blog is fantastic.  She had these great recaps of our Italian journey, and moments with the ""Da Vinci's"" cast.  Worth checking out! [Link to www.rayayarbrough.com](http://www.rayayarbrough.com)
 |But beyond that, her prose is just amazing.  She's actually adapting some of her old entries into a musical that we're putting up in Los Angeles in June.  Stay tuned for details!
[If somehow Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was to go back into production (or a sequel of some sort, a movie, webisodes, something\) - would you be willing to go back to composing music for that series?  I loved the show and your music added so much to so many moments in the show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r87g2?context=5)|In a heartbeat, no question.  I truly miss writing music for that show.   I still have so many variations of Sarah's Theme.  if I had the time, I'd just produce a ""Sarah Connor Season 3 Album"" by itself!
[1\) Will the sheet music for Kara Remembers be available?  Awesome tune by the way.

[2\) What tools do you use? And if someone wanted to get started on the cheap, would you recommend Linux audio software/hardware (assuming you've tried it\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5u9b?context=5)|Can't vouch for Linux software.  I use Digital Performer, Pro Tools, Sibelius as primary software.
[3\) Have you jammed with Zimmer, Newton-Howard,  Williams, Jablonsky, any of those guys?  If not, what kind of project would it take to make it so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5u9b?context=5)|Haven't jammed with those guys. 
[Thank you very much for doing this AMA. I was wondering what show that you worked on has influence you and by extension your music, the most? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5ct8?context=5)|Hard to say.  Every project changes me.  Every piece of music I write changes me just a bit.  I think, obviously, that ""BSG"" had a profound impact on me.  Not just creatively, but professionally.  It transitioned me from being an excited amateur to a young professional.  That was amazing.
[If you had to name one inspiration over all others, could you? Who would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fot?context=5)|This is extremely difficult.  But, I might pick Jerry Goldsmith.  
[Whats the hardest part about making music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4lut?context=5)|Staring at the blank page or the blank screen.  You've got a big uphill battle in front of you.  But, its all worth it when you FINISH writing music.  That's a wonderful feeling.
[Hi, what is your favorite wake up music? And could you compose one for us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4o78?context=5)|I'll work on something right now.  How about a Concerto for Chainsaw?  I imagine that would wake you up in the morning.  :)
[Hey Bear, long time fan here. Loved the BSG stuff and the Sarah Connor scores were brilliant!  Anyway my question is would there be any chance you'd be willing to compose for the new Star Wars franchise?  Also, how did you become such an amazingly brilliant composer? What got you started and where did you go from there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5gvt?context=5)|I think the composer should be John Williams for as long as he is willing and able.
[Bear! I am a composer in Los Angeles, trying to establish myself in the industry, and using the tools available to young up and comers, for me especially, are the MIDI string instruments such as Action Strings for Logic Pro.  What are your thoughts on composers these days using MIDI instruments, specifically for strings and orchestral compositions?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r52g1?context=5)|Virtual instruments are a great way to communicate your ideas.  But, they're a means, not the ends.  I think spending too much time and energy dealing with them is counterproductive and prevents you from developing your own unique sound.
[Hi Bear! Maybe a naive question but what's the process for creating a score? Do the producers/directors come to you and say ""write us some music for a space show"" and let you run with it, or is there a lot of back and forth during the creation process? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r8kn9?context=5)|There's always a varying degree of back and forth.  And its always best when you're collaborating with people who have either the vision to express their desires, or the trust to let you move forward with yours.  Typically, most projects are somewhere between.  But, I rely on producers' input to realize my own visions.  Working with David S. Goyer on ""Da Vinci's Demons"" was one of those rare situations where getting notes always improved the cues.  He was able to make suggestions, not in musical terms, but in emotional ones, that resulted in better music.  That's a very fun situation!
[Hi Bear. I live in Bellingham. Some of my friends went to school with you n' stuff.  My question: do you ever come back to the 'Ham? And if so, would you like to jam along with my cohorts in the totally un-famous gamelan band Monkey Puzzle Orchestra? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5dvo?context=5)|An un-famous gamelan band called ""Monkey Puzzle Orchestra""??

[I'll keep that in mind (I'm rewatching it with I friend I hooked on the series\) watching the next episode..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5hyx?context=5)|And I'm always looking for new sounds as the series necessitates it.  The Governor obviously created a new layer for the show, and as such, he needed a new kind of music.
[Is there a ""Go-to-set"" of scare or even zombie sounds in the composing industry? When my friends and I want to imply that something dangerous is is looming we immitate the shrieking violin sounds.  Did you add ""new"" ingredients to your personal set, or did you rather rearrange ideas and sounds you had before for the TWD dish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5hyx?context=5)|There are tons of ""go-to"" scary sounds in film scoring.  Those were the first things we eliminated when Frank Darabont and I started talking about the score for the show.  I go out of my way to not fall back on those old tropes, because we're so familiar with them.  They're not effecetive anymore.
[Heard you directed a music video for Young Beautiful in a Hurry that's coming out soon? What are you thoughts on directing vs. composing? Are there more videos in the works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5dew?context=5)|Indeed I did!  We're doing the video release party on May 11th in Los Angeles at Molly Malone's.  Details here: [Link to youngbeautifulinahurry.com](http://youngbeautifulinahurry.com/dont-stop-me-now) If you miss the show, we'll be posting the video online shortly thereafter.  There are some awesome cameos in there too, including BSG's Aaron Douglas!  We're working on a whole new set of videos to come out later this year.  And I'm collaborating with the band on a song for a new timelaps video from Randy Halverson, for whom I wrote ""Temporal Distortion"" last year.  So, a lot of stuff is in the works!
[I've been playing Elegy on the piano obsessively for some time now but I'm a bit shy about posting a video of it.

[Is there any score you love so much you wished you'd composed it yourself?  If so, what is it about that score you love so much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4jon?context=5)|There are so many scores I love, and that will always be a part of me.  But, I don't wish I wrote them.  Because then I wouldn't be able to simply listen and enjoy them!
[Do you choose which songs are used on the show? if so, what is your process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r9tf1?context=5)|Sometimes, but rarely.  that's almost never the job of a composer.  In the case of ""BSG,"" ""Caprica"" and occasionally ""Defiance"" I am heavily involved.  In the case of ""Trauma,"" ""The Walking Dead"" and other episodes of ""Defiance,"" I have nothing to do with the selection of songs whatsoever.
[Hey Bear, congrats on your work. I'm a happy man having the three last BSG albums signed by you (I'd love to have had the rest as well :(\).  Anyhow, quick question, have you written the opening credits theme of Defiance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5b3p?context=5)|Yup.  If you want to hear an extended version of that, just check out the Defiance video game record, which has a great five-minute version of the theme: [Link to itunes.apple.com](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/defiance-original-video-game/id627116362)
[What got you into wanting to make music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r93oj?context=5)|Hearing film scores as a kid.  I enjoyed music.  I loved the movies.  Suddenly realizzing that these two art forms met somewhere, that was very exciting.  I was probably about five years old and I never looked back.
[Hi Bear, BIG fan and thanks for doing this AMA!  I do some indie film and docu scoring from time to time, and I was wondering what do you do when you really feel like a piece needs some more work but there's a limited budget?  Do you go the extra mile ""on the house"", do you ask for more budget, or do you just let it go regardless of how you feel about the piece?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5jsu?context=5)|I never let something go if it doesn't live up to my standards.  If a project doesn't have a big budget, I tailor my music to whatever they can afford.  But, you should never allow yourself to get in a position where you write music intended for a big budget and then, by surprise, end up without one.  Sometimes horrible things happen, its true, but you should always do your best to know what they have to work with and tailor your creativity to the constraints.  
[Can you compare the music between the ""barn scene"" in WD season 2 vs. ""The Killer Within"" from season 3? Both were super emotional scenes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4qij?context=5)|NO SPOILERS, but they were both immensely challenging.  ""Killer Within"" took me a week.  Not to score the whole episode... just that one scene.  And it really depressed me.  I had trouble sleeping.  It was not fun.  Totally worthwhile in the end, but the experience was very unpleasant.
[Are there any composers you hope to collaborate with on future projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4u12?context=5)|Yes, actually.  We're looking for the right project to come along. ;)
[Have you ever considered doing your own album, not related to a show/film/game? Similar to what composer Jeremy Soule is currently doing (and funded via Kickstarter\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4q0x?context=5)|I've got a ton of stuff in the works, yeah.  But, I'm not really looking to get involved with Kickstarter at this moment.  
[What future projects should we be on the lookout for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4lf6?context=5)|I've got a feature coming out called ""Europa Report.""  I believe its on VOD in June and theatrical in August.  It's an amazing hard sci fi film.  One of a kind.
 |There are a few others that I imagine you will find... exciting.  Stay tuned for more information.
[Are you able to give us more details on the Caprica album that will (hopefully\) released this month? I recall reading that you were planning two discs.  Also, will there be a number of signed copies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4ol4?context=5)|It's being mastered as we speak!  It'll be a two-disc set featuring original score and songs from the all-too-short-lived series.  I'm certain La La Land will do signed copies, but they move fast.  Follow me or them on Twitter for exact release date info.  I hope it'll be out this month.
[Do you actually enjoy (watching\) all of the projects you have worked on, or are there some that you honestly would not watch if you weren't involved? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r558i?context=5)|I tend to only take on projects I'm excited about.  So, I'm a fan of all the projects I've scored. To me, this is a passion, not just a job.  I've been VERY fortunate to find myself in that position.
[""Violence and Variations"" from season 3 of BSG is my all-time favorite piece of music ever. Did you ever think during the beginning of the show that you'd get to do such an epic piece as that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r62jv?context=5)|Not at all! At the beginning of the show, I was told there would be no themes and no orchestra ever! It was just minimal percussion and a few ethnic soloists.  Slowly, during season 1, that expanded to include a small string orchestra.  That group just got bigger and bigger until we had a full orchestra doing big sweeping themes at the end.  It was a natural evolution.
[Bear McCreary! You have been an inspiration to me as a composer. Do you ever work with interns or work with a ""team""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4vdv?context=5)|I have an incrediby skilled team who help me do what I need to do.  We have interns from time to time, usually from USC or Berklee...
[I think I remember you saying a while back that there will be a Caprica piano music book. Is that happening and if so when? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r58gr?context=5)|It's on the backburner, but I'm hoping to do another piano book.  The BSG one was very successful and I've enjoyed watching fans come back at me with YouTube videos of them playing it.
[If I needed you to create a theme song about someone, would you take a commission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r54vb?context=5)|Give me all the moniez.  :)
[Do you find it difficult to compose music that differentiates from your previous works?  (I love your music so much!!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4me5?context=5)|Not really.  When I'm working on ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Eureka"" its easy for them to sound different. Ditto for ""Da Vinci's Demons"" and ""Walking Dead.""  I take on projects that allow me to explore new sounds. Doing all the Renaissance music in ""Da Vinci's Demons"" was a new experience for me.
[What's it like working with the Calder Quartet for Da Vinci's Demons? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5dgo?context=5)|The Calder guys are absolutely amazing!  I went to school with them all and its a wonderful experience to get back in the studio with them and work on a project as inspiring as ""Da Vinci.""  Those of you who haven't seen my video blog about working with them, check it out: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi9USqQCSwU&amp;list=UUU2Z9O7Qw7PCT6fPN0yaHg&amp;index=2)
[How do you do it? Do you wake up one night and write scores? Do tunes just come out of the middle of nowhere? The acoustic process of creativity has always alluded me. Are there tones you hear on the street that set you off into a world of composition? I wish I could see into your mind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rdoot?context=5)|You know, I do always hear music everywhere I go.  If I just sit still for a minute, I'll start hearing patterns in traffic, birds, wind.  Anything.  I think my mind is always looking for interesting sounds that can be ordered and given meaning.  I wish I could shut it off sometimes, to be honest.
[I've always thought that The Lost Room intro and The Walking Dead intro were very similar, at least visually. Do you pick up on any similarities, or am I coo-coo banana crumbs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rdwmj?context=5)|I can't say you're coo-coo banana crumbs, but I can't say you're not.  I never saw the lost room, so I have no idea...
[Hi Bear! Love your work! Kat's Sacrifice and All Along The Watchtower are some of my favorite tracks! Two questions.  Why not release digital? At least from a direct website if not through stores like iTunes and Amazon MP3? I believe the albums can be restricted to require the purchase of the full album.  Some of the most amazing work is starting to turn up in video games. Austin Wintory for Journey as an example. Would you ever consider working on an indie game if it had a real concept and story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rk4dj?context=5)|Check out my new label Sparks &amp; Shadows.  [Link to www.bearmccreary.com](http://www.bearmccreary.com/#blog/albums/sparks-shadows) That's my philosophy about doing digital releases.  Expect a lot in the future. As for indie games, I'm way into that.  I already scored and released an album for MOONBREAKERS for my pal Ed Byrne.  I'm also already working on the unofficial sequel to ECCO THE DOLPHIN, called THE BIG BLUE, collaborating with composer Spencer Nilsen and game designer Ed Annunziata. Here's our kickstarter! [Link to www.kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/annunziata/the-next-ecco-the-dolphin-adventure-game) 
[Do you use acousitic instruments? Or a DAW? and if you use a DAW, which one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r78ea?context=5)|Well, I work with Digital Performer and a vast collection of sampled instruments, most of which are custom-made.  However, I'm very picky about using live instruments in the final product.  You'll never hear fake strings or fake winds and brass in my score.  The soloists, orchestra, percussion, guitars, vocals, winds and brass are always live.  (That's why it sounds good!) :)
[PPPS. I'M MAKING A DUBSTEP VERSION: I CAN HAZ YOUR BLESSING?!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r78ea?context=5)|PS: Can't wait to hear your dubstep TWD theme!
[Hey Bear,  Long time lover of your music! Would you be interested in scoring a Steampunk series that I created?  Heh.  It's Matt.  True or False, did you perform Prince's 'Kiss' on accordion at Robinson's wedding, or was it a different funk song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9ra2ir?context=5)|Hey Matt!  Looking forward to your Steampunk webseries!  ;) I definitely played some Prince tune on accordion at that wedding.  Honestly, I don't know why I quit playing accordion at weddings.  I should keep it up.  I could probably get some decent gigs! 
[Whatever happened to Knights of Badassdom? It seems to have completely vanished off the radar.  If the film doesn't end up getting released, do you think there's a possibility that you can get permission to release the soundtrack through your record label?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5nwm?context=5)|Your guess is as good as mine. ""Knights of Badassom"" is an awesome movie, with a fantastic cast. And I dare say, a fantastic score. I had an incredible time scoring it and I'm a little confused as to why it didn't come out a year ago.  I'm hopeful that the right thing will be done and you'll get the chance to see the film and hear my epic score one of these days...
[Hello Mr. Mcreary, first off, fantastic job on the Walking Dead! That soundtrack never fails to give me chills.  I have a few questions,  What is your favorite peice you've ever composed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r62zk?context=5)|Being a composer is all I've ever wanted to do.  There really was nothing else for me.  When I was five, film music first caught my ear and I was pretty trapped from that point onward.  Luckily for me, I managed to carve out a living.  Because there was no back up plan!
[With Defiance (love the game soundtrack and the TV series so far\), it seems like you have a lot of control over the music. Do you choose the cool not-well-known covers of popular songs at the end of the last couple of episodes? Also, can we expect some moderation with those - I think having one at the end of every single episode would be bit too much.  And what is it like not only creating brand new songs, but songs made by aliens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4w4i?context=5)|I have control over SOME of the songs.  The Nirvana cover I had nothing to do with for example.  But, the cover of ""Ooh Child"" this week was produced by me, and sung by Raya Yarbrough with whom I frequently collaborate.  As the episodes progress, you'll hear about half the episodes end with a needledrop pop song and half end with a score or song cue that I did. And doing the alien band songs is amazing.  What a challenge!  I have to design alien sounds for instruments AND teach the singers to sing in these alien languages designed by David J. Peterson.  It's a blast!
[Well, from one creative guy to another, do ideas just 'pop into your head'? Or is it more methodical, a evolution stemming from a seed of a thought, like the distant pinprick of a star actually being the light of a supernova flaring up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r8rsi?context=5)|Ideas almost never pop in there (like the Stay Puft marshmallow man!).  I get basic shapes or intrumentation ideas in my head, but I feel more like a sculptor than a painter. I have to chisel away at the marble for hours before I start getting to the details.
[Hi Bear! I love the music in Da Vinci's Demons. What's your favorite thing about composing the score for this show in particular? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r543m?context=5)|""Da Vinci's Demons"" is an amazing opportunity.  Not only do I get to write lush, lyrical melodies and produce the score with a full orchestra, but I also get to explore Renaissance instrumentation and music.  This is something I ignored in school and now I've gone back and done a lot of research.  So, the score has made me a better composer and at the same time, pushed me to write what I think might be my best music yet.
[I read somewhere that in the episode of BSG where Kara imagines her father playing the piano in the bar that they based the character on you.  Can you speak to that? The actor they used does seem to resemble you in photos. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r66ud?context=5)|You know, the character was based in part on me.  I had long talks with the writers as they were coming up with his dialog.  They even auditioned me for the role!  Except it turns out I can't act at all.  :)  The guy who plays the role did an amazing job, and I was there on set to help the piano performances come together.

Background: I have 2 years before I finish my Computer Science, BS. I switched from Business (I have my AS) to Computer Science. 

I currently have a 3.48 GPA and I'm wondering what my prospects for getting into Graduate school would be, and if a PhD program (4 years isn't it? Or is it more?) would be worth it.

I currently have two interests: Software Development or Research and Development. It's pretty cliche but I simply want to do something important &amp; I don't think I'll enjoy a job that I can't be creative in. I really want to develop useful apps. 

For this reason one of my dream jobs is to work at Google, or IBM. I have a slight interest in AI.

From this subreddit I've picked up that self starting &amp; internships are really useful, but I have other questions.

What are my chances of getting into a good graduate school?

Should I spend the extra time (if I get into grad school) doing my PhD? Or is it a waste of time?

I'm also thinking about spending an extra semester in school to dual-major in math: how useful would that be in the fields I'm interested in?
Or maybe even spending a year extra finishing up the BS in Business Admin and double major Comp Sci + Business.

What else can I do to try to get ahead and seek out a good job?



EDIT:

It seems like I need to do a lot more research on what I'd want to do in research, haha. I've emailed one of my favorite professors to try to get more informed.

And my mother died right before I turned 19. Since I was an adult the government offered me no support. So I took the rest of the money from her bank account and bought a car with it where I lived for about 9 months.
 |I overcame it slowly step by step. Being a cancer researcher wasn't my goal. I first started working at a fast food restaurant. I would bathe in the sink of a coffee shop every morning before work. But I got fired for being unsanitary. [I had caught bronchitis from eating at homeless shelters.]
 |Someone at a  local boys &amp; girls club heard my story and knew that I was talented in music and gave me a stable job as a music teacher. I worked there for 2 and a half years. I went back to school to study music but then changed to Biochemistry. I had excellent grades and then applied for internships in 2012.

So even though I'm majoring in chemical engineering, I'm going to be doing Molecular and Cellular biology research. So I'll be studying how the body attempts to repair itself against cancer. In short, one of the best things about Chemical Engineering is our ability to work outside the field of Chemical engineering.

But as fields such as nanotechnology develop, a lot of chemical engineers are interested in nanocoating drugs so that way they can target cancer sells more specifically. These new technique hope to snipe out cancer, rather than kill it with a shotgun (chemotherapy).

 |Don't trust any science you read on facebook. Science is skewed in the media, even online. Really the best thing to do always is find the primary source and read the research yourself.

Thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rz6og?context=5)|Really frustrates me. I understand how people can see that but once you really understand what cancer is and how it works you will see this is not the truth.
 |First Cancer isn't 1 disease, it is a category of literally hundreds of diseases with all different mechanisms. There is no 1 cure for all cancer. It might be nearly impossible to construct one.
 |Another thing is that if 1 company did have the cure to cancer they would make billions off of it and easily dominate the pharmaceutical market. You can't keep it secret, we couldn't keep the Nuclear Bomb a secret, let alone the cure to cancer.
 |But I understand that people don't trust the government. but if anyone thinks that we have a cure to cancer are keeping it secret, they should come in the lab and try to do the actual research and see how tough it actually is. They should read the papers we have to read and understand how complex it is.
 |Steve Jobs was a billionaire but couldn't buy this secret cure for cancer? But I guess a conspiracy theorist would think maybe he did and faked his death?
 |Another way that we know its not true, is that even if they wanted to make it exclusive, they could just make it expensive. They don't need to keep it a secret. Everyday in the developing world people die from diseases that are already cheap and easily curable. Basically they don't need to keep its existence a secret to stop you from accessing it, they have many other methods.
 |Most of this is caused by scientific illiteracy which is a fault of the scientific community as well as the general population.

Some people are interested in surgical procedures, gene therapy, new medicines, revising old medicines, targeting the whole body, or targeting specific cells. But no matter what area you're in it takes a lot of literary research. A lot of reading the previous results of a lot of other people's research so you can draw your own conclusion. I'm working on someone else's research team so I won't be deciding what we do, then once we've figured out our objective and the procedure its running a lot of tests. A lot of measuring, a lot of flashing lights through liquids. A lot of gloves and a lot of measuring.

How would you rate that mix as determining factors of your success?

Since it's pretty much these two factors, Determination and planning. To get through the difficult circumstances is definitely 60/40 Its too easy to just settle with sustaining yourself, which you will learn only works for short time. You have to always plan for the future when you're homeless, so it takes a considerable amount of intelligence. And its really trying on your willpower.
 |As far as school. The hardest part of school for me is simply organization and following directions. Science and engineering are too competitive to rely on natural talent. Only freaks of nature cannot study, no matter how smart you are you're probably not one of them.
 |The keys to doing well in science and math are simply. You have to schedule all your time. Schedule your study time, hw time, following those goals. Maintain your health and mind, eat well, exercise, and sleep. Sleep is one of the most important things. Schedule breaks too.  Being a successful student has only about 7% to do with intelligence. That 7% may or may not be a letter grade. 75% is using your time effectively and following directions. Even if you're an idiot you can pass any class if you simply follow directions and use your time wisely. Don't multi-task. I don't' even use music when I study. NO! TV under any circumstances. the other 18% is maintaining your mind, (sleep, staying hydrated)

*the case and PSU were in a combo so I arbitrarily split the total price.


When I'm at my apartment at school, this will be my workstation and battlestation.  I'll be playing games like StarCraft 2, Metro 2033, Crysis, etc. and doing work in NX/SolidWorks as well as Illustrator and Photoshop.  I am on a tight budget though, so please keep build suggestions under $700.  

My main concerns are:

* Money. I *am* splurging a little while on my internship, but I would definitely like to save as much as possible while building a good value machine.
* Compatibility.  I've tried to do my research for this, so I feel like the parts are all pretty good choices for what I'd like to do.  I did notice the PCPartPicker alert about how my mobo has USB 3.0 headers for a case with USB 2.0 front panel ports, but from some Googling, it seemed like it would be okay.  Of course, I'll take any help I can get.
* Timing.  I started buying these parts over time to take advantage of sales, and I'm assuming that the next big sales will come around for Memorial Day weekend.  My plan is to buy the rest of the components at around that time, unless I can get them on sale before that.

I am not going to immediately overclock, but would like to have the option in the future.  Please critique this build and help me figure out what I could do better!

Thanks in advance, BaPC!"

I'm a third year computer science student. I'm going to starting a year and a half long internship in a few days.

Personally, I have little experience in ""real"" programming. I've had a couple of apps in the App Store. 

The position is of a mobile/web developer. I'll be starting of as QA and then (hopefully) moving up to a developer role during the course of the internship.

I'm sure tons of people here will have experience either being an intern or mentoring one. I was hoping to get some advice on how to get the most out if this internship. 

Any thoughts, comments, advise - I'll greatly approximate it all! :)

1dpigq,1,2013-05-04,What's the best way to make my roommates use my deposit for rent?,BrackishSor,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dpigq/whats_the_best_way_to_make_my_roommates_use_my/,"So I am staying 3 months in NYC for an internship and the only short term lease near my job was with (what I thought) were 3 Chinese students. When i went to look at the apartment, I noticed that the bathroom was not super clean but manageable and the kitchen seemed quite dirty. The living room had a ton of boxes/clothes sitting out and the room I was supposed to move into still has clothes/boxes in it.

The rent was pretty cheap and the head tenant told me everything was just super messy from the one roomate moving out and things would get better. Because I had no other options forthcoming I went ahead and took them up on the room. 

That's when the trouble started.

First off, when I moved into my bedroom two weeks later...there was still stuff all over the walls from the previous person. They had also left garbage out on the balcony and in my closet. There was also a bed left there, which was somewhat convenient but still unexpected. I thought the room was going to be actually cleaned before I moved in. 

I also noticed that the kitchen was messier than before...by far. Not only that but the stuff that was supposed to be cleaned out of the living room was still there. It became obvious that the way I saw it right off the bat was closer to the way things ALWAYS were, not just messy from the roomate moving.

Then to top it off I was shown a second bathroom which I didn't even know existed. This was the ""boys"" bathroom and I was supposed to use it instead of the one i was shown (Which turned out to be the girls bathroom). When I asked why there was a bathroom for the one girl living there I was then introduced to the fact that each bedroom in the 4 bedroom apartment (except for mine) had 2 people living in it! Not just me!

In short, i feel super mislead and would like to get out. I gave them a months rent as deposit, but haven't paid this months rent yet. I never signed any kind of agreement with the other tenants, so I'm wondering what you guys would do. Would you just tell them the deposit is this months rent and I'm leaving in june? Would you pay and suffer? Would you tell them nothing and just leave after this month?

Please help me! I've never been in a situation like this."
1dpi1q,0,2013-05-04,DUI...Next steps?,duithrowaway54,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dpi1q/duinext_steps/,"First, I want to preface this by saying the decision to drive drunk was incredibly stupid.  There is literally no excuse for it.  I don't know why I decided to.  I am not trying to get out of the charges; I am guilty.  I have placed a call to a lawyer already, but also assume that I won't here anything back until Monday.  My mind is still just going 1,000 miles per hour and I was hoping to get some feedback about what to expect until I hear back.

While I admit fault, and I am not trying to get the charges dropped, I also want a lawyer to make sure I can get a fair punishment.  I am 25/F with no prior charges of any sort.  

I am a full time student, attending school as an out of state resident (originally from Virginia - this is where my car is registered &amp; I am licensed).  The offense occurred in Oklahoma.  I was pulled over for driving 5 under the speed limit (30 in a 35), and weaving.  The officer approached and asked if I had been drinking, and I admitted I had.  I don't know if this was a smart idea or not, but there was no denying it.  I figured I might as well cooperate and hope for some brownie points.  Anywho, I gave over my registration and then anxiety set in.  I vomited.  The officer had me get out of the car to perform the field tests.  I failed.  No surprise to me.  The officer asked if I would consent to a breathalyzer.  I then told him that I wasn't familiar with what my rights were in Oklahoma, and that I wanted to consult a lawyer first.  He immediately hand cuffed me and placed me under arrest.  I vomited again.  He asked me again to consent, and I told him again I wanted to speak with a lawyer first.  

I get down to the station and I'm processed.  I'm asked a third time to consent, and I again tell them I'd rather speak with an attorney before proceeding.  Nothing else is mentioned.  

I was released on bail this morning.  One of the sheets of paper I was given instructs that I need to appear at the court within 3 business days.  It doesn't really say what it is for - ""initial appearance and arraignment.""  Do I need to have a lawyer present with me for this visit?

I have since learned that refusing a breathalyzer in Oklahoma is automatic grounds for license suspension.  I have the ability to appeal the decision, in writing, with the Department of Safety.  Is this something I do on my own, or can I expect a lawyer to assist me with this?  In addition, I do not have any recollection of them telling me that my license would automatically be suspended.  I mean, I'm sure they did, but at the same time, I do not feel that I would have still denied the breathalyzer if I had known that.  I suppose that's neither here nor there, but I figured I'd throw that out there.

Finally, to complicate things, I am supposed to be leaving next Sunday to take a position out of state for a summer internship.  Am I even allowed to leave the state with charges pending?  Do I need to get clearance from the court first?

Any help would be appreciated.  "
1dpf4t,0,2013-05-04,"Reddit, why will putting myself through college be worth it?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dpf4t/reddit_why_will_putting_myself_through_college_be/,"**TL;DR:** I am a 26-year-old who set aside a career to return to school and finish my BA through Columbia. I have one more year left, but at the moment, putting myself through school is so stressful that I feel like I won't make it graduation.
___

All but hidden in plain sight, a plaque on the left beam of Columbia University’s main gate bears this inscription: May All Who Enter Find Peace and Welcome. 

As a kid, when my family and I lived six blocks south of those gates, college seemed as accessible as walking through those doors. The campus became my playground: I tiptoed along fountain edges and raced past research libraries on my bike. On nights when the university opened its observatory to the public, my father and I would marvel at the telescopes as we gazed at the celestial phenomena. College encouraged reaching for the stars.

Shortly before I turned 14, my father and I had The Talk. Much as he advocated a college education, he’d never be able to finance one. I considered the acknowledgment generous; it allowed time to lay groundwork for the road ahead. So that’s what I did. I’d already obtained entry and a full scholarship to a prep school that had produced a former U.S. attorney general and Oscar nominees. Hoping to follow in their footsteps, I won a slew of local and national scholarships, studied two languages despite native-level fluency in three others, volunteered, occupied leadership roles in student groups and landed a top internship before even leaving high school.

That Ivy League-loving prep school  is now a 26-year-old without a college degree. The reasons do not include rehab, jail, pregnancy, terminal illness or joining the circus. These days, the gates are not of iron but cost.  

After high school, I spent several semesters at a nearby college, one I could afford without loans. When financial burdens became overwhelming, I justified my exit from academia by pouring energy into a career, and writing stories for places that you and your mother have heard of, until I returned to academic life and enrolled at Columbia University’s School of General Studies, which is designed primarily for those who have taken at least a year’s break between high school and college. Getting in was the first hurdle. Unlike the university’s other three undergraduate schools - Columbia College, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Barnard College – financial aid is extremely limited.

One year, my adjusted gross income was under $14,000, and the government determined expected contribution to be $1,322. The grants from the school amounted to $9,600 and government aid totaled $5,000, leaving savings and student loans to cover the remaining $18,325 in tuition, which doesn’t include room and board, textbooks or meals. The financial aid director said that I “did everything right,” but that there wasn't any more aid to go around - at a university had a $7.8 billion endowment in FY 2011. 

To cut costs, I live with my parents but cover all of my personal expenses – food, books, clothing, the occasional night out with friends. If I forget to pack lunch, I consider skipping meals until I return home. A professor once ordered dinner for the entire class to celebrate the end of the semester, never knowing that I would have skipped eating otherwise. Of course, I work, and because of fluctuations in my schedule, my term GPA’s have varied between 4.0 to… not a 4.0.

The school’s healthcare plan offers mind-bogglingly amazing resources without additional charge: multiple on-site clinics, psychological counseling, even a nutritionist. The irony is that I’ve canceled off-site appointments when the $30 co-payment exceeded funds in my bank account. And I am far – very far - from alone, though I know I am for.
College is not for everyone, but as a character on the West Wing says, paying for it “should be a little easier.” I have one year until graduation, and at the moment, I feel like I won’t make it there. So, Reddit, why is any of this – the all-nighters, the exams, the monumental efforts that resulted in literal failure, the years of debt ahead -  worth it? "

If that isn't possible, maybe work on certain skills that we could add to a resume, but I'm not sure what. Maybe programming?

I ended up starting some kind of thesis on it and acquired broad theoretical knowledge on the subject. Lately I've been interested in Scala for some reason. I didn't know anything about functional languages so far so I guess seeing it working along OOP was intriguing as well.

I am a freshman at a state school with no security courses taught here nor any active security groups. I am trying to get a couple of students together to start in a CTF team, but I really don't know what I am doing in that regard. We do have a decently ranked CS program in light of not having any security specific classes.

* I am a good CS student; to the point where I have tested out of classes and have been approved for taking grad courses next year
* I would like to either be a software engineer or a pen tester after I graduate, and would like to know how to best prepare for pen testing since I have the SE part covered with past experience.
* I have a SE internship at a fortune 100 tech company in a hardware group (nothing to do with security) and I'm wondering how I should approach the security departments at said company to express my interest and possibly be invited to join their team next summer if I am given the opportunity.
* As far as I know, there are only two pen testing orgs that operate in my state
* I have WAHH 2, CEH study guide (v7 I believe), quite a few Cisco books for CCNP and CCNA which I will probably study for, but not take the exams. I like having knowledge even if I don't have the certs. Quite a few other books in security from lock picking to SQL injection (more advanced topics of SQL injection, not really beginner topics except the first couple of chapters).
* I have recently gotten into a lot of trouble at my university for ""hacking"" their registration system (I basically just bypassed part of the system to register for classes early) so they will probably not be too happy if I try to organize a CTF team or an infosec club on campus because I received a total of 68 months of probation from various departments on campus.
* I am also interested in malware analysis and have done a lot of this on .NET and Java malware in years past. I am very proficient in Java bytecode. This could be another avenue of work I may pursue, but I am at a loss for what goes into getting into this field.

Thanks!"

1dvnro,46,2013-05-07,Graduated too long ago but not enough experience to find a job. I'm stuck and utterly confused about where to go from here.,stuckengr,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1dvnro/graduated_too_long_ago_but_not_enough_experience/,"**Edit: Wow, thanks for all the feedback and advice everyone! I'll try to respond to people individually later tonight.**

I'm a 24 year old guy that graduated in 2011 from the University of Michigan with a degree in mechanical engineering. I did well in my classes. My GPA was ~3.3 and I always worked hard and had a good grasp of the material and tried to take leadership roles in my projects. I graduated in 4 years, but admittedly didn't put effort into career development while I was a student. I guess I didn't realize how important that was. I guess I always just assumed that I'd apply to jobs and get interviews and everything to fall into place. In hindsight, that was a stupid assumption. In any case, I didn't start going to the career fairs until my junior year, and I wasn't able to secure any internships during the summer (which wasn't entirely uncommon anyway. A very small percentage of my classmates were being accepted to internships). 

I graduated without a job or any real sense of what I wanted to do in general. I'll try to spare you the boring details, but mentally, I was struggling. I was overwhelmed with the idea of graduating and battling with some depression problems, and I decided to take some time off and travel. I had always regretted not doing a semester abroad, and this seemed like a good choice at the time.

That extended into 2012, and then I was back home and ready to resume my job search. But nothing really came out of it. Days turned into weeks. Weeks into months. And before I knew it, 2012 was coming to a close without having made any real progress. In my mind, I had good grades from a good university, and *someone* would want me. I also had lots of people saying things like ""Oh, engineering? You'll find a job easy."" So I guess I convinced myself that something would eventually fall into my lap.

Then this past January, it hit me. I'm fucking up. I've been out of school for over a year and a half, I'm financially dependent on my parents, and my career search was pitiful.

I had a big change in attitude. I started working with a career counselor to revamp my resume and learn how to market myself and network. I had family friends willing to put me in touch with engineers they knew, and I set up and went on networking trips to different cities. I started talking to a couple different recruiters at companies. I phoned in to the Michigan Engineering Career Resource Center for help. I have friends at engineering firms that have passed along my resume. I've reached out to people on LinkedIn to network. I'm going to job fairs. I've even applied blindly to job postings I find online. 

And literally nothing has come out of it. I try to stay positive, knowing that all it takes is *one* person or company to say yes, but I'm getting very discouraged. Half the time, I don't even hear back from companies. And nobody I talk to seems to be in a position to be of any real help. Basically, my job search is falling flat. And I'm starting to panic.

The reality is that I'm 2 years out of school with no applicable experience. (I have some job experience with computer / IT work, which is better than being a camp counselor, I suppose, but it's not directly engineering-related.) And the gaps are starting to grow on my resume. And that seems to be a big hinderance to even getting companies to talk to me. At this point, I'd be willing to settle for *anything*. I'd take an unpaid internship just to gain experience, but I don't even seem to qualify for that. 

So I'm stuck and I have no idea what to do. The path I took post-graduation was unorthodox, and looking back, I know I made some mistakes. If you feel the need to call me an idiot for not realizing the importance of internships or for not taking the job search seriously until recently, go ahead. I've spent many sleepless nights regretting the past 2 years of accomplishing nothing, so it's nothing I don't already know.

But my point in posting here is to try to figure out where to go from here, because what I'm doing isn't working. Maybe I need to consider going back to school in order to start fresh and ""get back in the game""? I don't know. Can anyone give me some guidance?"

1duvm3,2,2013-05-07,A former company that I wrote blog articles for is threatening to give another writer the credit for my work if I don't create a Google + account,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1duvm3/a_former_company_that_i_wrote_blog_articles_for/,"From October 2012-April 2013 I wrote weekly articles for the blog of a beauty company that my friend is, unfortunately, the CMO of. She texted me yesterday and said that if I don't create a Google + account then she will be forced to put my content under another writers name. I actually did create an account about 4 weeks ago, even after I was no longer doing contracting work for them, but after several attempts of them being unable to figure it out I deleted my profile. I have been asked why I wouldn't just give up to avoid conflict, but I have over 20,000 words that would be given to someone else. It is unfair and frankly sounds to me like theft. Legally speaking I was hoping someone could tell me if I am fully covered or if there is some loophole I don't know about. I never signed a contract.  I'm sorry for the wall of text, but here is the entire text convo for context if that helps:

Her:  Hey girl hey!  I'm working with one of my interns on ramping up our Google+ info - I'm wondering if you could take a min and link your profile to the new ***** beauty profile? My goal is to make sure all our writers keep their association with their content, but because Google looks highly upon content that is linked appropriately to a google+ account, it's a must  for us because of search ranking. For everyone that can't help us make this change, I will have to roll your content up to another active blogger which I would HATE to do. I really want you to keep the cred for the great work you did for us!  Honestly, it takes 30 secs :) hope you can help us'

Me: Hey I have already done this twice I'm not really sure what else I can do. And just to be clear are you saying that you would change the name of my stuff that I have written to someone else's?

Her:  I checked in w ******** and she had noted that she was unclear on which G+ profile you linked to. I have 2 girls who have been completely unresponsive and what I sent was a copy/paste. Now that I have info that you've been trying to work this thru I can work directly with you on it. For folks that are unresponsive I don't have a choice but to roll it up to someone else. Google dings us hard w the authorship jig

Me:  Can you explain to me what exactly rolling it up to someone else means?

Her:  Yes, it would push the posts under someone else's Wordpress profile

Me:  Would it still have my name on it

Her:  Not if we rolled it to someone else. But it's a non-issue if you've been working on it. My intern was unclear on what was going on w your account

Me:  I have to be honest ********** I don't really appreciate the tone you came at me with regarding this. I would have been happy to help if you would have approached me nicely but instead you said you were going to just give my content to another writer if I didnt cooperate. As someone who considers you a friend I'm not sure why you felt it was necessary to try and strong arm me. Please just remove all of my writing from the website

Her:  I think you're reading a little too deeply into it. I voiced over and over that my goal was to give each writer cred. I stated 3 times that I wanted you to keep the credit - could you point to the language I used that made it seem like my intent was anything else?  I'm really confused

Me:  The intent wasn't the issue it was the tone and the fact that you would think it was acceptable to give my writing or anyones writing to someone else for any reason. I'm sorry this isn't working out how you would like but I'm not going to make an account at this point and I'm not giving my consent to you using my content so the only option now is to just take it down.

Her:  ******, I'm not sure where this is coming from but as a friend I'm going to honor your request

Me:  I appreciate it thank you

Her:  Could you please let me know how you read into tone via text?  Again, I'm still confused. I've tried to be ultra supportive, I feel like this is really out of left field and my communication was not a strong arm. If it was, I would have used very different language. But now, here we are. Your friendship obviously means more to me, but I need to learn ur communication style. And I hope you can see what a precarious situation this puts me. I hope we can talk this through

Me:  I'm not going to argue semantics. You didnt approached this as someone who is a friend so I didn't feel the need to respond like a friend. You set the tone and if you can't see that I would suggest showing this to someone you trust will give you an honest opinion of how you sound. Nothing more to talk through just please take everything down.

Her:  How about taking a walk to talk it thru in person. Actually I sent this to 3 other people and got a completely congenial response so honestly I'm really unclear on what brought you to this conclusion.

I have a few questions on what the IT/Systems Admin job market is like in Germany and whether it is realistic that I could make it.

First off, I'm graduating in about six months with a computer science undergrad degree at the University of Oregon. I have my Network+, and Security+ certificates and I'm working on getting the CCNA and CCNP certifications. Sadly I have no professional work experience or internships, all I have is unrelated work doing groundskeeping for my university and unfortunately it looks like I'm going to be stuck with this. Additionally though, I do have an uncertified B2 level understanding of German from classes and work outside the classroom.

With my certifications, degree, and some hobby work (I run a private video/music server and a public web/email server) would it be realistic that I could find a job as a jr. systems administrator or similar after graduation? Where would be the best place to look? If it's unrealistic, what should I work on to improve my CV?

I am working on a BS in Statistics and Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh and am interested in data analysis, statistical modeling, data mining, machine learning, and Big Data in general.  Background is as follows:

* Current GPA is a 3.377 with a 3.625 for last Spring.  My Statistics GPA is a 3.52, and a 3.59 when a class taken outside my university is included (I received an A, but it appears as transfer credit on my transcript).  I have a 3.59 when both Statistics and Math classes are included (excluding that class that doesn't appear on my transcript).

* Two Calculus-based mathematical statistics courses, along with two linear algebra courses: one applied/theoretical, and one scientific computing-oriented.

* Regression, including work on an independent project

* [A week-long statistical modeling workshop](http://www.samsi.info/workshop/undergraduate-modeling-workshop-may-13-17-2013) with SAMSI in North Carolina, where I modeled climate data in R.

* General experience with Python.  I've done some small mining of Twitter with it.

* Some experience with Java, but I will be taking an introductory course on it this summer.

* Basic understanding of MATLAB that will improve this summer with a numerical linear algebra course

* R

* Excel

* LaTeX

I do not have any SQL experience but am looking to gain some, if possible.  I am a fast learner and can pick it up if need be.  The same applies for any other database management system, including (and especially) SAS.

I will be in Pittsburgh starting on May 20.  Please message if you are interested in hiring me."

I was lucky enough to be offered an internship the summer after my sophomore year which due to changes in the company stretched out for another two years.  Last January I enrolled at a local state university where I have a 3.8+ GPA.  I have 14 credits left to finish out my BS in Economics and had a question regarding how I should finish it up.  In order to get the BS I need to complete Calculus II (I know, should have done that way back).  I also have to take 7 credits at my present school which will be done online.  These are the options I presently have:

1.  Complete 10 credits online at present school and take Calculus II at another school in my hometown, allowing me to finish up by the end of June.

2. Complete 7 credits online at present school, take Calculus II and an Economics course at Harvard (which has open enrollment for the summer, but at significant cost,)  this would result in me finishing up by the middle of August.

3.  Complete 7 credits online at present school, take an Economics course at Harvard, and take Calc II at a local community college online.  This would also result in me finishing up by the middle of August.

4.  Complete 10 credits online at present school, take Calc II at Harvard, finish in mid august.

5. And finally, the all online option - 10 at present school and Calc II at community college, finish the 10 by end of June and calc ends beginning of August.

Sorry for the rant-length post, but I was hoping I could get some advice from y'all.  I'm thinking that at least having Harvard somewhere on my Resume could be helpful, particularly with the way they are automatically screened today.  On the other hand it is at significant cost and could have a negative impact on my GPA.  Thanks for your time!"

I am a freshman at a state university with no security courses taught here nor any active security groups. I am trying to get a couple of students together to start a CTF team, but I really don't know what I am doing in that regard. We do have a decently ranked CS program in light of not having any security specific classes.

* I am a good CS student; to the point where I have tested out of classes and have been approved for taking grad courses next year
* I would like to either be a software engineer or a pen tester after I graduate, and would like to know how to best prepare for pen testing since I have the SE part covered with past experience.
* I have a SE internship at a fortune 100 tech company in a hardware group (nothing to do with security) and I'm wondering how I should approach the security departments (or if I should at all) at said company to express my interest
* As far as I know, there are only two pen testing orgs that operate in my state
* I have WAHH 2, CEH study guide (v7 I believe), quite a few Cisco books for CCNP and CCNA which I will probably study for, but not take the exams. I like having knowledge even if I don't have the certs. Quite a few other books in security from lock picking to SQL injection (more advanced topics of SQL injection, not really beginner topics except the first couple of chapters).
* I have recently gotten into a lot of trouble at my university for ""hacking"" their registration system (I basically just bypassed part of the system to register for classes early) so they will probably not be too happy if I try to organize a CTF team or an infosec club on campus because I received a total of 68 months of probation from various departments on campus.
* I am also interested in malware analysis and have done a lot of this on .NET and Java malware in years past. I am very proficient in Java bytecode. This could be another avenue of work I may pursue, but I am at a loss for what goes into getting into this field.

Thanks!"

I've only been doing really serious job searching since January (between August and January I was helping my dad fix up the house, as well as helping my grandparents with errands and the like).

Recently, I was provided two offers with companies I had interviewed with.

The first place to make me an offer would be a better fit for my career path. However, it's only been offered as an internship with pay (albeit fairly low). I was originally interviewing for a full-time position, but they ended up not needing a full-time employee--at least, not until last week, when a position opened up due to somebody else leaving. Instead of offering me the full-time position, though, they just said they'd like to try me out via the internship position, and then if I fit, they'd give me the full position. So like I said, this position would be a better fit for my degree; but at the same time, it's a bit of a risk, because I may not end up getting the full position if they don't feel I fit with them.

The other offer is more solid. It's full-time, benefits included, etc. However, it's more on the tech support side. I'm very familiar with IT support, as I've been doing it since high school, but it's not *exactly* the career path I'd like to follow. It's worth mentioning, though, that this position has the added benefit of being around home, meaning I would be able to live at home without paying rent, and would be able to save up money faster.

Sorry that this isn't worded terribly well, I wrote it in somewhat of a hurry. But, that's my pickle, and if you guys can give me any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. If you need me to clarify anything, just let me know."

After I graduated I immediately found a job, but in an unrelated field.  Through my school's anthropology department I was introduced to, and fell in love with GIS. Considering that there are very few jobs for anthropology undergrads, I decided to sign up for an introductory GIS in order to pry my way in to the world of GIS and earn a certificate.  The intro class went very well and I found myself even helping out a lot of the geography majors who were struggling around me within the class.  However, i'm really starting to wonder how useful I will be to employers offering GIS related jobs who are not anthropology-based.

So my question is, is having a GIS certificate and an unrelated undergraduate degree enough for an entry level technician job, at the least?

Also, I realize that what may be even more important is presenting the actual work I have done, and my technical skill with using the program.  Which is why I plan on taking up an internship, given the opportunity, as well as work on academic GIS projects.

So, should I work on earning a certificate and building individual skill, or should I work on all that while also planning on earning a more applicable undergraduate degree?

thank you for reading this post. I am a Master Student International Organization and International Relations ([http://www.rug.nl/masters/international-relations-and-international-organization/](http://www.rug.nl/masters/international-relations-and-international-organization/)) at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands looking for an internship in NYC.

Besides my Master, I have a bachelor degree in Information Technology (Essentially: programming.). At the moment I am working as a founder and co-owner (since a year and a half) of an IT-related business here in the Netherlands (http://www.noverius.nl). I am a social person, a quick learner, independent and driven. 

Ideally, the internship would have some link to international relations/international organization, but the only actual requirements for the internship are that they are a) of sufficient academic level and b) have an international character. As such, viable internships range from international investment banks to non-profits such as amnesty international. 

Given that I am a currently co-owner of a profitable company, preferably the internship would not last more than 3-4 months (since any longer would be hard to sell to my fellow business partners). Longer is possible; however, since in that case I would have to step down from my position as business owner, actual opportunities in regards to eventual employment or participation would be appreciated.

If you have any questions for me, if you wish to ask me about my previous experience or a resume, I will be happy to answer here or in a PM.

Background info: 
I'm a college senior who is currently studying Business Admin and CIS. I have a partner who is also a Business student. My partner and I are both currently located in Southern California. I'm from the Silicon Valley, and my partner is from India.

As business students, we've noticed all those people who want to start various apps/websites/etc. Problem with this is that they do not have the technical know how to implement any of their ideas, and they do not have the sufficient capital to hire a team of coders (which leads them to pissing people off by offering unpaid internships). 

I have a few friends who have used freelancer.com, and other online outsourcing websites, but all of them have been unhappy with the results for a variety of reasons (mainly due to lack of communication). 

We realized that we can use our capabilities/resources to create an ideal solution; my partner can get a team of coders together in India and we can afford to pay them a going rate. I can communicate with the emerging startups here and act as the middle man between the startup company and the team in India. 

The company will guarantee communication; if the customer wants to chat with the team, we will set up a video conference within 12-18 hours to talk about progress, etc. We plan on treating our team with a lot of love (we will provide them new Macbooks, a nice office, etc). 

I have a pretty thorough understanding about the Software development process. I understand that things like gathering requirements, and documentation are prime areas for failure due to the communication gap. Those are the two things that I can work on from the States (I'll eventually have a team here to do that). 


I understand that I need to do a lot of research, etc, but before doing any of that, I just want to see what the /r/entrepreneur community thinks about this.

tl;dr: 2 partners (1 American, 1 Indian) want to start an outsourcing firm aimed towards startups who have an idea but not enough resources to implement that idea in The States. We will offer a better quality product than websites like freelancer.com"

I have taken the embedded systems course at my school, and I am working as an intern doing embedded systems development at a small company.  However, I am confused about the startup and initialization process for a microcontroller.  In the course at school, we used an IDE that auto-generated the startup code.  At my job, the microcontroller board comes with a rapid development platform that includes templates that take care of loading the RTOS and setting everything up.  I've been trying to read the code in the templates, but I think this platform may be a little too complicated for me as a beginner to follow.  Here are my questions:

1.  In the real world, do most microcontrollers come with some sort of startup/initialization code, or would that be the embedded systems developer's job to write?

2.  Can you recommend any resources for learning how to write startup code?"

I'm 21 years old and in my senior year in college. I study computer science and have a very comfortable life. I'm successful in my academics and have loving friends and family.

I just got done with classes and undergrad work last week and started working at a summer internship 2 days ago.

I'm tired of the life I'm living. I know it sounds bad and that I'm taking it all for granted, but I'm bored. I don't enjoy working. I've lost motivation. My grades are slowly declining. I don't really enjoy life, but I'm not strong enough to kill myself. 
I know I should take a vacation. But I don't want to go anywhere. When I think vacation, I just think of lying in my bed doing nothing. 
I don't want to quit work, though, because I know the grass is always greener on the other side. I don't want to quit and realize I made a mistake later down the road. 

I know someone on reddit has probably felt the way I feel. I feel lost. Direction-less.
What have you people done? 


**edit:**  I'd like to clarify, I don't think I'm depressed. I'm positive I won't kill myself. I still have fun with friends and exercise daily. I eat healthy. I'm just not sure what to do. I feel like I should continue with my major, since I've made such progress in it and finding a job after graduation should be easy. But, when I think about the future and envision a 9-5 job for the rest of my life....iuno.."

1e3cmo,4,2013-05-10,Finally employed in my first professional job and it was because of networking,razorblade2099,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e3cmo/finally_employed_in_my_first_professional_job_and/,"A lot of this is copy and paste from a post I made in a forum, but it's finally happened. I finally found professional work in the industry, company, and city I want to be in.

I'm a recent graduate in accounting/finance. I left university without coop or internship experience so I've been struggling to find entry level work for a while. I started my CMA training anyways so it would show employers that I have the raw talent for accounting and analysis. I've been passed over a few times for more experienced candidates despite making good impressions on the interviewers. One time it was for an internship position. Imagine that, experienced accounting personnel are applying for paid internships. Mind you it was at a internationally recognized company but still.

I met this senior manager at a volunteer event/function over the weekend. He was impressed by the level of hard work I had shown during this event and had agreed to meet me for coffee. Before meeting him for coffee, I did my research on his educational and career background. I asked him about why he decided to obtain two accounting designations. I asked him about about how he was finding his transition to his new role. Then I asked him what it was about the industry he worked in that fascinated him. 

After this, we began to talk about the industry and the company. I had specific questions prepared that I asked in order to help me better understand the industry and then I asked further probing questions when he answered. We talked about the future of the commodity that the company dealt with, as well as the world wide issues surrounding it. I was able to relate specifically to facts that the MD&amp;A/annual report and CEO have touched upon in news interviews. During all of this time, I had a note book out that I used to take notes on anything that he said that I did not already know. 

We then began to talk about myself and my own experience. The type of character I display and the positive attitude I had. I asked if he could refer me to the controller for an interview for a AP Admin role that the company had posted, and indicated that I knew it would still be my own responsibility to earn the job and convince the controller that I was the right fit. He asked me if this is what I really wanted to do, and I explained that in all honesty it wasn't, but it was a way for me to get my foot in the door. It was at this point where he offered to look into creating a FA job for me at the company. 

Now ask yourself this, would he have even considered this if I had not been prepared for this meeting? If I had not shown the initiative to do the research and to reach out to meet him directly? If I had emailed him my application, he may have forwarded it to the controller, or more likely forwarded it to HR, where I'd get a courtesy interview but I'd probably be dismissed because of my inexperience.

This morning I received the job offer. He called me back to the office and explained that although he wanted to create the FA job for me because we both agreed that was where my talents indicated where I should be, he couldn't because the yearly budget had been made and he couldn't justify adding to the head count at this time. Instead he gave me the AP Admin job. Assuming I perform well, we agreed to revisit the possibility of creating the FA job for me next year. 

For all of you looking for work who are in the same boat as I was, I must stress the importance of networking. Over half the interviews I have received have only been because I network. But networking is not something you only do when you're looking for work. It's about building something for yourself and others. And in the end, networking isn't going to get you the job. You still have to earn this. It will however get you the interview and a chance to earn it."
1e37yk,1,2013-05-10,8 classes to go,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e37yk/8_classes_to_go/,"   8 classes to go and in all honesty I don't know how I will do it. I just started to see a doctor and get medicated but how do I get past bad habits?

   By bad habits I mean, ADHD has caused so much stress that I no longer am able to look at things that mAy be negative. I don't check my grades during the school year, I avoid reading emails since it may regard to my school loans or academic probation and I just don't see how I can fully function in this world when I am like this. 

   I have to intern twice in addition to my 8 classes and I can't get past it. In fact, I really wanted to take 3 classes this summer but have yet to sign up in regards that I may have another hold or another setback. Ie developed a ""wait to the literal last minute and pray"" method and sometimes it works out but sometimes it doesn't. The further I get into my profession, the more likely this method will not work at all. 

TL;DR: Unattended ADHD has caused problems, built the habit of avoidance if a negative outcome/emails is an option. How can I get myself to break the habit?

Thanks guys in advance, I've been a lurker of this subreddit for a while and it got me to accept that something may be wrong and to go get help. "

ADD ""bootcamp"" activity ideas?",4months2run,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e256j/summer_has_started_and_i_need_to_make_some/,"(Skip to the next paragraph if you don't care about how I've come to the conclusion that I need to do some self-improvement) 
I'm a 20 year old female unmedicated undergrad junior next semester, and last semester was the worst of my life so far. I was late EVERY SINGLE DAY to all but one of my classes, every club meeting (that I was usually running as well), and most days at work. Not just one minute late either, usually 5 minutes, even 15-30 (without any good reason other than I forgot) at least once in every class that I was late to. I tried waking up earlier, tried eating breakfast, tried getting more sleep, tried setting all of my clocks fast by 5-20 minutes, skipped taking showers several days in a row, tried running, nothing worked. The only reason I wasn't late to one class was because it was directly after another and within the same building. I also turned in most of my homework late (bless my professors for even allowing that), even a final paper. And of course when I did my homework it was usually not fully done since I could never manage to either do it or just plain remember to do it about an hour before it was due. Luckily what I did do I very well since all of my professors remarked that it was sad that I was doing so poorly because of failing to complete assignments when I apparently understood the material. Tests have progressively become more and more of a nightmare over the years and by the end of this semester I needed over 20 full minutes to calm down enough to be able to read the questions fully, having at least learned that was where half of my lost points came from thanks to previous tests. This was my first semester with mostly 50+ student classes (its a very small college) and these huge lectures were a nightmare, usually resulting in me falling asleep or doodling in order to not fall asleep. When comparing my notes to my peers I found out I'd completely misheard huge points and therefore couldn't trust what I wrote. It was also a nightmare trying to keep my friends this semester since I kept forgetting to talk to them and forgot when dining hall hours were, resulting in me having to eat alone most days. My room was a huge stressful disaster zone. Laundry became carpet and I didn't let anyone even look past my door, hurting my social life again. I ran away from all the stress that accumulated by either zoning out, sleeping, or hyperfocusing on either a tv show or book series (usually book series, tv series takes days instead of hours to finish and I absolutely can't do anything else when I'm hooked on one, making them wayyyyy too dangerous for me- I could literally not care about eating or leaving my room for days if I get hooked while alone). I became so sick with anxiety by the end that I was throwing up at the thought of the paper final (6 pages, not the longest I've done either) and seriously considered walking out of my final tests (which were much better than I thought they would be much due to the extra hour we all got for them). I ended up having to pay someone to pack and clean out my room for me too, just barely managing to pack what I needed to take home on time to catch the plane. I absolutely cannot do this ever again. If nothing else, I don't think my sense of self worth will be able to handle it. I haven't let anyone know the full extent of how bad this semester has been, even made a freaking throwaway for this post, and am praying for C's at this point.

So I've decided not to do a full time job or internship this summer and focus instead on self-improvement to help me survive (and get over how depressing this semester has been).

**Things I think are important that I improve on:**
1) Attention span during long lectures/ability to read so much as a paragraph of my textbooks and retain the information

2) Time management

3) Organization

4) Sleep schedule

5) Stress management

**This is what I was thinking of doing:**
1) Having a strict sleep schedule that will mimic what I will have to do at school

2) Mindfulness meditation daily for at least a few minutes. I've done it once a week for a few weeks before and it was very helpful in clearing my mind. It's never been about quieting the mind, rather just being more aware of my thoughts and feelings as they come and go. It helps the most in preventing myself from drowning in ""I'm so stupid"" thoughts and I hope it can prevent freak outs when presented with more than one thing to do at a time.

3) Hot Bikram yoga a few days a week (I freaking love it and best, am *good* at it, but was too busy during school. I don't like other forms of exercise because ""I'm bad"" at them and therefore they're embarrassing...), I've heard regular exercise helps immensely with ADD.

4) Updating my blog every day, which will get me writing about something I love (its not a personal blog).

But I don't know how much those will help with time management which I think is the key to managing most every one of my problems.

I have 4 months of vacation, so I figure that's a good amount of time to have plenty of failures and restarts in making any kind of positive habit changes without any repercussions. Or am I naive? Haha.

Do any of you have any other concrete activity suggestions for ways I can practice the improvements I want to make?

1e1gfr,2,2013-05-09,"Need college advice, narrowly missed academic probation this semester and don't know how to pick up the pieces",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1e1gfr/need_college_advice_narrowly_missed_academic/,"Sorry for the long backstory....  Basically starting college I didn't know what to do with my life, so I majored in Biochem and set my hopes on applying to medical/pharmacy school, despite the fact that I've always been terrible in science and never had a much interest in the field (my entire family is in the medical field, so I suppose I felt a little pressure). I did surprisingly well though and maintained a 3.6 GPA, although my highest grades were in my general ed classes (I made As in every non science class I took).  Then, sophomore year, I got a job in a pharmacy and hated it.  I was also becoming burnt out from taking upper level science classes that didn't interest me, so I panicked and decided to transfer to another university and get a degree in hearing sciences, then apply to grad school for audiology.  My reasoning for audiology being: medical field, high demand job, not as much rigorous science.

This is where things fall apart.  Had trouble making friends, had trouble adjusting to my new uni which, in retrospect, was a terrible fit for me.  Lost quite a bit of weight and was even worried that I was developing an eating disorder.  Looking back, this is the point where I should have sought counseling, asked for help, etc.  Stupidly, instead of doing any of these things, I panicked once again and decided that I had picked the wrong major, and if I changed my major everything would be better.  This was by far my biggest fuck up.  I switched to nutrition science, based on the fact that I had many requirements for the major already filled from my previous biochem requirements, and a mild interest in nutrition.  (My first semester GPA was 2.1 by the way.)

Although the next semester (this past spring) got better towards the end, it wasn't soon enough.  Things were still bad at the beginning; I still didn't have many friends and was pretty isolated and really sad.  Nutrition science is more demanding than hearing sciences, and I barely had any motivation to keep going.  I should have dropped classes, probably even should have withdrawn from my semester, but I didn't.  I thought if I forced myself to keep going things would get better.  Grades were still terrible though and I now have a cumulative GPA of 2.00.  The minimum not to be on academic probation.

Outside of academics, at the end of the semester things began to shape up.  I got a fun part time job that I'll keep this summer/next year, made more friends, am soon moving into an apartment with a great roommate, and was pretty happy the last few weeks of school and genuinely left feeling like I belonged there.  The last couple weeks of school I was actually happy, felt like myself again.  It's too bad these things didn't happen earlier, or I probably could have salvaged my grades.

The problem is, where do I go from here academically?  I am signed up to retake the classes I did bad in this summer, which would drastically raise my GPA.  I know I am capable of getting As in these classes if I retake them.  But that doesn't change the fact that I am in a challenging major with only a 2.0 GPA, and I have no job prospects with this major without going to grad school.  I will never be able to get a job doing research in a lab or an internship with my current grades, which are a necessity for my major and for applying to grad school, not to mention that I don't even think research is something I would like.  

Overall I made a terrible decision switching into this major, and I don't know if, after I retake classes, I should suck it up, and finish in this program, because I'm already a senior and this is what I committed to doing, or if I should find another major I'm interested in and good at and could still probably graduate in the same amount of time.  I just hate how indecisive I feel, I feel like I've lost my mind.  Most frustrating is that the classes I did bad in here were still easier than the many of the classes I took as a biochem major, and I know that I could've done really well under better circumstances.
I suppose I'm just looking for any suggestions, or anyone who can relate."

I graduated with a Masters in Information Science in 2011 from one of the Tier 1 institutes in India. Before that I completed a Bachelors in Information Technology (2010, by correspondence) and a Bachelors in Life Sciences (2009, full-time.)

Uptil December, I used to work at one of the largest Internet companies as an analyst. My job was mostly to review content and analyze data related to workflow issues, and suggest improvements with respect to the same.

I left the job, because I wanted to shift over to Software Engineering. My coursework includes most of the subjects taught in a regular Bachelors course in Computer Science. I can also code fairly well. While I don't have the experience of an internship, I have attended a summer school with a software giant. I also have a Masters project (related to GIS) to showcase my coding skills.

For the past couple of months, I've been prepping up and applying aggressively (through applicant tracking systems, job boards and referrals) to software companies in the hopes of an interview call. I think I have my resume and cover letter straight (keyword-optimized and tailored for each job.) However, all I've received uptil now is a rain of rejections. :(

A friend had asked for my resume a couple of days back to send to his brother, who works for a networking giant. Here's what the guy sent back:

*Problem is that this guy has not done a BE/B.Tech. and the minimum qualification here for being a developer/tester is a BE/B.Tech. :-(. Though his profile is quite interesting, they will definitely disqualify him based on that single criterion itself.*

A BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science is the indian equivalent of a 4-year BS in Computer Science. Software ompanies down here require a BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science *or an equivalent degree* for consideration for a entry-level job.

**Is it totally necessary to have a BS/BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science to land a job in software development? Does a B.Sc. in Information Technology \+ an MS in Information Science make the cut (assuming that the candidate has taken identical courses?)** I've landed interviews previously with two very big software companies (one through a referral, the other through a consulting firm,) but after reading this message, my brain seems to have frozen.

Am I asking for too much? If not, how do you suggest I go about this?

Thanks."

I have a decent amount of experience in what the internship calls (mostly class assignments and some little websites I made for fun) for but I'm worried about disappointing.

The job literally saved my life as I was heading on a very bad downwards spiral. I was hired full time and was tasked with basic level 1 stuff. Laptop repair, smartboard adjustment, and basic networking. I fought for a file server and new laptops for the whole school and made a great ticket site to keep things in check as well as managing the inventory with my coworker. But thats about it, the rest of it comes down to plugging in usb ports the right way and air dusting projectors that overheat.

However theres no incentive to do more than the very basics. The mdf and idfs are old and degraded, no domain controller, a decrepit wireless configuration that turns a 20mb up/down into 300kbps, owa 2003 managed off site that gives users 20mb of space, the fileserver is a mac because thats the only thing for sale and its trash in a 98% windows environment, theres an old content engine proxy that hits up a vip farm that gets in the way of everything, no wsus, no software updating procedure, we run out of license keys all the time, the users are a bit technologically inept and thats ok but some of them refuse point blank to learn anything more, we had a consultant come in and convince the school to buy ipads that have been nothing but a headache and i keep getting the feeling that the people i work with dont understand why all of this upsets me. 

The school has a gigantic budget but only about 25k can be computer related though I have to check since somehow we spent 450k on lenovos.

I dont know what steps to take to rectify any of this or if any of it is even worth it. Men and women of sysadmin, am i over reacting over a simple job or is this just what i should be getting used to in education?"

I've been interested in programming for a long time, and am currently majoring in ComSci. For the majority of my programming career, I've been told I'm good at programming and regularly gotten good marks and whatnot. However, the further I've progressed down my chosen path of study, the more I realize that knowing how to do stuff in a specific language is nowhere near as important as knowing how to be a good programmer. I *really* want to be a good programmer. Unfortunately, I suffer from a crippling lack of ambition (I play too many vidya), and a woeful inability to not look at what I have to learn in small sections. I recently started a development internship and have been given a ""reading list"" from the guy who seems to have taken the responsibility of mentoring me. I'm reading up on the stuff he's mentioned, and it's interesting, but I feel like a lot of it isn't really sinking in, and am confronted by this gigantic wall of things I don't understand yet, which causes me to shrink away and go back to other, simpler things (I'm up to 600ish points on codeacademy in the space of about a week, currently working on python).

Anyways, that's all just a lot of backstory for a simple question, which is: Where do I start? How do I get involved in the greater programming community, such that I can learn how to be good at what I do, as opposed to just know a lot of languages and be bad at all of them? I know that the key is practice, practice, practice - I'm just afraid that I don't have enough knowledge yet, and that I'd only be reinforcing bad habits.

Thanks in advance :D

tl;dr Where do I go to learn to be a good programmer, as opposed to a good code monkey?"
1e47o1,20,2013-05-11,I've just started work at my first coding internship! I'd appreciate any advice you have for me.,lostcats,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1e47o1/ive_just_started_work_at_my_first_coding/,"This summer, I was fortunate enough to land my first coding internship. It's a four-month internship on the web development team of a large organization.

A week has gone by, and I haven't done much coding yet, but this will change soon. Part of the slowness has been due to difficulties in getting the proper software set up (not exactly the fastest organization), and trying to familiarize myself with the workplace and its technologies. It's my first time using Visual Studio, C#, and ASP.NET.  Prior to this, most of the coding I've done has been with Java and for school - I've just finished up my second year of CS. It's my first time coding professionally, and I've been quite nervous. 
  
Already, I'm feeling overwhelmed here. Some things I'd like to know about:
  
1. What's the best way to ask for help? I have a great supervisor who understands that I'm an intern here to learn, so I know he doesn't expect perfection from me. I mainly follow his direction, but he is very busy. If it makes any sense, I'd like to ask good questions and not feel like I'm annoying him. I know it's a mistake - not getting help when I need it, especially when I need clarification.

2. How can I get better at understanding and reading other people's code? I'm not great at this. I was rather overwhelmed when I saw the code for the project, although I don't know what else I expected. I felt like I was just thrown into a project. I did receive some clarification from the supervisor and another developer, but I think I should be more self-sufficient. 

3. Will I ever begin to feel like I know what I'm doing as time goes on? I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing, except for following the guidance of others.

4. How can I make the most of my internship? Already I feel like I will continue to feel overwhelmed if I don't take an active role here. I know I have a lot of things to learn. Although I'm nervous, I'm excited to actually be coding things that will be used by people.

5. Any general advice/helpful tips/things you wished you knew when you were an intern?

I probably sound really worried... I do often doubt my own abilities. Thanks for any advice."

1e7769,1,2013-05-12,Just finished my 5th/Erasmus year in engineering (in the UK). Now what?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1e7769/just_finished_my_5therasmus_year_in_engineering/,"Hi fellow engineers,

I'm a Spanish guy who has just finished his Engineering degree (Industrial Engineering, which in Spain is basically a broader version of Mechanical Engineering). I've been studying this last year in the UK and I just love it in here, so I would like to stay here and try to get a job as an engineer in here.

But life's never easy, so I have some problems with that:

-I would love to work in the automotive sector. Cars are basically the main reason why I've studied engineering in the first place... and I'm afraid that if I apply for a job in, say pressure vessels, I will eventually become ""this engineer specialized in pressure vessels"" and it will be hard for me to move to cars.

-Even if I've finished all of my exams... I'm not technically a graduate yet. Because of the way Erasmus grants work, if you go abroad you cannot do your last year AND your last year project. That is, you can either do all of the 5th year subjects but no project, or do them back in Spain and then go to [insert country here] and finish your project there. Either way your stuck for a 6th year (thanks, bureaucracy). However, some companies might consider me graduate (since I could do the project in just 3 months while working for them) or let me work with them on a project that I can use as a final year thesis.

-And well... I'm Spanish, and I don't know if that's good or bad for applying for a job in here. I know for a fact that engineering is way harder in Spain than in here, but potential employers probably won't know that. My English is quite good anyway (well, you can probably judge for yourselves by reading this) so I shouldn't have any problems with the language if I finally start a career in here.

So here's the question: What do you think I should do? Try to apply for Graduate jobs in here, even if they are not automotive related? Student Internships? Should I go back to Spain, start the final year project, and meanwhile look for jobs in the UK?

Thank you r/engineering!"

To make this question short, I received an email through LinkedIn from a man who works at GroupOn as their Senior Technical Recruiter. After some researching, this man seems to have also worked at recruiter.

The reason why I am suspicious, if that's the correct word, is because my LinkedIn profile is rather plain - people have endorsed certain technical skills, and all I really have is the four most recent, relevant, job titles and timelines. 

&gt;I’m reaching out to you, as a new R&amp;D team here at Groupon liked your profile and wanted me to connect with you as they'd love to chat with you about an opportunity to join them in the United States. 
&gt;
&gt;Due to the confidential nature of this technology, I can’t go into details in this email, but I can provide more information over the phone and will send descriptions and links after we chat. I can tell you that we'll be utilizing machine learning/mobile and geo location technology heavily - and with half a million merchants and 200 million customers, this has never been attempted or built by anyone at this scale. Since our beginnings 4 years ago - Groupon technology has funneled 6 billion dollars to local business, revenue solely generated to them by Groupon. This new technology should enable us to generate double if not tripple that revenue to small and local businesses, globally, truly disrupting commerce as we know it. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;This team will be in Canada the first week of June for the sole purpose of meeting with engineers interested in this opportunity. I’d love to connect this week for about 30 minutes via phone to discuss these roles, and can make myself available at a time that works for you. Please feel free to schedule a time that works for you on my calendar directly at [link taken out]. I look forward to chatting 


I was prompted for an interview time through the phone - which I did through doodle - and I took out of curiousity. I don't really use LinkedIn that much nor have I updated it that much either.

Am I right to be kind of curious and almost suspicious as to why I was selected?
If this is legitimate, how do I approach the interview tomorrow - should I mention at the start that I'm still a student? Do I assume this is like any other technical interview through the phone? If this isn't legitimate, what signs should I look for?

**tl;dr** got emailed through LinkedIn asking for a phone interview. LinkedIn profile barely has anything on it. Not sure if legitimate, and if legit, how to approach."

1e865t,2,2013-05-13,What am I doing - Comp Sci major to History PhD to Marketing to maybe programming again?? Need advice.,Comet7777,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e865t/what_am_i_doing_comp_sci_major_to_history_phd_to/,"Hey everyone, 

I have a suspicion that I am not alone in being in my early to mid 20s without having a real exact idea with what I want to do for the rest of my life. I had programmed in highschool in various AP courses as well as for fun (programmed games). I went to college on a computer science scholarship thinking that would be the logical choice for me. After two years of doing computer science and becoming somewhat jaded (in retrospect it had more to do with myself than with the discipline), I wanted to challenge myself and make meaning of my life and switched over to a history and english double major. I managed to finish my degree on time even though I made a radical change. 

Things get interesting when I then was accepted to a Masters program for History. I really enjoyed what I learned and took it to a PhD program (all fully paid for by the department, with a nice yearly stipend too so it wasn't that much of a financial risk). I'm almost done with my coursework and on the verge of starting my dissertation writing process and I think I'm completely burnt out. I've come to this conclusion for a number of reasons: 1) the job market for my discipline and subfield is atrocious. If you land the coveted tenure-track job you've successfully have won the lottery. I refuse to slave away teaching 5-7 classes per semester as an adjunct to barely scrape by at maybe $30k/year since all that work guarantees you can't put time and energy into resumes and writing samples to get a better job. And 2) the idyllic professor job isn't so ideal after all. My wife is a teacher herself and she spends 10 hours at her school, comes home exhausted, and has to plan and grade all evening. It's hardly a life, and with us wanting to start a family, it doesn't make much sense for two of us to be doing the same thing. 

So, Reddit, I turn to you guys for advice. Since the job market looks awful I've decided to be proactive and engage with the private sector. I managed to snag a nice paid internship as a Market Researcher at an IT company. This is allowing me to network, gain crucial experience, and to learn what office environments are like. I've been really enjoying the whole ordeal. I recently learned that a few of us interns were brought in with the specific goal of turning us into full time employees. I would normally be suspicious of such a claim but this company was just recently acquired by an equity firm and is nearly doubling in size this year. It doesn't seem like a stretch that I could be offered a full time position contingent on my performance. Furthermore, since it is an IT company I'm working for and I have a TON of friends in the industry working as various sorts of programmers, it would seem that if I stayed in this industry I'd have a solid network already. Moreover, I've seen the career trajectories (and the stability) of programmers. It's been making me think that maybe I should refine my programming skills and follow that path. 

In conclusion, it seems that I can either 1) finish the PhD and pray pray pray that I land a tenure track job, 2) following this marketing gig since I'm actually utilizing the skillset I've developed in grad school and has a good potential for a career, or 3) since I have a foot in the door in the IT industry, maybe I can go back to programming?

Reddit - what say you?

TLDR - was a CS major but switched to history/english. Half-way through a PhD in history but got a marketing research gig and am enjoying it and am now deciding between going into marketing or programming (since I have a background of that already). I don't know what I'm doing with my life (long TLDR lol).

My goal is to keep it under $1200, which seems like I have done. Ideally, I would like to be closer to $1000. I will be overclocking sometime in the future, but not ""near"" future. My question is: am I overspending on anything? Is there any price reductions I can make in without sacrificing performance too much? 

I went to Microcenter today and found that they have

Crucial Ballistix sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory for $50. Is the $21 decrease worth it? Is this RAM terrible? 

I am also hoping to get a more portable case. I am moving in about a month for my internship, and moving (back) again in 4 months - so portability is very important. I would be willing to spend more for this.

I feel prepared but what will they ask me in these 30-40 minutes? How can I absolutely nail it given that they now what I'm capable of and know how hard I work?

I see other candidates coming in and also interviewing and what scares me is this position prefers 5+ years experience and these people all have more than me since I'm relatively young. I only have 3 years, but 1 is at this company and I feel my MBA must count for something, right? Why am I nervous about this despite me being that typical internal hire who usually beats the outside competition? 

What can I do to absolutely nail these brief interviews? I am bringing a portfolio of my work and plan to let that do the talking and only answer what they ask me ( no digressing)

Is there any additional advice someone has to calm my nerves? This is the biggest opportunity if my life, I interview well, am friendly and very articulate - I'm just a bit freaked that so much is weighing on this because I've worked so hard over the last 12 months and am not sure about my competition. 

Anything helps Jobbit. Thanks. "
1eabqe,5,2013-05-13,Mrs. Silvir,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eabqe/mrs_silvir/,"Being in an AP Psychology class, I've had to volunteer and interview multiple psychologists and psychiatrists in my area. These meetings usually followed up with writing a 5 page essay the night before it was due. None of it was ever interesting, the therapists I met with never had anything interesting to offer me. 
This was until I was actually offered an internship. Of course, I jumped at the chance, knowing how rare it was for a high school student to come across the opportunity of an actual internship in a field that I actually wanted to pursue. I accepted. The internship began late April. I was to go every Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.
It was a pretty small clinic for those who I can only describe as ""unable to function on their own"". I don't refer to it as an insane asylum as most of the people I'm around I find to be actually pretty normal, aside from the random bouts of anxiety or fear. Of course since I don't actually have any qualifications or degree to closely work with the patients too much, I'm usually just filing papers and running errands. But once in a while, Dr. Pinner (one of the head psychiatrists, also the one that offered the internship) allows me to sit in on a patient session.
These sessions usually consisted of me introducing myself and then sitting to the side and taking notes for a good 30 minutes to an hour. Most of the time the conversations I sat in on were uneventful, although I still enjoyed just being there. So far I’ve met with 6 patients. No need to tell you about the first five, since there’s nothing very interesting to say, but patient number six. That’s who I’m going to tell you about today in the hopes that I can find some comfort, or some advice I guess, too.
Last Thursday for the half hour before I was to leave (around 6 pm, I believe), Dr. Pinner once again invited me into his office. It’s become more frequent now, these invitations. I guess he thinks I’m doing a good job, but either way, I’m not sure I want to go back anymore. 
He told me that I’d be meeting a new patient. Mrs. Silvir. She had PTSD (although I wasn’t told what from), several phobic disorders, and severe schizophrenia. He left the room to bring the patient in, and I pulled out my phone to quickly check my texts (what can I say, I’m a teenager). As he came back into the room I jumped and shoved my phone back into my bag. When I looked up I saw Dr. Pinner holding the arm of an older woman. There was something uneasy about her, although I couldn’t really put my finger on exactly what it was. Her hair was dark and matted, but her eyes were light blue. So light blue…  almost white. It was kind of startling, in fact. Her shoulders were slightly hunched and she wore frailed, slightly dirty clothes. Her lips were thin, and dry. She glared at me with the weirdest look… I can’t even explain. Although I hesitated for a good 10 seconds, I mustered the courage to get up to shake her hand and introduce myself. “Hi Mrs. Silvir, I’m Presley. I’ll just be sitting in on this session, I hope you don’t mind. It’s really nice to meet you.” I reached out my hand and she pulled back. Her glare turned into a twisted smile. “Hi there Presley. Nice to finally meet you too.” Her voice was dry, quiet. 
Although this session was one of the most nerve wracking sessions I’ve sat in on, I’ll leave that for later. 
After the session, Dr. Pinner informed me that he just had to go consult with another nurse and that he’d be back in a minute. What he didn’t tell me was that he’d be leaving Mrs. Silvir with me. Alone.
She faced opposite from me, sitting in the couch, looking out of the office window. In an attempt to break the nervous silence, I tried to make small talk with her. Bad idea. “So I just wanted to make sure I have your name right. Mrs. Silvir, right? I’m pronouncing it correctly?” Her head turned slowly in my direction. She leaned in close to me. My skin crawled with unease. “I know who you are. You might not know me but oh, I know you sweetie.” Her voice was different. It was almost theatrical. Her words curled up into faint shrills. I didn’t know how to respond, so I just let out a nervous giggle and forced a smile. “I see you sleep at night. I see you trying to force yourself into slumber. But you can’t right? You think you see things in the dark. Such an innocent little girl. I see you turn on the lights when you think you hear shuffling in the corner. Coming closer… closer to the edge of your bed in the dark.” I was frozen in place. “I see you all the time. I saw you undressing yesterday. I saw your pretty new panties. All light pink and lacy. Even a bow to top off the pretty little girl.” She let out a giggle. “I see you everyday but you never seem to want to say hi to me. That’s not very nice.” Her voice turned deep, angry. “Oh and next week is your birthday too isn’t it. All grown up. No worries, I have a nice present for you. I’ll leave it where you can find it. I hope you like it. You better like it. It’s from me and I spent a good amount of time choosing it. Just. For. You.”
The door clicked open as Mrs. Silvir snapped back up, her face staring out the window once again, like nothing had happened. Dr. Pinner walked in and escorted her out of the office. I was shaking. I didn’t know what had just happened. I couldn’t move. Dr. Pinner walked back into the office and stopped midway. “Is everything alright? You look a bit shaken. I know that was a pretty heavy session…” “No, no. Nothing like that. I’m just tired.” I replied. “Oh, alright then. Well it’s about time anyways for you to be out, so why not just go ahead, I’ll sign you out.” “Oh… okay, thanks, Dr. Pinner.”
The rest of the night I spent going over that occurrence in my mind. I haven’t been able to fall asleep since then. And the scariest part of it all is that what she said was true… I do get scared at night. Like a kid. Probably mostly due to the massive amounts of time I spend on nosleep and creepypasta. And as privacy ridding it is to admit… I did have new panties…. Pink ones. 
I don’t know what to do. I’ve been looking over my shoulder uneasily for the past 6 days. And tomorrow is my time at the office, once again. I don’t know…. Please someone tell me what I should do.

My goal is to keep it under $1200, which seems like I have done. Ideally, I would like to be closer to $1000. I will be overclocking sometime in the future, but not ""near"" future. My question is: am I overspending on anything? Is there any price reductions I can make in without sacrificing performance too much? 

For example, I went to Microcenter today and found that they have

Crucial Ballistix sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory for $50. Is the $21 decrease worth it? Is this RAM terrible? 

I am also hoping to get a different case, maybe something more portable. I am moving in about a month for my internship, and moving (back) again in 4 months - so portability might be good. I would be willing to spend more for this. 

I would really appreciate any feedback. I'm real nervous since it's my first time! Thanks in advance.

1ef0w4,1,2013-05-15,Should I leave my job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ef0w4/should_i_leave_my_job/,"I'm a 23 year old college graduate (econ/international relations). After a very fulfilling few years in college internships, which gave me a great resume, I have found my first full time position in an institution of higher education.

However, the office environment/morale is extremely negative, the person who works above me is not the best manager or communicator (little training compared to the complexity of the tasks at hand), and I'm 100% sure I don't want a career in my particular department in higher education.  The problem is I started in January of this year and I'm worried it will look bad on me to leave after a few months and also that my employer would be extremely upset-even though I'm sure they think I'm a bad fit for the job. I have offered to help out colleagues in other departments to widen my skill set while I'm here. Realistically speaking, I couldn't leave any time soon but the thought of staying here another year just squashes my soul.

On top of all of that, the person above me (my unofficial boss) got into a screaming match with our head accountant because he wanted her to lie to the IRS by signing as a third party appraiser on a transaction conducted between our university and an individual making a non-monetary donation. The accountant was very alarmed, refused and told me to speak to her if this ever happened again. After that I have no idea if I can trust him even slightly, if he was willing to break the law so carelessly. How can I protect myself from becoming involved in those kind of semi-illegal situations? If I can't even trust the people I work with the most will I be able to make a significant contribution to this employer, or am I just wasting my time?"

I am a programmer that will be finishing up my CS undergrad degree next year. I was hired as a contract programmer for a startup. Another friend of mine was also hired at around the same time as me so we are the first workers there besides the founders. The current state of the company is we have operational funds for the next 6 months already lined up, a couple potential licensing/consulting agreements we are following up on, and are in early talks with several more investors who seem to be very interested.

So far it has been a great deal for a college student with flexible hours, competitive pay even compared to good computer science internships in the area, and I have learned a lot. Lately the other programmer and I have been questioning whether our work is being valued appropriately within the company. 

The cofounders were technical founders, but after me and my friend started working the technology quickly grew beyond their abilities. I personally have come to take control of a lot of product management responsibilities and have the final say in design and development decisions.

Me and the other main programmers compensation for our work has been around $20 an hour in addition to $20 an hour in options each. Over the last year or so we each have acquired options for roughly 0.75% of the shares of the company. The founders and even advisors who only help us occasionally have significantly more.

I don't want to cause equity struggles within the company, but I want to get some idea as to whether my work is getting fairly compensated so that if the company grows I'm not tossed aside or cheated. The going rate for a developer with my particular skill set is a six-figure salary, granted I don't have the experience or credentials to command that kind of salary, but I think that I would be close and for sure more than I currently make. 

To me it looks as if my work may not be valued appropriately, but because I have no idea how people are usually compensated using equity and options I have no idea how to read my situation. Does this seem like a reasonable compensation to other redditors out there? If I was to have a discussion with the founders about the value I add to the company what should I say or ask about to help. Any advice from people who were early hires at a start up?

Sorry for the vagueness, but I would rather not post identifiable information on here for obvious reasons. Thanks for helping me out!

*TL;DR*: What is a fair share of equity/pay for an early tech-startup hire?

EDIT: clarity

Everytime you want to submit your dream, you would have to donate a dollar, USD, or more if you'd like. Since my dream, is to help other people fulfill their dreams, I think this would be great. However, we need a website to start off, so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to make us a website? I would try to pay you as much as possible, but since this is a charity, it would b hard. After getting off the ground, when we start getting noticed more, you would be getting paid, and it would basically be a job. So consider this an internship, I suppose. Anyone want to?

Let’s emulate how ancient cultures show appreciation for this time by honoring the love within us.

Throughout time, songs have been sung, poems have been composed, and volumes upon volumes have been written about Love.  Without a doubt, love is as critical as air and water.  

So this Summer Solstice, Beyond Body Mind Spirit (BBMS) invites you to explore and expand your world of Love into Self Love.   Try this exercise. 

Right now close your eyes for a moment. Visualize your body as a gateway opening to release the thoughts and feelings within you.  Now ask yourself, “What does happiness mean to me?”  Take a few moments.  Allow every thought and feeling to be expressed, using whatever device is at hand.

When I tried this exercise, I realized the majority of my responses were about my desire to help the other people in my life. I believe this is an admirable quality.  Perhaps you, like me, were taught,  “do onto others …”  as children.  Yet as I read through my list of answers, I realized what was missing was how I create my own happiness through my actions towards me.

And that’s what BBMS asks you to consider- all the ways to support you, care for you, make wiser decisions for you, have compassion for you, and unconditionally love you.  As my experience suggests, learning how to love yourself requires these quiet moments and a teacher to help you explore what’s inside. 

Self Love is just ONE aspect of happiness.  At BBMS, we help you “Enjoy Healthy” in its fullest sense and add yoga, meditation, and nutrition.  

Over the next few weeks, I will explore the other 3 aspects with you. 

So begin by commenting about your thoughts on happiness to keep this conversation going.  Then infuse your vision of happiness into your Summer Solstice practice and revel in your creation.

P.S. Add your comments and let’s blow the roof off our experience of Self Love. 

P.P.S. Like us on Facebook.

So I've always had a problem with the things that come out of my mouth. I tend to offend people without meaning to, and I generally come off as a mean, unfriendly bitch (with a lot of unnecessary flamboyance and drama). If you can, imagine that one person who's always loud, mean and generally obnoxious. Somehow I still have friends, but I feel they tolerate me more than truly enjoy spending time with me. 

It's also starting to affect my work. For example today, I made a remark that I feel may have offended someone and given them a bad impression of my work ethic as an intern (I was being berated for having appointments overlap by 10 minutes, to which I replied that I had to wait for X, a senior staff, to pass me his work before I could do mine). I meant to, and hopefully did, say it in a joking manner but I suppose it might have been construed as me pushing the blame on someone else, since my default facial expression is 'grumpy and always-looking-for-a-fight'.

I realise I shouldn't have made that remark in the first place, but upon further reflection, I probably do this more often than I realise. I find it difficult to recognise where the joking boundaries are, which is doubly hard for me since my jokes probably don't come across as such (ah, the pitfalls of sarcasm). 

My question: What sort of person do people like to work/hang out with and how can I become that person? Any tips for me to give people a good impression? I also want to make this change last long term, so any advice is welcome! Please, if I'm unclear in my post, ask me to clarify! "

And fast forward to me, who has been mooching off of her-- I've been fired from 1 job after 5 months, quit an internship 2 weeks in without notice after realizing I am not fitting in, and taking on a minimum wage customer service job to be a better people person. I am struggling financially.

I feel very guilty for not landing a good job after college. My mom's been taking care of my grandmother who is severely depressed (she came to the US to raise me). My Dad's not in the picture because he and decided to live with his mom to evade debt in the US when I was 12.

I'm scared that I'm turning out like my dad. Leaving commitments and I only have a few friends at a time in my life. 

I've stayed at my college town for 5 years. The school is definitely a reach school and I would not have gotten there without my Mom pushing me. 5 years of studying and almost dropping out, came out with a degree I don't care much about with a 2.9 GPA. 

No big network of friends and I think I'm pissing away my youth at my Mom's expense. I'm thinking of working at the oil fields in middle America to pay my educational debts or maybe moving back home to help my grandmother. 

TLDR; led sheltered life, can't hold down a job, burn bridges, have few friends, don't want to end up like my dad and grandma who don't have a support network. I feel like a robot that doesn't see the consequences of what I do to other people. How can I change?"

1. Could you guys recommend some books to me as just a way to introduce me to management consulting and what I'd need to learn/do/practice to do well in consulting interviews and such. 


2. Any other general advice on how to approach getting into consulting?



3. Are there any consulting internships for undergrads out there or is it strictly for grad students? If so, do you have any advice on when/where I should look for them?

1eg9sl,6,2013-05-16,[Build Help] Wondering if I can build a Desktop for moderate gaming for around 500$ to outperform my laptop.,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1eg9sl/build_help_wondering_if_i_can_build_a_desktop_for/,"Hello reddit!

I have been thinking about building a desktop  for a while and now that I have started my summer internship I think it may be time to start!

I would like to spend around 500$ but am willing to increase a bit for a better performance within reason.

Currently I have a ""Gaming Laptop"" with the following specs

•	Processor Intel 2nd Gen Core i7 i7-2670QM / 2.2 GHz ( 3.1 GHz ) ( Quad-Core )

•	Memory 8.0 GB / 8.0 GB (max)

•	Hard Drive750.0 GB - Serial ATA-300

•	Operating System Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Edition

•	Display Type 16.4 in TFT active matrix

•	Max Resolution1920 x 1080 ( Full HD )

•	Graphics Processor NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M

•	Optical Drive DVD-Writer / BD-ROM - Integrated


My goal in building this Desktop would be to outperform my laptop with a decent margin. My laptop has cooling issues and tends to framedrop far too much for my liking.

Games I play include Guild Wars 2, Chivalry, CS:GO, ARMA 2 and 3, and hopefully Dayz standalone when it comes out.

I have a keyboard a mouse and monitors and if I want to upgrade those later I will but I would love some tips and advice!"
1eg8wd,1,2013-05-16,"Should I take the ""safe route"" or go with my gut?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1eg8wd/should_i_take_the_safe_route_or_go_with_my_gut/,"I am a 33 year old wife and mom of two. I have a mortgage payment and all the other perks that come with being an adult. I have worked for the past 5 1/2 years as a social work clerk for the Department of Public Health in the state that I live in. For about 3 1/2 to 4 of those years, I've been attending a local university working toward my Bachelor's in social work. My employer has allowed me to flex my time to attend any classes that I could not take in the evenings or online. 

This being said, a coworker was allowed to do her internship here on work time for her Master's in social work a year or two ago. She was also granted Educational Leave, as was another social worker who was working on her Master's. I have always assumed, and been led to believe, that I would be given the same treatment. 

I am to go into my internship for the Fall semester, and graduate in December. I am to complete a 450 hour field placement. Wednesdays are all day in class, 9-4. When I approached my supervisor to make arrangements to do my placement here on work time, I was told they no longer do that. When I applied for Educational Leave, I was told that my classification (Administrative Support Assistant II) cannot receive Educational Leave for Social Work. I was then told I could use up my leave, then take leave without pay so that I could keep all of my benefits. After graduation, I would then continue as a clerk until a social work position opened up. (All of this was with the stipulation that I complete all of my required tasks.)

As of Tuesday, I was told I could do my placement here, but I would be cut to 1/2 time, meaning I would make only about 600-700$ a month. My insurance premium would go up to $675, I would lose my seniority, my leave accumulation would go down by 1/2, I would not get my annual longetivity payment, and I would not be guaranteed a full time position in any assignment when I graduated. I was also told that if layoffs occur before the semester starts, I will not be able to do my placement here.

If I continue as an employee here, I will have to drop my insurance, as I will not be able to afford it. In addition to all of the things I lose (which were my reasons for wanting to stay) I will be working 12 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8  hours a day 2 days a week for a total of 76 hours a week for 4 months. Like I said, I have two children, and my husband travels for work.

If I quit, I will be able to draw out almost $10,000 from my retirement. This, in addition to my left-over student loan monies would allow me to personally invest some into an IRA or CD, plus give us money to live off of until I graduate. I figure I'm going to lose my insurance anyway. If I did this, I am hoping the place I did my internship at would hire me, or at least provide a great reference for employment.

So, after giving you all the many boring details...do I stay here, lose everything that had given me reason to want to stay to begin with, and kill myself working and doing an internship for almost 80 hours a week. (which will include missing out on things for the kids.) All of this and I don't even know if I'll have a job in December. Or do I resign with the the knowledge that I will have to use some of the retirement I've saved up, and will have to start all over in a new job and agency when I graduate.

I'm turning to Reddit because my husband, mother, friends, etc. will only say do what I think is right or what I want to do. No one will just give me an unbiased opinion.

I never programmed in my life before hand so you could say I'm a very late bloomer. However I just finished up software engineering 1 and I got an A (gpa 3.2) and I'm also about to start a software development internship(my first internship) next week. So this is wear I'm at . However Im thinking of changing my major to Computer science because I heard it was better, my degree plan is literally like a BA in CS and a minor in business,however I fear that I would have less of an earning potential with this degree. Changing would require another year of schooling, which will be a 5th year of college for me. Should I make this decision? Thank you"

1efvth,2,2013-05-16,Construction Management Grad considering second BS in Civil Engineering...?,mnrreeee,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1efvth/construction_management_grad_considering_second/,"I have managed to get myself into a pretty sticky situation and I am looking for any advice from fellow redditers. 

I graduated last December with a BS in Construction Management and have been trying to find entry level work for the last 7 months.  I have managed land a few interviews with small firms, but no offers.  I graduated with an average for my program GPA of 2.7 and no internship experience.  During my undergrad it was very difficult to find any type of internship in my field because of the recession. It seems that I have found myself in catch 22.  Every company wants at least a few years of experience in their entry level positions and I cannot find any company willing to allow a grad to intern.  I have been volunteering building and rehabbing homes to keep myself busy, but that’s not really relevant experience for an entry level management position.    

I have always have had interest in building and designing so becoming a civil engineer is definitely appealing to me.  The civil eng. program I am considering would take me 2.5 to 3 years to complete.  Being enrolled as student again in an undergrad program would make me eligible to intern and hopefully I’d have an edge with the CM degree.   I do have some concerns though.  I am worried that potential employers would wonder why I decided to get a second bachelor’s in such a closely related field especially if I find myself getting into the project management side of things.  I have also heard there is a pretty hard GPA 3.0 cutoff with engineering if this true I know I will have to bust my ass to bring my GPA up.

I have considered masters programs, but I think I would have a tough time getting in and have also read that in order to take the PE exam you must have a BS in engineering.

If I don’t end up going back to school I have thought about entering the trades, but I feel like that would be wasting the last 5 years of my education.

I just need some advice to help decide my future, any help would be great!

3 reported anonymous salaries

Using math, the 3 reported salaries are 14, 20, 23.

When asked what salary I would be okay with, do I just say anywhere from 20-23? Or do I give the whole in-depth explanation that showed I have researched past salaries on Glassdoor and say 14, 20, 23 eliminating the 14 as an outlier and say I deduced my desired salary down to 20-23? In other words, would giving so much detail help my case? Or would they think ""This guy is too smart. Let's pick a different intern so we can pay the new intern less money""?"

Questions|Answers

[Would you recommend that I call or visit the store I applied to after I submit an application? Some people say it make you seem eager and willing, but I also do not want to seem pushy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejbqz/iama_manager_at_a_malls_store_and_im_here_to/ca0u6hm?context=5)|Yes. Chances are you'll get a stock answer when you call, mostly because the person is super busy, but we take note of your name and when going through applications remember that you were actually interested in the status of the application.
[Also, I have some experience working as a Summer School tutor at my high school. Should I include that as job experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejbqz/iama_manager_at_a_malls_store_and_im_here_to/ca0u6hm?context=5)|And that is definitely work experience. Put it on there and if the manager has questions, they will ask you.

If you don't have an interview by then, you ain't getting one. 
[I'm 19 and about to look for my first part time job ever.

If you're not in college come up with another reason you weren't working that sounds damn good.

Shows you're not just a lazy spoiled kid.

But if an app is empty we can't put it in the maybe pile. It goes straight in the no pile if things are left blank. You have no experience? Either find a hobby or volunteer work to put in there or write N/A. 
[Would you avoid hiring a person with scars that are obviously from self-harm (even if the person showed no other indication of mental health issues\)?

And I feel like a lot of places don't. You probably could find work as a bagger at a grocery store, or babysitting, but all states have a LOT of laws about minors working, and generally places don't allow minors to run a register so the jobs are limited. Also be prepared for not a lot of hours since we can only give minors limited hours.

We are a really good company to work for. We care about our employees and are honestly more like a close group of friends than coworkers (At least in my store, and as far as I know it's pretty common). Go in to your local store and ask a manager if they are hiring. Generally we don't post sales associate jobs online. Have open availability and a good attitude. We mostly hire in early july and end of october. We are not allowed to keep on all of our sales associates after holiday hiring, but we keep the best. Show up on time for all shifts and pick up extras if offered to you. We might be the ""fun"" store, but we are run by corporate and expect no less from our employees than say Sears or Macy's.

Not a whole lot. As long as you are hygienic and presentable (clean, nice clothes with your hair at least combed into place) we really don't look to much past that when it comes to physical appearance. 
[Can you explain ""Nice cloths""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejbqz/iama_manager_at_a_malls_store_and_im_here_to/ca0v2me?context=5)|Think first date attire. Nice pants but not overly dressy pants (khakis or cargo is okay), not wrinkled, pants NOT sagging, and a button up. And for the love of god NOT jeans. 
[What if jeans are my nices pants.. Like I have shorts pjs and jeans... whenever I go looking/aplying for jobs I will wear my nicest pair and a button up shirt. should I buy some nicer pants?

Thanks for all the advice though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejbqz/iama_manager_at_a_malls_store_and_im_here_to/ca0vq8b?context=5)|Most certainly yes. 
[I work in the restaurant business. Jeans are ok. I wear em to work everyday. Retail is different as you won't be wearing jeans ever. Just pointing out a difference for anyone not seeking retail.

Working and wearing jeans is one thing. You don't have to impress your boss to start your shift every day. But dressing to impress for an interview shows me that you CARE that you get this job. Which implies you will care enough about your job to do it. I don't want to fire you in two months and start the search all over because you can't be bothered to do the things I hired you for.

Nice khakis are perfect. Casual, but you put effort in. Make sure you don't walk in to places with stacks of apps in your hand. If possible, fill them out right away and hand them in so you don't have to let on you're applying everywhere and anywhere.

If it's close enough to commute to your parents on weekends and keep your job, then tell them you're willing to do that. If not, is it a possibility to stay closer to the college during summer? 
[I go to school in a different state, so no. I told the managers that i would be willing to take a LOA and come back and work during breaks, and that it is my last year of school.

[Would you consider someone who already has a job? I work part-time (weekends only\) and they won't give me anymore shifts, so I need a second job to survive this summer.

1ejfdd,4,2013-05-17,"First job--bored after one month--do I leave, and if so, when?",the_bell_tolls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ejfdd/first_jobbored_after_one_monthdo_i_leave_and_if/,"So I'm a new grad and I've been at my first full time software engineering gig for a month now; the organization in question is a recently acquired startup. On the surface and to most anybody on the outside, this job is something of a fantasy: I'm well paid, my shop is staffed with highly competent people, it's a fun environment with very flexible hours, I have top shelf hardware to work and play with and we get tons of benefits and perks.

There's just one really, really big problem: I'm bored to tears. I literally spend my days watching tutorial videos and dicking around with side projects. There isn't a surplus of work available and most of the guys I work with have been together for years and nobody is particularly eager to put me (a nobody college hire) on their project or accept me into their cliquey little groups. I accepted this job because it appeared to be a challenging environment with an interesting variety of projects, but instead I've just spent most of the past week watching streams from I/O.

Frankly, I don't care how much Dr. Pepper or how many organic apples they feed me--I'm a motivated person who seeks out and enjoys challenges. I came here to work hard and learn while I'm still young and eager; I had several awesome internships that pushed me to my limits and gave me something to hang my hat on. This is different, and I'd give most of this up just to have something substantial to do during the day. I'd happily accept bitch work at this point--I'm not expecting serious responsibilities as a new grad.

It's not just that I'm bored, either--I'm also concerned that I'll inevitably end up with a bad performance review all while my skills erode, leaving me stuck here or fired/marginalized. I moved clear across the country for this and committed myself to a year-long lease, too, so in some sense I'm already trapped. As I mentioned, nobody is responsible for me, so I'm responsible for myself; it's my task to find work. But despite my efforts, I can't, because there simply isn't any going around. So, after just one month, I'm already thinking about heading back out into the job market.

Question is: at what point do I begin to *really* worry, and how bad will it look if indeed I decide to bail after just 2 or 3 months?"

I just got my first internship working in a lab that is using velvet to sequence the genome of an unknown obligate parasite living in a eukaryotic cell.  I have a embarrassing question with velvet…

I'm working through a [tutorial](http://www.molecularevolution.org/resources/activities/velvetbowtie_activity) on velvet (trying to catch up before we get started), and I've been able to produce these files:  
- contigs.fa  
- Log  
- Roadmaps  
- stats.txt  
  
Dumb Question: So now what?  I would like to be able to open the velvet outputs with something like Tablet, and eventually blast some of the contigs so that i can eliminate the eukaryotic DNA, but I don't know how to uses these files.
  
  I know I need to learn a lot and this is why I'm asking all of you for some hints.

1ejaa0,1,2013-05-17,Seeking some career advice.,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ejaa0/seeking_some_career_advice/,"Hi r/engineering, first some background: I left my previous job in another country in December to move to the U.S. and I received my Green Card a month ago so I have only been applying to jobs for a month. I graduated in May 2011 with a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from a top university in the US and have a lot of experience with UAVs, more specifically doing design work and some flight testing. I have two summer internships and 1.5 years of full time experience.


I am looking for some general career advice because I am currently struggling on deciding what to do with my life. 


I want to work in the Aerospace industry but right now almost all of the companies that I am interested in are either on a hiring freeze or don't seem to be hiring much. I am worried that the longer I wait the more obsolete I become and the less likely I am to get hired. I am also getting tired of not working and just staying at home waiting for companies to hopefully get back to me. 


My other good option right now is to go work at an Automotive company were I'll be making good money and be in a rotational program which could mean learning a lot of great skills. The other advantage is that I wouldn't have to move so my wife wouldn't have to leave her current job and we would have about twice the income than we would if we had to move. However, I don't know if I should pursue this option right now or wait because what I truly want to do is Aerospace. Also, working in Automotive makes me nervous in terms of job security for the long term. 


Part of me wants to just say ""screw it"" and work at the Automotive company right away so that I can continue my career and start making money but another part of me wants to wait so that I can land an awesome job working on things that I am truly passionate about.


**If you were in my position, how long do you think you would wait before pursuing the alternate option of applying for the job at the Automotive company?**


**How long do you think is too long to be unemployed and why do you think this?**


Any comments, feedback, and opinions are welcome. Thank you in advance."

I hope they are.  Even if they aren't I'm still blown away and thankful to all the people who applied to see if they were a kidney match.

[How do you plan to end your channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07374?context=5)|With a wave and a wink.  I was much more dramatic about it in the early years but I dont even know what my life is without YouTube.  I'll always be around but its just the show wont always exist.  I feel like Im in this big worldwide stupid loving and occasionally racist family.  Don't want to lose that.

I do get worried because I think they are going to push Google+ so hard they may alienate some users but lucky for them they are THE SOURCE of videos.  The only time I use anything else is when some artsy content producer uses Vimeo.  YOUTUBE is it!
[Some dirt on other YouTubers please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06vz4?context=5)|A few years ago I probably would have ripped apart a few youtubers but these days I keep out of the dramatastic YouTube and stick to the creative/businessy YouTube.

ITS HILARIOUS...for him.  Disgusting for me.  The rest of the hosts are too scared of me to prank me but thats probably because of the constant lashings they get for looking me in the eyes.

[Since you started the show it's evolved from ""The show that's not really a show but me talking to a camera for 3-4 minutes (yeah.. yeah..\)"" to a show that's now usually at least double that length.

Linz and I are great.  You get comfortable in a relationship where you just trust the other person.  Not that ignorant/lazy trust but that we respect each other and would never do anything to hurt the other trust.  It takes time and arguing but once you get it its so great.

[How do people get hired to work at Sourcefed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca0796k?context=5)|Most start as interns who apply at Internsushi.com.  The rest are robots we manufacture in house.
[Any chance you leave Youtube and host all your content on your own website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca076ah?context=5)|Only if one day I was like I should do the worst thing I could possibly do.  Then I would totally do it.

1ei4ih,5,2013-05-17,Did I blow my second interview? Need some insight from experienced interviewers or interviewees,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ei4ih/did_i_blow_my_second_interview_need_some_insight/,"I went in for my second interview for a summer internship with a company in the telecommunications industry. From the start the manager told me to sit at a table next to her desk, and I sat in her seat apparently (there were papers in the front of the seat I sat in, which ended up being her interview questions).


My main concern in that I did not articulate my answers correctly. Here are some of the answers I am concerned about.


Tell me about yourself? I stated basically my professional strengths.She said she wanted to know more about my personal interests. I said I like recording music and have experience in logic and pro tools.


She asked for three strengths, weaknesses, and three things I wanted to get out of the internship. I gave three solid strengths, but stumbled for a third weakness and what I would get out of the internship(said wanted a experience in the telecommunications industry,wanted experience dealing with strategic/target marketing,  and experience in a professional environment)


She also asked what my friends and work colleagues would say about me. I was completely thrown off guard(did not prepare for those questions) and started with my friends would say I am a nice guy(Probably the most honest answer, but she laughed and I followed it up with I am loyal and easy to talk to). As for work colleagues I basically re-stated my strengths (hard working, motivated, come in everyday wanting to learn).


The real worrying answer I gave was to the question, you are not a marketing major, so what marketing experience do you have(communications and Poly Sci with IT Minor). I stated I am an expert in people because of my field of study, and I have some experience in direct marketing with my previous jobs. Of course with extra words thrown.


She then said many of questions were to determine if I would be a better fit in the analysis or creative side of the marketing department based on that typically people are one or the other but very rarely both. Then asked if I had any questions, which I was well prepared for.


I nailed many of the questions that I didn't mention, but I am worried I may have come off as unprofessional or immature based on the poor ones. She told me I would hear back in two weeks(starts June 1) because they were interviewing a few other people and she would be out of town, and ""wished me luck"". She also did not ask for references. Is this me being paranoid or did I really have a poor showing."

I live in central Canada. My GPA is &lt; 3 and my school is a not big-name Canadian University, but I have some summer internships (with big-name companies), a cool project, and a part-time position as a web dev under my belt. 

I am still interviewing as I would like to land a programming/soft. eng. position; I love programming. I will accept this position which starts in about a month, as the company is reputable and I need the money (30k+ student/CC debt).

I am just seeking for general advice. I would like to work as a software engineer, and I believe I have what it takes to be successful in a Soft. engineer position. Sadly, the first half of degree I did bad academically (major health anxiety for the first 2 years, depression, immaturity), but after my first internship I realized that this was what I wanted to do with my life and my passion for programming grew and still grows (I've been part of hackathons and enjoy reading about technology). I was able to raise my GPA from 2.3 to 2.85.

1ehi1t,1,2013-05-16,What's under my seeming alcohol problem?,help___throwaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ehi1t/whats_under_my_seeming_alcohol_problem/,"I think I may have a problem with alcohol and other substance abuse. It's really weird too because my life seems to be going great on the surface. I'm 20 years old, going to be a junior studying abroad in Europe next fall, and have a really good programming internship for the summer. My family is really proud of me. I had been drinking heavily each weekend at college with my friends, and it seemed pretty normal but looking back it was definitely picking up towards the end. Everyone else kind of just saw me as the typical college ""bro"" drinker guy. I still got really good grades and stuff, but I always went the hardest on the weekends.

Ever since I moved in to my own apartment for the summer, I've been getting drunk every night for about two weeks. At first it just kind of felt like I was celebrating my newfound freedom, I could drink whenever I wanted to since I have a fake ID, etc.

But at this point it seems like it could be becoming a habit, and it's really worrying me. I just come home at 5, make dinner, and then drink for the rest of the night until I go to sleep. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? What is going on? I know I might have a problem with substances - I've gone through small periods of pills (opiates, amphetamines), chewing tobacco, etc. in the past, but it just seems to be whatever I can get ahold of at the time, and it would stop whenever the supply ran out.

I feel like I'm running from something. I don't know. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I don't know what to do."
1elp9u,228,2013-05-18,Affirmations,Grakmarr,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1elp9u/affirmations/,"I became friends with Daniel, or Dan, in middle school. In the interest of full disclosure, Daniel was his middle name. His real first name, which he understandably hated, was Francis. Who the hell does that to their kid? Anyway, he had more working against him than just an unfortunate name. He was 5'5, 130 pounds soaking wet, wore glasses, stuttered, and was horribly awkward. I was no prize myself, six feet tall and fat as hell, man tits, second only to Dan in awkwardness. We had our share of common interests, but what really brought these two thirteen year old boys together was the realization that without each other we had no one. By staying close, we mitigated the amount of hell that could be directed toward either one of us individually. Instead of everyone ragging on me for being a landwhale or him for being a nerd, we split the attention between us. It was a mutually beneficial friendship, which lasted until shortly after we reached high school.

Before my freshman year, I joined the football team and started lifting weights. I was tired of the teasing, and willing to do whatever it took to be treated decently for a change. The end result was nothing miraculous, but between my subtle transformation and the respect of my new friends it was enough to keep me from being the target of mockery - some of the former bullies even seemed to want to make amends. My new life was going well for me, I just wish I could say the same was true for Dan.

Whereas I made changes to better my circumstances, everything seemed to be going downhill for him. He grew taller, which only made his already slim frame seem gaunt and sickly. His eyesight took a turn for the worse, and soon he was wearing thick rimmed glasses. His personal hygiene became somewhat... objectionable. I tried to remain casual friends with him out of respect for the help we had given each other over the years, but Dan became sullen and distant. Every once in a while he would call to congratulate me after our team won a game, and we would talk for a few minutes. But by and large, even perfunctory gestures like that were rare.


After high school, as it is wont to do, life happened. To wit: I got a shitty retail job, a shitty girlfriend, a shitty security job, an amazing girlfriend (fiancee, now), and a less shitty security job. I forgot all about the past, about school, about Daniel. Until a couple months ago.


I had been home from work for maybe an hour when my phone rang with a number I didn't recognize. Most folks would probably let something like that go to voicemail, but curiosity has always been a weakness of mine. When I answered, I was greeted by a confident baritone voice.


""[Grakmarr's real name]?""


I started to confirm, then asked to whom I was speaking. I don't owe money all over town or anything, but I'm reasonably sure there's a collection agency out there with my file buried in a stack somewhere.


The man on the line chuckled and answered, ""It's me, Daniel. From school.""


I replied cordially, and made all the typical long-time-no-talk greetings, but internally all I could do was wonder when that squeaky stutter of his turned into the used car salesman patter I was hearing on the line.


""I called because I was just thinking about old times,"" he continued, ""and how much of an ass I was to drift away from you like I did. I guess I was jealous that you found your place, while I was still struggling. I heard you're still in town. I was hoping we could grab some lunch and catch up. My treat.""


""Sure,"" I replied, ""Sounds great."" It didn't sound great at all; frankly I was happy to put those days behind me years ago - but again, curiosity. I had to know. We made the arrangements, and ended the call.


The next day I went to meet him for lunch at a local barbecue joint (there's one thing about the American southeast, you're never out of walking distance from a church or a pork sandwich) and started scanning the crowd for someone who looked like a decade-older version of my old friend, when a handsome stranger in a three-piece suit waved me over. As I walked toward him, the realization hit me.


""Holy shit... Daniel?""


He grinned, flashing perfectly white teeth. I made a mental note to smile with my mouth shut to hide the lifetime of nicotine and sugar damage, and plopped down in the seat across the table from him.


""Hey man,"" he said, ""You haven't changed a bit.""


I thought I caught a whiff of derision in the comment, but was willing to let it slide even if it wasn't my imagination. I *am* just an older version of what I was back then, and I was mistakenly expecting the same from him. Instead I got a young Johnny Depp in a cleaned and pressed suit that appeared to cost more than I make in a month. It's not that I expected someone nearing thirty to still have acne or anything, it's just that the characteristics by which I (and everyone else, I suppose) defined him had undergone such a radical transformation that he was wholly unrecognizable. Thick black-rimmed glasses had presumably been abandoned for contacts, lanky build now lithely coated with muscle evident even through the suit, and his quavering stutter a distant memory. It was my turn to stutter, now.


""So uh..."" I squinted, ""Wh-what's new?"" We shared the laugh of two people preparing to address the metaphorical elephant in the room. He told me everything; and enthralled, I let him go on at length. Evidently after high school he went on to earn his MBA, and became the VP of Global Sourcing (whatever that is) for a major local business. He was on the Board of Directors for a non-profit, and co-founded a scholarship program for gifted youths. When he was finally done catching me up on all of his numerous accomplishments, I asked the one question left unanswered: How?


""When I went away to college,"" he said through sips of his unsweetened tea, ""I learned about something called 'affirmations'. Basically you decide on a specific goal you want for yourself, and put it in writing multiple times throughout the course of the day."" He tapped a leather-bound notepad jutting just slightly out of his pants pocket while he spoke, ""You keep doing this every day until you've achieved your goal. It focuses your will, and doesn't let you lose sight of your objective until you've accomplished what you set out to do.""


I nodded, ""I've heard of that before, I've just never tried it. So it really worked for you?""


He grinned wider, ""It did. I think you have to really want it to, though. The more earnestly you do it, the more likely you are to succeed. Personally, it saved me. I was skeptical, it sounded really silly at first. Once I saw that it was working, I began to take it more seriously. What about you, anything new in your life?""


I told him about my boring job, and he listened politely. But when I started talking about my fiancee, his eyes lit up, and he seemed to be paying genuine attention.


""She sounds wonderful,"" he said, ""I'd love to meet her sometime.""


Now this woman is truly amazing, but she's the exact opposite of me in one regard: She is a complete social butterfly. She doesn't nag me about anything, except when it comes to my total lack of friends. And to my surprise, Daniel had turned out to be a seemingly awesome guy, so I excused myself from the table to see if she would be okay with having him over for dinner. She seemed delighted at the prospect, if a bit surprised, so I went back and made the offer to Dan.


""That would be excellent,"" he said, ""I'm looking forward to meeting the woman who could make your life so complete.""


Dan paid our bill and shook hands to part ways for the time being. As he extended his to mine, I couldn't help but notice the maze of shallow cuts along his palms and fingertips - but immediately shrugged it off. I tried to brace myself from drunkenly falling onto asphalt one time and ended up with something similar, so I know these things happen. But when he caught me studying his hands, he averted his gaze for the first time during our entire conversation, and quickly excused himself. Strange as that final exchange was, it was a pleasant nugget of schadenfreude to know that some of the old quirky kid was still left in him. We can never entirely outrun our past, after all.


I helped my fiancee with dinner as best I could, largely by staying out of her way, and got our little apartment ready for my old friend. Dan showed up right on time, clean-shaven and dressed almost as nicely as he was for lunch, and made the traditional platitudes about our humble home. I had no sooner mentioned my fiancee's whereabouts in the kitchen, when he made his way past me in a hurry to introduce himself. The two of them exchanged pleasantries, and we sat to eat.


We shared good food and good conversation, with no sign of the oddness Dan showed when we parted earlier, save for his occassional nervous petting of that same notebook  when my fiancee and I were addressing each other. I was beginning to wonder why he felt the need to bring it with him, but I supposed that's just what you do when you take a compulsion so seriously.


After dinner, my fiancee had slipped off for the night, and Daniel and I saw ourselves to the other room to have a chat and a few drinks. My hand tends to tip the whiskey bottle a bit heavier than the soda, so before long we were both more than a little inebriated. For me, this was any given Tuesday; but Dan seemed a bit less acclimated to the ways of the bottle, not to mention the six inches and god-knows-how-many-pound advantage I had on him. By the time the ice was melting on his third glass, he was stuttering like good ol' thirteen year old Francis again, and his conversation turned a little emotional. He started talking about his myriad failed attempts at romance. This was an unintended development on my part, but again: Schadenfreude. I'm not a perfect man, by any means.


""Remember the affirmations?"" He cocked his head toward me, green eyes squinted knowingly, left hand stroking his notebook, ""They do work. Just not for other people.""


""What do you mean,"" I asked, ""Other people can't use them to better themselves?""


He laughed bitterly and shook his head, ""No, anyone can do that. They don't work when you try to change other people.""


I furrowed my brow, figuring my old friend had imbibed far too much alcohol and was now intrepidly exploring gibberish territory, ""Well of course not. You can't just will someone to be different. People are who they are, there's no changing that.""


Dan jerked his head toward me, glaring, ""Everyone can change. Everyone *needs* to change. *You* changed. Someone *loves* you, now.""


There was venom punctuating his words, and little flecks of spittle as well. I really hate angry drunks, but he was my guest, so I tried my best to comfort him. ""Dan... I had to work at that too, buddy. That's not the kind of shit you just write down in some notebook and wait for it to happen. It takes patience, and an open heart. And yeah, sometimes you have to go through the wrong ones before you find the right one. I've ended up wounded plenty of times, but love is worth bleeding a little.""


He jerked up out of his chair at that, swaying back and forth slightly, stared me dead in the eyes and said, ""I've bled plenty. All I want is what you have, right here in your home. And I can't fucking make it happen.""


My mouth was trying to form words, but Dan was already headed toward my bathroom door. After it slammed shut behind him, I just sat in my chair staring at the floor. Poor guy really seemed to have issues, and I started feeling terrible for reveling in what faults of his remained.


When I finally looked up, I noticed that the notebook must have fallen from his pocket when he rose so suddenly. Curiosity engaged in a brief struggle with respect for the privacy of others, but ultimately won a decisive victory. I leaned out and snatched it up, and began to slowly leaf through the pages.


It started out much as I expected. The first dozen pages were neatly scripted in blue or black pen, repeating the same sort of sentences over and over again.


&gt;*I will pass my final exams. I will pass my final exams. I will pass my final exams.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will graduate college. I will graduate college. I will graduate college.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will stop stuttering. I will stop stuttering. I will stop stuttering.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will win this internship. I will win this internship. I will win this internship.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will be more confident. I will be more confident. I will be more confident.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will be hired as an employee. I will be hired as an employee. I will be hired as an employee.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will get my body into shape. I will get my body into shape. I will get my body into shape.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will get this promotion. I will get this promotion. I will get this promotion.*


After some more of this sort, the writing became a bit shaky. The letters grew jagged and seemingly rushed, and the margins of the paper were increasingly ignored.


&gt;*Kristen will say yes to a date. Kristen will say yes to a date. Kristen will say yes to a date.*


At this point I thought he had started using watercolors, the letters were thick and streaked with dark fingerprints.


&gt;*Rachael will go on a date with me. Rachael will go on a date with me. Rachael will go on a date with me.*
&gt;
&gt;*Elizabeth will fall in love with me. Elizabeth will fall in love with me. Elizabeth will fall in love with me.*


As I finally reached the last page with writing on it, I felt the contents of my stomach go into a spin cycle. The crimson characters hadn't had time to dry and darken like the ones on previous pages, and they streaked as my fingers brushed across them.


&gt;*I will have what HE has. I will have what HE has. I will have what HE has.*


I sat there, stunned, and became acutely aware of the bathroom and the occupant therein. I stood slowly, crept toward the threshold, and pressed my ear against the door. Silence.


""Dan?"" I whispered, ""You okay in there, buddy?"" Nothing.


I tried the knob, surprised to feel it turn in my hand. The door met resistance after opening less than a foot, and I hesitantly stuck my head in through the gap and looked around. Daniel lay there blocking the door, face down in a widening pool of his own blood, his hand extended toward the wall beside him. Choking back the pork tenderloin and whiskey threatening to make an oral exodus, I looked up to the wall - and read Daniel's final affirmation.


There was an investigation, of course. Dan was a very important man in the community, and I'm... not. But the suicide was about as cut and dry as they come; he even left a note, of sorts, on my wall. And the questions really died down after they examined his book. As far as the authorities and the media are concerned, the whole scandal is over. I wish I could say the same for me.


Often I'll dream about what I saw in the bathroom, and wake in the middle of the night. Sometimes when I have that dream, I'll try to sit up without waking my fiancee. When I do that, I swear I can see a scrawny little boy in glasses sneering at me from the corner of our bedroom; and I remember Daniel's final affirmation scrawled on that bloody wall.

&gt;*I will not leave.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will not leave.*
&gt;
&gt;*I will not*"

I have really wanted to continue work as a software dev, but my first love is system administration.  

What is the likelihood to test both careers?  I will more than likely be offered a job at the end of the summer because of my past work experience and because the other interns have no past work related experience.  I wouldn't mind the job, but I've heard that software devs, getter better pay and better advancement over time.  Is this true?  Will my degree be able to get me into upper management in 10 years, or do I need to keep looking for a software company to work for?  Also, in 15 years where do you see the market going in terms of computer people needed?

EDIT:  I also have 3 years of tech school experience and 2 years of college finished, and am well versed in Comptia A+ and Net+ concepts

However due to family health issues I don't know if I want to live that far from my home and family if something happens to them (I live in LA).

Anyways because of that I would like to work as close as possible to LA, but I don't want to throw away a great possible offer from MS if I can't find anything closer to home. 

So first of all is it even reasonable to think ill be able to get an offer from a company like google, FB, twitter, in the bay or LA area? I've had good internships but I'm from a mediocre state school with a mediocre GPA. Are there any networking events in LA where I could possibly make connections with googler's in the LA area?

Second if I start applying to companies closer to home when should I start? My internship ends in September. "
1ekvw8,0,2013-05-18,My degree pooped the bed and I want to pursue a masters while I work... what to do for a better job chance?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ekvw8/my_degree_pooped_the_bed_and_i_want_to_pursue_a/,"I graduated in December with a BA in Political Science. I had  a high GPA, glowing internship, 10 years of management experience, and numerous volunteer work experiences. This meant exactly squat in the job market. I was lucky to land a job with an investing firm totally outside my desired field that paid decent 18/hr. However, the job is caustic and the environment is unethical at best. I started April 1st and they seem to love me there, but the job and the 100-mile daily commute is killing me. I just can't work there or even in that industry forever. 

Seemingly, despite my love of political science, the degree itself has shit the bed. It applies to very little and employers take it with a grain of salt at best. If I want to truly utilize it the only sure bet seems to be a move to DC. That isn't going to happen. 

I want to get a masters.  A few fellow graduates in my major have been themselves eyeing an MBA. I just don't know that an MBA will anyone  that much. I know that anything will help more than my current incontinent degree, but I have been leaning towards a master In Computer Information Systems with a focus on computer science. I would take it at a local state college. 

My question is will this degree make me more employable in a fashion that will allow me some more choices in employment. The last time I applied for roughly 300+ jobs and had exactly one offer in something that I didn't really want but had no alternative.  

I just want to make myself more employable so I can move out of this shifty high-pressure investment field. 


Any help you can give me in diapering my wayward BA would certainly help me to recover from the shitty situation I find myself in currently.

1ek6b6,18,2013-05-17,Two jobs?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ek6b6/two_jobs/,"I started at a minimum wage food service job about a month ago. I'm currently only part-time, but it's money.

Before I applied for that job, I applied for a (paid) internship that's also part-time. After I started working at job 1, I interviewed for that internship, and found out a few days ago that I got it. 

I need both to help with bills, but I have no idea how to ask my current manager to rearrange my schedule for a second job, especially since flexibility has been really important to me working there.

I'm supposed to start the internship Wednesday and work out my schedule then, so I can't tell my manager exactly what hours I need to work. I know it's just a shitty minimum wage job, but I really love the environment and my manager is fucking fantastic, but I don't want to miss out on an actually great opportunity.

And I don't actually know if any of this is a big deal, but if anyone has advice on talking to my current manager and new manager without getting fired, I'd really appreciate the input!"
1ek68c,1,2013-05-17,"I work in the film industry. I see people advertising all the time for unpaid ""interns"" to do GE/Electrical work. How legal is this?",OceansOnPluto,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ek68c/i_work_in_the_film_industry_i_see_people/,"So, basically, I'm a production Assistant. I get coffee, drive pass vans, and pack up gear on reality shows (and any other miscelaneous things). On the film job boards, I see (ALL THE TIME) people advertising for PAs for free. It's usually labeled as ""Intern"" but the gist of it is you'll show up to this short film/radio event/tv show. Here's an example of an ad. 

""Exciting New Reality Show Seeks Talented Crew! (West Village)

An exciting new Reality Show, whose theme is a music producer competition, seeks a talented crew for an upcoming live taping at the legendary S.O.B.'s on Wednesday, 5/22/2013. This is a multi-camera shoot and the crew call time is at 4pm. There will also be a required, but brief, pre-production/crew meeting at S.O.B.'s on Saturday, 5/19/2013.

Production Assistant @ meal, copy and credit""

Even though I know hard it is to get gigs when you're just starting out, I have to wonder, how legal is this? In one of the comments, the guy mentioned it was for Hot 97, the music station....and if they're putting on an entire reality show, I would imagine they have some funding somewhere...

I use that example, but there are plenty of them, and lately I've been wondering how legal it is for a company to advertise for these types of things. 

I've also seen ads advertising for G&amp;E worker ""Interns"". These positions tend to be highly specialized, and usually command about 300-400 a day (It varies depending on what type of shoot you're on, but that's what I've heard GE guys I know talking about). The example below is a feature film which clearly has SOME people paid to do their jobs, but is advertising for more unpaid labor. 

""Seeking Grip interns for ULB Feature! I realize this position is unpaid, but will get you in the door for Grip &amp; Electric! Dates are 5/23, 5/28, 5/29 and 6/5. Please send resumes to kerry@**********.com

-And then below in the comments she wrote the following.

I have received several resumes from individuals that have G&amp;E experience, but not quite enough to be hired yet. It is important that these individuals have basic knowledge of G&amp;E so that they do not create more work for the dept. in the end. Get it?""

Again I don't know this whole situation, but this is what really set me off to wondering: From the ad and the comments, this seems like a FEATURE film, with SOME people getting paid, and even though they don't neccesarily have the budget for the massive crew they want, they're advertising for people with experience to work for free. But she says clearly there is a department, and you can't run a feature film with a full GE crew on nothing. 

And again, if it was a short film or a passion project where everyone was working for free, I would get it. But these don't seem to be the case. 

Lest you think it's just these two scenarios, I see this ALL THE TIME. People  on corporate jobs advertise for interns to do regular PA, AC, Camera, and Electrical work (I can't tell you how many people respond because I tend not to respond to those ads). 

I had thought I read somewhere that 1) Interns can provide no immediate benefit to the company hiring them, and 2) They must either be paid or given college credit.

That is really not the case with most of these shoots. I didn't think there was anything wrong with it until a friend gave the explanation that if someone wanted a job at a bank, it would be illegal for the bank to have them work as a teller for free for three months just to ""gain experience"". 

So basically....am I completely wrong and just don't know anything about labor law? If you have a company, need a worker, and just don't want to pay them, how legal is it to just call them an intern and not pay them?

TL;DR: Basically, can feature films and corporate jobs hire unpaid, off the books interns as free labor? In positions where they NEED a professional but don't have the money? And is that illegal?
----------------------

Edit: clarification on the TLDR."
1ejvyz,4,2013-05-17,Resume advice for a Freshman,julius559,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ejvyz/resume_advice_for_a_freshman/,"I want to put together a resume of my knowledge of programming so far so I can start applying to internships or just be able to have one when someone asks me for it so they can check it out (being that this person might want to help me find an internship). And I was wondering how I go about that with just having one year experience?

I understand to do my own projects and put it online, but what I have done in class and what small little programs I make on my own aren't exactly comparing to the elaborate programs you look at on github or bitbucket.

And I have no work experience with programming, so would that just lead to a half empty page with the top section listing my school, GPA, and known languages, and my ""github"" link?

I know some of you must be in the same position now or have been in it and I am just asking for some direction. I do feel worthless, but I want to have some experience during college so my resume can actually look like a proper resume when I graduate.

Thanks for your time, you guys have helped me with so many other questions, and I appreciate the hospitality and helpfulness of this subreddit.

Edit: So here is what I have come up with. I don't find it impressive at all.

[How many people have lost their shit in the tank? (freaked out, not crapped their pants\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t3us?context=5)|In terms of people losing their shit, it doesn't really happen. It seems like a crazy idea at first, but if feels really familiar once you're in there. It also puts your body into a super relaxed place, so it's a really hard environment to lose your shit in.  You can see crazy visuals and hallucinations in the float tank, but there's no point where you feel like you're not in control, so it differs from a drug trip in that way.  People are really forgetful after they float though, so our lost and found is pretty impressive :)
[How critical of a role has sensory deprivation tank technology played in keeping Portland, OR stuck in 1993?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tfaw?context=5)|Don't tell anyone, but float tanks are basically the flux capacitor in this equation.
[Maybe an odd question, but how do restless people or people with ADHD react?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w6m9?context=5)|They are actually some of our happiest customers. A lot of those people have trouble quieting down that voice inside of their heads, and letting their body relax, and the float tank is amazing at helping you do that.
[How profitable is your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|The business has been profitable from day one, pretty much.  We started with very little but it has been doing well.
[Have you thought about opening centers in other cities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|There are about 100 centers in the US, so not enough. There should be at least one in every town.  The number is rapidly growing: attendance at the last 3 [float conferences](http://floatconference.com/) has doubled each year.
[How often do people pee in the tanks, and how would you know if they did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|No one has peed in our tanks.  It would be hard to do.  We check the tanks after each person.  If they did, it would mean we would have to reschedule on a bunch of people and cost us a lot.
[Are there any long-term health effects (positive or negative\) to spending several hours a week floating in saltwater?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|Epsom salts have many medicinal properties.  The effects of regular deep relaxation are very positive for a number of health issues.  Right now we are working on a [fibromyalgia project](http://fibromyalgiaflotationproject.com/) because floating is insanely good for people with fibromyalgia.
[Not to dwell on this, but how would it be hard for someone to pee in a tank?  Seems like floating in water + extreme relaxation + privacy = primo time for bladder releasing.  Granted one would then be soaking in their own urine which could be enough of a deterrent...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wcdw?context=5)|You are both very relaxed and very aware of your body.  It is hard for me to picture a situation where I could pee in the tank without noticing.  I have certainly felt the need to pee.  We have robes so folks can just go.  I bet with the amount of floats we run something will happen someday but knock on wood it doesn't.
[I can't tell if the pee thing is a joke. Nobody gets so relaxed that they just let it out? Wouldn't the salt/filters clean it out just like anything else in the water? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wd6g?context=5)|It hasn't happened yet. I would be concerned about the smell.  You would have to will yourself to do it.
[I'm really excited about this AMA.  About answer 3: How much capital do you need to open a center in, say, California? Wine country + college town + float center = good idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1lq9v?context=5)|You should definitely check out [floattanksolutions.com](http://www.floattanksolutions.com/). It's our website for answering people's questions about opening a float tank center. Feel free to give us a call as well. We're always happy to chat and help out.
[What about MS? As an MSer who refuses to use the current crop of toxic MS drugs, I'd like to know what effects Fibro patients are seeing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u111?context=5)|I'm not aware of any clinical studies about people with MS floating, but anecdotally, I've heard a lot about considerable pain relief from MS using float tanks.
 |The small pilot study that went on with Fibro showed pain relief from the beginning to the end of a float, and between floats. We're hoping to get some larger data with the new Fibro project that is going on internationally.
[Upvote for science!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yave?context=5)|We're all about the science. We're all natural skeptics here at Float On, so we had to do our due diligence before accepting that these things weren't new age mumbo jumbo.
 |The nice thing is, these things have been around since the mid 50's, and spent their first 20 years exclusively in laboratories, so it was easy to find a lot of hard information on why float tanks are amazing.
[Oh heck yeah man! Where do I sign up!  &lt;--- Rhetorical question, I know I can bump over to your website and sign up, or roll in.  Alas, though, I am not in PDX.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yrem?context=5)|There are lots of places to float around the world (relatively speaking). You might be surprised. Check out [floatationlocations.com](http://floatationlocations.com/), or just google the name of your city and ""float tank.""
[The fact that you want to see more flotation places, as you mentioned that you want to see one in every town, is frikkin awesome.  It shows that you are not a greedy corporate suit.  Upvote to you my good man. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z5lt?context=5)|Thank you, sir. We're all about sharing knowledge and bringing floating to the people.
 |There's a whole section of our [float conference](http://floatconference.com/float-center-workshop/) specifically set up to help people get float centers up and running.
 |In fact, the whole float industry seems to be unusual in this way. Everyone is extremely cooperative and open with information. I guess floating helps you get a bit of perspective :)
[Is it allowed to go into the thant under the influence of drugs? If no, how do you make sure it doesn't happen? Are there any stories about people on drugs in the thanks? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tn1y?context=5)|I assume that you're under the influence right now, in which case let me ask: can people in the outside world tell? If you walked into a float center right now, would we be aware of your altered state?
 |If you behave yourself well enough that we can't tell, how would we know?
 |If you want some crazy tank + drug stories, look up Joe Rogan talking about tanks on youtube!
[I assume you've floated in these yourselves? What did you experience when floating in the tank? It seems like it would be really relaxing, but do you experience other things? Does your imagination kick in and trip you out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t7of?context=5)|We love floating.  It's why we do what we do. So, yes, we have definitely floated in many different styles of tanks in several different countries.
 |It's super relaxing.  You lie in a dense solution of magnesium sulfate.  Your spine relaxes like an accordion.  Your joints decompress.
 |With no light, no sound, and no touch... your brain waves begin to slow down.  You rest in the theta state which has been known to help with creative release.  Some even experience visuals (not everyone, though).
[What tips can you provide for excellent facial hair maintenance? You obviously derive your power from your beards, and I wish to know your secrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u9sd?context=5)|You've just asked the right question. It really is the secret to our success. A few of us even competed in the World Beard and Mustache Championships (when it was in Norway).
 |Not to encourage juicing, but pre-natal vitamins really promote hair growth.
[If William Hurt came in for a float, would you let him? If so, would you schedule him as the last client of the day, and/or make him pay a large up-front deposit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ui2o?context=5)|We would just stock the float room with lots of goats and lock the door.
[Why are your float times so long? Do people really like to go for that long at a time? I feel like an hour would do me, then again, I haven't floated(yet\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0uek7?context=5)|Lots of places run hour long floats, but we really don't think it's long enough.  We get a lot of people surprised by an hour and a half, and then come out to tell us that it felt like 30-40 minutes. We also get a lot of requests for longer floats. Time really does fly by in there, and the longer you're in the better it feels :)
[Thank you so much for the answer! I'd love to stop by sometime, but unfortunately I'm on the other side of the country.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ul39?context=5)|Hey there might be a place nearby.  Where are you located?
[Up in Northern Vermont. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z3fk?context=5)|You might try giving [this place](http://floatationlocations.com/united-states/vermont/floating-on-brook/) a call. I'm not sure if they still exist anymore, though.
[Thank you. I'll definitely give it a try. Damn, you guys are awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0zb66?context=5)|It's all the floating. We can't help it.
[I read about a discussion wether or not a integrated display inside a isolation tank might be useful at learning specific things like languages and other disciplines. In theory, deprivation of all external stimuli should aid your ability to focus. Do you think this would actually be beneficial or that other effects of isolation tanks like intense body sensations and perceptual distortions (some experience hallucinations\) might be to much of a distraction to improve cognitive learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ukfk?context=5)|The most research on the first part of your question was done by the Dallas Cowboys in the 80s.  Players floated and watched videos of their performance.  According to the team, it helped immensely.  We had one person use our tanks to tune his musical ear, listing to specific notes while floating.
[How is the water in the isolation tank cleaned? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ukfk?context=5)|The water is cleaned after each person with a cartridge filter.  Our pumps are powerful enough that the entire water in the tank goes through this filter system 3-4 times before anyone else gets in.  We also clean the water with hydrogen peroxide.  The fact that the water is so extremely salty does wonders to keep it clean.
[That's fascinating. I'm really pumped to use a tank for the first time soon.   *Most of our cleaning is dealing with the salt getting everywhere.*  I have a petty question about that. I do a lot of kickboxing and I play soccer regularly. On top of that I own a very strange cat. How worried should I be about getting in the tank with (little\) open wounds?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0uwxk?context=5)|If you are kick boxing your pain tolerance should be good enough to deal with a bit of salt stinging.  With that said we provide Vaseline to cover cuts, and the salt really helps heal said cuts up really fast if you man or woman up, hop in without covering the cuts up and let the salt do some work.
[*According to the team, it helped immensely.*  There's nothing like a good science experiment.  And that's nothing like a good science experiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca11po1?context=5)|Look up studies on REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy). That is the name that a lot of clinical studies on float tanks have been done. None of the studies had super large samples sizes, but they're still really interesting to look at.
[Anyone fall asleep in the tank? how do you keep them from drowning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wrwd?context=5)|The difference between sleep and deep meditation can be a fine line.  It is very difficult to submerge oneself because of the salt.  Also as soon as you get any near your eye, nose or mouth, you will be very aware and need to get out of the tank.
[What's the longest float you know of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vap2?context=5)|We have had someone come in and float 24 hours straight, and there are rumors that John Lilly did a 2 week float using an IV way back in the day, but for sure a 24 hour float has happened at Float On.  The Float Tank was first created in 1954 and the first commercial tank was released in the early 70's.
[How do you regulate the temperature in the water/pod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vap2?context=5)|Different tanks use different methods, but the most common method is a set of water bed heaters under the liner.
[How did they feel after 24 hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vlij?context=5)|He said time was very silky, and had used the time to recover from a very long walk, which worked quite well.  Words and language take a bit of a backseat after that long in a tank, so not so sadly he was not a sound byte machine when emerging from a day in the tank.
[Are they impractical to have personal tanks at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vlij?context=5)|You need to be really committed to have a tank in your house, for a few reasons.  Cost, space, how close to a shower you can get it, salt is going to destroy things, and you need to float a lot before you are going to save money over visiting a center and letting them deal with the rest of it.
[One more question. Excluding rent since that varies, how much would you advise a new float business to have on hand before attempting to open a float center? Say in a popular but underserved city. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w2f7?context=5)|That is going to depend hugely on how many people are on your payroll and how many tanks you want to have.  We shoestringed and bootstrapped to make this one happen.
[Where can I find cool shades to coordinate with my outfits, Float On guys? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tf37?context=5)|At our shop!  Come to Portland! 
[Is there a prize system? Like, save five shades and trade them for a mustache ride? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0th76?context=5)|You can definitely earn a mustache ride, but it involves a very hairy punch card.
[Have you read The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown?  Did the bit about the bad guy spending time in the sensory deprivation tank bug you as much as it did me?  Do you think Dan Brown is perhaps America's worst author?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u49b?context=5)|Yes, yes, and yes.
[How does the experience relate to a DMT trip? Is there any ""mind fuck"" ?  I feel like going in a flotation tank would be claustrophobic and kind of scary. Is it as scary as it sounds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0v52k?context=5)|The tank is only as scary as the voice inside your head... So for me not so scary, for you...who knows.  In all honesty though claustrophobia is typically more about control than it is about space, and you are in total control of the whole thing.
[So can you open it up whenever you want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1gbc2?context=5)|Absolutely.  No locks or no latches on the tanks.  You are in complete control.  Of course, there is a client controlled lock on the main door to the float room... we want clients to feel comfortable (being naked and what not).
 |That's right. You just push the door and it opens. No locks or latches.
[How much does it cost to build and maintain a single tank? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0udj6?context=5)|It will probably cost you somewhere in the 2k-5k range to build your own float tank (with a decent amount of planning and handiwork).
 |The salt you'll need to fill it for the first time will be about $500. After that, they don't cost a lot to maintain. If it's just you and a couple other people floating, all you really need is about 50 pounds of salt a month, a few pool chemicals, and a tiny bit of electricity cost from running the heaters and the pump.
[As someone who wants to have his own float tank one day, which route/option would you suggest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x13p?context=5)|Have you floated before?  I would start there, if you haven't.
[How feasible do you think it is to build on my own? I'd definitely consider it due to the cost but my biggest concern would be about making sure that the quality is up to par. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xhuz?context=5)|You are basically making a box with a heating element.  Everything beyond that is up to you.  The cheapest tanks are usually wood with a pond liner and some water bed heaters.  Fiberglass is another common option.
[Has anyone requested music? Sure, this defeats one element of its purposes, but having something made for a meditative state like Filosofem piped in during a float sounds awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u7q6?context=5)|People can bring music in if they like.  We strongly suggest that people try a float in silence first, just to get a sense of it.  
[How does that work?  Can you bring an ipod and have it plugged in?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca176l5?context=5)|Exactamundo.
[Has anybody ever pooped in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tkyp?context=5)|Nope!  Thank goodness!  We check the tanks after each person.  Also a filtration system cleans the water after each person.
[What would you do if somebody did poop in it?   How would you decide who gets the privilege of cleaning it up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca19fah?context=5)|I was going to say that sounds like an intern task but I would actually make the owners do cowboy-ninja-bear to determine that one.  I'd imagine that the cleanup would depend on the nature of the feces.  We would probably have to throw out all the precious precious water.  :(
 |The water is filtered after each person so if they don't wash their butt enough your tank is still clean.
[How do you feel about people wanting to experience different types of drugs in your facility?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tgsr?context=5)|Wanting to do drugs is absolutely fine! Unfortunately, federal law frowns on actually doing them, and we have to take the same stance...
 |Legal drugs, like marijuana (with a medical card in Oregon) can be great for relaxing into the float, but a lot of people, after trying it, actually prefer doing the tank a la carte.
[Could you actually replace your bed with one of these tanks?  I guess it would help you a lot, but... will it be safe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xpnp?context=5)|There is one person I know of that did this for an extend period of time, but she was already quite experienced with the tank, and living a crazy exhausting life style, I think it is possible, but not for too many people.  
[What are possible drawbacks you're thinking of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ygoi?context=5)|Since the float tank promotes such a meditative state, it can be hard to actually slip into REM, which of course your body needs.
 |If you float every night for long periods of time, eventually your body will be able to easily slip into REM in there.
 |I've heard of one woman who slept in her tank every night, and then had trouble sleeping when she traveled because no bed was as comfortable as being in a float tank.
[What are your thoughts on the use of the sensory deprivation chamber on Fringe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yabi?context=5)|I've only seen a youtube clip, but it's a lot less spooky than that. For one thing, we don't lock you in.
[You guys need to get an Olympic sized float tank.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0y2jl?context=5)|Do I hear a kickstarter in the making?
[What do you think of the Simpsons episode where homer went in one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yodi?context=5)|Fantastic! I remember watching that episode before ever knowing about float tanks, so I guess even in my own life, the Simpsons did it first.
 |They're a lot bigger than pictured in that episode, and we only put 1/4 of our customers on the back of moving trucks.
[I have to ask - how often do people have sex in these tubs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tiig?context=5)|That would be a salty and chaffing experience.  We only run solo floats.
[Is there such a thing as double (or group\) float?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tpzg?context=5)|We don't do those at our center.  They do exist.  It's different than floating by yourself.  I find it a little distracting but to each their own!
[I want to start a float tank business in my town. It's a town of 300,000. Can I ask you questions in private? I have no idea what I'm doing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wwcz?context=5)|Feel free to PM us.

[How do people react when their float ends and they are ""woken up""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yrdi?context=5)|Most people are really surprised that an hour and a half actually went by. Pretty much everyone feels super relaxed, and would hop right back in if we let them :)
[Oh, well. No one saying stuff like ""I was relaxing; you woke me up. *I hate you!*""? :D.  How do you wake people up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ywyn?context=5)|We fade music into the tank. Each tank has transducer speakers that are below the water line, so it's actually a pretty neat experience to have sensory stimulation eased in like that after suck a long time without.
[How sound absorbent are the tanks compared to anechoic chambers ? I remember reading that most people couldn't bear to be in them for more than a few minutes and would think that with the deprivation of the other senses it should be even more uncomfortable. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wzjj?context=5)|The tanks are no -7 decibels but they are very quiet, a lot of the sound reduction comes from how you build the room, and we also have our tanks on sound isolators that keep the vibrations that come from the floor out.
[What are the age limits in the tanks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w8sv?context=5)|There really are no age limits.
 |When it comes down to it, you're just floating in water and Epsom Salt.
[Yeah, i live up in Vancouver and I've heard a bunch about these tanks but I wasnt sure how old you need to be. Whats the youngest person thats floated at your location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wg2r?context=5)|At least 8 but I think his mom was in the room with him.  A 12 year old was floating on a semi regular basis a while back.
[I have OCD related to being dosed with LSD...absurd I know. Would the experience in the tank be something I could handle?  Ie no wild psychedelic experiences?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xg15?context=5)|You might have an experience but it is more mild than wild.  You are also very in control, being able to get in and out at your own pace and take a break any time you like.
[How intense are the visuals?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xvv7?context=5)|Anywhere from no visuals at all, too Flying across the universe, to being a crow on a lake.
[Oh man, I've always wanted to try a sensory deprivation tank. Until I went to your website I thought ""I wonder if there are any in Portland"". Well now I know!  So my question; who is your favorite lawmaker to work with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x1k0?context=5)|We have yet to deal too directly with any specific lawmaker, but I am a fan of a few specific politicians totally seperately from Float On. Elizabeth Warren, Dennis Kucinich, Ron Widen and Alan Grayson would be awesome to work with towards making opening float centers easier.
[Open one on the east coast? How much do you think that would cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xl9l?context=5)|Depends a lot on the city, Manhattan versus some suburb of Atlanta are going to be two very different beasts.  With that said what tank style you choose, whether they are new or used, and how much work you do yourself versus hiring people are also going to be huge deciding factors regardless of where you end up opening.
[Cool. I wonder if their is anything nearby NYC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0y2gt?context=5)|There are definitely a couple small places in NYC. Google that shit!
[I love the idea of sensory deprivation tanks but many of my friends think they would be too claustrophobic to even give it a try. Is claustrophobia a big concern of first time customers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0we1t?context=5)|It's something that everyone is concerned about being a problem that doesn't actually turn out to be a problem.  The main thing is knowing that you can get in and out.  Are they claustrophobic when they sit in a car or when they take a shower?
[Could someone bring goggles in and swim around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yqrj?context=5)|I routinely do laps in there as my morning exercise. With only 8 feet of length, you can get a couple thousand in before breakfast.
 |You have to be careful around the lifeguard though, he has a strict ""no splashing"" policy.
[As a supplier of sensory isolation tanks, do you know if there is still much scientific interest and activity in the consciousness experiments of Dr John C Lilly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z2cs?context=5)|Interest - I think so. Activity - not as much, it seems. Are you thinking of something specifically? John Lilly did a lot of crazy stuff...
[I'm surprised I haven't heard of you guys before this, and I live in Tigard. Do you guys not run advertisements? And I am definitely going to stop by sometime in the near future because the experience sounds sublime.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z4ne?context=5)|We don't do any paid advertising, but we run lots of fun projects that usually gets the word around. We've been on the news a couple times too :)
 |You should definitely swing by and visit us. We tend to book out a 1-2 weeks in advance, so give us a call before you come.
[How bad does the water taste with all the salt? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca13vty?context=5)|It's pretty intense.  It's magnesium sulfate (no sodium), so it doesn't really taste salty.
[Is it true if your placed in a sensory deprivation tank where you can't even hear yourself talk outside, that eventually you go crazy and want to commit suicide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yjw3?context=5)|Not that I know of, but I guess anything's possible.
 |There are some old myths about sensory deprivation and torture, but they're mostly fabricated.
 |The original studies on sensory deprivation involved people being put into dark rooms and told to lie on beds with cardboard and cotton all around them for incredibly long periods of time. It seems like most of people's anxiety and discomfort came from the laboratory settings and the fact that you're lying wrapped in cardboard for 24 hours.
 |The salt water we use nowadays is basically the most comfortable thing we've been able to come up with as humans. Once we invent anti-gravity machines, we might switch to that.
 |We now have people float for incredibly long periods of time who have amazing experiences. The record at our shop is a 24 hour float. The dude came out and said he thinks he can go for 48.
[What do they do about food/ water? Seems like you might get hungry or thirsty after a long period of time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0zm3k?context=5)|We advise people to eat 30-90 minutes before coming in, so you both don't have to listen to yourself digest, and are not getting hungry mid float.  For longer floats your body is in such a state of rest you just don't need the same amount of calories as you normally would.
[How tall and wide are the tanks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca2fa4y?context=5)|The tanks range form about 4-8 feet wide, and also 4-8 feet tall.
[Doesn't bouncing into the side of the tank cause sensation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca2fa4y?context=5)|You bounce a little at first, but if you don't push off the walls, you get centered pretty quickly, and then you're good.
[I am quite late, but do you float against the side of the tank? Doesn't it interrupt the relaxation? I want to do this so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca14oso?context=5)|You end up getting centered pretty quickly, and then not really hitting the sides.
[I've been interested in these Tanks for a while now. I know it relaxes you but is their any other long term effects at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca17nfs?context=5)|Absolutely. Basically curbing the effects of stress on your body consistently has incredible long term improvements. Look up research on REST (Restricted Environment Stimulation Therapy).
[Are there any at-home substitutes for those of us who aren't near a floatation center?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca10gax?context=5)|It can be hard to replicate at home, but basically just try to cut out as much sensory input as you can: dark room, no noise, a really comfortable bed, etc.
[How about doing a GroupOn for $10 USD for one hour, but that hour must be between 2 and 8 am? That way you can get lots of potential new customers, without antagonizing your user base.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1yjyp?context=5)|We already float people between 2 and 8 am :)
 |That's a good idea though. I like the idea of happy hour floats.
[I'll be stopping in the next time I head up to Portland. Want me to bring you guys anything from the Rogue Valley?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca16vfb?context=5)|Heck yeah!  Bring yourself in for a float.
[Really want to try this. So cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0trun?context=5)|Come on over to Portland! Best known for float tanks, beer, and strip clubs.
 |Of course, there are also many other little float centers located around the US where you can experience the sweet awesomeness that is floating.
[My wife goes to this place occassionally and finds it to be a very positive experience. She considers herself midly claustrophobic. One of the tanks is apparently more of an open room, but it is dark. She likes that a lot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tws8?context=5)|That's great! We get a lot of people worried about claustrophobia before they hop in the tank, but then almost no one who actually has a problem with it once they're in there. You can open the door to the tank at any time, so you're really in total control of everything. The pregnant ladies love to float. There's actually a certain position in there that takes all the weight of the the mother's stomach off of her body. We even had one woman say she really got to know her child for the first time in the tank...woah...
[Also, when she was deep into pregnancy and was uncomfortably huge, floating was a great relief.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tws8?context=5)| 
[I live across the street from this place.  How 'bout that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1397e?context=5)|I'm waving to you right now.

[Do you have any Naruto posters hanging up in your building?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tada?context=5)|None...yet.
[Please make an announcement when said Naruto posters are prominently displayed within the building.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tfzy?context=5)|You will know because we will change our business name to Naruto Posters On.
[Pretty much what I've heard about these is from Joe Rogan who says he smokes pot and goes in. I am completely against drugs, would there be a benefit for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1bsjw?context=5)|A lot of people associate the tanks with drugs because of Joe Rogan and John Lilly (the guy who invented the tanks).

I've had cancer and suffered with mental illness for the past 6 years, and it's really taken its toll on my grades. I don't have any extracurriculars, internships, lab experience, or anything I can add to my resume. 

I think I'll have a year and a half left in college before I finish my bachelors. I'll have a STEM degree, but the starting salary for my field (Biology) is pretty low at 35K, and most people go to grad school to become more employable, which isn't an option for me at the moment.

Please let me know what you think I should do... I really want to make a future for myself, and I'm beating myself up that I'm only just now getting serious about my life."
1enmsw,7,2013-05-19,I'm not sure if...,throwaway23446756,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1enmsw/im_not_sure_if/,"I'm 20 years old. For the last 6-7 years of my life, I can easily say that I considered suicide to be an option. An easy way out if things get too tough. As an atheist, the idea of my consciousness ceasing to exist is pretty appealing whenever I'm going through hardships in life. 

I've actually had a pretty good life so far. My parents are not too wealthy but they make a decent living... decent enough to send me abroad to US for college. My social life has never been better but it still isn't amazing. Never had a girlfriend. I always had mild-to-moderate social anxiety and still do, but I manage to be more social now. I've had girls wanting to get into a relationship but never the girls that I'm interested in or found attractive. I have a good internship waiting for me right now. I'll start in a month and live in San Francisco, making a decent amount of money.

I never had a good relationship with my father. We just can't get along. He can't get along with anyone. He can't get along with with my mother or with his sister or with his parents. My parents have a dysfunctional marriage and I've been told by both of them separately that the only reason they are together is me. I'm the only kid in the family and growing up, I would hear them fight and yell at each other every three months or so. After having some stronger fights with my dad, he told me that he will get divorced from my mom after my college education is over. He said this in the spur of the moment, no decision or anything but he says he won't support me or my mother after my graduation. This wouldn't be that easy, of course. Legal obstacles, family pressure etc. My mom also says the same thing... that she's still with my dad because he pays my tuition. He is not abusive or anything. He is just a negligent and rude asshole. Strangely enough, my mom's family is moderately wealthy too so we can afford the tuition either way but she would have to ask my grandma.

So far, not too bad, right. Well, everything is getting harder now. I'll graduate in two years and many problems recently emerged. My mom has a kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome. That's why she has been especially down and depressed lately. My dad is supportive but he's still an inconsiderate asshole. I've reason to believe that he cheated on my mom when I was younger. My mom on the other hand sincerely loves me and is a great human being. She gets angry easily and says things in the spur of the moment but I have no doubt that she has immaculate intentions all the time and I love her.

I've always been very close with my mother. As a kid, I would tell her that I loved her like every two minutes. As an anti-social kid, I spent a lot of my time at home and this brought us even closer I guess. Obviously my leaving for college was very hard on her. That's why we got a dog before I left. They get along very well and they are very dependent on each other. Two days ago, my mom had chest pains so I drove her to the hospital. As the avid smoker she is, we knew she was at risk. It's not cancer but she developed pneumothorax and had to spend the night at the hospital. I called my dad so that he comes to the hospital and spends time with her and he said he was on his way but he came in after four hours. I called him two hours in and he said he was somewhere on this way. My aunt called him and he said he was on his way but at an entirely different location, which is unacceptable. My mom had a nervous breakdown at the hospital bed because of this and stress of everything combined. They both spent the night there and I went back home. However my dad insisted on going to work the next day. We had a huge fight and I got him to spend the next day there too. He is there with her even right now. Other members of my family (grandparents, my aunt, her cousin etc) are also visiting and supporting her. She is going through a lot of pain and trying to endure it as she has some operations to drain the liquid from her lungs etc. My dad is still there, trying to be supportive but also still being an asshole even though it is to a lesser extent.

I've been taking care of our dog which I love and cherish. She misses my mom and it breaks my heart. I try to be supportive and play with her all the time but I'm not mom -- I can't do a lot of the things she can do. Today my cousin came over and he dropped one of his ""workout supplement"" pills. It is just amino acids and it shouldn't be a huge danger but it got me very worried. As a psychopharmacology-enthusiast (aka informed occasional drug abuser, will get to that later) I looked up all the amino-acids and found out that the risk profile is low. It is unlikely that she'll get any harm from it but she'll get some effects like stimulation followed by sleepiness. Even though I shouldn't be greatly worried, she took a lot for her body mass. I took her out for a run and she was very stimulated and agitated. I had to hold her back using the leash and even though I didn't hurt her or anything, it broke my heart doing that. I hate being assertive with her. It feels like I'm breaking her heart. She is so happy and full of life, smiling. It was very hard to bring her back into the house because she wasn't cooperative and this entire situation demoralized me even further. My mom will probably be in the hospital for at least 4-5 more days and I hope she gets better, and that my dog is totally fine tomorrow morning. But even the best case scenario happening, I don't see myself having an happy/ideal/comfortable future ahead of me and ceasing to exist looks like a great option. I feel lonely.

I don't know if my mental psyche has a text-book definition but I don't think I'm depressed. I'm prescribed ADHD medication and I can feel better if I decide to take them now but it doesn't feel like real happiness. It's just synthetic euphoria. I usually just use them to study or socialize. Throughout the last year, I smoked weed once daily before going to bed and it helps me immensely but I don't have access to it right now. I also experimented with psychedelics, hoping that they would make me a better person, let me discover myself, solve my inner-problems but they didn't help either. Even when high on cannabis, I still feel an emptiness inside me. I'm missing some integral part of what I want out of life. I need to change, I need to change something.

I've thought about just running away. Just getting a good amount of money, assuming a false identity and traveling across the globe... however far that money takes me. But the problem there is with that is that I'll be alive and I'll think about how sad my parents (especially mom, I don't care that much about my dad) are because I did what I did. They'll feel the same way if I kill myself but at least I won't exist to see it. I don't even know how I would kill myself. I would have to guarantee it. I would probably buy a lot of heroin, use for a long time until my tolerance is too high. Overdose and jump off of a bridge or something.

I feel empty. I feel like my future is in danger. I feel like I'll never truly be happy. If my parents stop supporting me, or if I don't have a job when I graduate, I'll have to go back to my country and I don't want to. But also not going back means my mom will miss me even more and she might need me both emotionally and physically.

I realize this is a huge wall of text but thanks for reading. For others... TL;DR: I'm thinking of ending my life.

I am a CS junior in university. I started a year and a half long full-time internship about 4 weeks ago. However, from the get go, I did not click with the company. The environment, I feel is not conducive for learning. I did not like the product, nor did I find people I could look up to or learn from. 

This isn't my first job, though it is my first CS job, so I'm not sure if the expectations I had were too high. My classmates who also took on internships have had a very different experience. My day-to-day routine is nothing related to software development, I can't help but feel that I may not learn even a small percentage of what I expected.

So here is my question - should I suck it up and stick it out? Since, any experience at this stage could be considered good experience. Or, should I look for something new?

Thank you!"

I'm about to begin my internship in two weeks and was recently e-mailed a description of requisite skills they are expecting - one of them being Java. Though I have prior programming experience (C++), I have no Java knowledge whatsoever!! So naturally, I'm freaking out a little.  

As a student, I have access to Lynda for free, would that be a good place to start? I also noticed that oracle has free documentation as well. There are so many resources available I'd like to get an opinion on a good one that will provide me with solid exposure of Java in a week and a half. I have programmed before, so I don't need to be babied too much, but I'd like to start building a good foundation in my initial exposure. 

Please learnprogramming, help me! Thank you in advance!! 

**edit: thank you everyone for your suggestions. I've decided to go ahead and start with Head First Java along with Oracle documentation--upvotes for everyone!**"
1emi7p,36,2013-05-19,Studying Engineering in germany. A Quick report.,3l3s3,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1emi7p/studying_engineering_in_germany_a_quick_report/,"Hi guys!
I thought i'd take a couple of minutes to give you a rough idea what it's like to study engineering in germany, mainly because I find that it is quite different from studying in the U.S. from what i read here.

**General:**
I study chemE with focus on biotechnology at one of the [TU9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU9). I am currently in my sixth semester working on my Bachelor's thesis. I'm an active member of the students council and help other students with whatever they need to be successful in their studies.
**Edit:** In Germany it is absolutely uncommon not to get a master's degree. We had the ""Diplom"" before and as that took about 5 years, one is hardly considered a fully educated engineer without a master's degree. There are positions for bachelor's graduates tough, and also special combined programs working closely with industrial partners where you are part time at work in the company and part time at university and work full time once you got your bsc.

**Semester times:**
We have two semesters a year. Wintersemester from October through March, summersemester from april through september. Approximately half of that is filled with lectures. As a rule it should take 6 semesters to get your BSC, one of which is your thesis. Enrollment for most engineering programs only in the wintersemester.


**Lectures:**
We have approximately 6 different lectures per semester. Some of them come with extra classes where a TA shows how to solve problems and/or tutoring where you can solve problems yourself in small groups. Generally it is good advice to go to lectures and take exams in the order designed by the school. There are hardly any classes where attending is mandatory. Nearly all lectures are taught in german only. (There is a mechE program completely in english tough, and us chemE's have the same maths classes, so you could go ahead and attend those)


**Exams:**
Very unlike what I read here very often about a designated 'finals week' our exams are spread out over the entire time of the semester where there are no lectures. (I have had as little as a friday+weekend entirely free time after my second semester, most was about 4 weeks) This makes for about 2 weeks of studying time for each exam. This may seem odd to you, but from my experience, there are hardly any students that would pass the exams with significantly less time (they are frickin hard). Most exams are closed book closed notes but with formula sheets+ calculator. (Eg thermodynamics I + II closed book, closed notes, calc, formula sheet; higher mathematics i + II + III: lecturescript including notes + one published mathematical piece of literature + formula book + no calculator).


**Tuition:**
There is no tuition at most public universities. There is a relatively small administration fee (about 250€ per semester).


**Housing:**
There are dormrooms for as little as 150€ a month (9 m^2, including warm water and internet). Most people don't live in dorms, as there are not enough rooms available.


**Personal remarks:**
I am currently looking for an Internship abroad; unfortunately I want to intern during the winter. That makes it somewhat harder...


**TL;DR:**
Studying engineering in germany is quite different.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!

[What was the worst accident youve had? Worst one in your shop that wasnt you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ig71?context=5)|[Answered about cutting off my nose here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2iqv1)
 |The one that wasn't me, I was working on a film production and the producer showed up a week in advance in a very expensive suit and probably $2,000 shoes. He walked in my workshop as I was forging his pieces. I explained to him that it's dangerous and he shouldn't be there.
 |I put the red-hot metal over to the side of the forge. He walks over to a work bench and picks up a razor-sharp knife I made and runs it across the ball of the thumb cutting it to the bone while asking if it was sharp.
 |I take him to the first aid center, and bandage him up. He walks back to the workshop, picks uip the blocks of metal I had just forged for his production, fusing it to his hand. He shakes off the metal that's fused to the skin of his hand and immerses it into a big plastic tub of what he thinks is water.
 |It's actually a phosphoric acid pickle used for cleaning the metal. So he's cut his thumb, burned his hand and immersed it into acid.
 |Shop etiquette: when you come into the shop, assume everything is hot, sharp, poisonous, and offensively rude.
[What was your favorite build on the show? Least favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hr6t?context=5)|Well the favorite build was Gimli's Axe, as I mentioned above. Pattern-welded steel.
 |My second favorite would have to be [Raphael's Sais](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-nI7xSmBHk). The bladesmithing, the forging of it required a lot of skill.
 |My least favorite would have to be [Captain America's Shield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyFGE0Me9ug): due to time constraints it didn't come out as perfect as I like to make my work. I'd redo it correctly if given the chance. 
[How did you get into this line of work? Were you approached by film studios, or did you actively seek it out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2huks?context=5)|I started cutting gemstones and making jewelry from 7. At 13 I started cutting rocks professionally. At 15 I met the creator of the Conan swords, Jody Samson, who I pestered until he was willing to critique my work: a knife I made.
 |When I was 17 I went to a renaissance fair. Saw a guy making armor. He was using a railroad track as an anvil and modified hammers and chisels. He wanted $5,000 and a year's wait for a suit of armor. So I watched him work for a few hours, went home and replicated all his tools to make my own armor.
 |I was working as a machinist making stonecutting equipment in my early 20s. The business adjoining the shop I worked at was a prop house, and they saw the work that I created: the weapons, jewelry, leatherwork, and they commissioned me to make seven sculptures for Disney World, Epcot Center. That was in 1987. That same company referred the movie Hook, Michael Jackson's tour, and everything else.
[Of all the civilizations and styles that used pattern welding for their swords, who do you think did it best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hqvr?context=5)|Probably the vikings. They were using pattern welded steel in the 7th and 9th century, and it created a very strong, durable sword. It's one of the better uses of pattern welded steel.
[What is the most requested weapon for the show that you might not be able to do? People say you can't do the Mastersword because it's been asked for too much or has already been done to death? Comments? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hxjv?context=5)|Master Sword will have to be done at some point, it's asked for so often.
 |When? You'll have to wait and see.
[Swords in the movies seem to be impossibly sharp. Chopping off heads like a warm knife through butter. Cutting lesser swords in half. What degree of sharpness is actually possible and what is the sharpest thing you've ever made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2husx?context=5)|A sharp sword could definitely cut a lesser sword in half. I was interviewed for a Japanese TV show and forged a sword out of D2 steel. Shaved the hair off my arm to show how sharp it was, then cut through a piece of 4""x4"" oak beam, then took a 1"" round bar of unhardened mild steel, chopped through that, shaved off chunks of steel, then shaved my arm again. Then they realized there was no tape in the camera, and they had to do it all over again.
 |The second time, they lost battery midway. The third time went smooth and it maintained that sharpness the whole time.
 |I sharpen knives. My showroom's open to the public on saturday and I offer knife sharpening and razor sharpening while you wait.
 |My process will leave an optimal 1 molecule thick on the cutting edge of a blade. That is the sharpest it will ever be. Then it's just a matter of the type of steel whether it maintains that edge or not. I do that on the daily basis, they're all the sharpest.
 |Most of the pieces I make for film aren't ever sharpened (actors with a sharp knife?!). They're predominantly made out of aluminum for lightweight prop purposes.
[2\) Also, what style of weaponry would you say is your favorite? Things like types of swords (Katana, Rapier, Epee, Scimitar, Kilij, etc\) or daggers or polearms or the sorts.  3\) And in relation, what type of armor have you found the most interesting/appealing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hund?context=5)|1) I do take custom commissions. Right now I'm booked until about 2015. Most knives and swords cost $500-1000. I would need clean design work, and without seeing that I can't comment more on that.  2) Probably swords. They're what I make the most of.
[I live in NY, and would love to take up blacksmithing as a hobby. Whats the best way for someone with no experience to start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hsrn?context=5)|I'm self taught, but I don't recommend that route. I would join an organization such as ABANA - the Artist's Blacksmith Association of North America. They have regional affiliates, I don't know what the affiliate is in New York, it's probably the New York Blacksmith Association. In California it's the California Blacksmith Association.
[Also, I love the Man at Arms series, and would like to thank you for doing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hsrn?context=5)|The affiliates have meetings and you can take classes from them. They'll generally have hammer-ins (get togethers with a bunch of hairy blacksmiths and one woman.)
[It seems like all you do in your videos is make what other people want you to make. Is there anything that you'd personally really like to do a video of?  Also, loving the videos - look forward to them every week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hup1?context=5)|Glad you love the videos! It's the end of season 2 but look forward to more videos coming.  I'd love to make a giant cauldron bubble bath to bring out in the dessert, but it's really not for a video. That's more for burning man.
[What do you do with the recreations you make on the show? any plans to sell them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hs8g?context=5)|All the recreations are displayed in my private vault at Sword and Stone in burbank. None of these pieces are for sale. These are my fan-based interpretations of other people's copyrighted products. I've probably had about a thousand requests for a damascus steel [Bat'leth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNcyzbcECbM) and 500 requests for [Finn's sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_HxKReSSlA).
 |Unfortunately I can't sell these things without the rights, especially with things like [Batman's Batarangs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV7Kn2J58FM) and [He-Man's sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G23dU1q7hmc) since I actually worked with Warner Bros and Mattel.
[What was your favourite job you did for a movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hwlg?context=5)|Probably Hook back in 1991. It was my first big commission. To see my work on billboards throughout the world was really gratifying.
 |In case you can't tell, I made the title weapon. The hook.
[I hear you mention over and over how dangerous the grinders are on Man-At-Arms. Whats the worst injury you've seen in a shop? Worst injury you yourself have sustained?  Excellent work, btw - everything you do is awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hzm3?context=5)|You can see the sexy scar on my face. It's from when I cut off my nose while polishing a piece of gothic armor on the buffer. Just the left side, it took 44 stitches to sew the inner membranes and cartilage.
[What is your favorite project that you have made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hqnb?context=5)|[Gotta be Gimli's Axe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa0FVYxbVWk).
 |I forged it from Damascus Steel, which is one of the things that makes it more exciting for me. It's actually a challenge to make the piece. It raised the bar over aluminum. It's a real weapon with folded steel.
[Tony, firstly let me say I love your show. Everything you make is so nice. But say you had to go into a medieval war, which 3 piece you've made would you take with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i1ej?context=5)|Well, I'd need a shield for defense. I'd go with a kite-shaped shield, I've made plenty of those.
 |A double-edged broadsword or bastard sword.
 |And a main gauche parrying dagger might be good.
 |If it was just from the show: Captain America's Shield, Raphael's Sais, and Jamie Lannister's sword.
[Tony, I love watching your series. The He-Man sword was awesome and so is everything else you're making.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|Captain America's Shield, I was going to have the shield spun by a big spinning blade. That would have required a month and a half build time and we had three days notice. I had to use existing shop equipment that didn't match perfectly.
[Can you tell us more about the trouble you had with the Captain America Shield? It seemed the least polished of all your other entries. Was there anything you could have done to make it look closer to what it should, as if it was made from 1 block of metal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|If I had more time to build it, it wouldn't have had the gaps on the medal. That's the problem a lot of people had - it didn't look like one piece because we couldn't have one piece to have that anodized color that I heard Stan Lee prefers.
[Also, Any plans for the Eye of Thundera? How about more unconventional weapons? Maybe armor? Bracers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|Lots of plans for more coming up. I'd like to do more armor, it's just the testing for armor at the end of the video is less exciting than seeing stuff smashed up. [I have an armor tutorial for the Stan Winston School you can watch.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZcoY1WEzY8)
[Is there any weapon you would love to make but don't have the skills or the means to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvwi?context=5)|I don't make phasers or electronic weapons so much. Been playing around a little bit with more steam punk-y things, but incorporating air canisters and electrical charges.
[Also do you have a favorite era or style of weapons you like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvwi?context=5)|I just like to make weapons of all eras. No favorites.
[If you didn't have blacksmithing, what do you think you would be doing instead? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2j79y?context=5)|Poledancing for sure.
[What was the weirdest thing you were asked to make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i06i?context=5)|One of the first weird things that I was asked to make was a peg leg for a three legged dog for the movie Hook. They never used it, because the dog had gotten used to walking around without the leg.
[About how long does it take, on average, to make a video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i3a7?context=5)|I don't make the videos. I make hammers.
 |Production is done over a five-day build period and then the next week we do the testing phase. That's not five days for one weapon, we shoot six episodes at a time. So six weapons, five days, no sleep, lots of rockstar (if they want to send a free case address is on my website,) and then the testing the next week.
[Do you have a favorite piece that you've made specifically for yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hy22?context=5)|That question's a bit like the cobbler's shoes. His family walks around barefoot because he's making shoes for everyone else.
 |I'm too busy with everything else just to make something for myself.
[What is the biggest task/ most difficult weapon you have been asked to make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2i34n?context=5)|Gotta be the Buster sword. Have you seen how huge it is?! [Watch the episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xogheZdAO18)
[If you were given enough adamantine to make one thing what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ja2t?context=5)|I don't know the working properties of adamantium or mithril. I looked it up in the AMS metallurgical handbook but it wasn't there. I may need a more current issue.
[Same question, but with mithril.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ja2t?context=5)|I also like working with unobtainium! But I can't get it anymore.
[Just wanted to say that the blades from Hellboy carried by Karl Ruprecht Kroenen were inspired, both sets.  Do you get to have any stylistic input in a movie like that?  Is it just ""copy the comic?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvn7?context=5)|For Kroenen's swords I had a lot of input. They're based on a tonfa, a Japanese police baton weapon, but with edges all over. The grips were wire wrapped from my design and incorporating a black cabochon gemstone in the handle.
 |It was funny when United Cutlery got the licensing to reproduce that, Kit Rae called me trying to find the stones. The black stone that I cut the cabochon from was from a piece of obsidian I found while camping in Mammoth, CA.
[What's your favorite movie weapon that is made by another artist? Perhaps the Conan the barbarian sword? I saw a replica one in a sword factory in Spain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hv38?context=5)|I was 16 when I met Jody Samson and he was creating Conan's sword so that was definitely an inspiration to me.
[.. Sorry for repost.. Phone said it didn't go through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hv38?context=5)|In 1998 I created the Atlantian sword for the TV show Conan the Adventurer with Ralf Moeller. Actually, in the opening credits they showed me forging the sword as Crom!
[Have any actors commented on your builds, good or bad? Whats the best example of either?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ir3h?context=5)|I was building an aluminum stunt weapon for James Franco for Tristan and Isolde. When he came into my showroom, which is decorated with the castle walls from Army of Darkness, and I walked out of the back workshop filthy.
 |He asked where I keep the gimp.
[Where does one go these days to become a blacksmith? Are there decent trade schools, or is apprenticeship the only way to go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2huj6?context=5)|There are trade schools, [ABANA](http://www.abana.org/) is a good place to start. Not many on the west coast but I know there's [Penland School](http://www.penland.org/) in North Carolina. Also in North Carolina is the [John C Campbell Folk School](https://www.folkschool.org/)

I just received my MPH and have only had internships, great internships, internships that I should be proud of: but nobody is actually giving me a chance to work for them.

My masters, according to hiring managers, makes me too qualified for entry level...

but because I've only had internships (in this field) they don't want to hire me for anything more than entry level.

My interview on Friday went like this:

- genniside, this job is called an analyst but it doesn't have any real analyst responsibilities - you don't want this
- I know someone who may have a different position for you, so you may hear from HR about it.

This has happened to me 2 times before, and the end of the story was that I was underqualified for the other positition and didn't get an offer from either.

In this particular instance (last friday) I wrote an email saying I don't know about the other job when I am really looking for entry level work. Basically telling her that she may perceive me as being over qualified for the job, I do not see it in that light.

2 questions:

Did I do the right thing by sending that email?

How do I escape this paradox and actually get an entry-level job?

Thanks, any help will ease my mental health. Seriously. So stressed over these dumb situations I get myself into."

i haven't gotten a internship offer yet for the summer. so i'm thinking of being spontaneous and just buying a one way ticket somewhere and just chill there for a bit. meet new people, experience a new town, get a low-key job (like waitressing or something, even though i've never done that before lol).

it's just...i want to do something outside of this ""master plan"" i think i have for myself. just get internships, finish school, get my degree, work and officially be thrown into the real world. 

i don't like monotony. i don't want to be stuck in the same routine.

so i figured take advantage of the time i have this summer to do something different, wild, and free, and live a little.

my question is....any suggestions of where i could go? i'm in an urban area right now, so im not thinkin of any big cities. i'd even be fine with a small town kinda place where real connections are made.

or maybe i'm just asking for too much and stuck in a silly daydream.

any help/advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

I picture being famous and important. I picture my friends looking up to me and having a steady income, attending parties with famous people and being interviewed. I’ve often written about others as well – the influential businessman, the wealthy entrepreneur. 

I picture these instances, because I know that I am capable of becoming these things, if given the chance. In the end I do not know how. 

I want fortune to smile upon me, showing me with money, praise and admiration. But it never does. 

And I walk the city streets, hoping to be discovered for my style, hoping to that chance encounter with a businessman who is impressed with my youth and ambition. But these never come. It depresses me sometimes, when  I think that I am twenty-five and jobless. And it depresses me when my roommate writes me a text message about throwing detergent into the washing machine like I am his intern or stay-at-home wife, because he thinks that I am at home doing nothing of importance and therefore can do his laundry. And it depresses me when I think of my future – which at this point is so insecure and on such a darkened path, that I cannot picture where I will and a week from now or a year from now. 

It is not that I do not want to work – it is that I do not know what to work at. In truth I want to work and I want to work hard.  I want to make money and earn respect and meet interesting people and intellectuals, but aside from drifting through expensive bars at night, hoping for these one-in-a-lifetime encounters, I do not know what to do. 

There is always the possibility of taking the entirety of the bottle of Xanax in my desk drawer, but I do not really have the balls to do that, and I would hate to think about what it would do to those around me. That is not a solution, that is giving up. It is there though. 

And so I wish and I wait and I write lists of what I want.  And the feeling in the pit of my stomach comes and goes, and the feeling of depression and hopelessness comes and goes. And I print and I write into this little book, documenting my feelings and sometime adventures, the writings getting so personal that it is really not fit for anyone but myself to read. Lamentations on life and New York City, the world and women.  The mantra, “kill myself, kill myself,” floating through my head at night or when walking down the city streets. And I do not know what to do.

Starting QA, want to move out eventually.",LiNZero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eo7td/16_month_internship_starting_qa_want_to_move_out/,"I started a 16 month internship in Toronto, Canada for Big Blue(they like 16 month internships and I needed money to change schools, they pay very well!). My job title says ""Software Developer Intern"" yet they put me into the QA team for the system group that was hired for. The software architect stated that I would start in QA to become familiar with the system and then move on into development, but I am afraid that I may get stuck in this role for 16 months. This is because of several things:

* I came into this team with another new intern. He started in development immediately whereas I started in QA
* There are 2 old interns that are leaving in August and I'm working with them. I am afraid that I am supposed to be their replacement.
* The interns have been doing this since the beginning of the year now. So this indicates I may be QAing for quite a while at least.
* They cannot simply move me into another team. I would need to replaced. Just as I am replacing the old interns.

The next full release cycle of the product starts in July and ends in October. My ideal situation would be to experience one cycle as a QA and get out. I don't really mind being QA to get the experience of being one but I definitely do not want to be QA for 16 months.

How should I tell my manager that being QA is not what I expected and that I do not want to stay in this position indefinitely? Is there any timing that I should be aware of(like don't say it so soon since I've only been here 3 weeks)? How can I be diplomatic about this?"

Like some of you, I was quite anxious about finding a job after graduating.  I had no internships under my belt, almost no contacts save my professors, only a couple of substantial personal projects, and a resume that consisted mostly of relevant coursework.  Really, the only thing I had going for me was a very high GPA.  After interviewing with only three different companies, I landed my first programming job.  

I understand my situation may be the exception, and certainly you should not discount the advice you will find in this sub, a lot of it is really good.  But to those of you who are like I was, who are discouraged that they may not have the most competitive, ivy league, ""rockstar programmer"" credentials, just know that it *is* possible.   Also, make sure you have a good relationship with your professors.  If you're a good student, they're your guaranteed network/connections.  One of mine is actually partly responsible for me getting this job.  He gave me the name and number of one of his industry contacts and a good referral.  So, make sure you talk to them and develop a good relationship outside of the classroom.

Good luck!"

I just finished my first year at college (Computer Engineering Major), and I'm looking for a summer internship. I figure since my major is a related field, it wouldn't be hard to get a cs/web development internship (especially since those are more common than engineering internships). I really like programming, and tend to like my cs courses better than most of my other courses. (But then again I haven't really taken a lot of engineering courses yet being a freshman).

I've applied to some positions posted on internships.com and internmatch.com, and almost every position asks for links to my best work. Because I am looking for an internship to gain experience, I don't really have that much great code lying around. Sure I have all of the simple programs that I wrote when learning a language, but I think that doesn't come anywhere near qualifying as ""best work.""

Should include schoolwork? Project Euler problems? (Maybe even something from Codecademy?)
Right now the only thing sitting in my github account is a simple HTML-basad connect four game I wrote in javascript/jQuery.

In addition do you guys have any advice on small side-projects I could do to put in my programming portfolio?"
1eqtg2,9,2013-05-21,Help.,MRN1982,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1eqtg2/help/,"I am a 30 year old man that is happily married with a beautiful, loving wife and have a 6 week old baby. I haven't been working for over 3 years. I became a firefighter when I was 21 because I like to help people. I worked hard and pursued my dream and attained it. On the advice of my retiring captain I attended paramedic school to better myself. In order to do this I would have to take one year off in order to attend classes and 800 hours of an internship. Over 1200 hours of work in total. My internship lasted 600 hours, a far greater time than is normal. My preceptor, normally a hard ass (but an amazing preceptor and paramedic) with a 60% fail rate kept me on and gave me as much extra time as he could. He saw how hard I applied myself, how hard I studied and applied what he taught, however, I still was unable to make the cut. I had folded under the pressure of a few bad calls. He told me that failing me was the hardest thing that he had ever done with any intern he had. I will always remember his kindness mixed with disappointment.  After I had failed. I tried to return back to my fire career. My old captain had retired out of the country. The captain who replaced him a deeply conservative, homophobic, and mean spirited man blocked any attempt for me to rejoin the department. He had tried to terminate a young lesbian woman who worked at our station the previous year and my testimony cast doubt upon what happened. Every other firefighter had said ""I didn't see anything."" I told the truth and her job was saved and subsequently transferred.  I also had transferred to another shift with the retiring captain. After failing paramedic school, and not being able to get back in to the job I love. I have been lost ever since. I decided to work on an ambulance and was employed for 2 1/2 years. Due to depression and a back injury I could no longer work for them. 

It has been 3 years. My muscular and athletic body has turned to fat and  I am now an embarrassing 310lbs. I am unemployed and have tried to find other careers but nothing has been able to stick. I have only a high school diploma and was never very good at school. My wife is a very successful business woman who's career has skyrocketed. She will be graduating from a top 5 university with a MBA. I am ashamed to stand beside her when we are with friends. I have seen therapists for depression. I had started experimenting with drugs for a short time behind her back. She never found out. When she got pregnant I stopped.  Now I just sit in front of the computer for an average of 12 hours a day playing video games, just happy to get lost in them. My wife's irritation and exasperation has been growing. She says I have the power to change anything I just have to put my mind to it. This makes me feel even more weak and powerless. I try to avoid looking at myself in the mirror and every day feel a mix of shame and self loathing fill my chest. I was bullied most of my time in school. I am a 30 year old man, but I feel the same familiar helplessness as I did when I was younger. I feel myself sinking, and see no ways to fix it. I feel as if I am dragging my loved ones down with me. I sometimes think that my child would be better off without having my influence in her life and that my wife could find a better man after I am gone.  These thoughts of suicide are not the first I have had. I have battled with them ever since I was a teenager. They went away when I had my dream job, I had the drive and the fire to improve myself and had become living proof that nerds to become great after school. Now I am back full circle. The shame, embarrassment, and feelings of worthlessness have come flooding back, this time however, they are much stronger. I sit in front of my computer and cry when I am home alone. When I am out running errands I fantasize about being murdered during a robbery or run over by a careless driver. Having worked in the Emergency medical field I know what happens to people who say they are a threat to themselves and others. When I started planning to jump off a bridge while her family was here to visit (so she could have support nearby) I decided to post here. 

I have been to the top. Since then I have lost so much. My career, health, faith, and soon my family if things don't change. "

Last bit before my question, I'll have about a month before the position starts that I could devote to learning Php - however that would be well after the application deadline.

Should I pursue Masters?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ev013/unhappy_with_bs_failed_a_year_low_gpa_did/,"I'm studying CS at a little known university in Europe and just finishing B.S. Didn't like it very much so far - I failed a year and have really low GPA - 2.0/4.0 (US scale). However, I also did 4 software engineering internships at good companies (one of them is Google) so my resume is not that bad.

Here is how I passed most courses:

* Skipped all classes - they are a waste of time.

* Watched equivalent courses at Coursera, MIT OCW or something similar.

* Downloaded good books rather than read those written by local professors.

Really, why bother going to a university if I am learning everything on my own? Yeah, I do have friends. Yes, I am exposed many areas of CS. Yes, I can study on my own. Yes, I do a lot of programming in my free time. What am I missing here?

However, I must also say that some courses at my university are excellent. But still, just a minority. And I would go through them by myself anyway - all materials are available to me. Apart from writing a thesis, I feel there is really no point in being enrolled.

Two more years pursuing Masters doesn't sound exciting to me - I'd rather work for a year and then study on my own for a year or two. The fact that my salary might be compromised at some point in the future is worrying me. Is this my concern valid? Would it matter if I get a job in U.S.? What about Europe?

Do you believe me when I say that online courses blow equivalent courses at my university out of the water? Do I sound silly? Anyone else feeling like this?

What would you advise me to do - Masters or not?"

[Hey Frank, follow you on FB, just happened to see your post on here.  Thought it was nice of you to do an AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xe2x?context=5)|First time I saw Star Wars, I made a musical connection right away.  First thing you hear is that iconic opening piece of music and all you see is text on a screen.  You know music grabs you if it can do that with no other real reference to connect it yet.  With all that in mind enjoying what your doing is also a big part of it, even when its stressful and you have deadlines.  I feel extremely fortunate that I love all that I do no matter the situation and that I've been able to evolve, adapt, and rise to the occasions all along the way to grow and improve and further my position to audio director and all other aspects of audio work aside of just composition, which of course is as much an equal passion as its ever been.  OK, that was a book!  Hope its answers your question and thank you!
[My question for you: How has your music evolved throughout your life?  Is your music influenced by things in your life, the game itself, or any outside factors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xe2x?context=5)|Thanks for following on Facebook, and welcome!  Great question!  I predict a long answer... here goes!  In my own life, I can give some examples.  It evolved in phases.  FIrst off, my parents were musicians, so my fisrt exposure was from birth being around them playing and performing.  So as a little kid, I took it for granted that everyones parents must do that, and didn't understand when other kids were so overly wowed by it, for me it was part of daily life.  All the while I'm being introduced to new music, new artists, new styles, new soundtracks, and I would just take what affected me most and apply it to whatever I was working on at any given time.  Outside of composing full time at this point, I'm still trying to do something with bands, and what really inspired me to further myself in sheet music writing for horns was a band Home Cookin, which I later joined.  They had a horn section already but when the main guy became unavailable, I took the reigns and crash coursed learned what I need to do to make it happen.  Which of course translates to orchestra and beyond but it was a good starting point for me.  Experiences you have in life will also contribute to how creative or inspired you are and no matter what emotion you are feeling you can take advantage of it and harness it into music.  If you are composing something for a somber scene, you can draw from sad experiences in life, same with uplifting, or anger, anything.  I learned to channel it.  The game itself naturally is a big factor in style and all the various settings / levels and situations so referencing those directly is also a must of course.  From there, the art inspires me, the fun of the gameplay inspires me, and the team I'm working with does too whether they enjoy the direction its going or offer more feedback as to how to redirect.
[Thanks for making part of my childhood awesome, how has the switch from Westwood to EA and then Petroglyph come about? Do you miss the olden days of Westwood much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3ukdd?context=5)|You're welcome!  Westwood days were great and I always look back fondly, was a great era.  When EA consolidated, I didn't make the move to California, I stayed and freelanced until Petroglyph formed up.  I miss the way the industry in general used to be in older days - it seems that it is pretty rough out there now.  Petroglyph always feels like an extension of Westwood with many people we have from there.  I'm thankful that we can continue to make fun experiences and move forward as a creative team.

[Hello Mr. Klepacki!  First of all I am HUGE fan of your music on C&amp;C games. I listen to them often while I am jogging.  I'd like to ask what does the man say at the beginning of the song Grinder? And what language is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3v0bj?context=5)|Was told it was Russian, vaguely saying something to the effect of ""this is a Red Alert"" or ""emergency"" but I'm not entirely sure.

[Alright, I have to know. I'm looking to get into the music side of video gaming doing exactly what you do. How did you end up in the job you are in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3vwzq?context=5)|How I started, and how one has to start today, are two completely different scenarios.
 |•Quality has got to be there, has to sound like what's currently out there right now. Network, attend game conventions, talks on the subject of game audio, get a feel for things.
 |•Start small with indie devs or mod communities, get in some experience with working with teams, how the audio gets plugged into the game as to have a better understanding of approach to composing for it.
 |•If you pursue in-house positions, maybe start as an intern with a larger company, or junior position. if you're freelance then prepare to chase work more than doing it at first until you establish enough clients.
 |•Don't just pursue 'games’, pursue all media! Composing knows no bounds or formats.  The level of quality is all on the same playing field.  A ""game composer"" used to have the stereotype that you make a 'bleeps and blips' soundtrack.  Now its full symphonies, any everything in between.  
[Is there a game you wish you could've done music for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uf60?context=5)|Big fan of Unreal Tournament series and Transformers war for cybertron games, would have been great fun to work on for me.
[HELL MARCH! What's your favorite music that you wrote?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uht6?context=5)|\m/ Multiple favorites, would have to be more specific.  ;)
[Do you have a formulaic approach to composing for a game, or does it differ from project to project? Are there common traits in other soundtracks that you admire or try to steer clear of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh5j?context=5)|It differs project to project, but there is common ground in my approach.  As composers you can only write for one instrument at a time until you have as many layers needed for a section of music, but my approach is to start with the first instrument choice that is inspiring the new piece I'm thinking of in my head.  Whether its a French horn melody, or a bassline, or a drum beat, that's how I generally start it off, and if I'm hearing a finished section in my head, then I start with the fastest things I can load into the daw and crank it our asap before I lose the idea.
[Thanks a ton for doing this AMA, by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh5j?context=5)|As far as what I steer clear of, I try to avoid the things that are done to death in many other soundtracks, but it's tougher these days as everything's been written and tried for the most part, so now I think the main things for me to continue to set myself apart, is unique combinations of instruments I come up with, or delve into some progressive elements to mix it up.
[Favourite Synth ? Opinion on software synths?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3w3i1?context=5)|As a composer in many genres I need a ton of sounds at my disposal so while I will say Kontakt is my central hub with which to load up with custom banks of instruments, Komplete Ultimate contains majority of what I use today, and then I will then load in third party sounds into Kontakt like libraries from Cinesamples.
 |I used to have a rack of all hardware synths and samplers back in the day and while I have an affinity for some of those signature sounds and still have some of that gear, I definitely have embraced all software synths because saving all settings and instant renders are the only way to go now.  Of course I will combine that with live instrument tracks as well.

[Also, along with most others here, a sincere thank you. The music you've done for games is just incredible. From the C&amp;C and Red Alert music to the amazing End of Nations opening theme, the music you make is (for me\) among the most iconic out there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3ur17?context=5)|Most recent work to have come out is The Battle For Graxia Soundtrack in both mp3 and flac is on Steam right now: [Link to store.steampowered.com](http://store.steampowered.com/app/236640/)
[Mr Klepacki, thanks for everything you have made ! I have a question though, one of muy favrite songs from C&amp;C is ""Act on instinct"" and I wondered if the voices in the song were stock samples or extracts or if you have made everything up ? (but then, who talks ?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3vup4?context=5)|They were recorded at Westwood by various voice actors and processed to sound like they were sampled.
[I am a composer, mixer, producer, etc. currently about to leave graduate school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Hello!
[This question is a bit personal, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, but maybe you can give some sort of insight. What kind of pay can someone expect when writing freelance for games? Obviously it differs per project, but a range for larger and smaller games would be helpful. Also, what is the salary like for in-house composers at both larger and smaller firms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|If you are freelancing you set your own rate.  The pay scale may differ depending on how demanding the job is.  It's your choice whether to charge based on how many hours you work, or by the assets you are providing.  I generally would charge by the asset: per sound effect, or per minute of completed / delivered music.  You have to take into consideration of a buyout, meaning that if the client is paying a one time buyout fee that gives them the rights to use it for the project and you collect nothing further, what is that worth too you?  The game industry generally does not want to pay royalties in this category.  So then it's upfront payment, or milestone payment, or whatever is worked out on the contract depending on the work load.
[Are you receiving royalties from freelance game projects or are they up-front payments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|In-house position salaries will vary on your experience level and amount of duties you take on.  Most game studios these days want sound designers more than composers in terms of in-house.  The more things you can do to be valuable and flexible will open more doors.
[What are the licensing payments like for your material that UFC uses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Licensing usually means you are allowing use of music for an agreed upon fee, in exchange for you retaining the rights to it.  Which traditionally would be a cheaper fee then a buyout in that case.
[Sorry if I crossed any lines here...you don't have to answer all of it. I just expect some of these opportunities will be open to me in the near future and I'd like some guidance on which will be the most worthwhile to pursue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Royalties in the case of television are collected through your performance rights org like ASCAP or BMI, and they track the usage and pay you quarterly accordingly.
[Follow up - so for example in the case of the UFC music, generally one would get licensing + royalties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca427cx?context=5)|All clients are different.  Generally in more specific cases, (if they want a specific song) there is an initial license fee and then broadcast royalties.  But if you were to submit to music libraries that shop it around for you as part of their collection, then generally you're only looking at broadcast royalties.
[What is considered to be your most famous work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3wj68?context=5)|Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert is probably the most famous, but a lot of people have also gotten to know my solo albums through Ultimate Fighting Championship tv shows.
[I absolutely loved the soundtrack to the original C&amp;C - it's really somewhat unique music - have you ever thought of releasing something new in a similar style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3wo9m?context=5)|Why yes ;)   Have you heard my solo albums?

[I liked your work in Blade Runner. What was the music while in Tyrell's office called? I have a hard time finding the name of that ambient piece. It was simple but lovely. It had what sounded like wind chimes played intermittently.

I totally immersed myself in Vangelis work for that one - made me appreciate his soundtrack so much more.
[ off, huge fan of your work, Mr. Klepacki!  My question: Have you ever considered doing a tour of sorts where you'd play live versions of the tracks you created for the Red Alert/C&amp;C series? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uxna?context=5)|Thank you!  I have, and I would, given the right circumstances / offers.  
[Thanks for doing this Mr. Klepacki, just wanted to ask, what's your favorite track from the original C&amp;C? Me and a friend picked up almost all of the tracks and tabbed them back in the day, kick ass work you did there!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3upim?context=5)|Cool!  My favs from C&amp;C TD has to be Act on Instinct and Prepare For Battle.
[I hate to think I'm contributing to a downward shift of the very industry I'm trying to work my way into.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca440ik?context=5)|Network at game conventions, attend talks, check out communities like audiogang, ask questions, but you want to be meeting people like producers &amp; leads on a project to get their contact info and discuss opportunities to pitch to them.  Take genuine interest in what they're working on and ask them about it.  Most important thing to find out is what do they need ""right now?""  Back to timing.  That's where their minds are most likely at.  I often tell composers to also become sound designers, because the industry tends to look for those more often than composers - then you can pitch for sound design work too, and once that's going well, if there's ever talk of music needs after, ""oh, what did you need there?  Maybe I can help.""
[EDIT: Also, how would you compare the video game scoring industry to the film and television scoring industry? It seems that there's more stability and in-house jobs to be found in the former, do you find this to be true? Thanks again for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca440ik?context=5)|Don't stop at games - go after ALL media, commercials, tv, film, short films, music libraries, licensing, agencies, exhaust every possible avenue.  
[I feel like your work on the Universe At War soundtrack haven't been appreciated enough. I didn't play the game a lot, but I've had the soundtrack on my ipod for years. Which of the three factions were the most fun to work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3vavb?context=5)|Yeah I wish UAW had more marketing behind it, it was a very under-rated and unique RTS in my opinion which still had that fun quality of the old C&amp;C's to me.  The Hierarchy was probably the most fun.  I loved those massive walking units which inspired the ultra decimating soundtrack style for them. 
[Just do it up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca41ep9?context=5)|Every encounter, is gonna be much more difficult.
[Mr. Klepacki, first of all, I've been waiting for this moment - I love You &lt;3.  My question would be - Do you have a single all-time favourite from the C&amp;C Saga, and if you do, which one is it? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xbp5?context=5)|Many favorites from C&amp;C Saga!

I like your work, thank you for awesome music:\) Sorry for my english.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3w3ju?context=5)|""becoming"" a composer requires education so college courses are a must.  To write music for films, or any media you'll just need some early experience to get your feet wet.  See my response to peripheral_vision below.
[I wonder, apart from composing, how many/which instruments can you play?  Like, if given in 'real life' :P For example, I've seen your live performance with the guitar, that was awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3w2oz?context=5)|I play drums, guitar, bass, keys and sing.

[Hi Mr Klepacki, I just wanted to say thank you for this IAMA.  I grew up listening to your music. My friends and I used to sing along to the C&amp;C and Red Alert tunes!

[Do you always play the games that you made music for? And what are some of your favorite games that you didnt have any involvement in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40980?context=5)|Yep, I do.  Part of the gig!
[Also, thank you. I think I can sum my childhood up in Hell March.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40980?context=5)|I also have enjoyed games like Batman Arkum asylum / city, GTA4, Transformers War for cybertron, Unreal tournament series, Infamous, Force Unleashed.
[Frank Klepacki AMA? No friggin way...  I love to throw on the old C&amp;C music. Driving, working, making pasta, etc., it always puts me in the zone!  Oddball question. I would like to know your opinion on using HM1/2 wither a video featuring gameplay from Company of Heroes 2? Did Relic ever contact you/EA? Licensing could have been a problem, but a CoH2 teaser with HM2 would be epic!  If I made my own video, properly attributed, would that work as far as you are concerned? Think EA might get it pulled down since CoH2 is sort of a competitor to the C&amp;C series?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3y21q?context=5)|Its out of my hands, EA controls the licensing of that music so it would be up to them.
[Hey Mr. Klepacki - main thing I want to say is that I've really enjoyed your tracks for the Command &amp; Conquer series: all three Hell Marches, Just Do It Up, Grinder, Prepare for Battle are a few faves. Listened to a little of your other stuff as well which I've also enjoyed. Nice going and thanks dude!  Feel compelled to include a question - Do you end up with a lot of cut material when you put together a soundtrack? Do you often carry over cut material from one project over to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40ua5?context=5)|I don't end up with a lot of cut material usually, if I do, I identify it early on as something that doesn't fit and I'll keep it on the shelf until I find a home for it.  Experimentation is key - I'll often ""sketch"" out a handful of ideas in very basic form, a single track or melody or chord change, and I only pick the strongest ones to continue forward with.  Depends.   
[Where did you get that awesome guitar you got. And how can i get one too ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh20?context=5)|The guitar is made custom for me by Tagg Guitars, and you can request to order it as well through them:  [Link to taggguitars.com](http://taggguitars.com)
[Frank, I must say that you are a great inspiration to me. Not simply inspiration in the musical sense (although I greatly admire your work\), but more the attitude of 'Well my music won't be heard if I work in a band. Fuckit, computer games instead!' and the success you've had in a notoriously fickle industry. Your name is well known although yourself and Koji Kondo are the only computer game musicians I can name off the top of my head.  Do you think thatre there any opportunities around now for the talented, or possibly lucky, musicians amongst us in computer game music, so we can follow in your footsteps? Are there any other unorthodox avenues that would be worth pursuing for an aspiring musician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca44jq0?context=5)|I appreciate that, thank you!  State of mind can play a big part in determining your path, and if you run on parallel paths for a while to figure out which one is better for you, than so be it.  That's basically what I did, computer gig by day, band pursuit by night.  Funny thing is I still do that, but the difference is my state of mind.  I'm not trying to kill myself over the band thing anymore.  I know what that's all about and now I pick and choose, only do whats fun, and I have no other expectation.  Where as video games most certainly is my ""career"" so I came to accept that years ago and so that's is always my priority above all else.  I've touched on some other things in threads below of what I think are ways to investigate pursuing it today.  The industry is pretty wacky so you never no from what angle something will turn up but constantly putting yourself out there and perhaps taking on some other skills and traits that compliment the field can be helpful to subsidize what is going slower in one area.  Audio renaissance guy is what I recommend for anyone.  More options you have the better.
[Thank you for doing what you do! The Red Alert soundtrack was the first CD I remember listening to on my own (and I listened to it a lot!\) You've significantly influenced my musical taste from when it was first developing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3zoe9?context=5)|From when I first started taking notice: John Williams, Vince Dicola, Midnight Star, afrika bambaataa, ACDC, Van Halen, Metallica.
[Who were some of the influences you remember from when you first started actively listening to music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3zoe9?context=5)|I suppose that's enough of a start to influence a mixed-up kid who wants to handbang and breakdance while writing orchestral backing behind roller skate beats &amp; synths with metal guitars.  lol  ;)
[Hello, fellow Las Vegan here.  I just wanted to say thank you to your company for creating such an awesome bit of video game history in our city.  And of course for making sure they all have such kick-ass soundtracks.  My question is this: With the announcement that Take Two is moving some of it's operations to town, how do you feel about the future of the industry here?  Has Petroglyph been affected by this announcement? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca4489z?context=5)|Hey there!  Thanks!  I hope it presents even more future for the industry to consider Vegas.  It's the perfect place for any of them to move to, cost of living is less, no state tax, free parking everywhere, and most importantly NO DISASTERS.  I'm surprised it's taken even this long for another one to make a move.  So I'd say we welcome it!
[Absolutely loved you're work on C&amp;C, ever since I was a child... But I especially love your work on the Dune games. For me, you truly captured the 'essence' of Arrakis, I guess that's one way to put it.

The newer selections I added to that game definitely drew influence from the David Lynch Dune film, as well as extension of my previous work.
[What were your inspirations while scoring Dune2000/Emperor Battle for Dune? Also I noticed Emperor had 3 different composers, which tracks were you responsible for? Regardless, the music was fantastic across the board :\) Keep doing what you're doing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40urj?context=5)|In Emperor I did all the Atredies themes which picked up where Dune 2000 left off.

A long time ago I used to listen to these songs from your website and then I copied them, renamed the downloaded files to mp3 and woohoo. Now they're in my computer and my car. Thanks! I guess I should have paid for them :-D. Sorry about that. Great songs, perfect compositions. I love the way you sometimes mix in odd/atypical sounds with other typical musical sounds.

You would probably enjoy my solo albums, and the Universe at War soundtrack.
[Hi Frank! I just want to say that I love all your soundtracks, and listen to them on a regular basis, especially the Command and Conquer soundtracks. My favourite song would have to be No Mercy, which samples one of my favourite movies, Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey.  When you were composing the soundtracks for Dune 2000 and Blade Runner, how did you go about getting the feel for those universes? Did you just listen to the movie soundtracks over and over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca44osw?context=5)|Listened to em, watched em, played the game over and over, everything.

Star Wars Empire At War is what I was born to do, being a huge Star Wars fan who knows the music and sound effects and voices like the back of my hand.
 |Universe At War was just a straight up fun RTS with truly unique factions that played differently and had that sci-fi meets campy C&amp;C spirit and so it was a direct extension of that feeling of the past.
 |The End of Nations scoring I did had a lot more emotion and allowed me to make something a bit more organic.
 |Battle For Graxia was a cool fun and creative experience, much more akin to the old days of game dev with a smaller team, and more action arcade like qualities that I enjoy.

Lands of Lore 1 was probably my personal favorite of the series as it was very much along the lines of Eye of The Beholder 2 which I'd previously worked on and I loved the 3d grid style dungeon crawls.  LOL2 was very creative and inventive though, I loved scoring the videos to that one in particular.  I remember both those scenes very clearly - I was captivated by them as well.  ;)

Today after entering in my information for a full time job and sending it off I realized I autofilled my extraneous information for an internship, and not a full time job. I got an immediate response from HR asking about the internship information. Thankfully this was the first (and last) time it will happen. 

Judging from their quick response they were interested in me as well. Bah.

TL;DR: check, recheck, and check again to make sure the right information on the application is filled out."
1euitg,340,2013-05-22,Always Check the CD/DVD Drive!,area88guy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1euitg/always_check_the_cddvd_drive/,"This one happened way back in the beginnings of my career. I was the System Admin for a small for-profit college campus in my home state, which meant 10% of my time was imaging machines, 10% was improving our systems and builds, and 80% was working on student laptops or desktops.

That last one always felt dubious. However, my boss stated that this was a service that we could offer to our students that would give them a bit more ""loyalty"". I didn't mind because it was usually easy work, and also because it just gave me more WoW or SoaSE time with my interns.

Enter Qiet Student. QS was a known, good person that I had seen around. She came in to ask if we could take a look at her laptop, stating that it was extremely slow and things were not working. After taking down her information and labeling the machine, she was off to morning class, and I booted her laptop up.

Of note: my office was directly across from a classroom, and I was required to leave my door open for approachability. The class across the way was also leaving their door open for late-comers.

As the machine starts to boot, I hear the CD/DVD drive spin up. It didn't concern me at the time, and I let it get into Windows. It automatically logged in, saving me that trouble. However, for some reason, the CD/DVD drive was immediately accessed and opened...

...blaring some pornography in my office at a volume level that could have summoned Godzilla. I was not prepared for this. All in the space of a few heartbeats, I had both thumbed the mute button and hit the Eject button on the CD/DVD drive. Neither immediately worked, so I *dove* over my desk, vaulting it like a parkour object, and shut my door quickly. 

I am not a small man. Luckily, I had brought my backpack that day, and it was filled to the brim with clothes. I had a work ""uniform"" that consisted of a button-down and tie, with slacks. Since I also attended the college, I would change into more casual clothing afterwards. This was in the dead of winter, so I had a t-shirt, large pullover, and jeans in the bag.

My lightning-fast reaction to the sounds had produced one flaw: my dual monitor system had become unhinged, and one monitor flew at the floor at speeds I couldn't calculate with my mental math proficiency. Thankfully, I made a critical LUK save, and the monitor landed on my clothes pack unharmed.

After closing the door, saving my monitor, and slowing my heart down, I dusted myself off and went around to check the laptop. It was still sitting there, DVD ejected, and loading up an amount of spyware and virus-spawned evil that caused me to consider an exorcism. 

There, in the tray, was an unlabeled DVD.

I knew what it had to be, and I wasn't too pleased. I was also floored; did someone really submit this machine to me and ask me to clean it, with this in the tray? I couldn't believe it, but there it was. Shaking my head, I took the DVD out of the tray and made my way back around my desk to pick up the mess of other items my vault had sent flying. As I do so, however, I hear the sound of a key in my office door. There were only two people with that key. I was one. The other was my boss. My ""not computer savvy"" boss, the one who believed that fear and job security were good enough threats for motivation.

Arrogant Bastard Boss steps in to ask why my door is closed, and I immediately cut him off with ""ABB, please close my door and allow me to explain what was delivered to me."" I used his first name. I never did that, unless it was a Big Damn Deal, and this caused him to pause, then close the door. 

ABB: This had better be worth it, 88.

88: It is. This student laptop was delivered to me, with this DVD in the drive. It began to play automatically when the laptop started up, and closing my door was just part of my attempts to prevent its sounds from being heard.

ABB: What? Give me that.

88: Sir, the contents (*the disc is now snatched out of my hands*) are not safe for work!

ABB proceeds to put the disc back into the laptop's CD/DVD drive, where it is popped back in and immediately played again. As it turned out, the volume control on the laptop itself did not work, but the door to my office was thankfully closed as the video began to play. He gave it five seconds before he paled, immediately ejecting the disc. Setting it on the desk, he came back around to me. ""You know what to do. Carry on."" ABB left my office, closing the door behind him.

QS returned four hours later, and I took her aside, asking my intern to close the door. I kept the intern inside, since I had told her the entire story, and I felt a female corroborating the story would be a bit helpful.

88: QS, a DVD was found inside of your laptop that contained pornography. This DVD was automatically activated when I started your laptop. I'm afraid that this will be the last time I will service any of your equipment.

QS: What? You're fucking lying, I don't watch porn!

88: See for yourself. The DVD is on top of your laptop.

QS boots her laptop, pops the DVD in, and gives it time to load. It does. She begins to watch the video. Thankfully, the volume was at about 1%. Her face begins to contort into an angry mien. She takes the DVD out, shuts down her laptop, and storms out. The Intern and I are left wondering.

Cut to a month later. QS comes into my office to request assistance with her phone. I quietly remind her that she is no longer entitled to support, which I hated to do, but she asked if I would reconsider if she told me what the problem had been. I agreed, since I was curious, and all she needed was one sentence to regain my amused trust: 

QS: The man you saw was my now-ex fiancee, and the woman you saw was my sister.

Trust regained, and I couldn't help but laugh."

[What's the weirdest scene you've been involved with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca35ooz?context=5)|I've got two, will start with an easy one.
 |Spouse abuse case. I show up and the husband is like, six feet tall, 150 pounds...black eyes, red face, busted lip. His wife, no taller than 5.5 ft, at least 300lb+, is sitting there telling the cops why she beat him up. I also have to document the entire house to ensure they are upholding a proper ""standard of living"" and find a series of dildos on their entertainment suite. When I get to that area, I look at the scene commander and ask, ""You want me to shoot the dildos?"" He said, ""Yep...and I want close ups."" !!!
 |I think this one takes the cake, though. Very beginning of my career.
 |I get a call on the ""alert phone."" It's the base police. They ask me to report to building XXX whatever. I'm asking myself why it's such a familiar number...""OH, I LIVE HERE."" (Dorm/Barracks).
 |I go outside and there's cops, fire dept., ambulance - everyone. I walk downstairs and find the on-scene commander. He tells me to follow him.
 |As we near the entrance to the dayroom (lounge area) I see a blood trail and start snapping shots. We keep walking...I am now inside. We open the door and there's feces and blood...EVERYWHERE. On the phone, on the pool table, on the TV...
 |All of a sudden I hear a cop say ""found the probe""...not words I want to hear when I see blood and poo. I turn around to see this cop holding a billiard cue with the tiny end covered in blood and poop dripping down the handle.
 |We never found the bleeder.
[Is there a particular crime scene or accident you will never be able to get out of your head? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36fx3?context=5)|We had a report of weird smells coming from a house a few years back. It's summer and we all assume the worst. We open the door and are immediately hit with rotting human smell.
 |Doe had been dead for at least a week, maggots were coming out of his mouth, ears, etc. No visible sign of violence, he seemed to have died in his sleep. They bust out the ""glow"" light and we see vaginal fluids all over him. Best guess is that he died having sex. That's probably the best way to go.
 |Well, they can't leave any stone unturned so, as a closing act, they need to turn the body to see if there are any marks/wounds on his back. I'm on the business end of this event, camera ready to shoot as soon as they turn him.
 |As they start to pull him, his flesh tears off...like chicken skin. They get a better grip and pull him to one side. Yeah, it's terrible - every bit of liquid had been pouring from his anus for a couple of days...I still can't eat steak and broccoli with garlic because of how reminds me of that smell.
[I was really interested in reading this entire thread...opened it up and began reading this answer as I sipped back on my nutrient packed vegetable blended juice...  I cannot read no further...  Juice is going down the sink.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3gp7x?context=5)|Appropriate: [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/oKocbvx.gif) 
[Yep...that pretty much sums it up for me and this thread hahaha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3j7qz?context=5)|I laughed out loud when I read this.
[What was it like the first time you saw a dead body in person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca38l2i?context=5)|If you can remember any awkward scene when you were a teenager or young adult...when you had to get in front of class or were scared but had to act...it was kind of like that. Very tingly sensation, remembering that these folks depend on me doing my job right. This was before the wars REALLY kicked off...so death was still new to me, even in the active military.
 |It's very strange to be alive next to someone who will never breath again. Realizing that their friends will never talk to them again, their family will never hug them again.
 |I had to go spend some serious quality time with friends after that...just to wash that feeling away.
 |Edit: I'd like to add that I also felt guilty to be alive...for some reason.
[How accurate are tv shows when it comes to crime scene procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3739v?context=5)|Haha, they're pretty terrible. First thing - I'm usually the 2nd person called to the scene. For the most part, NO ONE is allowed in without me shooting the scene first. Military defense lawyers systems pick apart crime scenes, so they rely on me and my images/testimony to uphold prosecutorial items.
[Relevant to this, which tv shows/series do it best in your opinion? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3joqm?context=5)|I really can't think of a show that gets the photography right. I don't watch too much tv - so I'm only current on the happenings of Westeros and what rick is screwing up in Georgia.
 |I'll say one thing - that ""enhance"" word needs to go from every imagery scene. No one's designed an algorithm to fill in the blanks where pixels can no longer resolve.
[Yeah, umm...that's what I was afraid of. I'm going to to have to revisit this idea in another time of my life, like maybe in 20 years. Thanks for the reply!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3az4x?context=5)|No worries, dude. I have kids myself, you can't help but make the correlation and then your day is ruined. Best of luck!
[What's the scariest thing you've ever experienced as a military photojournalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39fvs?context=5)|I'd honestly have to say every convoy in Afghanistan was the scariest moment of my life. You never know which rock or piece of trash has your number hidden beneath.
 |Getting shot at isn't any fun, but at least then I was busy taking photos of the guys around me - so that took my mind off it.
 |Also, nice name.
[Do you have news hair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39mct?context=5)|[Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/e5hy15E.jpg)
[Do you have to take the crime scene photos so they are clear and useful for evidence, or can you take art shots? I'm asking due to your photojournalism background and an assumption on my part.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36h25?context=5)|Clear, sufficiently composed, sharp, and properly exposed. Yes, I do take artistic shots all the time - crime scene is just one of the many aspects of the job. I've photographed sporting events for all major sports, met celebrities, flown in dozens of aircraft, etc.
[Wow it sounds incredible, has there ever been a moment on those adventures when you stopped for a moment and just said to yourself, 'Dam I can't believe I'm here right now!' ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36ugg?context=5)|Yeah, man. Good question - just had memories pour over me.
 |I was in a valley, documenting an aircraft crash (class-a, loss of life, loss of aircraft) and stopped to take it all in. There are thousands of pieces of metal (and person) everywhere.
 |I'm climbing the side of the mountain, looking over the wreckage. At that moment my partner pops his smoke for help pickup. Out of nowhere this Blackhawk flies in like a bat out of hell and literally lands on the side of the mountain to pick me up. I'm now bugs eye, hanging out of the hurricane seat, snapping shots. Hundreds of people now look like ants, parts are still smoldering, fires being put out. I was like...damn...crazy times.
[Related question... say you were on site and took a few really beautiful , tastefully composed shots that would look really good in your portfolio (perhaps for employment after you get out\)...  what's the policy on copyright and ownership of those photos? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3u03d?context=5)|Good question. You can't make money using government equipment. You are entitled to keep any and all of your artistic imagery - as long as you don't sell them and they aren't sensitive in nature. My portfolio has many images from times when I was on scene at an accident.
 |Which brings up another thought - lots of idle time at crime scenes.
[I was one of my base's responders for a recovery team.  Thank you for making it possible for us to do our jobs, shitty as they may be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3kcyb?context=5)|Yeah man, I worked with a recovery team once or twice. You guys do the hard part, thanks for what you do. That made me remember something pretty cool.
 |When a jet crashes, I'd take photos of the wreckage - thousands of photos. A few years before cameras had gps, the investigators started assigning a civil engineer with a gps signal recorder to take a reading when/where I took a picture.
 |The team manually attached my photos to each tag and then entered into a program that showed where each peace came from, rewinding back in time before the crash happened.
[What ^is the most disgusting thing you've ever photographed/seen? Apologies if this has been asked before! :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca381no?context=5)|Any number of murder/suicide scenes come to mind.  If I HAD to pick one, I'd say that it was when a drunk kid punched his hand through a window in a door. It was one of those with the wire netting.  It got caught and somehow didn't sever an artery. So I show up and they've removed the window...which is still somehow attached. It's just eviscerated...like it had been in a blender. Bone, muscle, tendons...crazy, like out of a movie. He's sitting there saying, ""I fucked up, I fucked up...""
[What is the most grisly thing that you have ever seen in you job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36wdp?context=5)|Um...well, do you want IN YOUR FACE or mentally subdued?
[Well both I guess! You choose. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3a3e4?context=5)|I once had to take photos of a friend who had died. She was wearing a football jersey and underwear, sitting there down on the floor with her face on the toilet - alcohol poisoning. I had to kneel down next to her to and take a photo of her face before they moved her. Standard practice is to take a wide, medium, and close up shot of every single picture.
 |I kneel next to her, breathing erratically. I pull the camera up to shoot and I see her face through the viewfinder. She's dead, but her eyes are wide open. Staring at me. I still remember that...4 years later I remember the look on her face.
 |Edit: a letter.
[Wow. I'm sorry bro. That must have been awful. What do you do to try and forget things like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3by6i?context=5)|I actually had to go to counseling after that. I lost faith in the military support system at that point. We were being overworked, under rested, walked on and then punished for the slightest mistakes. I can compare this to a bout with depression - how does one get out of a hole that keeps getting deeper? Stop moving. Be still.
 |That very case made me come to terms with life and death. None of us are making it out of this journey alive...the sooner I figured that out the better.
[What the fuck. There wasn't another person that could have taken your position for times like this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3okge?context=5)|Yeah, frog and wodie - this actually doesn't happen too often, only once in my career. The thing is, I didn't know it was her until I was in her face. Then it was like time stopped and I was frozen there, staring at this dead girl who now had an identity. Didn't mean to set the story up like I knew it was her from the start, because I didn't.
 |Once I was there, however, I couldn't let myself back out. I was actually training a new photographer at the time - so losing my composure wasn't an option, for me at least.
[Sorry - I think we need a follow up question. You never found the guy?! Despite blood everywhere?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3o7kh?context=5)|Yeah man, you gotta think about the surrounding area. This single barracks has 100 rooms, and there are dozens of them in the immediate area. Also, since we were stateside, he/she could have got in his car and driven to a local hospital.
[You mentioned that you have to take three types of shot per framing (close, medium, and long\) - but do you apply standard 'photo' principles to taking shots?  Or is there a special type of photography that comes with the territory of crime scene documentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3cpjj?context=5)|Crime scene photography, for the most part, does NOT take photojournalistic principles into account. All I'm concerned with is proper lighting, focus, and overall clarity. You want to take a photo that you don't have to ""edit"" when you're done, as any editing has to be done in front of an investigator and well documented.  Our method is as follows: Walk into a room, take a picture at the entrance. Go to a corner of room one, take a wide shot (overall). Go to the other three corners and repeat. You now have a 360 view of the room.  Once you've taken your overalls, you document any and every item of interest. You take a new overall of this individual item, then a photo from about 3 feet away, then a photo as close as possible.

Then, fields merged and we became photojournalists. When that merge happened, we were known as PA.
[Im in the Air Force, photography is a huge hobby of mine, and if I had thought about my AFSC more, PA would have been something of interest. Hows its work with officer/enlisted and the standard PA (event planning/coordinaitng\) and deployed/action/plane photography?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca45f68?context=5)|PA is usually broken into these groups: Photojournalists Videographers/Broadcasters Community Relations Media Relations (sometimes just an additional duty) Command.
 |PA deploys quite often but, as I'm sure you know, the US is due to withdraw from Afghanistan next year. Deployment tempo is usually pretty high, but varies from base to base.
 |Officers usually take care of the strategic/crisis communications while the enlisted folks take care of day-to-day news and operations.

Top secret?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3emm1?context=5)|Sure bud. So...lets say you have a standard breaking and entering call. If that happens in a Secret/TS or Restricted Area, that ENTIRE scene is classified to match the level of the highest classified item.
 |Other times an actual piece of classified machinery/technology is damaged...that's now a classified photo shoot.
 |Yeah, standard clearances apply.
 |Quick thought: There was recently an uproar over how many people have TS clearance in America...it's quite large. Just so you know, just having a TS clearance doesn't give you access to ANYTHING beyond why your specific position requires the clearance. Basically, if you have a TS at your office in Alaska, and you want access to my Top Secret files about a crime in Florida - sorry. The phrase is called ""Need to know."" Even with appropriate clearance, you can't access information that you don't need to know.

If life is just energy, does that energy just dissipate or does it transfer to something or somewhere?
 |Existence is way too intricate to cease when the human body ceases to function.

I'm not the smallest of guys, so trying not to step in pools of blood, poo, broken glass, or other pieces of evidence was always a challenge. There are times, though, that it can't be avoided - you just take a picture before you enter the area to show how it was before you walked in.

Long story short, I got hired on and explicitly told how much I would be making an hour by the two people I work under and hired by. I stumbled across an email between my boss and the boss of the entire plant where my hourly rate is in question and after 50+ hours of work they might reduce my pay significantly due to a miscommunication and error on their part amongst themselves. 

I'm very put off by this and think its extremely unprofessional. My fellow classmates are making what I was supposed to be making in their respective internships and its essentially the going rate. I had other internship opportunities I turned down that I would not have knowing that they were going to pinch pennies and not pay what I feel is appropriate.

The dilemma is that I signed a summer lease of 3 months in the area that I will not be able to get out of. 

I'm looking for advice on how I should approach this when inevitably they approach me in the morning. I badly want to tell them I don't feel the compensation is appropriate and how underhanded it is to change the rate AFTER I got hired and started the job. 

Right now I think my best bet is to suck it up and finish out the summer and if a job offer is included (which is very likely) to tell them to politely shove it. It just feels wrong and distasteful. I have been highly motivated on the job these past few weeks and I know there will be a negative effect on my performance due to this shiesty behavior.  

Other option I've been thinking of the possibility of is to tell them that since we are changing my hourly I'd like my hours reduced as well. This accomplishes me  1) still getting credit hours with my university for the internship, 2) Still being able to put it on a resume, and 3) Being able to actually enjoy my summer not locked up in a place that's screwing me over.  I don't know how it would go over to tell them I want minimal hours but it's an idea im playing with.

I am a current junior going into my senior year and have had several interviews over the past month or so for internships. I have not gotten a single call back. I have no relevant experience as of now.

During the tech interview section I usually do extremely well, with several of the tech interviews having follow up questions that go beyond what is expected. During the 'behavioral' portion I also feel I do well, and am generally enthusiastic and try to make sure my passion for compsci shows.

I have felt all of the interviews have gone well (except for one), but have not gotten a single call back. What could I be doing wrong? When asked for feedback I either get no response or some canned HR drivel (""We felt you were a strong candidate but decided to go with someone else""...etc...). 

I am well groomed, no B/O or other such problems, show up early to interviews, and am well dressed. I am also decently sociable and by the end of a few tech interviews we are very friendly with each other talking some random CS topic or another (once the 'tech' questions are out of the way of course). 

When asked if I have any questions I of course do ask several, and I do some research about each company prior to be able to ask relevant questions.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

1evrmz,0,2013-05-22,Going back for associates (for multiple reasons). Stupid idea?,gyrrdo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1evrmz/going_back_for_associates_for_multiple_reasons/,"Here's the deal..

**How I f-cked up:**

* Graduated with my bachelor's in advertising, but opted to pursue a career in my hobby: graphic design.

**My situation now:**

* 2.5 years of experience as a 'graphic designer', multiple paid internships and freelance work.

* Severly underemployed. Hell, I might as well be unemployed. 

* Can't even get a retail job or work at Starbucks to save my life. The last time I landed a retail job, it was only part time for $10/hr which covered nothing but my travel expenses TO that job.

* Drowning in debt. $65k student loans/medical bills ($34k of which are private loans. They are killing me as they cannot be deferred like the federal ones.) I've exhausted my savings and used up all my forbearance time on them, except the federal loans.

**Why am I going back?**

* My portfolio sucks. All of my internship experience has been in production roles, churning out templates and correcting horrible existing designs. After doing this for so long, I feel my creativity has been killed. I hardly create anything good these days.

* While I am able to get small jobs from local businesses, my ability to work full-time at a great agency or get better paying clients is limited by my current skill level (and horrible portfolio)

* I need to get my private lenders off my back for a little bit.

**Two ideas:**

* Go back for a A.S. degree in graphic design - Only because I already have the experience, but need solid training and work to fill my portfolio. The CC I'm applying to has a required co-op program that places students in corporations during their studies. Considering I already have my bachelor's, I would only be in for about a year. I figure this route would get me closer to landing a stable job to pay my bills.

-or-

* Go back for a A.S. degree in computer science - I'm interested in web development, but I'm wary of throwing away my design experience. However, there are many corporations around here that have large IT departments. There is also a co-op program for this degree as well.

**Which of the two seems more practical? Or are they both foolish?**

Currently, I commute an hour and 15 minutes to my job that I got when I graduated. I make $45,000 salary at the moment, been there since January. At the time I accepted, money was a big issue that motivated me to take the position before applying to a large number of places. I don't want to sound ungrateful, because I know there are a lot of graduates looking for work. I feel like I'm underpaid as I can barely find a decent apartment and pay all my bills with what I'm making. The commute is terrible and I feel like I'm stuck. However, I'm doing well and everyone's happy with my performance. I like what I do and the people I work with, but I don't see a raise happening anytime soon as it's a smaller company. I don't want to appear to be a job hopper either. If anyone has advice or similar experience I would like to hear from you."

Reddit, what are your biggest pros and cons when it comes to adult life?",acrophobicapatosaur,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1evghg/just_started_working_74_and_my_quick_dose_of/,"It is a summer internship, and it has only been my first week, so I know it will get better, but regardless, the concept of being at work for 9 hours every day is freaking me out a bit. I feel like I have drastically less free time, especially since waking up early means I have to go to bed early, meaning I cant make up for ""lost"" time by staying up late.

This makes me worried because it has left me with the idea that as an adult I will not have as much time to do the fun things I currently do in my typical 20-year-old college student life, and as a result, will become unhappy. I fear that my life will turn into one giant routine and that I will end up feeling like the cliched corporate slave (think when Mr Incredible works at his day job). I try to find comfort in telling myself that once I grow up, all of my friends will be doing the same thing, so even if I could keep up my current lifestyle I would just become bored since I would have no one to hang out with. Then I tell myself that if Im going to be bored, I might as well be making money while Im bored. I understand that I have not gotten used to this lifestyle yet since I have only been a part of it for 3 days, but I am still very worried and would really appreciate some insight from you guys.



**What I mainly want to know are three things:**

1. What is the best part about being an adult?

2. What is the worst part about being an adult?

3. What do you do in your day-to-day life to combat #2?"
1ezoye,24,2013-05-24,Talkeetna,Chalqk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ezoye/talkeetna/,"Each passing minute felt like a pendulum passing slowly back and forth over my body. The air was icy and thick with snow. My heart still is racing just thinking about it. Emptiness. Everything is empty. But let me take you back to where it all made sense still.

December 17th, I've got a one way ticket to Alaska. Looking back I didn't know what I expected to look at more than snow. I hate the snow. I hated it then too but a job was a job, and I needed the money more than ever. A couple months back I had been offered a paid internship to work in Alaska at a hotel and work the front desk. Everything was paid for so I thought, ""What the hell."" and jumped on board the idea.

The plane ride there wasn't anything amazing. Minor turbulence here and there, but nothing too exciting.  Although I did have my doubts as soon as I got on that plane. We landed some time after midnight and the snow was six feet high; I didn't have an easy time finding the hotel. 

Now the hotel itself was privately owned and located just about 40 minutes north of Talkeetna. Now By the time my cab was in Talkeetna, I was beging to doze off but an eeriness crept on me like a poison. As I looked around, i saw nothing but darkness enveloping snow. The only word to describe this place was empty.

I arrived at the hotel around 4:00 am. I walked to the front desk with all my bags to only be greeted again by the feeling of emptiness. Everything was silent. Everything was also dark except for a single light over the front desk. There was no difference between here and outside. The cold was the same. 

After what seemed like two hours I began to snoop looking for someone only to find a man asleep in a manager's booth. It was the manager; his name-tag read, ""Randoll-Manager"". He looked something of about 50 years old, and pale as the snow. I knocked on the door but he did not stir. I opened the door, quietly calling his name but he did not awake. Finally I shook him lightly and he seemed to be coming to. Once I woke him up, he just stared at me with this revolted expression that made him look angrily concerned. 

""I'm the intern. I was told I'd be greeted and taken to my employee room in the last e-mail I got from here."" I spoke softly. His face slowly was beging to calm but his silence was giving me chills. 

""Fine, fine. Yes, come with me."" He seemed to be at a loss of words. He escorted me to my room; the room i would stay in for the next several months but he remained silent for the remainder of the trip. Finally i got into my room and Randoll just disappeared. I thought nothing of it and went right to bed.

The next morning was as cold as the night but the light was comforting. Now this hotel was beautiful, like an actual ski lodge, but much bigger. The views were breath-taking but in the first couple days there was a snowstorm. We didn't get a lot of service the first couple weeks because of the continuous snowstorm, but I was still being paid so I was content. Randoll hardly ever appeared around the hotel and it seemed like it was only him and I on staff. Occasionally people would leave their rooms for the day and come back later that night, or a service man would show up for an hour or two. But other than that this hotel was dead.  

It was in the last week of my first month (January 20th) that things started to change. People checked out, but they never came back. The service men stopped coming and i started seeing less and less of anyone at all. It was just Randoll and I. Alone. Now I got the weekends off but there was really nothing to do with a snow storm around. The food was all packaged for the employees for times like this so we were fine. I wasn't worried at all about the people not coming anymore, it just left me bored with nothing to do at the front desk. 

What started to worry me was that i stopped seeing Randoll as often and he and I never talked. I would just get a check under my door every two weeks. When i stopped getting my checks and Randoll stopped showing up anywhere at all, I was concerned. 

I began to look around again for anyone, or anything like a phone I could use. Even when I found one i didn't know who to call. I kept working, but always looking. About another two weeks went by and there were no signs of anyone in the hotel at all. I had practically memorized this hotel. 

Slowly, things started to seem a little colder and a little darker each day. Once I had missed two paychecks in a row, I decided that I would stop working and find Randoll. I looked EVERYWHERE for that man, but he seemed to always evade me, if he was even there at all. 

I did start to find things though. Subtle, odd things that barely caught my attention like a bike randomly in the lodge. But no this bike was covered in ice. It made no sense, but it gave me hope of finding Randoll after all. The snowstorm began to intensify and there was a low whistle everywhere in the hotel from the wind outside. 

Even once i could have sworn I saw Randoll walking at the other end of the hall then turning into another hall. But when I turned the other hall, there was nothing but an ice born draft on me. That cold draft never left me that day. 

Another couple days passed until I could literally stand it no more. I was going to pack my bags and leave before I got snowed in. It was around 8:00 pm so the sun was still up. Walking to my room I noticed something strange. A door was open. And I heard riffling. I began to approach the open door with caution. It wasn't the smartest idea, but I began to call out. 

""Hey, is anyone there?"" The riffling stopped. ""Hey!"" I began to run to the open door. Without warning a high pitched whine began to sound. I covered my ears and stopped in my tracks. What I saw emerge from the door ever so calmly was a tall (maybe 7 feet) albino human looking creature hunching over another human body. The creature's eyes pierced my mind and snared me. I vomited from the stench and the sheer terror of the beast and began to feel weak and ill. As I began to step slowly backwards. So too did the monster com forwards. 

The light passed over the creature in segments at a time. I had the nerve to run as fast as I could but not the will power. I caught another glimpse of the body the creature was dragging along. Randoll no doubt. I didn't know where else to go but in my room. I vomited again this time being more stomach acid than food. I began packing everything I had brought, while trying to think of a way to leave without crossing paths with it again. I could hear it inching forward a short ways down the hall. 

Every time I thought of it's image I gagged. Once I had everything ready to go in a makeshift packing effort I stood silent to listen. I could hear the creature no more. I waited then for about an hour before I mustered the courage to open my door. My hands were sweaty and shaky and my head was pounding from a headache. I opened my door so silently I even shocked myself. Not long after I poked my head out to check down the hall. Nothing, as usual. The blood on the floor carried on down the hall. It must have been from Randoll. 

I began making my slow and steady escape from this horrific hotel. Once I was out of the hall and into the main entry I felt better. Although I did see the manager room door open. In my better judgement I wouldn't have checked, but a small part of me BEGGED to know why.

I walked over to the manager's room where I showed my flashlight. It made me jump when I saw it, but i immediately felt sorrow. Randoll's lifeless body stared down to the floor. Right. Into. My. Soul. I didn't know him well, or at all for that matter, but he was just a confused old man after all. He still had that stare he always had.

I left and never went back. I don't think I'll ever go back to any places with snow now. They all feel empty."

My original plan was basically get my BS Accy/IT in 2014 and do MS Accountancy for my CPA and ultimately graduate in 2015.

However, all my plans have been thrown to the whirlwind the past couple of years as I have slowly discovered that I love CS and don't really like Accounting (even though I'd say I'm good at it.) So right now, my options are to change my degree altogether, abandon Accounting and stay an extra year to get only BS in CS by 2015 or I could get that Accounting and IS/IT degree, and pursue a professional masters degree in CS and graduate in 2015. 

I have taken the requisite of CS and Math courses to get into the M.C.S program at my university, so I should be fine in that respect. I am also currently doing a CS internship this summer. I am just really confused which option to go by - especially because I know I want a career in CS (either software engineering or databases/data mining), and I don't know if my business background will hold me back from other candidates if I do decide to go with Masters.

Cost wise and time wise, there is not much difference as I was always planning to stay till 2015. I'm just confused about which option would be the best career-wise. Any advice... is there any other alternative that I haven't considered?"

So I am in college and got a raise at my internship so I figured I would celebrate with a little upgrade in the price range of $150-200.  

I was thinking about one of the following:

* adding a second monitor
* adding a second GPU
* downsizing because I am back and forth from college and my case is massive.  I only really move it during winter break and for the summers though so it isn't a huge deal.  

And suggestions on what to upgrade even if it isn't on that short list?  Thanks"

Academically, I'm doing great (4.0), double majoring in Math/CS with a minor in Econ.

-I came in with AP credit, got to some mid-upper level courses, and am involved in research with a professor as well (CS prof).  I've done lab internships since HS, and I'm very sure I'd like to go to gradschool and become a researcher.

- Overall, I don't feel satisfied with my school beyond doing 'well' there. I'm happy with my grades, work, etc. but the overall educational expereince isn't what I wanted. I'm not too fond of the atmosphere or size either. Due to this, I've thought of transferring to an overall better school (my school has a strong CS dept, ok math dept, and very weak econ dept). The schools I want to transfer to will have equal CS department strength, and better math/econ departments.

- If I transfer, which would be as a junior, and leave my current instituion- I'd have to ultimately find a new prof to work with. Does having breaks/working with different people matter? I have an REU for this summer, and I'll probably try one for the next. Is research experience in general more important than whatever specific projects you have worked on (as long as they're fairly relevant).

- I'm split on whether I want to go to grad school for Econ or CS. I enjoy both subjects. At my current school, there's research going in CS that I like, but the Econ department isn't doing work in the areas I'm interested in. If I transfer, I could work in areas of Econ I enjoy, and even I end up not enjoying Econ work, I could still continue work in CS areas I'm interested in (which is at all the schools I'm interested in transferring too).

- Ultimately, down the road I may regret not transferring. I have this feeling at the back of my head that I could've gone to a better undergrad. I don't know if this will be bad for grad admissions since I'd sort of have to start over at a new school, though by then I'd have almost 4 years of lab/intern research experience in total. In either case, transfer or not, I'll still focus on gaining skills.

I decided to move back to my parent's home, borrow money from them, and use it to get a CS degree (and hopefully a programming job). Unfortunately, my work history is utter shit: throughout high school and college, I only worked a couple of unimpressive jobs, and only a few months at each. I did not find a job after the B.A, and moved home just a few months later.

 While I would prefer to spend all of my waking hours outside of school programming, in the hopes of building a good portfolio and impressing internship recruiters (and because it's FUN!), I wonder if I'm just setting myself up for disaster by not working. I worry that I am becoming (or already am) unemployable.

I finally landed an offer on craigslist. However, the pay was for a lowly 11 dollars an hour non negotiable and she offered me the job right away after the interview, which led me to believe that it was probably a high turnover job (benefits after 90 days, but I have to pay part of the health/vision/dental and no vacation 1st year).  But I decided to take it because I'm guessing one of the most important things hurting me was a lack of experience (had no prior internship experience specifically in my career field). Anyways, I go in first day this Monday and they just throw everything at me. They expect me to know the whole process and system right away. My boss explains the whole process in 20 minutes in general terms and he expects me to know all the details. There literally is only a 30 minute training session on the software when I come in the first day and that's it. My boss keeps on making remarks on why I don't get stuff, but he never fully explains what I'm supposed to do. I could tell he is also stressed because the entire department is so behind on everything and they are missing deadlines. So they are shoving stuff into me without explaining stuff and expect it to get done. They are so unorganized in their process. Lastly, you can tell the department is low on morale. None of the employees in my department seem to care about each other. They work, they go home. No small talk, nothing. Their pay is as low as mine, and one of my co-workers just quit literally the 2nd day I came in. Never showed up again. Didn't even call them. The supervisor called her and asked her and she just said that she quit. I'm really not exactly sure what I should do r/jobs. I have to keep the job for the experience, but I'm already looking for ways out. When can I start applying for new jobs? Is it way too soon? Will employers look bad upon that? If I leave in like 3 months, will my supervisor give me a horrible recommendation, thus making this job experience essentially useless?"

I started taking UCB classes and meeting people and basically begging to intern at places. I interned at HuffPo, Late Night W/ Jimmy Fallon, and The Onion. The Onion hired me, which was nice of them. Then they moved the company to chicago and I was out of a job so I made [a web series](http://www.youtube.com/user/untitledwebseries). That web series got me agents and a manager. Through them I submitted packets to a bunch of different shows and this one finally stuck. My advice: make the things. I worked on the tv periphery for a long time and no one thought of me as a creative until I made a thing. 
[Thanks! Appreciate the answers; gives me a little bit of hope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca58l6y?context=5)|You should have hope! it's not impossible. 
[Can you talk more about getting agents and a manager? Where do you even begin, once you have work to show for yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca59we5?context=5)|Definitely. This is just how I did it but there's a lot of ways.
 |I made two short films which kind of got the UCB scene here in NY to think of me as a director. I started getting emails to direct web series' for people and I did a lot of that. I did an episode of ""Broad City"" and got hooked up with those girls (who are amazing people) and they recommended I meet with their manager. I did, and her and I hit it off really well. I had scripts and stuff ready to go in the event I was ever going to be contacted so I had a quick turnaround in terms of my writing samples. After my web series came out, my manager was contacted by agents who wanted to meet me. I went to LA to meet with people and see who was a good fit agent-wise. I'm really happy with my reps. The thing is, it sometimes seems really futile and hard to get noticed by these guys, but if you're generating a lot of content people seem to connect with and like, it will get seen. I can't really emphasize that enough. These agencies have whole departments dedicated to watching YouTube videos and stuff. They sign dogs for christsake! Just keep plugging along, say yes to every opportunity, make stuff you're proud of, and promote the shit out of it. It will get seen. Can't emphasize that enough. I was just a guy who made a web series that someone at ICM saw.
 |Another important thing to remember is to have stuff. Like, if you wanna be a writer, have your specs written. Have a feature written that's in a really good place. If you get a meeting with an agency or studio because you made a killer web video they're going to want to know you can do other stuff and are prepared. You gotta have stuff to give them. 
[Hi, Morgan. How many tens of people watch VH1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca5825x?context=5)|By our count 1 ten of people 
[I have a hard time disclosing to people that I want to pursue comedic writing in a professional sense. People tend to scoff or think I'm delusional. This also may stem from the fact that I really disallow people to see that I am serious about it - it's sort of an insecure sore spot for me. I know that's something you eventually grow out of. I was wondering if you guys experienced similar feelings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca5c1ce?context=5)|I mean- It's not like you're telling people you want to blow dogs for a living, you know? If people don't support you, you know, fuck 'em. There's no room for that. You should be surrounding yourself with people who believe in you and think you're capable of anything. Whether it's comedy writing or whatever. I think if you surround yourself with supportive, like minded people you'll feel less insecure about saying ""I want to be a comedy writer."" It's not ridiculous you want to do this. There's a lot of rejection but if you really want it and you're willing to do anything to make it happen you'll figure it out.

On one hand I wouldn't have been able to move from Arizona and live in New York without school and the loans and stuff. On the other hand I was paying 600.00 a semester for a ""comedy writing"" class when you could go to UCB and spend 375.00 for one taught by an SNL writer. I dropped out to take this job. I didn't really make connections in school. Most of my connections came from UCB, but I wouldn't have been here without college. I would say it is not a bad idea to go to film school if you can end up in LA or NY because of it.

Not yesterday, not last week even, but on this day precisely one year ago. However, I can still feel (or rather *not* feel) the consequences of it today, so I feel this post is somewhat justified.


To provide a little background: I had been on an internship in Paris for the past three months and everything was going absolutely swell. I made some great friends, professionally things couldn’t be better and overall I had a blast spending time abroad alone for the first time in my life. Being in Paris just added to that experience. To quote my man Ernest: 
“If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.” Anyway, I digress. 


The residence I stayed at had its own little gym so I had been working out religiously during my time there. I was really getting into shape and becoming stronger. Of course, with added power comes added cockiness so when a friend challenged me to a game of arm-wrestling one lovely Saturday night I immediately accepted, gloating about his incumbent demise.


*I got this.*


Turns out, I didn’t. We had been going at it for a good 30 seconds and I was at a small advantage but this dude was still not giving in. Apparently, slightly inebriated Germans are rather strong. Me being extremely sober thought that I could maybe wear him out enough so that he would just give up. This didn’t seem to work and I tried to give it one last push with all my measly strength.


Then it happened. CRACK. THUD. ARGH.  My arm loudly banged against the table, in the opposite direction mind you. I didn’t realize what just had happened but my body sure as hell did. I couldn’t control myself and started yelling incoherent sounds, all the while breathing very loudly. The pain was very intense but started numbing down quickly when I sat down again. Whenever I tried moving my arm, it started twitching. Honestly I just thought I had torn a muscle or something.


An ambulance was called in and I was soon rushed to hospital. I was checked in and told to wait. Overall I had to wait for 4 hours in the ER which wasn’t the most pleasant of experiences. (During that time I saw a guy with a beret strapped to a stretcher trying to fight two nurses because they called him monsieur while he’d rather be called madame. Aah, Paris, comme je vous adore)


Anyway, when someone finally came to see what kind of dire straits I had gotten myself into, they just started berating me. I was a blithering idiot for arm-wrestling, I had been the third guy that month with the same injuries (didn’t even know you could break your arm while arm-wrestling, let alone that this wasn’t a very rare freak accident). In the meantime, my arm had swollen to Schwarzenegger proportions and the guy examining me asked if I was on steroids. No thanks, I wasn’t. He told me I had broken my humerus and that I needed surgery asap. Great.


The next morning I had surgery and the surgeon came to me afterwards and said everything had gone over smoothly and that I should be as good as new in a few weeks. However, I still couldn’t move my arm after two weeks and the doctors concluded that they probably had severed a nerve. (Maybe the surgeon can post a TIFU from his perspective)


Long story short, my wrist and fingers were paralyzed for 7 months and only in the last few months have I been making progress. I still have a pretty bad-ass scar and a few insensitive spots on my arm to make me remember my fuck up.

**TL;DR: don’t arm-wrestle guys, it’s not worth it.**

[What's a typical must-have in high-end real estate? For example in the suburbs it's a fenced yard for the kids, or a basement for tools, entertainment room, things like that.  What's the strangest must-have requirement you've encountered?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Views. Views, views, views. Central Park, if you're particular. That can make the value 150% of the same apartment that doesnt face the park.
[What's the nicest place you've been inside, and why was it nice?  What I'm thinking of is a place like in the movie *A Perfect Murder*, huge kitchen and a balcony, or *The Thomas Crown Affair* with the gorgeous foyer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|A couple of penthouses in Tribeca are the most notable as of late. The penthouses at the Laureate on 75th and Broadway are amazing.
[On the flip side have you ever been inside a richly renovated place and just facepalmed at the owner's sense of architecture?  What was that like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|YES. Sometimes the renovations are for the current owners and the current owners only, so much that even in mint condition, it's a gut job. It runs the gamut...
[Given the nature of NYC real estate, does it obey any market law?   It's chaos when you're dealing with that kind of money, no? Like, how much do you want something, as opposed to what is the intrinsic worth.  How can you even begin to price anything?  Are comps all over the place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Au contraire. The stock-ticker like nature of the market, and the number of trades make it much easier to establish a value, spot trends, analyze them and apply all sorts of other metrics (check THIS out: [Link to www.millersamuel.com](http://www.millersamuel.com/browse-all-charts))
[What's another international city on par with or outstripping NYC in terms of stratospheric real estate price?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|New York is by no means the record-setter worldwide. Hong Kong is nearly 3x NYC, Tokyo 2x, London and Paris are almost peers, but London is setting some records at present.
[I glance at some NYC real estate reality TV sometimes (just glance at, I swear!\)  Those characters come off as horrible, shallow, pretentious, but very beautiful people.  Is that anything close to real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Sometimes. It's all about how you present. I consider ""the look"" giving the least number of reasons to object to you. I don't wear cologne, because I'd rather have no smell than one that someone finds unpleasant. I always wear a suit, because no one will really judge you for wearing a suit, but jeans and a blazer, you may be underdressed. You have to look like you're put together enough to handle millions of someone's dollars. If you can't brush your teeth and comb your hair...but then, there is a contingent of showiness.
[Most important: How abundant and glossy are your tresses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Most importantly, more glossy than abundant lately...to the chagrin of my Propecia regimen.
[Given the exorbitant price of NYC real estate, and the type of people and the professions that can afford it, do you think eventually the ""normal"" people and professions would be priced completely out of the market there, creating what will be an essentially a segregated Huxleyan society?  Do you think that's bad or not impactful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|A reasonable point, and it is happening. That's why we're seeing the gentrification of Harlem, the building boom in Long Island City, Brooklyn (Park Slope and Williamsburg ESPECIALLY), and even these places are trading at very near Manhattan prices. While it's not the healthiest for society (IMHO), I'm not sure what else can be done to control it. There are incentives for developers to include affordable housing contingents and the like, but that can be counterproductive for the developer. There are proposals by Christine Quinn to add large amounts of affordable housing, but I'm not enough of an economist to consider the long term effects of either.
[What do you see as the main differences between this and being a more normal financial range realtor? And for the clients? Do you see any changes with increased online services (either as competition, or as enhancements that you use/offer your clients\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6a7zy?context=5)|I actually started have worked very successfully in both markets.
 |The biggest difference is the role that you play, where in the ""typical"" market, you are more of a ""friend"", invited over for dinner, housewarming parties, and the hokey balloons on the yard sign open house works. Also, without implying that people are not smart, in the typical market, your clients are more blue-collar and look to you for ALL types of business advice. In the market where you're dealing with people who are plunking down $10-20 million in cash, you're merely a service provider/assistant, and generally to amass that kind of money (trust fund kids aside), the client is much smarter than I am.
 |Functioning in the multi-million dollar range, you are at once a concierge, investment adviser, marketer, negotiator, personal assistant. It takes a level of humility to be simultaneously very successful and simultaneously give firm opinions while remaining somewhat subservient. It's takes finesse to balance it all with 20,000 competitors fighting for under 10,000 sales per year.
 |There has been a HUGE change in the role you play in light of the availability of information. New York real estate trades like a stock. The world's eyes are on it, and if there's a good buy, there's an ask, and from somewhere in the world, there will be a bid. The values fluctuate (e.g. up +/-26% since January) so much that you have to talk people out of considering what someone paid for an apartment 3 years ago. The price of AAPL today is completely independent of the price 3 years ago, and NYC real estate is the same. The inventory is finite, as it's a relatively small rock, so it's very supply and demand driven.
 |Suburban markets are much different, as there aren't organized bus trips to, say, Tacoma, Washington, for wealthy BRIC country investors to go property shopping. New York is one of very few markets that operate completely outside of a vacuum.
[Well written.  Just curious, what made you use Tacoma, WA as an example?  That's where I'm from and I was just wondering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6mw9m?context=5)|Completely and utterly pulled out of thin air.
[I don't follow the appeal of NYC to the international set. Obviously a place to do business. And cultural institutions in Manhattan. Do those who buy high end apartments ever leave Manhattan? Where do they go other than JFK? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6aig5?context=5)|The international set is what drives the New York market to the values they're at, consider that the area of a sheet of paper laid on the floor of a middle high-end building is valued at about $1,000.
 |New York is arguably the business and fashion capital of the world, moving up in the tech sector, still active in entertainment, although secondary to LA.
 |It's a place to park hard assets in a relatively safe and historically appreciating market, but most importantly is inventory. Manhattan is a rock, and there is practically no undeveloped land south of 96th Street (""Prime"" Manhattan), so to add inventory you've got to remove inventory (commercial or residential). The market will never be saturated with inventory in such a way that the supply far exceeds the demand...in theory. It's also a well branded commodity.
 |And, then, of course, sometimes it just feels cool for a Japanese businessman to say he has an apartment Trump ___ amongst his friends.

I'm lucky enough to deal in the high end, but the ""low end"" is my day-to-day for sure.
 |But, general suggestions for the good of the gander, do have a broker. You can sometimes negotiate directly with the listing broker, but the relationship the listing broker has with their clients transcends yours, and you'll never actually know if the discount you got was a break in the brokerage fee.
 |Decide whether light and views are more important than space, as these are the two things that will focus your search, and what you're actually paying for.
 |The price you pay to live in Manhattan, in my opinion, is for convenience, so if you're moving for work, move fairly close to work. I can't fathom being an owner of an apartment in NYC and still having a 45-minute commute.
 |Get pre-qualified for a mortgage in advance. Have a letter indicating that. The market is so fast right now from the sell off at the end of 2012 that you've got to be prepared to look and decide quick. If you love the first one you see, make an offer. Negotiate. Immediately look at 5 more apartments to ensure you're comfortable. If you still feel the same way about the first, go to town. If not, keep going.

 |These mega-listings were all precipitated by the $88 million sale at 15 Central Park West.
 |If the penthouse is worth $125 million, what's the floor below it worth? $100 million? and the floor below, and so on.
 |If it does, it will likely be an overseas buyer, and it will be a purchase that has nothing to do with value (there is nothing functionally that you couldn't get for $5-10 million in another building), but mostly ego.

If they're equally motivated, there's some room. If the seller is too opportunistic, and the buyer isn't in love, or just wants room on price to get room on price, it'll stagnate.

In the event that I get an offer, I'm considering taking a leave of absence from my school for 1-3 years to begin working full-time immediately. I only have a year left, but I'm growing really tired of college and I feel like I would be learning a lot more working at Microsoft (about programming and about life) than I would be learning in school. I also feel like all that real experience will help me get a lot more out of my classes when I return to school. And although I realize the inclusion of this fact muddies the waters a lot, I have to say it, because it's a huge part of my motivation: I'm having a lot of trouble getting over an anxiety disorder that is a big issue at school but won't be an issue at work. It has an enormously deleterious effect on my productivity and well-being, and I need more time to sort it out (I'm talking to a therapist, and I'll continue to talk to him on Skype).

My question is, could this decision come back to bite me in any way? How will a prospective future employer react to the fact that I left school with only a year left in order to work for a while?

2. Research opportunity for ""students interested in wearable computing"" (Google Glass, Nike Fuel Band, etc.) that lasts 9 months followed by a 3 month summer internship

Both have about the same hours and the pay is similar (within $5/hour of each other).

Pros for #1:

* Great for networking even though I do not plan on going into academia
* Good rep in the department for future research opportunities

Pros for #2:

* 3 month internship at the end of the 2013-14 school year - this is not a big factor to me as I have internships for next summer covered if I do not choose this program. I haven't been told where the internship is at, but my money is on Texas Instruments because they are funding the research project.
* 9 months of part time work on my resume

I am leaning towards option #1 since I like the head of the department, but #2 sounds like a more fun and interesting experience if the internship at the end of it was optional. Any ideas for what might look better on a resume?

1f5ypl,0,2013-05-27,Recreational drug use,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1f5ypl/recreational_drug_use/,"Hi all, I'm starting a new software engineering internship in about a month and I am becoming increasingly worried about the possibility of a drug test during my first day on the job. I smoke marijuana pretty regularly (~2-3 times a week, if I have nothing going on), and I know that I would test positive if I were to submit to a drug test. I do not consider myself to be addicted, I feel that I can stop as soon as I hear a firm ""yes, we do test for drug use in the industry"". In other words, I am more than willing to cease any/all drug use if it turns out that I need to. I really do care about this job, it's in a field that I am interested in and it would be incredibly foolish to miss this opportunity due to something other than my ability as a software engineer.

So, my question is this: how prevalent is drug testing in software engineering? Is this something that I need to plan for? Or is it not really an issue?

Any commentary would be appreciated. A little background: this job would be in Texas, though the company is a prominent one and is based in SV. I do not know whether location makes a difference here."

[What are some of the worst/weirdest situations you were involved in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u4gn?context=5)|I have had people working at the Ministry of Education ask me for bribes. I have seen ministers embezzle funds. My life has been threatened twice. The first organisation I had worked with had asked me to allocate certain funds designated to the purchase of ringers lactate (necessary for cholera treatment) to a supplier that was across the globe instead of in the US because the transportation costs would have been higher and we could say more money was spent that way.
 |The weirdest situation I ever found myself was probably when being invited to a meeting at a restaurant at night. The restaurant was bursting with music, imported steaks, tons of alcohol. Meanwhile, across the street from the restaurant was an IDP camp. This was during cholera too, so as you left the restaurant you could actually hear the moans of people who were being treated at the cholera treatment centre nearby. It was surreal.
[ of all, thank you for your work. You have clearly affected many lives in a positive way. How has it affected your life being down there for so long and witnessing so many things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6ufql?context=5)|Thank you for your kind remarks.
 |It is depressing work. For a long time I would drink myself to sleep. For a month or two I was punching the wall next to my bed in my sleep as well. It is crazy, I think many people see those who are in my line of work not as human beings. There are always negative comments about how aid workers whore, drink, and do drugs. How they have loud parties while people are starving/dying/suffering and how they go on wonderful holidays and generally seem to be having a good time. I would have to say that we are all human beings. Doing some of these things is in some cases the only way to cope. One cannot be in constant despair, and in fact, that is exactly one of the reasons we choose to do this work, to get people out of constant despair. We cannot do good work if we are constantly thinking of horror. So what happens? We become desensitised, we drink a lot, we smoke a lot, we may become belligerent, whatever.
 |With me, I lost my girlfriend after a few months of being here. I had trouble following conversations. I could not sleep unless I had a drink in me. I hated this place for a long time, and maybe I still do. But things are better with me now. In part I have gotten used to it (desensitised it enough), and in part I have changed my surroundings.
 |I do, however, think that seeing a therapist after I leave here will probably do me a world of good.
[I understand the whole avoiding despair, but as someone that has had many friends in deployed locations, there's more you can do just coping with one another than drink, smoke, and party. I am afraid to visit most other countries because of the bad reputation people have given of english-speaking people. Do we need to send out a humanitarian effort for the humanitarian effort now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v5ut?context=5)|Hahaha,
 |That's a funny thought. I agree there are other ways to cope. Drink, smoke and party are usually cheaper, easier, and less time-consuming. 
[What's your perspective on the long-term aid work going on there? Lots of teams went down short-term, but it's interesting that you stayed. How, if at all, has your perspective pertaining to Haiti's needs changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u2wj?context=5)|There were tons of organisations coming in in 2010. At one point the Ministry of Interior was saying that about 4000 different organisations (NGOs, church groups, international businesses, etc.) were working in the country. The immediate response was therefore very hectic. There was very little organisation. The UN held (and still holds) what they called ""cluster meetings"". These thematic meetings tried to coordinate the various activities of all the different actors (so there'd be an education cluster, a shelter cluster, a WASH cluster, etc). Unfortunately many of the smaller NGOs would not participate, making true coordination efforts impossible. You would have large NGOs such as Samaritan's Purse or Save the Children trying to build schools with the coordination and ""assistance"" of the Ministry of Education, but then some church group from Kansas would come in and would build a school in the areas where the large organisations were meaning to work, thus ruining projects that would probably have had a larger impact and would be managed better.
 |Tons of money was thrown away in this way. There was also lots of corruption and profiteering. Port-au-Prince, for example, became one of the most expensive cities in the world. Materials for construction, medication, essentially anything that was needed to carry out projects was so expensive that the money allocated for certain activities was barely enough to achieve what had initially been planned out. The opposite thing would also happen, some organisations were unlucky enough to receive far more money than they could spend, and so tried to get rid of it in any way they could, consciously making bad investments, making little effort to protect their warehouses and doing anything when things were stolen, thus forcing them to spend more money buying the material that was stolen. That sort of thing.
 |There are all sorts of beautiful, wonderful strategies for development in Haiti. They have been drafted using money from all sorts of organisations and countries and they make for nice meeting platforms. They are essentially useless, though. Very little effort has been taken to make coordinated moves towards developments. Most of the action from government, NGOs, UN, and the other different actors has been uncoordinated and disorderly. You can think of it as a school children. They will all acts as ""friends"" make wonderful plans to work together, publish amazing reports with distorted figures about the achievements that have been done, while at the same time stabbing each other's backs and wanting to take as much credit as possible for the small positive outcomes. Thus the government claims that the building of 200 new schools in 6 months was their achievement, the UN will say that these same 200 schools could not have been built without the aid of the MINUSTAH (Mission des Nations Unis pour la Stabilisation d'Haiti - peacekeepers), the European Union will say that they put in the money and have therefore contributed to Haiti's education, and meanwhile there are no desks or chairs at the school or, as I've seen it, the owners of the land where the school has been built have decided to make some changes to the building and turn it into a private residence.
 |The chaos was evident since I arrived, but I had hope that it would get better. It seemed for a while that true coordination efforts were under way to actually come up with a central plan to develop Haiti. In fact, I believe the government had even created an organisation to do this. With time, though, especially around election time in 2010 (November, December and then again in beginning of 2011), we all lost focus. The chaos became the status quo, it was accepted, this is Haiti, there was really nothing that could be done about it. Apathy in one person or in a group of people happens all the time and is easily overcome, but apathy in a government and all its supporting branches and external structures is really a depressing thing that is almost impossible to overcome.
 |I am not sure if that answered your question, but there you have it.
[So, would you say that the Haitians would actually be better off if they were left to their own devices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6ulv1?context=5)|That is an extreme viewpoint. I do not believe that Haitians would be better off alone. Besides some interventions and invasions, Haitians have been alone since their independence. It is a country with an extensive history of abuse of power, factionalism and stupendous brinkmanship. I believe that the earthquake of 2010 was a fantastic opportunity for Haiti to take advantage of the aid, the global support and sympathy it had, and to move forward. Part of my disappointment with this issue comes from how quickly all of this was forgotten here. I believe that if Haiti is to develop, it should come from within Haiti, yes, but this will not be possible without the financial aid of the international community. The mechanism through which the aid is sent to Haiti should be changed, though. Maybe this is a bit of a hazy answer...
[1 What lessons have you learned about organizing short-term, first on the scene response team strategies &amp; execution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uqbf?context=5)|I am not entirely sure if it is actually possible to do coordinated first responses. The nature of the emergency itself means that there will be little organisation and a lot of disorder, however I do believe that smaller organisations (even a group of missionaries coming in for a week) should do their homework and ask themselves if the activities they plan to do are in harmony with what is already being done. They should ask themselves if there is anyone else working in the area, if their practices will create inequality or dependency, etc. The Sphere Standards are a good start.
[2 Long-term development strategies seem to be lacking vision, yet have some resources to accomplish something. What do you see as the future for Haiti? Will they rebuild back to its previously decrepit, poverty - stricken standard, or will they rebuild into something greater? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uqbf?context=5)|I believe it is important for governments to make emergency plans for the sorts of emergencies they are prone to. Haiti did not have an earthquake plan, unfortunately.  Haiti is currently looking into improving its tourism industry. It is laughable to some, but a very daring feat. I believe that the future of Haiti does lie in the service industry. Manufacturing, mining, tourism, etc.  The poverty-stricken standard is what is currently in place at the moment. I believe that this is the accepted status quo. It is not accepted by those outside of Port-au-Prince, of course, but it is accepted by the political elite, the business owners, even, I dare say, some NGOs who wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this standard.
[The ""Haitian people"" would not be left to their own devices anyway, someone like Papa Doc would probably grab power.  Anarchy is unstable.  (Right?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vicn?context=5)|But that's what I mean as being left to their own devices. Maybe I don't understand your comment. Someone like papa doc or aristide or baby doc is exactly what has happened when they have been left to their own devices.
[Hey I am Tourism student, studying in UK. Next year I will be required to take a placement in industry as part of degree, I was looking into internship work in Africa's Nature Reserves. But after checking your AMA, I'm interested about possibilities in Haiti. After some googling i found most of the issues with it, but wanted to hear your opinion on tourism in Haiti, its expansion. Also do you think there are any opportunities for internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wxqs?context=5)|You could try and contact some of the hotels directly to see if they'd be willing to take you on. My main problem with tourism in Haiti is that Haiti does not sound, in my opinion, like an ideal Caribbean holiday. I find it difficult to think of a tourist who would want to come here for a month or two in the summer. Also, I believe the Dominican Republic is the biggest tourist destination in the Caribbean. It will be difficult to compete with such a large business. In spite of this, there ARE tourists who come here, and the Ministry of Tourism is doing a hell of a lot to try and help. I have not studied tourism so my views are completely superficial, but who knows, maybe there is a future in tourism here. You might also want to try contacting the Ministry of Tourism directly, it wouldn't hurt, at the very least they could forward you on to someone who could help you. Good luck!

[What do you think happened with the bulk of aid money that was committed to Haiti in 2010 immediately following the earthquake?  Why do you think it is so hard for Haiti to recover from the earthquake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|What do you think happened with the bulk of aid money that was committed to Haiti in 2010 immediately following the earthquake? -This is hard to say. Most of the answers above cover this quite well with the addition that in 2010 most of the activities were for emergency response, therefore short-term goals (distribution water or food) and therefore have not left a tangible mark that can be seen today.  Why do you think it is so hard for Haiti to recover from the earthquake? - The earthquake destroyed Port-au-Prince, the largest city and commercial base of the country. It's as if New York City were suddenly obliterated. Recovery from something like that would be slow and painful. If on top of that you take into account lack of coordination, corruption, and personal interests then you will end up with something like Haiti today.

How long do you plan on staying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u0r0?context=5)|I chose to go to Haiti because I needed work. I got an interview through a friend of mine for an NGO and was sent over very shortly after the earthquake of 2010 (in January). I did it because at the time it was the highest paying job I could find, and because it was vaguely related to what I wanted to do career-wise. I never intended to stay as long as I have. One month turned into three more, which turned into six, and next thing I know I've been here for years. For a while I tried convincing myself that I came to help people and to respond to the disaster, and I suppose that made my job easier, but with time I realised that it is really a dirty and disgusting business (yes, a business). I plan to leave in December of this year.
[Do you know the best way to become involved in NGOs? I have wanted to volunteer for a very long time now but since it seems that whenever I try to ask about volunteering or working I am given the same response, no. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vwyd?context=5)|Yes,
 |Try contacting NGOs in usually uninteresting countries at first. I made the suggestion to someone else of Samaritan's Purse in Bolivia (again, I don't work for samaritan's purse and don't know if they actually work in Bolivia). If you write directly to the country director (whose name you could probably find by googling it) you will have higher chances of getting a positive response. 
[Will you work in a similar capacity elsewhere? I assume this kind of work looks good in general, right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6y262?context=5)|I am thinking about possibly continuing work in Asia, but at the moment am in a bit of an existential limbo.

The first job I had here paid around USD$4,500.00 a month including housing and transportation with R&amp;R every two months (plane ticket was included for the RR)
[What's the best way to donate to Haiti relief? I hear that so little of the donated money actually reaches the island, it sounds like it would be more effective to just put cash in an envelope and mail it to a random name in the Haiti white pages.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v0je?context=5)|Let me tell you first what the worst way to donate is: donations in kind. Sending clothes, water, food, whatever. That is amazingly annoying and mostly unnecessary. Most of the donations in kind will sit at warehouses for weeks and months and will cost much more to store and transport than if it was bought separately.
 |The easiest way to donate to Haiti would be to give money to a reputable, maybe non-religious organisation. It is true that a lot of the money does not reach the projects themselves, but that is unavoidable. You have to see your money not as equalling a brick in a school, but as something that helps that brick being put there. NGO offices, the cost of guards, even having coffee for a meeting, these all come from donations (mostly) and are in some way necessary to making it possible to put a brick in a school. Still, I understand your frustration with this.

[On to the question.  If you could change one thing in Haiti (politically, culturally, etc\) to aid in its advancement, what would it be?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uonk?context=5)|If I could change one thing in Haiti it would be the attitude of the beneficiaries. Over the past two years there has been a great and partly justified anti-NGO sentiment. They are suspicious of works being done and believe that we are just a business (which I believe we are in part). This obviously cuases massive problems with the work we are trying to achieve. Ironically this anti-NGO movement demands that we do more work and take over some of the activities that are the legal responsibilites of the state. So basically, they don't trust us, but they want us to do more.
[Why should anyone care about Haiti anymore? We provided money and support since the quake, and after the major coup d'etat, and after their last national disaster. Why shouldn't I just say, ""13 strikes and you're out?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w6zd?context=5)|I'm not here to change your opinion.

[What is a humanitarian worker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u3k3?context=5)|This is a great question. It's funny, I don't actually know what is probably a generally accepted definition of this. Maybe I should explain to you what I have done?
 |In 2010 I came in as part of an emergency team, trying to deal with fast response to the earthquake emergency. This meant the immediate alleviation of the needs of those affected. Thus, distribution of food and water, clothes, medication, emergency medical services, tents and tarpaulin for shelter, etc.
 |Since then I have moved to development. This means that the emergency is over and now we are focusing on long-term goals. So we have built schools, fixed roads, built hospitals, trained nurses, etc.

[I was just in Port au Prince! I got back on Tuesday from a ten day trip there. My father works in a high position for Digicel down there, I'd rather not say what exactly. I met some girls at Wahoo Bay that were working for Hope for Haiti, so this post piqued my curiosity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vpzh?context=5)|I think in part it's just the way it is. They're used to it. I'm used to it too at this point. Secondly, there are very few pick-up spots for refuse. Thirdly, many people choose to throw it in the canals because it is easier than burning it themselves.
[My question to you is when I was down there, the amount of trash on the mountain sides, in the street, etc. was astonishing to me. Coming from the states, it was shocking to me that there was no regard for cleanup as we have here. Why do you think that is? Do you think that the Haitians don't care, or is there more to it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vpzh?context=5)|Every once in a while there will be efforts to clean up, but because of how Port-au-Prince is built, rain tends to wash a lot of it up on the streets.
[How much is the pay? and are many of the prisoners that escaped still out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w1s9?context=5)|For project management positions it is anywhere between EUR 1000.00 and EUR 6000.00 a month depending on the organisation. In the first organisation I worked with my boss, the country director was making around USD 120,000.00 a year. It really depends on the size of the organisation.
[What would you say to someone to convince him/her to become a humanitarian worker in Haiti like you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uzzc?context=5)|I'm not sure I would try to convince anyone to do this. It is hard, it is uncomfortable, and it will eventually break you. I believe it was more difficult for me because it wasn't an actual calling. I did it for convenience, and though at the beginning I did believe that I was doing good work and that I wanted to help, this faded. It is sad. Had I had other opitons, I think I would have left much earlier. This makes me incredibly sad about myself, but it is true. If you want to do aid work, you should know it and be sure of it without asking other's opinions, I think. Think of it like joining a seminary.
[Say I wanted to leave for this type of work immediately. How does one jump right in? I've been wanting to do some kind of work like this temporarily, and eventually permanently. Are you actually a volunteer and have to pay for all travel, food, and living expenses or are you a paid contractor of some type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v0ac?context=5)|Strangely, it is harder than one would expect. I got lucky. Organisations are usually looking for educated individuals, and usually people educated in either the field of humanitarian affairs or whatever specific field they will be working in (e.g. WASH - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene experts).
 |Some organisations might look for volunteers but they are also very competitive. Take a look at reliefweb.com . Job descriptions there might give you an idea of what it is they're looking for.
[Do they need people with IT skills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6y9bu?context=5)|Yes. People with IT skills are always needed. As in any office or work environment, things will crash and people need, no, DEMAND someone to blame.
[A close friend of mine was working for some private security firm over there. She said there was a big problem with the Haitians raping women over there. Apparently she wasn't allowed to go out after dark for fear of people raping her. At some point a group of people got fed up with all the women being raped, rounded up a group of like, 12 people who had tried to rape their female counter-parts, and murdered them all on the roof of a building. Is rape a serious problem over there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wkes?context=5)|Rape is a massive problem. I remember reading that rape did not actually become illegal until the beginning of this century, though I'm not sure if that's true. I receive a daily digest of security issues in Port-au-Prince from the UN and I'd say about 80% of these are related to rapes. Also, vigilantism is massive. Lots of lynchings.
[If you had to do it over, would you have gone and done this? Whats the biggest problem with Haiti / the people ? That country seems to not be able to lift itself out of poverty vs dominican republic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wjd8?context=5)|If I had to do it over again I don't think I would have stayed longer than a year.
 |In a nutshell the Dominican Republic has the advantage that it speaks Spanish and can therefore form active part of its surrounding community, it has made an active effort to improve its political culture since its dictatorship, and it was able to take advantage of the tourist industry starting from the 1970s. Haiti at one point was a bigger tourism destination than the Dominican Republic (in the 70s I believe). Since then political problems have, in my opinion, managed to detract from this sort of development.
[Can any real change be taken in Haiti while the government is corrupt? A government needs to provide for it's people, and clearly the Haitian government does not do that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyw4?context=5)|I do not believe positive significant change can take place with a corrupt government.
[How do you feel choosing this path, and how have the people there taught you as a person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w4fr?context=5)|I feel emotionally and physically exhausted. From the people here I have learnt what true human resilience is. I have also learnt what despair and distrust truly is. I have been incredibly angry at the people here, I have hated all of it, but I have also realised that classifying a people as one entity, giving them one label and one name, is an exercise in futility. You will find all sorts of kind people and all sorts of spiteful people, and though it sounds very trite, you might as well focus on the good ones because the others will have you wallowing in despair.
[Serious question: What do you think are the reason(s\) that Haiti is still in a mess, compared to other countries or societies which had comparable or greater earthquakes?  I'm working on a related economics research, and would like to hear an at-the-field, outside-of-discipline opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w9z2?context=5)|Predominantly the political culture. It is based on factionalism, corruption and strong-arming. A crude simile would be the mafia. Strong structures with dubious populist bases who are able to control through fear, pressure, and the sheer weight of money being thrown around.

Schools have been built, cholera has been responded to in an amazing way, local associations have been set up and are able to effectively manage and represent their communities. I believe that achievements have been made but nothing near what was expected, and this isn't from lack of trying. I think that expectations were far too high and unrealistic.

That should give you a quick overview.
[Do you think that some of the work that is being done allows the Haitian government to get away with irresponsible spending?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v8pr?context=5)|Definitely. A common strategy is to request salarial aid for extra work such-and-such functionary will need to do in order to move this proposal/project/importation/whatever along.
 |That is small, though.
 |The big ones are when donors give money directly to the government for projects.
[I don't know if you can answer this but I am going to ask anyways.  Any projects/donations in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w8dg?context=5)|Construction projects are wonderful for this. Lots of money, lots of questionable expenses. If you're talking about a large infrastructure project, then even better. You will need government approvals, licenses, maybe even businesses that are owned by functionaries.

If you want to do microcredits, do some economics, try to get an internship with a local microcredit organisation (you can even find them in large US cities!), if you want to do WASH then do an internship as a plumber's assistant (seriously!). Development alone won't get you very far.
[Thanks for doing this AMA, it's great to hear a first-hand account.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v9go?context=5)|Also, try for internships in places that are rather boring. For example, look up the Samaritan's Purse office in Bolivia (that's just an example, I have no connection to Samaritan's Purse, I don't even know if they work there) and simply write and say that you'd be interested in doing an internship. You'll be more likely to get one that way than by going through the usual competitive routes.
[What ISP does your organization use for Internet access in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vfdw?context=5)|Explain to me why you want this information, and I will give it to you.
[Really I'm more curious about what specific technology your last mile access is using (from the ISP to your NGO's premises\), speeds to the outside world, prices, and whether in your opinion it's reasonably reliable or not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vm2o?context=5)|I believe my organisation uses NATCOM, a vietnamese-owned company.

Most of the time I'd say that unless one is completely lacking in common sense, one should be absolutely fine. But then I realise I've gotten used to not walking around in Port-au-Prince, gotten used to having armed guards at the door of my house, knowing exit routes BY HEART. Some friends of mine have been robbed, one them was almost kidnapped (his colleagues were kidnapped, he was out of the house at the time). There was a Swiss woman who was killed for HTG2,000.00 in Cap Haitien I believe. It can be dangerous.
[How many places have you been to help out in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vo2s?context=5)|I worked predominantly in Port-au-Prince but have been working throughout the country except for the Sud and Grand-Anse departments.
[I don't know if this will get seen, but will give it a shot. My parents are Canadian, but I grew up in Haiti. They moved there to help out in the 80s but not as part of any NGO or company, just on their own. When my mom first moved there she lived in a tiny little room rented from a house with no furniture and barely enough to live on. My parents were very determined that I grow up as a Haitian culturally, I went to Haitian schools (most ex-pats would go to Americanized schools\) I spent time in my neighbourhood with the kids there, not going to special ex-pat hangout spots or summer camps. I am culturally a Haitian and associate with Haiti more than any other culture. My mother has worked since with many aid organizations and now runs her own small scale, grass-roots, Haitian NGO focused on teacher training. I've seen everything there is to see with NGO's and their workers. From this perspective I've felt it's a shame that aid workers and ex-pats don't get enough exposure to Haitians. They see the worst because they interact with people who are in dire situations or deal with corrupt officials. Whereas there is so much joy and beauty there, and growing up there I don't have any familiarity with most of the situations OP has talked about (not that he's been bad mouthing Haiti or that these things don't exist, just that there's a dark side in any country, I'm sure aid/social workers in the US/Canada might have many similar stories, though probably not as publicly visible as in Haiti\). So a question to OP is, do you think it would be beneficial to be more exposed to Haitian community life? Would it help with the depression and shock that many of you feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca703a3?context=5)|Yes. I think that more exposure would help with depression and so on. I'm not sure if it would have helped much in 2010 when things were so out of control, but it would certainly help now. And let me say, there are many expats who have given themselves to Haiti completely. They have made families here, have become completely entwined with the country. Many of those who left have very fond memories of Haiti.
[TL;DR; Grew up in Haiti as Haitian, parents involved in NGOs. I feel it would benefit NGO workers to be more involved in Haitian life, than just helping in the emergencies. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca703a3?context=5)|It was never my intention to bad-mouth the country, and I'm sorry if it might have even seemed that way. I am only one voice and one opinion, and I only mean to share what I have seen and felt.

Whether its when I'm with my freinds and someone they know and I do not comes over, or if its after going out to lunch saying bye. In general I feel awkwardad I would like to feel less awkward.

I also sometimes feel awkward at my internship.

I started an internship a few months ago at a local startup company. Sometimes I feel alittle awkward there as everyone who is there graduated from Stanford and seem to be really brilliant. I sometimes feel alittle uncomfortable as I am only attending UCSD, which I think I will love, but is nowhere near the caliber of Stanford.  They seem to like me and act really cool, but I still fill a little out of place. 

I worry sometimes I am not meeting their expectations on what I should do, they haven't said anything negative, but then again, they never really have said anything even slightly negative. They are always just really positive. 

When they had some buddies over from Stanford they said I was their best intern and I would be getting an amazing letter of reccomendation, we all went out to lunch and it was a really fun time. I've also gone to block parties that were held nearby. I feel like they do like me, but I also feel I'm just tagging along for the ride and if I wasn't there it wouldn't really matter or be any different. One of the founder's brother's owns a company and allows me access to his machine shop.

I feel a little insecure. While based on what they have said an how they act it feels like I should be grounded and confident in my position, I can't help feeling that they would be this nice to anyone.

I feel in general I don't make much of an impact and what I do doesn't really matter.

[How come these things won't visit US ports? Just no West Coast port big enough to handle them? And if not, why not?  I understand these ships are pretty brutal to the environment. Do you see any technology or practices on the horizon that might make them a little less harmful?  Is this size of ship going to be the new standard to stay competitive on those routes now?   A lot of Europe-Asia air traffic is being flown through Middle Eastern airports (or Istanbul\), a vast change from even a decade ago. Is there the same shift in sea cargo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7qozw?context=5)|The real problem is not the size of the ports it's that the ports use outdated technology. Ports in China and Europe are highly automated and they can move containers at and amazing rate. American ports are slow because the unions fear that automation will cost their members jobs and because union rules support policies that lead to slower load rates (the longer it takes, the more hours union members rack up. One expert told me that this ship could be offloaded in Europe in 2-3 days but it would take the port of Los Angeles over a week to offload her... And Maersk can not afford to leave an expensive ship like this one tied to the dock for that long.  These ships are brutal on the environment on a per ship basis but on a per container basis they are much more efficient than any other form of transport (e.g. Trains, trucks, etc). So the environment would benefit significantly if containers were moved across this CPU try (through the canal) then aboard trucks and trains. This is called ""short sea shipping"" and is how European cargo gets moved... But it's something lobbyists have fought for years.
 |Yes, expert believe this will be the new standard in 10 years but... Only time will tell.
[*blasphemy, how dare you insult the sanctity of the union maritime worker!* ~sincerely, NY tugboat operator tired of his useless union. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81k6a?context=5)|Well the Sandy Hook pilots are just across the bay and they are non-union, right... maybe they have a few openings ;)
 |(Yes, I'm joking)
[Do you think that by trying to avoid automation to save union jobs and provide more union hours, these ports might be bringing about their own demise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7v1qi?context=5)|They can't do more harm to themselves then they already have, so no, I don't think they will demise but they are preventing their own growth.
 |If we adopted Europe's methods then we would move containers onto smaller ships to more efficiently get the containers closer to their destinations... That would mean two more loads per container for every crane operator which translates to lots more jobs. Of course, it would mean less jobs for truck drivers but this will happen anyway as new ports are currently being built in Mexico.
[As a member of the shipping industry in the US now pursuing a degree in logistics, this comment infuriates me to no end. It seems every inefficiency on our side comes back to Unions, and its usually true, having witnessed it first hand. Between local government interference and union hustling it sometimes amazes me anyone is willing to do business here.  That said, I find this industry absolutely fascinating and look forward getting more involved in it after college. Your blog looks like a great resource. Working for Maersk is one of my goals. Did you enjoy your time with the company? Though I hope to work port-side in some sort of intermodal capacity, any chance of getting some time at sea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca82oaz?context=5)|Well if the unions infuriate you then you're in for a treat... Just look up e work ""MARAD"" in the index of your text book and you'll learn about one organization that makes the unions look like time travelers from the future.
[How many bags of heroin does your boat hold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n27v?context=5)|What, didn't you see Mark Wahlberg's film ""Contraband""? There are a thousand places to hide heroin, weapons and people on a ship like this. 
[I was going to ask what it's like to have Mark Wahlberg smuggle stuff on your ship.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nifp?context=5)|Mark's a nice guy but got an attitude when I said the only thing worse than New Kids is a Funky Bunch album ;)
[But seriously, did you ever have crew that would try that stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nifp?context=5)|I've certainly heard rumors and had reason to suspect they were true but... no, I've never caught anyone in the act. Like I said, it's a big ship with thousands of hiding spaces... the only way to be caught is to either be really dumb or get stopped on your way on and off the ship. 
[SO HOW MANY BAGS OP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nmi7?context=5)|Thousands of kilos. Hiding vast quantities of anything is easy, you just open the hatch to a void space and drop the stuff in, the only limit is your ability to get the stuff on and off the ship.
[Ahh, the ol' Han Solo technique.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7vjse?context=5)|""I use them for smuggling kid. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous!""
[How many Zapp Brannigan quotes were you able to use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mkw0?context=5)|Only one: ""She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely. Seductive. I'm gonna Fly Her Brains Out!""
 |My favorite quotes as a captain was Steve Zissou's classic line ""Hey intern, go plug this in and make me a Latte.""  (a captain has to have his coffee!)
[What kind of crew does a ship like that need? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m22q?context=5)|The  minimum crew required by law is only 14 people but Maersk plans on crewing her with at least 20. Shocking considering that a Nimitz class carrier holds more than 5000 people ( Ship's Company: 3,000-3,200, air wing: 1,500, other: 500) and is 67.2 meters (220 feet) shorter in length!
[How does that break down? (i.e. 3 bridge crew + 3 engineers x 3 shifts?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7metf?context=5)|Top of the food chain are the Captain (in charge of everything) and the Chief Engineer (in charge of the enige room and anything mechanical)
 |Bridge team: 3 officers (Chief mate, 2nd mate, 3rd mate) 3 lookouts (Able Bodied or Ordinary Seaman)
 |Engine team 3 officers (1st Assistant Engineer, 2nd AE, 3rd A/E) 3 oilers.
 |Steward's department (in charge of food, laundry, etc) 1 Steward (In charge of ordering food and cooks the breakfast) 1 Cook 1 Assistant.
 |3 DEU's (junior crewmembers who are pulled by any department that needs them)
[Out of curiosity, what do the stewards get paid? (I cook for a living\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rz5l?context=5)|The non-union stewards get paid peanuts and usually have less vacation time than the rest of the crew. I don't know exact numbers but union stewards get decent pay plus can get significant amounts of overtime if the captain approves it (which he usually does if the food is good).
[Considering boat crews are often international, I'm assuming the English is the lingua Franca on these type of ships?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7tfg8?context=5)|Yes, that is correct. 
[A ship that large almost seem impractical.  How many ports are large enough to hold such a big ship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mgp7?context=5)|Not many... She only plans on calling on 13 ports all in Asia and Europe. She won't be coming to the united states. 
[Is making a single large ship more efficient than making a number of smaller ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pztl?context=5)|Yes, but that's only half the equation... It's also that transporting 18,000 containers at once is more efficient than making two 9,000 container trips.
[Does it take the same time to load/unload though on per container basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca80ceq?context=5)|Good question but I'm not  sure of the answer.
[How is it to handle a big ship like that? How much do you have to plan everything  before, to make your ship react at the right time? How long does it take to make a full stop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mnd8?context=5)|Yes everything has to be very well planned. We won't know exactly how long it takes this ship to make a full ""crash astern"" stop but 15 ship lengths is fairly typical of a large ships so... 6000 meters or 20,000 feet.
 |But the ocean is wide open, so very little maneuvering is needed once the ship reaches open ocean. The difficult part is maneuvering in port but stopping distance is not much of an issue for two reasons: 1) Ships move slowly in port 2) They are escorted by powerful tugs which can stop them quickly and help them turn ""on a dime"".
[I took a cruise recently from Tampa to Grand Cayman, then Mexico and back to Tampa.  I spent a good amount of time staring over the side hoping to glimpse fish, dolphins, whales, anything.  Other than 2 flying fish, I saw nothing. Nothing at all.  Is there a trick to seeing stuff, like a certain time, or in front or behind the ship?  Ever see any cool fish or anything like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n9i2?context=5)|In my experience their are only two factors to seeing those things: luck and location.
 |The key is to ask the crew were are the spots they most often see marine life... then ask them what time the ship will pass those locations. If they won't tell you then you best bet is to watch during times you are in sight of (but no too close to) land.
 |My favorite are the sea turtles!  You can be over a 1000 nautical miles from the closest point of land and see a turtle slowly paddling alone. They are really slow... and it boggles my mind how (even with favorable currents) they can travel so far on their own.
[What was the most exhilarating experience you had as captain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ltka?context=5)|Probably the rogue wave which, luckily, I only witness first hand on one occasion. It was in 2002 and the water was dead calm and we had jsut rounded the southern tip of Africa when I caught the thing from the corner of my eye. I don't know how big it was but I was about 40 feet above the waterline on a 500 foot ship and, just before we hit it, I was looking up at the thing. Scary as hell.
 |The good news is that we only hit it due to my relative inexperience at the time and incompetence as a navigator because the location of these things is well charted, known among scientists and easily avoided... so I don't plan on running into one again. 
[Er.. the location of rogue waves are well charted???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7miv8?context=5)|Yes they are fairly well charted on the latest versions of the charts... but it's only been in the last 10-15 years that we have known anything about them.
 |Now there are 2 basic types of Rogue Waves, those that form in the middle of giant storms and the Freak type that seem to come out of nowhere.
 |A book called The Wave by Susan Casey is a great read if you're interested in learning more.
[As much as you are allowed to discuss, what was your company's standard procedure for dealing with pirates, and did you have weapons or other ways of deterring them? Do some companies hire private security firms, like Blackwater? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m21v?context=5)|Well the last time I sailed as Captain was 3 years ago and many ships still were not allowed to carry any weapons or hire any private security firms. Most companies still discourage the crew from bringing aboard their own weapons but do allow the use of private security firms.
[Not allowed, this is really surprising!  Considering the dollar amount of the cargo on the ships, it's shocking that security firms are not allowed.  Not allowed by whom, I wonder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pb5h?context=5)|I ment to say that, yes, today security teams are allowed on ships.
[So as recently as three years ago, multi-billion dollar cargo ships had less security than Disneyland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pb5h?context=5)|Yes, three years ago, most didn't have more than a set of handcuffs and a batton... Much less then Disney!
[Could you use the boat to ram the pirates' dinghy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rplc?context=5)|Yes but only if the dinghy holds it's course...
[Do pirates usually have the ability to forcibly board a ship that large?  It seems like you could just ignore them and steam on.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7v4gr?context=5)|Pirates would have a very difficult time boarding a ship this big and fast.
 |Most ships that have been taken have had either a low freeboard (distance from the water to the deck) or a low top speed. 
[Im a former pirate hunter in the Gulf of Aden @ HDMS Absalon...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xu2e?context=5)|The task force is dong an excellent job, especially in the gulf of Aden, but they have remained mostly ineffective off Somalia's east coast simply due to the fact of the ocean, and the distance these pirates are willing to travel, is so large.
[How do you guys view the efforts by the taskforce stationed in the middleeastern and asian seas, and what improvments could be made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xu2e?context=5)|Private security teams aboard the ships and simple precautions like straining razor wire around the gunwales is proving to be the most effective deterrent. 
[How much is the ship worth? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n43i?context=5)|This ship is costing Maersk $190 million to build but they signed the contract before the economy tanked. Today you could commission a yard to build this ship for around $150 million.
[I'm fascinated with ships like this and how they operate.  You said in another question the minimum crew on one of these ships is at least 14, what does everyone do all day?  How much of the day is structured with actual duties and how much downtime do you get?  Are there any recreation options other than playing cards or reading?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7r53g?context=5)|The captain works 8 hours (mostly behind a desk) but is on call 24/7.
 |The rest of the crew typically work three 4 hour shifts. Two of those shifts are standing watch (on the bridge, engine room or in the kitchen).. The third shift is doing routine maintenance and inspections.
 |Lots and lots of time for card playing, reading or watching the months worth of stuff you downloaded via pirate bay.. 
[So some could call you...a pirate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ukou?context=5)|The MPAA certainly would ;)
[Thanks for the reply, appreciate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rttf?context=5)|I have found stowaways before but we caught them before we left port.
[Ever had anyone sneak onboard for a free ride?  If it happens and they are discovered what is the protocol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rttf?context=5)|The protocol for finding one after you leave port depends on your company policy and the laws of the port you are heading to. At a minimum you must give hem a bed and food then notify immigration prior to arriving at your destination. From there you must follow the orders of the immigration officer who will usually fine the ship and launch an investigation. 
[Do your engineers not just do day work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7yzm9?context=5)|It depends on if the ship has an automated engine room or not but, You're right, on this ship they do. 
[I think I could get used to being a captain. Many hours to read, the sea, what's not to like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81rrw?context=5)|That totally depends on how good your cook is and how much money the company gives him to buy groceries. Usually the food is very good but heavy (mostly comfort food).
[So making them walk the plank isn't an option?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81sbl?context=5)|No but I hear rumors that it still happens since there is a lot you ""could"" get away with if the closest police station was 1000 miles away, you had a week to clean up the evidence and if you were floating directly above a 15,000 foot deep trash can filled with man eating sharks...
[If the ship gets fined what is the motivation to notify immigration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca8244y?context=5)|A bigger fine and/or imprisonment if you don't notify immigration.
[What ship(s\) did you Captain? Merchant Marine? If so do you have a son and if so did you name him Nathaniel like every other Captain in the Merchant Marine? You seem a bit young for that gig.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m7ob?context=5)|I am a bit young for the gig but there has been a massive shortage of qualified mariners int he last 5-10 years as the economies of china and india have expanded. When I first joined it was rare to find a captain under the age of 45... today many are in their early 30's.
 |Nathaniel is a strong name but my wife vetoed anything too nautical so we named him Jack.
[Is this the biggest machine a single man can ""drive""? How does it feel to be behind the wheels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n4mf?context=5)|Sure is... unless you find a time machine that can travel a long time ago to a galaxy far away.
 |It feels awesome, like having a super power, the only downer is that the ship's wheel is rather small and puny. 
[Is most of the driving done by computer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca82j8r?context=5)|Yes, the ship has autopilot which is controlled by an ""integrated bridge system"" (a windows based computer)
[I've been a long time follower of your site, and I'm glad to see you doing something like this.  My question is: when do you think the other carriers will debut ships of equal size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p0tk?context=5)|Jus last month China Shipping put in an order for five ships of this size and e others are likely to follow. The only thing that's holding them back is the fact that shipping rates are currently at a historic low... but this will change as (let's hope!)  the economy continues to improve.
[With more ships of this size being built and only ever increasing cargo shipping, do you think the Suez and Panama canals will be widened to accommodate the extra width?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p602?context=5)|The Panama Canal is, right now, being widened.. But it still won't be large enough to accept a ship of this size.  The Suez Canal, however, is already plenty wide (and deep!) enough for this ship.
[Have you seen the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p602?context=5)|No... Most of my time has been in the Atlantic and Indian oceans but I have seen plenty of trash. It's still rare to see a large patch of it but is certainly depressing when you do!
[Any close calls with pirates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mafa?context=5)|Their are two basic types of pirates... those who steal stuff and run (found around the world but most prevalent in the Strait of Malacca). These ones typically only steal stuff you have left exposed on deck  (they love brass firehose fittings and thick hawsers).
 |The other, more dangerous, type of pirate are those in Somalia who take over and ransom the entire ship.
 |Personally I have seen a few of the former pirates but none of the latter but I have friends who've seen both. The closest I've come to the dangerous type of pirates was as a blogger... I called the bridge of the Maersk Alabama (via skype!) to verify the story of her capture before it broke in the news.
[How would a pirate board a ship as tall as yours? Sorry if this is a dumb question. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xshc?context=5)|Grappling hooks and rope ladders but the pirates prefer to board slower ships with lower freeboard (the distance deform the water to the ship's deck)
[Do you guys use scooters to get around the ship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mc9q?context=5)|No but scooters are the preferred method of transport in most of the large shipyards where the ships are built. On ships larger than 1000; feet you will often find a couple of bicycles on deck for getting to/from the bow.
[As a captain, how much of your time awake is actually spent doing something ship related? I can't imagine there being too much needing to be taken care of if you're on a month long run from Asia to Europe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ouqm?context=5)|A decade ago you would be correct, there isn't too much that needs to get done during a month long run but, the invention of satellite Internet means that today's captain has access to the Internet, Skype and email. While this sounds good (and mostly it is) it also comes with the problem of micromanagement... The shoreside managers love to fill any free time with paperwork. So, in short, today's captain stays rather busy.
[How did you get your start? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n62f?context=5)|I went to SUNY Maritime College in the bronx... a state university that gives you a college degree and a license to drive really big ships. 
[Seriously, can the chef legally kill pirates if the ship is attacked? A 30% raise and a reasonable risk to my life would be interesting, if not awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7yuj0?context=5)|Yes you can certainly defend yourself if they attack... but, depending on the company policy and the laws of the flag state, you may have to use your kitchen knives to do it.
[What goes through an average captain's mind in really rough seas?  Is it like, ""I'm a badass captain, and if I keep my cool, I've got this,"" or ""Oh shit, I really hope I make it out of this one?""  Videos like this are what prompt my question: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7se2w?context=5)|Well, you have to instill confidence in the crew so outwardly you say ""I'm a badass captain, and if I keep my cool, I've got this,"" But, as long as everything's well secured and there are no signs of structural failure, then all that's really going through your mind is ""F me, I wish I was home surfing Reddit!"".
[Ever played hide and seek with the crew???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7r5o9?context=5)|No but I played ""hide from my boss"" plenty of times when I first started out ;)
[As someone from a family of shipbuilders, I can indeed confirm that you have a very impressive boat. :\)  I also have friends who operate on ships like these in the South Pacific. They have plenty of great tales. Who knows, maybe I'll end up on one one of these days.  So yeah, question time: what's the fastest the boat can go when fully loaded? And how long does a round trip take?

 |They bend a lot in heavy weather. The first major storm I was in was aboard a 1000 foot tanker and I watched as the bow twisted one way, and the stern twisted another, as she hit a wave. I called the captain up to the bridge and he said ""Twisting's a good thing, it means that the steel isn't brittle. But if she stops twisting then grab a lifejacket and run to the lifeboat.""

(bulk carrier\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7opl6?context=5)|My best advice is to work on many different types of ships during the first few years of your career.

So I'm a rising sophomore looking to study MatSci next year, and I made a huge mistake this summer. I was planning on working full time over the summer at my school's climbing facility while I take a class in the mornings. Unfortunately, between a mix of a ridiculous amount of new hires (to fill students who left for the summer) and some budget cuts, my hours are way less than I expected.

As a result of this, I completely missed out on applying to be a research assistant (I've already gotten in touch with all my prof's), my morning class and lack of car keeps me from getting an internship (if I don't take this class now I fall a year behind), and now a lot of the small shops around campus have already made their summer schedules and aren't really hiring.  

I'm determined to get something out of this summer, and I feel like teaching myself a language like Python or something along those lines would be a great resume booster. I've already taken an intro C++ class, and I've had experience with MATLAB, but I wonder if there are any additional (free) resources out there for those 2, or if anyone knows any good resources or languages to check out? My school has a ton of free online books available to students, so chances are if anyone recommends a book I can get access to it. "

The majority of stuff I have left are math classes. The problem is that the logistics of getting to the math classes is a pain. The campus I attend only has a few of the classes and I'd need to put in about a 90+ min commute to get to the other campus to take the math classes throughout fall (maybe summer) and probably next spring to graduate.

I liked the early math classes (calc, stats) stuff I've taken already and really want to do this but I'm worried that 12 months of this kind of commute will just kill me and really make it hard to take an internship on the side if I'm commuting so much to class.

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with the degree, consulting, actuary, real estate are a few of the things I'm thinking of.

I'm really interested in being smart at Math. I love tech (I've taken coding and data classes on the side at Coursera and other places), and just think that it's a thing I'd like to know. I'm not sure exactly how it would make me a better canidate for a job, but I'm afraid that economics alone isn't enough.

So yeah. A few qs:

* What do you think of XFX as a PSU brand?

* Is 450W enough if I wanted to add, say, a GTX 670 later? Not OCd.

* Is the RAM decent? It's really cheap so just want to make sure it's good.

* Is AMD coming out with a new APU any time soon? 

* Will Haswell's integrated graphics be better, price-performance wise, than the A10k?

The ""real"" jobs are very difficult to get unless you have years of expertise in their special topic, no matter how much education you have. Everything else is part-time or contractor work. And the job listings are soul-crushing.

More often than finding a position I'd like to apply for, I find myself wanting to send angry e-mails to job listers chastising them for their impudence. They want a bachelor's degree and want you to know every style available and only want to pay you $10 an hour (if they're even willing to pay). Or better yet, they want to pay you $10/hour to write four or five 500-word articles a day to fulfill their content-mill needs. If you could even accomplish that, the quality would be so low and the burn-out so high that no one would last more than two weeks. 

At some point, it seems that ""writer"" became synonymous with ""personal assistant"" and ""graphic designer."" It's this uncomfortable catch-all for which no one actually wants to pay. You should be an expert at data-entry, customer service, blogging, social media, PR, articles, reports, graphic design, advertising, SEO, web design, programming, travel arrangements, and finances (oh- and if it's a home office for a small business, expect to walk the dog and pick up groceries). You'll get bumped up to $11-12 an hour if you're really good. If it's part-time, you must be absolutely loyal and work ridiculous hours that make it impossible to hold down multiple jobs. If it's full-time, you should be willing to ""pay your dues"" for a few years and be grateful for your intern wage after a 40-minute commute.

Don't forget that research and ""thinking"" are frowned upon as wasting time. They only want to pay for the finished product.

The easy solution is to just not apply for these jobs. But I know that someone else is just desperate enough to put themselves through it, and I feel defensive on their behalf. These employers have no idea what they want or how much they're squandering what they find. With any luck, they're only able to hire people who don't care.

End rant.

--Edit--
TL;DR  Job searches are frustrating. Low demand, high chance of being taken advantage of. No one cares. Stop whining."

I was raised my a single Mom and my grandma came to another country to raise me.

I got a liberal arts degree and I have to pay $200/mo in debt for the next 5 years. I am unemployed at the moment. I didn't like my major and didn't have many internships, got a job out of school for online marketing and was fired. 

I'm sitting here regretting the last 5 years of my life. My friends are on track for grad school in their fields and I am looking at moving back home next month. My Mom says she doesn't really care that much about what I do anymore. She makes about $58k a year and she has to pay off her house and she's working in a career she hates. 

My grandma is going crazy because she left her home country to be with me where she doesn't have a support network. She was just in a hospital 2 days ago. 

I feel like a monster. I have disappointed my family and I'm not seeing a way out. 

Did I fuck up my entire life? 

EDIT: I am the only child and my single mother's been raising me for half my life. She is an immigrant and I came to this country when I was 10. In a way I feel she is justified in how she feels about me. If I don't have her I don't know who I would have to turn to. "

I'll just give you a brief intro so that you know what you're dealing with.  I'm a 22 year old guy, english is my third language pardon me if I can't express myself sometimes -- i'm a complete beginner to the whole tech side of computers.  Even though all i've been doing the past 10 years is gaming on the PC, whenever I had technical trouble with like bluescreens or viruses/malware that kind of thing(when I was younger) my brother fixed it for me.  He works at a PC repair shop(also selling pc's and accessories and that) since like a decade and had always been there for me when I was having problems with my computer, upgrading and stuff too, so I really never felt the need to educate myself on the topic or try something myself. After I finally finished highschool back when I was 18, which was a horrible time since I was very antisocial because I had been going through an extremely rough time at home(my grandparents and dad died in the same year).  I had absolutely no motivation to carry on with studying, unlike everybody else who was very hyped to go to university or work.  I dabbled around in law school for a year, then I spent a year at home, then I tried tourism studies, nothing was really for me.  I was/am very lazy and would make up excuses to just sit here at the PC so that I can play games or watch movies.  Now at 22, I finally decided to get my act together and go look for a job, without luck(bad situation in my country).  Then today, my brother came back from work with a very happy expression on his face -- I could get an internship at his work for 3 months (he's not just a bottom employee, above him is only one more boss).  My brother and I never really connected much and we hardly ever spoke despite him living in the same house all this time (he's 40 now, suffering from periods of depression), yet this was really great news.  

Now finally to my question, do you think it's possible for me to learn sufficient information about the whole PC tech world in 2 weeks so that I don't make a complete fool of myself when I start my internship there? I'm quite clumsy and awkward at times so it'll be weird anyway but i'd absolutely LOVE to atleast have a little basic knowledge on this subject beforehand.  I just wanted to ask here first before I start googling books etc. because I don't want to end up with outdated information or beginning at the wrong place etc. Basically i'd really like to learn the basics of how to build a PC, i've been looking at videos such as these from thenewboston http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7uBoOA11Pw&amp;fmt=18, and considered downloading one of those ""for dummies"" books about building computers.

Could somebody please help me out? Where should I start and how? What are the most important things I need to learn properly? It would mean the world to me, I feel like I can finally turn my life around and do something. "
1favqm,1,2013-05-29,[Internship] Web programming internship available for the summer,[deleted],internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1favqm/internship_web_programming_internship_available/,"Hello everyone, I am offering a unique opportunity in web programming. I am a software engineer for my primary business but I am also starting a project on the side. I am looking for interns who want to learn programming or bring their programming skills to the next level this summer. The assignments I can provide can have a wide range in difficulty so this posting applies to anyone who has completed at least freshman year in computer science.

**What you can learn**

* C# / ASP.NET MVC
* Javascript
* AngularJS
* MongoDb
* Neo4j
* Solr
* Twitter Bootstrap UI Framework
* Git / Github

The internship is, however, unpaid. But I have laid out a plan to be in accordance with all points on the sidebar.

* Work from home / remotely
* Work as many or as little hours as you choose. This is your own education after all.
* We will have regular, live Skype code reviews and training sessions
* Over the course of the summer, you will be given a series of assignments that will get progressively more difficult and challenging as you get more familiar with the technology that you are working with.

For example, your first assignment will be to watch a tutorial on angularjs. Next assignment is to write a little application in angular and c# / asp.net mvc. Next assignment is to hook it up to a database, etc, etc...

I hold no expectations as to the quality of the work. I understand you are an intern and I will likely scrap all of your code anyway. All I ask is that you are intrinsically motivated and sincerely care about learning. The more you work and put in, the more I will help and teach you. At the end of the summer, I will write you a letter of recommendation and serve as a reference for you. And you can put everything you've done down on your resume.

If you are interested, please PM me with:

1) What school you are attending / major

2) How much school you have completed

3) Programming languages you are familiar with

4) One sentence on why you are interested in this internship. 
 

Cheers."

**The Problem**

One of the requirements is that I must be working towards a bachelor's degree. My plan was to finish out this next term in the associates program so that I could get hands on Cisco experience, and then transfer to WGU for their bachelor's degree. Every class I take next term will count towards that bachelor's degree. Including the Windows Server and Active Directory course.

1f9vwv,0,2013-05-29,"A ""what if"" question: all undergraduate education is online for free",Helen___Keller,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f9vwv/a_what_if_question_all_undergraduate_education_is/,"TL;DR: What would be the economic and social ramifications if all undergraduate education was replaced with online education, nearly freely available? 


Okay, so here are the assumptions I'm making in this what-if question:

1. Let's suppose online education has been improved steadily over the course of the years. Revolutions in understanding the learning process let us tailor specific education programs for any undergraduate major. Studies show that it is as effective as, or more effective than, a traditional education.

2. Through some method, online education is also reliable in that you can't just have your engineer best friend take tests for you and claim an engineering degree.

3. Universities still exist, but primarily for academic research and graduate level education. Basically, suppose that all traditional undergraduate education ceases to exist. Many dorms have been replaced by research labs or whatever. There may still be some 'boarding colleges' for undergraduate education, but there are few, and mostly for the wealthy.

4. With the advent of online education, a 'standard' education works like this:
Up through high school is the same, except rather than worrying about college applications, students worry about which online program to invest their time in. Advanced students start early.
Then, online education, nearly for free, for either a traditional field (psychology, chemistry, engineering ...) or for any craft (electrician, plumbing, ...). During this process, work part time / get internships if possible.
Then, Those particularly interested in a traditional field apply and go for graduate school as in the real world.

5. These online education programs are not directly analogous to current undergraduate degrees. Whether or not you get a 'general education' is your choice. Writers need not take college algebra, engineers need not take english classes. In any case, what you do learn is reflected by the 'certificate(s)' you have. An employer will know whether or not you took english comp I and II or whatever.


Returning to the TLDR, my question is what social and economic ramifications would result from this?
Things that occur to me:

1. Without undergraduates as a source of cash, would research universities lack funding?


2. The ability to learn part-time for nearly free would reduce barriers to entry to many fields for those willing to put in the time to learn engineering, or whatever. Would workers in high-demand fields see decreased overall salary if more people had access to this education? Is this a good thing or a bad thing, then?


3. Stereotypically, college is a time when young adults explore in many ways, include socially. Do you consider this necessary to a 'complete' education? Would there be a way to make up for it if undergraduate was all online?


4. Degrees are often used in the real world as indicators of competency. A job applicant may be outright rejected for not having a degree, where the same applicant would be interviewed if they had an entirely irrelevant degree. Would it be the same in this what-if? Given that degrees are broken up (you don't need the general education to get the engineering degree, for example), would employers still want the 'whole' undergraduate degree (including gen-eds, college algebra, etc) to signify competency?"

I'm currently an ECE student going into my ""4th year"" in the fall (quotes explained shortly) at a top 20 university in Canada.

The reason I say ""4th year"" is because I've been at school for 6 years, going into my 7th year of my bachelor's in the fall. I have screwed up a lot - having failed a bunch of courses in 1st, 2nd and 3rd year. As a result I only have a cGPA of 2.2 (which made my self-efficacy take a hit and make me question myself) and am worried about job prospects after graduation in May of 2014.

I initially entered the computer engineering stream because out of high school I really only had an interest in software and computer hardware. However after spending a number of years in engineering school, I became more interested in sustainable design and building construction having worked for an electrical &amp; mechanical consulting firm for three summers (I was really fortunate and was able to get this job through a connection). It's for this reason that I have started taking more electrical courses and am planning on taking fundamental courses in electrical power such as switch-mode energy conversion, distributed generation etc. this fall (most students take these core courses in 3rd year). However, last summer I did not work at this firm due to personal reasons and was not really employed (I'm worried about this gap in my employment history as well). This summer I tried applying to about 15-20 internships but was unable to get an engineering-related job and so I currently do data entry full-time.

I guess what I'm asking is... how screwed am I? I would like to try and improve my situation. Some ideas I have include taking the LEED Green Associate exam this summer because it is something that interests me (although I'm not sure how much employers would care) and joining an extra-curricular Solar House design team this summer.

I'm also doing some mobile app development for a course I'm taking this fall/spring so if things go south with the electrical job hunt, I can perhaps have a contingency plan and go into software.

Another thing is that I still live at home with my parents - I wanted to move out for the longest time but it just never ended up happening due to various reasons and it is one of the biggest things I regret. I feel like this would make me jumpy when job hunting after I graduate, looking for that first job that would let me get up on my financial feet, and not necessarily looking for the right job. Or is this not a valid concern because I should probably just pick the first semi-relevant engineering job due to my poor grades?

I know a lot of my thoughts are disjointed and that there is a lot of stuff here but I guess what I'm really asking is: am I in trouble for post-grad life in terms of jobs and if so, what can I do to remedy the situation? Any general advice for someone in my situation / what would you do?

Thank you for reading.

Carrying my laptop up/down Hearst is not very fun, so I've been looking into buses/shuttles.

I've known of the [H shuttle](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=207072823347146212274.0004b66e0462041827281&amp;msa=0), which goes around from Bart to Lawrence Lab. However, it doesn't run very often, and the number of stops also seem limited. After some googling, I've learned that there's a shuttle for LBNL called [""Blue Uphill/Downhill""](https://www.nextbus.com/predictor/stopSelector.jsp?a=lbl) that runs every 15 minutes. I was wondering if anyone knows whether Cal students can ride this bus, or is it just for the LBNL employees? 

Also, if I want to arrive at the workplace by 8:30 am, what time would be best to leave? I'm thinking 10 mins from Northside to Bart by bus, or 20 mins walking, 25-30 mins on Bart (stop at Montgomerry Station), 10 mins walk to workplace. Together, I think I should leave an hour in advance. How bad/crowded is Bart in the morning?

Apologies if these questions have been asked before, but I'm really nervous about this first internship. After getting some answers, I plan to ""test-drive"" tomorrow by riding whatever bus that goes down to Bart and calculating the time myself.

I declined and thought that was that.

A week later they called me up and asked if I would be interested in a technical writing position. I said I would be interested though I don't know anything about technical writing outside of writing lab reports.

I'm a transferring as a junior to CoE from a community college.

I may not be able to attend CalSo, as I just started a summer internship and I may not be able to get time off. If I can't, am I screwed? My registration date would be pushed back to mid-July, rather than early June. Will I have trouble getting into certain classes if I have to wait?

I'm not certain what my schedule will be, but here are a few classes I **might** be taking:

* EE 40 (4) Intro. to Microelectronic Circuits
* EE 20N (4) Structure and Interpretation of Systems and Signals
* CS 70 (4) Discrete Math and Probability Theory
* CS 61AS? (1-4) The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Self-Paced)

**Questions:**

0. How many units should I aim for?

1. Is it a bad idea to take EE 40 and EE 20N at the same time during my first semester?

2. Will I actually have to take 61A or 61AS? It seems to be an introductory programming course, but no equivalent is listed for the CC I'm transferring from. I've taken multiple programming classes, and am working as a software engineering intern right now -- how can I determine whether I'll still have to take either 61A or 61AS?

3. How can I find out which general ed/humanities classes will transfer? assist.org only lists those for the College of Letters and Sciences. The EECS website says which Berkeley courses fulfill those requirements, but not what their equivalents are at my CC.

4. Most of this information is supposed to be made available at CalSo. Where can I clarify these questions if I can't go to CalSo?

5. Do you have any general advice for transfer students? For EECS majors, or CoE students?

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.

Thanks! I'm incredibly excited about going to Cal."

So, a little background info on myself. I'm going to be a senior in the fall, and I'm a computer engineer. I'm well rehearsed in C/C++ and Java, and I'm interested in embedded systems. As for my career, I just want to integrate electronics into everyday life with microcontrollers. I'm stuck with a free summer this year (no internship woohoo :|). However, I have some classes and I'm going to graduate in the winter.
What should I do to make myself stand out from others in the field of embedded systems, and am I aiming too low for my career?

Second question: is there any good project idea that would prove I'd be a great software engineer? Or some sort of computer engineer, so that I can show off I can make a quality project and show off some creativity. I do have a 3D printer at my disposal.

Some ideas I already have are:

Eventually I started enjoying the classes. I really enjoyed learning the theoretical aspects of it, and all the amazing things people have figured out over the years. But I find the actual 40+ hour weeks of programming to be soul-crushing. At least in the two internships I've had I did. I absolutely HATE having to go through someone else's confusing uncommented code and figure out what the hell is going on so I can fix some bug. I hate having hours go by where I have nothing external to show for it, even though I have been running a mental marathon trying to figure out what the problem is with the code in front of me. 

At one of my internships, I feel like I basically bullshitted my way through most of it. It just felt like there was so much information to take in and I didn't quite grasp what all the different applications were doing. It seemed like some of the other interns picked up on it right away. I know I'm not stupid, but unfortunately computers really are not a passion of mine. So even though I can write software and I really appreciate the art of good software design, I don't know all the ancillary computer stuff that most cs guys seem to know because they really like computers. I see some people who I can just tell belong in cs and wouldn't belong anywhere else, and unfortunately I'm just not that person. I can write software, but it's just not a passion of mine. Although I did really love it the one time I worked on creating a project of my own. But anytime I have to sit down and work on the same boring financial application for a month straight, I start to die a little.

Can anyone else relate to my feelings, and if so did you ever find a cs job that you ended up really liking? And if so, what was it? Any advice?"

Will an internship such as this basically close the doors to getting interviews for junior software developer positions at good companies (from large ones like Microsoft and Google to the small firms all over)? Or will I still be able to have a shot at this. I absolutely despise this menial I.T. work, and only accepted this (min wage+$1) internship as it was the only offer I received (I started looking relatively late)."

1fdwtf,7,2013-05-31,Advice on completely an internship while having social anxiety.,throwthatawaymkay,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1fdwtf/advice_on_completely_an_internship_while_having/,"Hi! I’m a longtime lurker, first time poster. I'm very anxious in social situations. Specifically, I tend to dwell on past social situations for a long time and think about how stupid/wrong/dumb I was in a previous encounter and how I should never be social again. Then I start avoiding social situations, which is problematic now that I'm in a situation that demands constant social interaction.

 The thing you’re about to read are merely current symptoms of my worrying problem. It’s a lot of shit to describe my patterns of worry and how they apply to my current situation. So skip down if you want.  

I’m going to a shiny new Washington DC internship with an organization that I like a lot. And I’m scared shitless. The reasons are 1) I’m anxious 2) I rented a room in a house sight-unseen (they gave me pictures, but I didn’t visit) and am very anxious to meet the people I’m sharing the house with 3) I feel fucking incompetent half the time. I’ll go into detail about each on.

1) A little anxious. I do get anxious in social situations. Talking to people? Fuck that shit, it’s terrifying.  My heart races, I get sweaty palms, I usually blank out. I don’t know what the fuck to talk about unless I have a “mission” to tell someone something specific (eg – “did you know Governor Deal refused to endorse the Medicaid expansion? Here, take this pamphlet!”). Despite these problems, I can usually acknowledge in the moment that there’s no reason to freak out. They’re just people. But my body doesn’t seem to listen.  And on rare occasions I freak out completely. I'm currently in freak out mode with regards to my internship.

I recieved a mass email that was given to all the other interns discussing dress code, basic rules, blahblahblah. I’m coming out of town, and I though the other interns were too, so I sent a group email to the interns on the mass email thing asking if anyone had tips on finding affordable housing. Sure enough, several interns responded with similar concerns, which I was totally relieved about. 

So a few weeks pass, and I’m about to fly to DC. I send another group email suggesting that we meet up before the start date to make things less awkward on our first day as interns. Again, I’m thinking that out-of-towners won’t know anyone and might want to find one person to hang with. Doesn’t sound like I’m anxious at all, right? WRONG. I did this to push myself out of my comfort zone. I knew that I would freak out the first day and wouldn’t be able to function unless I knew someone a little bit. I knew that meeting up awkwardly for coffee would be a little better than meeting up while under the pressure of performing well on our first day. Even writing the email was bad, though. I got frustrated and mad that I didn’t know what to say in the email. I spent 2 hours on a 3 line email. But afterwards I got a little excited because the interns seemed really receptive to the housing email, and some even suggested rooming together. I thought people would really dig my carefully crafted email.

 Oh, how quickly my excitement melted into fear and doubt. I prefaced both emails by saying something to the effect of “let me know if you don’t want to get these mass emails. I know it’s weird to email people that you don’t know.” No one told me to remove them the first time around, but I still wrote it down. So sure enough, a person gives me a short “please remove me from this mass email”. She used the same words as I did - “mass email” – which bugged me and made me feel like she was mocking me. I’m sure the reader is thinking “what did the OP expect? Of course some people will be uncomfortable with mass emailing.” Yeah, some people will be uncomfortable. But why didn’t they express this in the first email? Is it me suggesting to go somewhere? Am I going to be considered “that girl” in the office that tries reallyreally hard to get to know people? Am I annoying this person? The only reason I’m doing it is because I know if I don’t try reallyreally hard, I will completely shut down to other people. So now I’m terrified that this person hates me for sending an email that they find repellent, trying too hard, and unnecessary. Like a mass email. Will/Do other interns feel similarly ( I just sent the email out today)? Should I have never sent out an email in the first place? Will this email ruin their first impressions of me? I literally can’t think of anything else.  I want to hide under a rock. When the other interns see me, they’ll think “there’s that mass email girl. Ugh.” I don't know how to control my thoughts at the moment.

2) Sight unseen. I know, reader. You’re thinking that it was dumb as fuck to rent a room sight unseen, right? Since I can’t spend 2000 bucks on a plane ticket to see my room, I really had no choice. So I did all the research I could on the person I was renting from (a family, actually), I looked up the coordinates of the house, and I asked trip advisor peeps about the neighborhood. It all checks out well. 

EXCEPT I’m so fucking terrified of meeting these people, making small talk with them every day when I go to the kitchen, and asking them for the wifi password. They’re picking me up from the airport upon my arrival, and I have no idea of what to say when I see them. I’m even more worried because their first generation immigrants, and it’s very difficult to understand them (on the phone at least). What if I can’t understand them? What if I offend them? I’m starting to think stuff like “well…I don’t have to use the kitchen…I can just live off of trail mix and water from the bathroom sink for 3 months!” I know that will be rough. How do I talk to people that I know nothing about, have nothing in common with, and might/might not understand? How do I relax?

3) Incompetence. This internship is with a nonprofit that I like a lot. It’s the kind of place where you’re always learning about what you don’t know. I feel like I’ll be less informed/less social/a total dumbass compared to the other people there. I sort of did that at my last internship. How do I not worry about that?

 

**tl;dr: I sent out a mass email that someone got annoyed with and I feel terrible about it. I’m moving into a house with people I don’t know and I don’t know how to talk to them. I feel fucking stupid. How do I stop getting anxious about these things?**

I'd prefer advice that doesn't involve medication or therapy - I cannot afford it.

Stop talking about how bad you wanna graduate (unless your a 5th year...), because the real world is just as freaking boring, just in other ways. Pretty much all of the engineers at the massive company I'm working for have a hard time holding a conversation, even the other interns. Just like working at Tech to get involved and meet people, it gets 10x harder when you start a job. Don't get caught in the grass is greener type mentality. College can be the best time of your life. Get out. Have fun.

Here at Tech, I first fit into another one of those in the first category I described: I felt that this place ruined me after my freshman year. I was absolutely unhappy with life because I didn't really do anything, developed some anxiety issues, and blamed this school for EVERYTHING. In my future years, I've taken the more laid back approach, calmed down a ton, met more people, taken up 100 different hobbies. I stopped blaming this place for making me a certain way, and learned that if one day is complete shit, tomorrow can only be better. If you can't figure out that thermo problem and it's 3 am, go the fuck to sleep. Tackle it tomorrow with some help from someone else in the class. I generally love life now, even at Tech. It's a little bit of work to get to know others, but it's so worth it. Tech really does contain some of the best people. We're all incredibly similar anyways right?

A lot of my friends/family have said I've come leaps and bounds in such a short time. My advice is to do what everyone is posting about now! Get involved. Meet some other people. You'll find some gems in this school. Stop blaming this place for certain issues. Is it Tech's fault that I took life way too seriously and studied myself into depression? Yes, you have to work when you get here, but working hard doesn't have to make you unhappy.

Please let me know your opinions here. I haven't really shared much of my story, but I guess some advice to any incoming freshmen or students that are having a rough time. Let me know what you think.
