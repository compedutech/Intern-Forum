My boss as kindly asked me to individually copy and paste his client files from one server to another, no big deal.  Normally I would copy and paste the entire folder, but there's so much data and I'm working off such an ancient PC, that our IT guy instructed me to do it individually for fear of the system crashing.  Fuck.  There's around 400+ files, and each one takes 10-20 minutes to transfer.  As much as I would love to sit around all day looking at Reddit, I would much rather find a program that would automatically copy and paste one folder after the previous one had finished so I can get out of here.  any help, or suggestions would be great!

I want some real life experience, and I just happened to be pretty good and interested about computers. I'm completely self taught and passed the APCS test. Is there any good places to intern next year or methods of finding such? I've primarily worked in Python, with dabbing here and there in Java, C++, and Octave (MATLAB clone). I know that it'd be most helpful to get up to skill on C++ and maybe actually take a class to see what it's like, but I really want to get an internship next summer for the experience, and thought I'd start planning now. Any ideas?"
9if5f,1,2009-09-08,I think I don't like my master's thesis project &amp; internship. What should I do? No backup project. Advise wanted...,logan23,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9if5f/i_think_i_dont_like_my_masters_thesis_project/,"Dear fellow Redditors!

I'm studying Bioinformatics with an emphasis on informatics and software engineering. Currently I am doing an internship in a laboratory with some ties to developing bioinformatic tools. 

problems:

- my boss is a strange fella and nobody actually likes him as a person. he treats people like shit and  he seems a bit bipolar - one minute sunshine, the other minute he is mad like a thunderstorm. people left the lab just because of his presence. 
he also lies about some things, which is really annoying. scientific discussions are very hard because he wants to have the last word with everything.

- the project i'm working on is not very satisfyng. It seems that it has just been made up of ""stuff"" that nobody else wants to do. Hence, my motiviation level is not very high. And it's not very informatic, it's more like 3d modelling and i have never worked in this field before.

Additionally i want to do a big software engineering project, where i can show my skills in GPU programming...

It's hard for me to find a field in bioinformatics i can speciallize in. That's the reason I'm doing this internship right now. I don't know in what other field i want to work. 

MY QUESTIONS:

- should i quit and find some other internship? Right now I don't even have a signed contract (boss has problems with organizing it), but I planned on staying here until next year. Which is a very long time.

- are there any bioinformaticions out there that can help me with finding the right field for me?

- does someone have a cool bioinformatics project or internship available? especially if it's GPU programming related, but i also like plain C/C++, Java or C# projects.

What do i like in Bioinformatics?
Sequence Alignment, Signal Processing (i'm working in this field right now), Protein Structure prediction/modelling
not so much: Biostatistics (because it involves not so much programming)

EDIT: gpu computing is for me: using Nvidia CUDA or OpenCL.

9imj5,1,2009-09-08,Just got my final review for an internship.  How do I improve my soft skills?,bluepojo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9imj5/just_got_my_final_review_for_an_internship_how_do/,"All through school and in my personal time I've focused much of my attention on my technical skills (I'm a software engineer).  

As a result, I was told that my technical skills are ""very solid"" but my soft skills need improvement, most specifically on how/when I ask questions when I need help.  Has anyone else had a similar need for improvement? What did you do to fix it?

A bit more about me:
I'm not very social to begin with, and most of my projects have been done individually, till this internship.  My previous internship was mostly working on my own stuff, though I did work as part of a scrum team, and sometimes worked with the other developers. My first internship was 100% solo. As a result, my team work experience is more limited than it should be, and I'm not sure what the best way to fix it is."

How should I put this on my resume (if at all...?) without detracting from my current achievements? Also, any tips about including things that I plan to learn (verilog, VHDL, ect. in our labs...)? Also, resume templates would be helpful. I feel my current resume looks tacky and doesn't say anything. "

I have done well (A's and B's) in most of my computer science related classes, however I have gottten straight C's in all my math classes, and done flip-floppy in my GenEds.

During one summer I worked in an internship for an insurance company(helping to fix some of their automated month-end closing software), thats all I really have to put on my resume.

Do I have a chance to get in?  And if so is there anything I can do to possibly boost my chances (other than somehow make all of the other applicants suddenly go missing.)

I don't know much about applying to GradSchool so I was hoping maybe someone out there who has gone could give some helpful input.

I'm 28.  I do not have a college degree.  I am 18 credits shy of my Comp. Sci degree (all upper level computer science credits).  I am strongly considering finishing my degree- I just don't know that I'm interested in being a programmer and that is what my degree seems to lead to.

I have been working in my city's IT department as an intern for nearly two years.   My job responsibilities range from standard desktop and some network troubleshooting to large scale projects.   My most recent (and biggest) accomplishment is the installation of a voting/sound/video system in our city's council chambers.  

I like a lot of what I do.   The ideal job for me would be one that involves a lot of problem solving or research as opposed to the mindless desktop support.  The ideal business would probably be a bit smaller/not so corporate.  I think I would be happiest wearing many hats.

Anyone have any advice on what kind of path to take? Job titles/education/certifications/etc.   Thanks for reading!"
