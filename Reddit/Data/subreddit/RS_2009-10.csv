9q6d9,5,2009-10-02,I have been interning at a company for a 4 months and I'm about to graduate. How do I ask my boss for a full-time position?,GraduatingIntern,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9q6d9/i_have_been_interning_at_a_company_for_a_4_months/,"So here's my situation. I have been interning at a small software company for a few months. I will be graduating this December with a MSE in Electrical Engineering, after which I will be seeking full-time employment. I really enjoy working at this company and I would like to continue here full-time, but I don't know what's the proper/professional way to bring this up to my boss. I think my boss likes me and what I have accomplished but I'm worried because we recently hired another intern and a full-time (in an already small company). So Reddit, I need your advice. What should I say? Should I speak with him in person or send a formal email? What should I do if he says no?"
9qab5,6,2009-10-02,AskReddit: My wife and I want to have a child but are worried about financing/insurance - any suggestions?,throwaway103,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9qab5/askreddit_my_wife_and_i_want_to_have_a_child_but/,"My wife and I are approaching 30. We've been wanting to have a kid for several years but have put it off because we haven't been as financially stable as we like. We both went to college, and I went on to get a MBA. During this time we wanted to wait until I had a stable, decent job. Then the grand ol' recession happened. 

My wife currently has a job with limited insurance and income. It looks like (after several months of looking) a job is not impending in my immediate future. It's actually looking like I may need to go back to doing an internship just to keep my resume from getting too much white space. Very depressing. 

So it seems like it could easily be 1-2 years before I have a decent job. We really don't want to wait that long. We've considered private insurance (buying a plan through bluecross, etc) but they're expensive and I have sincere concerns they'd just try to screw us over if we got pregnant a month after getting the plan. 

Does anyone have recommendations? Good insurance plans for purchase? Alternative ways to limit the costs associated the having the baby? Think we should just keep waiting?

Thanks"
9qm60,1,2009-10-03,Grad School: Now or Later?,unsureCSgirl,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/9qm60/grad_school_now_or_later/,"Hey, reddit. I'm a female CS (omg we do exist on the intarwebz!) and linguistics double-major in my last year as an undergrad at a prestigious US university. The current plan is to apply to CS graduate programs to do work on natural language processing/computational linguistics, whichever title floats your boat. Information extraction/retrieval seems like a beautiful fit for me, given my particular set of interests.

My primary worry is that I'm only applying to PhD programs so that I can finally prove to myself that I really *am* smart--but not because I truly want to do research for the next 5 years. In the past I've done well academically (3.7 GPA), but have always felt like I've been ""faking"" my way through it. That being said, this past summer I had a really fascinating internship which really piqued my curiosity and interest.

Is this kind of academic insecurity normal? Should I be concerned or is this merely a quarter life crisis? Half of me feels like I'm over-reacting, but the other half thinks some time off would be good for me. What say you?

**UPDATE** (2/11/10): I applied anyway, figuring I could make the decision later and would only be out the application fees. Just got offered a spot at a good program with a great stipend and am not lamenting my decision to apply. Thanks again for all your advice!"
9tuxg,0,2009-10-14,AskReddit for Career Advice: Should I quite my permanent job in support for a contract in development?,fuckmyjob,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9tuxg/askreddit_for_career_advice_should_i_quite_my/,"Throwaway account to protect myself/current employer. 

Let me start by sending condolences to unemployed Redditors. Since I seem to have too many jobs send your resume to fckmyjob.temp@gmail.com if you live in Portland, OR and I'll see about sending it to whichever of these two companies I *don't* go with -- if you're qualified at least in my eyes.

So, here's the scoop: I recently graduated from university with a degree in Computer Science and I've been working a permanent job in support at a not-so-startup startup for about 6 months now. I had a chance to interview with a Fortune 100 company for a junior developer role about 4 weeks ago. I didn't get an offer -- everything went super well until my last interview in the loop which was with the VP...I ended up saying some really dumb stuff...but the director of the org and I got along really well. 

Anyway, he called me up a few weeks later and asked if I'd be interested in a dev contract at this Fortune 100. I initially said that I indeed would but I'm starting to get cold feet. It's strictly contract so there is no guarantee of work after the terms are up (6 months), but he did mention that if I prove to be good hopefully a perm. job would be open by then...or maybe if there was more work I could get back on contract with them...

Here's a breakdown of the ups and downs that I see:

**Positives**

* Biggest in my eyes: My support job makes me want to throw myself down a well
* Contract is with a Fortune 100 company with growth this year
* Really really want to work in development...in fact, all my previous jobs were in dev.
* Working with technology that I know very well and want to build a career on (.NET)
* Would get first-hand experience working at this Fortune 100 company and make some really good contacts within
* Would be making *lots* more money than I am now -- about $13/hr more
* Get to work better hours (currently working midnight-9:00am)

**Negatives**

* Only 6 month terms and *not* contract-to-hire
* Shit economy
* Current benefits are awesome! Health insurance, dental, vision, 401k, pretty good PTO, really great package.
* Girlfriend's internship is up at the same time as the contract ends. She is my roommate so there is a possibility that we would *both* be out of work at the same time.
* Current company is showing pretty good growth, possibility that the options I currently have would indeed be worth quite a bit one day...but also a Fortune 50 company has just entered our market so this might be moot in a couple months :)

I'm tired of thinking through this on my own, I would love to hear what your guys' perspective is on this!

Help me Reddit hive mind, you're my only hope!

How do I handle the responsibilities of my job, without being stressed out every single day?",stressedout_itworker,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9um7q/reddit_please_help_me_how_do_i_handle_the/,"I don't want to get into too many details, because my position is fairly specific, but I am a computer technician at the University Level, but am also in charge of a lot of University Purchasing, and also what amounts to being a retail manager all at the same time.

I started this job several months ago, and liked it because it allows me to interface with a lot of different people at different levels, from sales to support. The problem is that with the new school year, the workload is atrocious.

Right now, I have 14 repairs in transit. On top of that, I have been commissioned to facilitate and support a number of technology related workshops for the faculty, student, and staff of our University. I am also held accountable for tracking all of this in a CMS, which I am responsible for creating. I also manage several interns and give them day-to-day advice. I also manage a good amount of University Purchasing, and handle just about any and all administrative tasks.

My boss won't hire any help outside of my interns, who are there a limited amount of time, and have no interest in taking on any of my workload.

With everything I have to do, I don't have enough hours in the day. I rarely take lunches (For which I am admonished for, because I am an hourly employee), and every day I leave work with a stress induced headache. I even noticed hair falling out and my hairs are greying even quicker than before. I'm in my mid-20s. I came home this evening and slept for two hours, and that's why I'm now wake at 2am.

My boss's advice is to simply breathe. And to realize I can't help everybody. But he doesn't see it from a day-to-day perspective. I hate telling people NO, and frankly, most of the people I work with don't take NO for an answer.

And the pay is way less than what other repair technicians are making. I'd quit, but I live hand-to-mouth, paycheck to paycheck. So leaving right now would royally fuck me.

How can I not be so damned stressed out? I dread coming into work everyday, because there's always a storm brewing."

I am almost finished with my Masters (which doesn't matter to me at all), and on track to advance to PhD candidacy this spring. I'm officially in Cognitive Science, but practically I'm studying machine learning. I'm doing quite well by most standards : I have a few papers already as co-author, more in progress, and more funding than I can spend. I don't have to teach or take classes this year. My advisor is a dream; always supportive, never pressuring, and has all the right connections and knowledge. 

The biggest pressure is from my on again / off again girlfriend, and while that can fill a few threads of its own, for here I will just say that she constantly reminds me that I'm not where I could be in life right now, and that I could be making six figures easily, which is true. I was a CS major at CMU. 

Part of the problem is that I'm trying to deal with Southern California, which even as one of the better-paid students in my department, is hardly survivable at my stipend level. 

At this point, I like the work and doing research, but I am feeling stifled socially, and am really sick of grad students, but I'm watching my expenses so tightly even a burger and beer can feel like a stretch. Its not really possible to have a social life under these circumstances. 

So I'm thinking of either taking on consulting work, or just leaving for good. I've had a few interviews but never really took them seriously, and I've been so focused on academia for so long I'm missing things like internships in industry (opting to work in labs over the summer for research experience). I'm interested in consulting, but I have no idea what to do : I have a very specialised and particular set of skills in machine learning which are my most valuable asset, and while I could get a job simply programming or doing web development, I am not sure that I'm best suited for that, or that I can even be competitive, i.e. I don't think finding stuff on rentacoder.com is going to work for me. My advisor has sent most of her students out into industry after the graduate, but has no industry experience herself. "

Hey Reddit,

Since I didn’t feel like going to the bar across the street tonight.  I’m feeling very introverted.  So you all get to play bartenders.  Prior to the last 3 years my romantic life was f’ed up. 

My previous serious relationship lasted for 8 years.  4 of which were in a marriage.  This was with my high school sweetheart.  Whom at the time was a smoking hot Latina.  I would have done anything for this chick.  Yeah, I'm a sucker who got burned.  It happens to the best of us.  It was some fucked up stuff out of a Springer show.  One of those things that when you’re watching the show and you’re like that shit wouldn't ever happen to me - it does.  I didn't see the divorce coming.  But she had been planning it for months.  When I acknowledged that we had some relationship issues I was down for going to counseling.  Which she asked me to go - I agreed.  A month after counseling she told me that she had a big secret to tell me.  We need to separate, cuz she thinks she's gay and needs to move on in her life.  Of course she tells me this after I took out a big loan on my own credit for her own business six months before.  She tells me that chicks have been turning her on for a long time.  And demands a divorce because she needs a new life.  This shit continues to fuck with my mind 4 years later. I went to see a counselor for a while.  Then couldn't afford it and stopped.  The worst thing is that lez porn no longer turns me on.  Sad, I know. LOL Not my fault.  It's just life.  Anyways, enough with this dreary trash that I had to experience.

My life has improved.  I took a better, higher paying job since this whole experience and have recently received a raise and a promotion.  Most importantly I paid off this crazy bitch's debt.  I have the support of my friends and family and a good life.  And have also been putting myself back out there. 

 I found this great gal who is gorgeous and also has a brain.  Knew her from back in the day and reconnected on FB.  Seems like a rarity too find these days! Bimbos are a dime a dozen here in LA.  The big issue at hand is she's on the east coast and I'm in Cali.  We've been doing a long distance thing for a year now.  I go out there, she comes out here.  Last time I saw her it was this summer for a month.  This is my 1st serious relationship since the above bitter breakup.  She is finishing her PhD out there.  When we 1st started seeing each other we agreed to see where things would go.  Originally she agreed to moving out here and I in turn said I was open to the possibility of moving back east.  The issue now is she has mentioned she is no longer open to moving out west.  She wants me to move east.  Her reasons are school, family, and so she can intern there.  She’s also making promises when it comes to the longer term if I move out. Which came as highly unexpected.  We still are really interested in each other.  She’s coming out here in a week and later next month too.   Part of me wants to go for it and part of me wants to play it conservative. I don’t want to give up my life for someone else.  Already did that shit and it sucked.  If I went for it I would continue to wait out the economy for a bit.  I’ve had so much good happen to me that I’m crazy fearful of getting pissed on again.  However, I have feelings for this girl and we really get along well.  Plus she's not immature.  A big +. So reddit, what would you do?  I would appreciate the brutal honest advice from my fellow redditers.  Ask me anything

This summer I had my first real taste of what the corporate worker's 8-5 workday was like at an internship and I hated it. It's not as if I don't enjoy what I do, and I did enjoy my job here and there, but for the majority (85+%) of the time I was dying in my cubicle. I'm not a lazy person, but this felt like torture. Is this normal at all? 

Ever since then I've been dreading graduation, but the year creeps on and it's getting ever closer. I've been giving a lot of thought to the subject and I'm having a hard time justifying selling the majority of my waking life so that I can continue selling the majority of my waking life (and a bit of free time here and there in the form of weekends and evenings). I've even been getting really depressed lately thinking about it. 

Has anyone else gone through this? Is there any advice someone could give me to help me through this time in my life? Any comments?

9ye1u,1,2009-10-27,Student deciding whether it's time to live by himself for the first time- see text for more details ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9ye1u/student_deciding_whether_its_time_to_live_by/,"Hi Reddit, 
Long timer reader first time poster. Liked some interesting discussions I've read so thought I'd throw my current dilema out there.

A little about me:
I'm a 21 year old college student starting a condensed masters program in electrical engineering- I'll graduate June '11 in 5 years total. I'm in a lot of debt and paying my way through school by my (future) self, but I have been taking school seriously; I already have two internships and have interviewed for this upcoming summer with a few companies. 

My problem:
The people I live with. Mainly two guys, out of 5 of us. One is a year younger, he's generally immature. Unable to articulate himself (ie saying a sentence with out “shit” or “fuck”), messy, obsessed with computers and is always planning out what new computer his parents will buy him next. Always trys to talk to be about god damn computers. The other has been my friend since high school. We started hanging out because we both liked smoking pot. In a nutshell he has already dropped out of school and came back for rehab due to oxy-cotton addiction (thankfully I have never had a problem with drugs intruding in my life). 

More info about this dude:
He is just the epitome of a spoiled kid, given too much attention when he was young, and now the defining characteristic of his life is his drug addiction and subsequent recovery. His mom is very wealthy and always working, so when we were young we would always go to his house and smoke. He has driven a $27k car since he was 16, despite that he failed his drivers test twice before he got a license. He is very selfish, inconsiderate, and insensitive. Shortly after sobriety he got a girlfriend; if it wasn't for her, he probably wouldn't be back in school right now. He talks on the phone for hours every night. He cannot take any criticism and gets very defensive when you ask him to clean up after himself. It's very childish. He has never cleaned anything, let alone his room. His girlfriend does that for him. The type of guy that'll take his laundry home so his mom can do it for him, and is only taking 12 units a quarter so he can 'get good grades so he can get a PhD eventually' (because he likes the image of being respectable) all the while school is a free ride for him. He craves attention, he sings loudly and love it when people compliment him and laugh at his jokes.  
And of course, his mom owns the house we are all living in. 

The house:
Lived here two years, this is start of the third year. Last 2 weeks I had been studying for the EIT so I would be on campus 14 hours a day. The kitchen became atrocious. Ants all over the place, it took me 3 loads in the dishwasher to clean all our stuff. Happens all the time, a lot of dissemination of responsibility. People leave doors open, no one ever locks anything, and lights are left on all the time. Bills are split 5 ways (I pay them and collect money from everyone, no on else can handle that responsibility), so even though I don't want TV and don't waste electricity I pay for it. 

To the question:
So my original question was going to be: should I move out on my own, in a little studio type of thing? But I realized I already know the answer to that, the question I need to be concerned with is why am I so hesitant. Why do I see it as so difficult to confront him about all this? I feel like his mom must- “anything for you &lt;name&gt;!” Can anyone relate to this situation? I will have to give me 30 days notice in mid nov, so after finals in mid dec I'll move out. 

Additional reasons I should move out:
-Dad just got a new job and for the first time can afford to help me financially in school; already said he is willing to compensate additional costs if I move out
-Would be able to concentrate on school more.. which is important considering I'll be taking 500 level EE courses
-Would be free from what I consider a stale living situation. I am the maturest person in the house, no one there is really making me grow... 
-Just a change in general, and a new challenge for me
