 The problem is I was suppose to be in the academy twice now, and twice it fell through due to state budget cuts (I live in New York).  I have a new born and I am living at my moms house (I'm 23) with my girlfriend because were saving money to get on our feet (and my mom loves her grandson).  I need to make this police offer thing happen and I am sick of them telling me ""maybe next year"".  I know its not their fault but I need to move on and start my career. 

So any police officers who browse reddit, my questions to you are where do you work? and how did you get in?  is your dept hiring? do you know of any departments hiring? or do you know of any departments with a fast hiring process? as most of them take almost a year to complete."

cndat,1,2010-07-08,Dear reddit: I have to interview a movie director this week. I've never done an interview. Can you help me think of some intriguing questions to ask him?,starving_artisan,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cndat/dear_reddit_i_have_to_interview_a_movie_director/,"My boss at my internship just sort of threw this task on me this week. I'm an intern - limited to filing, shredding, and restocking toilet paper. What am I supposed to know about conducting interviews? Well, I hope to do a great job - maybe I'll end up getting paid at some point, but I'm totally stuck as to what sort of questions to ask this guy.

The movie is called *Restrepo*. Basically these camera guys followed around US soldiers in Afghanistan while they were in combat. Here's what the press release says about it:


Restrepo, a feature-length documentary that chronicles the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers inAfghanistan's Korengal Valley. The movie focuses on a remote 15-man outpost, ""Restrepo,"" named after a platoon medic who was killed in action. It was considered one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. military. This is an entirely experiential film: the cameras never leave the valley; there are no interviews with generals or diplomats. The only goal is to make viewers feel as if they have just been through a 94-minute deployment. This is war, full stop. The conclusions are up to you.

 
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT
The war in Afghanistan has become highly politicized, but soldiers rarely take part in that discussion. Our intention was to capture the experience of combat, boredom and fear through the eyes of the soldiers themselves. Their lives were our lives: we did not sit down with their families, we did not interview Afghans, we did not explore geopolitical debates. Soldiers are living and fighting and dying at remote outposts in Afghanistan in conditions that few Americans back home can imagine. Their experiences are important to understand, regardless of one’s political beliefs. Beliefs can be a way to avoid looking at reality. This is reality.


Starting in June 2007, Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger dug in with the men of Second Platoon, making a total of ten trips to the Korengal on assignment for Vanity Fair Magazine and ABC News. Each trip started with a helicopter flight into the main firebase in the valley and then a two-hour foot patrol out to Restrepo. There was no running water at Restrepo, no internet, no phone communication, and for a while, there was no electricity or heat; it was essentially just sandbags and ammo. Some days the outpost was attacked three or four times from distances as close as fifty yards. Hetherington and Junger – sometimes working together, sometimes alone – did everything the soldiers did except pull guard duty and shoot back during firefights. They slept alongside the soldiers, ate with them, survived the boredom and the heat and the cold and the flies with them, went on patrol with them, and eventually came to be considered virtually part of the platoon. By the end of the deployment, they had shot a total of 150 hours of combat, boredom, humor, terror, and daily life at the outpost.

 
Conditions for filmmaking couldn’t have been harsher. The surrounding mountains rose to a height of 10,000 feet – all of which was traversed on foot. Long operations meant carrying enough camera batteries to last a week or more, on top of the fifty or so pounds of gear required on even ordinary patrols. Cameras got smashed into rocks, clogged with dirt and hit with shell cartridges during firefights. Men were killed and wounded during filming, so there was a constant issue of when it was OK to turn on the cameras and when it was not. Only the filmmakers’ close relationship to the men of the platoon allowed them to keep shooting in situations where other journalists might have been told to stop. Three months after the end of the deployment, Hetherington and Junger traveled to Vicenza, Italy, where the unit is based. They used two Veri-Cams, a full light and sound package, and two cameramen to conduct in-depth interviews with their main characters. These interviews – initially considered a kind of glue for the verité, and a way to avoid outside narration – wound up being some of the most powerful and affecting material of the entire project. The soldiers were able to allow themselves a level of emotion and introspection that is simply not possible in combat.



Sorry if that's a lot (it is). I've thought of looking over other interviews of journalists stationed in the Middle East and mimicking their interviews, at least for a start. But I know all you reddit people are awesome and might have some good ideas."
cnjr4,0,2010-07-08,I just got fired...,justgotletgo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cnjr4/i_just_got_fired/,"Basically since orientation it seems my manager had it out for me.

My ex-company requires new hires to complete some online training courses but since I was an intern and my internship wasn't going to last until the due date of the courses I made a **joke** about how I wouldn't need to do them. My manager was sitting at my table. I completed those courses within 2 weeks of starting and none of the other interns have done so, atleast as of this past Monday. She brought the joke up in the meeting, and when I heard that given as reason, I just looked at her and was thinking WTF?!?!? and she just looked at me and does the shoulder raise. Can't really describe what she did but it seemed she purposefully worded it in a way as to detract from my work. 

They complained about my attendance. Some of it was truth but most of it was either lies or half-truths said in a fashion to make it look bad. For example, I told my manager that one morning I need to go pick up my granddad and dad from the airport but told the supervisor that my dad picked him up and I have to go pick him up from the airport. I later realized I phrased that pretty badly and when I couldn't find my supervisor through phone, email, or visiting her office to offer a clarification, I told my manager instead. I asked her to relay this information to my supervisor but she did not. That incident was brought up in the meeting. There is a whole list of other stuff like this and if anyone actually reads this and wants more, I'll tell them in an edit.

What I really want to know however is that does anyone know if it is the law to give an intern (full-time) two week notice or can they just terminate me on the spot?

I actually made a few comments to some other interns that I was either going to be fired or quit because my boss has it out for me. I said this maybe 2 weeks ago.

**tl;dr:** Can a company legally terminate a full-time intern without 2 weeks notice?"
co8gw,1,2010-07-11,"Reddit, should I feel guilty about using my parents' money to pay for an apartment during my senior year of undergrad, when I can just commute instead?",DeathByDoubleDip,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/co8gw/reddit_should_i_feel_guilty_about_using_my/,"So I attend a public university in Southern California and I have commuted to classes from home for the past 3 years (10 miles ~ 30 min. drive on surface streets) and I have 1 year remaining. Rent for me alone (I have 5 other roommates in this 3-bedroom thing) is $750/mo. for a furnished apartment, which comes out to $9000 for a whole year, $7500 for the time I plan to stay (I'm hoping to find someone else to take over the contract for the summer). I signed the lease a few months ago, but they mentioned that I could find someone to replace me on the lease at any time. I don't move in until September. I asked my parents twice if they were fine with paying for it, with me covering all the utilities and food with my own money.

Earlier, I was completely fine about staying at this place, but now I'm thinking I'd be chipping away at my parents' finances too much (we're middle-class). Part of me keeps feeling like I'm acting like some type of selfish entitlement brat by just letting them foot the bill and not looking back. 

On one hand, I feel perfectly fine about commuting to school for yet another year, even though everyone keeps throwing hypotheticals at me such as ""Well, what if you want to take a girl back to your place? Oh, wait..."" . Learning how to live on my own isn't really an issue here, since I'm in an apartment for an internship this summer.

So I'm curious, Reddit. What do you think?

tl;dr I signed the lease for an allegedly expensive apartment being paid for by my parents, who're okay with footing the bill. Am I a selfish prick?


Update: I am now trying to find someone to replace me on the list, and if time permits, hopefully find a cheaper place I can afford on my own. Thanks again."

cqptb,40,2010-07-17,Late at work,fermion72,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cqptb/late_at_work/,"I'm back in engineering graduate school, and this summer I landed a great internship at a big tech company in the Northeast.  The company is located in a giant, oddly shaped building off of a minor highway, forty-five minutes or so outside of a large city.  It's relatively rural, in other words, surrounded by forest on three sides, with a large parking lot that winds down to the road.  As I said, the building has a strange shape -- it's mostly square, but there is one corner which forms a ""V,"" and my cubicle happens to be right in the upper corner of one side of the V, such that I (and my cubemates -- we might have a corner-cube with windows, but there are three of us in here!) look out one of the large windows more or less directly into the windows in the other side of the V.  For some reason, that part of the building is vacant (I think the plan is to expand over there), and all that I can see is a couple of chairs and a fold-up table propped next to one of the windows.  It's a pretty big open space altogether.

Now, I used to be a high school teacher, and as it turns out I was asked if I could teach summer school in the same city where I'm working (it was a strange coincidence that I'm in town, actually).  Because of my full-time job, I declined the offer, but the school was in a bind and desperately needed a substitute teacher for one week, and I asked my boss if I could take the mornings off for one week and come into work late.  He said that was fine, as long as I worked a full 40-hour week, meaning I'd be in the office until 8 or 9pm each day that I taught.  I figured that I could handle 13-hour days for a week, so I decided to do it.  So, last Monday, I taught in the morning, and arrived at work at about 1pm.

The first couple of days of my evening work-week were pretty typical.  The office was bustling until about 5:30pm, at which time people started to trickle out of the office.  Most of the lights stayed on, but they must be on some sort of timer, because at about 7pm about half of the lights went out, and the office definitely seemed more deserted, and it had that ghost-town feel to it.  But, I had my work to do, and I didn't really notice.  I finished up about 8:30pm, turned off my computer, and headed down to my car, which I parked about half-way across the large parking lot.

Wednesday night, though, things got a bit strange.  First of all, more lights than normal went off at 7pm, and there were probably only about twenty percent of the lights on.  I definitely noticed, but didn't worry about it, and I didn't really mind working in the semi-dark.  As I went to leave that night, I went to open the door into the main hallway (it's got a sensor that unlocks it when you walk up), but it didn't open automatically.  I had to manually press a switch that unlocked the door.  Again, no worries -- maybe the sensor was on the same switch as the darkened lights.  I walked down the hall and down the main staircase, out the front door, and then into the parking lot, over to my car, which was alone in the center of the lot.  It was dark out, but the moon was shining, and the car glistened in the moonlight.  The car happened to be facing towards the building, and as I got into my car to leave, I happened to look back at the building, and I noticed that the empty room on the other side of the V had the lights on.  I thought this was odd, as I would have thought I would have noticed it from my darkened office right next to it.  I didn't really think too much of it, though, and I turned on the radio and went my way.

Thursday night, almost all of the lights went out at 7pm.  I began to think this was strange, being in my giant building all alone with the lights out, and I did start to get a bit creeped out.  I jumped when the A/C fan went on at one point, and I began to hear what I thought were steps along the cubes next to me.  I also thought I heard someone typing on the computer in the cube directly on the opposite side of where I sit.  I figured I was just tired, from the long days and all the work.  At about 8pm, I was sitting at my desk when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the lights in the empty room had suddenly gone on.  As I swung my head over to look, they immediately went off, but I thought that I had seen a tall figure standing in the room, facing me from the window (which is about 15 feet from my window).  I got a cold shiver straight down my spine, and I decided that I'd worked enough for the day.  I packed up and got ready to leave.  I made my way (in the dark) towards the door but of course the automatic switch on the door didn't work again. Unfortunately, neither did the manual switch.  I panicked a bit, but then noticed an exit sign all the way down the other end of the hall, and I made my way towards it.  I ended up at another stairway (lighted, thankfully) and I went downstairs and found another exit out of the building.  It was a darker night, and I quickly made my way to my car, jumped in and tore out of the parking lot.

Friday night (last night) was my last day with the crazy schedule.  All afternoon I kept thinking about what might happen after everyone else had left, and I was already nervous by about 6:30pm.  At 7pm, the entire building went dark; the only light came from my computer monitor, and it gave my cube an eerie glow.  I could barely see to type, and I jumped at every little sound.  Again, I thought I heard typing, and there seemed to be more steps next to my cube.  I didn't dare leave the cube, but I started to plan my escape, wondering what was really going on.  By 7:30pm I had had enough, but just then I heard tapping on the window next to me (towards the empty office).  I almost had a heart attack, until I realized that it was just rain -- a storm had quickly blown in, and it was pouring out.  I took a deep breath, and finished putting my stuff away.  As I clicked off the computer monitor and stood up (leaving me in complete darkness), there was a tremendous bolt of lightning outside.  I turned to look, facing the empty office, and there was another huge lightning bolt.  The entire office next door was lit up.  And in each of the five windows stood a figure, arms at his sides, staring directly back at me.  I screamed and it was, of course, instantly dark again.  I totally panicked, grabbed my bag and went running for the door.  Amazingly, it opened with the manual switch, but the door to the stairway I normally took was locked--I didn't even know you could lock stairway doors.  I didn't know what I was going to do and then I noticed that there was a lighted exit sign down a different hallway, one which I had never been down.  As I started running towards the exit sign I realized -- I was running in the same direction as the empty office.  I stopped dead in my tracks, and didn't know what to do.  I decided to go for it, and I bolted towards the sign, which was like a glowing lighthouse -- the only thing I could see.  Just as I passed what must have been the doors to the empty office, the doors flew open, and I got knocked sideways, like I'd been hit by a train.  I careened into the wall, but somehow I managed to keep running.  I didn't dare look behind me, but somehow kept running for the stairs.  The next thing I knew, I was down the stairs and outside, into the thunderstorm.  I rushed to my car, fumbled with my keys and lept into it, driving as fast as I could out of the lot, towards home.

I didn't sleep much last night, but this morning as I was watching TV while eating breakfast, I saw a news report that said there had been a tornado that had gone through the town where I work.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw my building--they were showing the corner V and you could see that the empty office had been blown to smithereens.  I haven't talked to anyone from work yet today, but I'm definitely glad that my crazy week is over.

cr08i,24,2010-07-18,My Internet startup nightmare story,mexicatl,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/cr08i/my_internet_startup_nightmare_story/,"Six months ago, I had a couple of free weeks before leaving on vacation when I saw an ad on the university website put up by dotcom company looking for someone to do data entry. I show up the next day and they explain that the job was to put sample content on the website. I spend the next few hours hacking an interface into their back office and creating a database of content from the web to upload. At the end of the day, I explain that I can automate the process and instead of it taking two people two weeks, I can have it done in a couple of days.

The CEO was impressed even though the solution seemed rather obvious. I finish the job and I start helping them out with other things. I rewrite their terrible English and Spanish copy, write up a basic marketing strategy and give feedback on the website. I start understanding the business model and to see its potential. I'm also duly impressed by their big name partners but notice the CEO knows next to nothing about computers or the Internet.

So a week before leaving, I ask the CEO if he's looking to hire. I tell him that they need someone like me who has startup experience, having worked at a few already and owning equity in all of them. He tells me that all they're looking for is interns, so I tell him that I understand given that the website is about to launch and that I was willing to accept a short ""internship"", maybe some stock options and a basic stipend to pay for my expenses. He agrees and says he'll draw up a contract.

So I start work, seven days a week. I work during my vacation, developing new partners and searching for marketing firms. He showers me with compliments and sends out an email to his partners and investors saying I am the new Marketing Manager. Awesome I think.

I get back and keep the same pace. I'm work every day until 10-11pm. I review operations completely and keep developing the partner network. Mid-March, I get bumped to Director of Business Development. I start getting results, but negotiations promise to take months.

End of March, the CEO announces there is no more money, out of nearly a million Swiss francs initial investment two years ago, and that salaries would not be paid. People quit, leaving just the CEO, his assistant and me. At this point, I am managing most the operational aspects of the firm while they look for funding. I never get a contract, not even an NDA.

Potential investors come and go, but nobody invests. Our developers and some service providers start freezing our accounts, but we continue more or less getting by operationally. I spend hours everyday in emergency meetings. Late May, the CEO cedes 1% of the company to me, but still no salaries. He starts complaining of having no money. Morale continues dropping.

End of June arrives and there's still no funding, so I inform the CEO and the Board that I am leaving. I explain that my savings have been used up and I have no other choice, even if I am a shareholder. A Rolls-Royce driving board member/investor advances my back salaries and a few thousand more for operations at the last moment though and my financial situation now stabilized, I continue working.

To cut costs, we leave our offices and start working from home. He fires the assistant. I am now the only employee aside from the CEO. He continually complains of being broke, accusing me of having money saved up and even hinting to me and the board that he's going to kill himself. He seems less and less stable. I continue working.

Then last Wednesday, I get a CCed email from him to the board, accusing me of working on the side and no longer being implicated in the company. I instantly deny it, explaining I'm still working nearly 12 hours a day. I show them the results. I go for a walk to calm down and when I get back he's left a message on my phone repeating his accusation and a couple of emails threatening to quit. The emails continue into the next day.

I send out an email the next day stating I can't work in these conditions and that I am stopping my current collaboration immediately. I offer to continue working if they can propose a reasonable a mandate with a minimal budget and well-defined scope.

That was last week. So far nothing but silence. I have no clue what's going on and I don't really care anymore. A real shame. I think it is the first startup I've worked for that is not gonna make it. I just wish I had been hired a year ago, back when they had money, when saving it would have been possible.

So, any other startup nightmare stories? :)

**TL;DR** Worked my way up from temp to employee #1 in startup that had nearly a million Swiss francs in initial investment and worldwide partners in six months. CEO mismanaged capital, went batshit crazy and I left.

crx7u,6,2010-07-21,I'm a college student depressed about my future. Is this normal?,mobius-n-stuff,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/crx7u/im_a_college_student_depressed_about_my_future_is/,"I've got one year of college left. I'm majoring in what is more or less film production. I've always wanted to make films, but honestly, for the last half a year or so I've been pretty depressed about it. 

Fall semester this past school year I was in Production 2. The next semester I wanted to get into an Immersion class where I would be making commercials for downtown businesses in the city, so I had to talk to the head of the project (also my advisor) about it and she asked me to bring her my reel.

I showed her what was I thought was the best thing on it, and she in so many words told me it wasn't very good, and that I should take Production 2 and try again. Maybe I just took that too hard.

I haven't done any internships because me/my family is far from loaded and I have to work in the summer to be able to afford school.

I have a friend who just this year got his shit together and moved out to Arizona, where he's already landing work on legit short film shoots and going to a school where the profs have worked on real features. 

I feel like I've wasted my time. I go to a state university, I wish I would've gone to a film school. I feel like I'm already way behind most of my classmates because I haven't done an internship and I can't get into any of the classes for people that are more skilled. I don't think I'm any good, I feel like I've wasted my college education on a pipe dream, and I'm wishing I would've just gone to school for generic shit so I could've landed some crappy office job after college. I am pretty depressed that I am just going to spend the rest of my life working in the factory I currently work at as a summer job.

Feels like all I have to look forward to is alcoholism.

Am I just being stupid?

TL;DR I feel like I suck and I've wasted my time in college and I'm not going to amount to anything in life."
cs69a,9,2010-07-21,I have made the biggest mistake of my life,halluz,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cs69a/i_have_made_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life/,"I have been reading Reddit for a long time but this is my first post so.. go easy.

The short story is this: I dated my dream girl in college.  We dated for 2.5 years then I broke up with her as I was moving across the country for 3 months to do an internship.  In short, that was the biggest mistake of my life (breaking up with her, not the internship).  Fast forward 2 months to today: we're talking pretty frequently and for whatever reason she still loves me.  I'm still at my internship and I will be coming home in about a month.  Only in the past couple of days, however, did I truly realize what I had done to her when I broke up with her, and how truly incredible it is that she is still talking to me, and even more than that, saying that she still loves me.  

Before you all post ""you're an idiot for breaking up with her"" or ""you're stupid you deserve what you get"", I want to agree with those statements.  It was easily the worst decision I have ever made in my life, and I was unaware how much I took her for granted and how stupid I was being at the time.  I can't believe I couldn't see how much she loved and cared for me, and how blinded I was by my own selfish thoughts.  I've been battling with this whole situation in my mind all summer but only recently have I been able to really see it from her angle and know how terrible and selfish I have been.

I don't understand why she is still talking to me or how she could still love me after I have broken her heart, but she does, and I feel absolutely wretched for doing that to her, and I do still love her too.  Here's where the situation gets a little sticky.  Her dad absolutely hates me now.  He didn't like me before, but now he completely hates me, and for good reason.  He won't listen to anything she has said to him about us and refuses to be rational.  This leads to my two-part question:

How can I show her that I am genuinely sorry for what I did and that I feel absolutely terrible and I do love her in a way that isn't contrived or cliche, and **(more of the main question I seek to Ask Reddit), How do I deal with her dad?**

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend, which was a mistake and now she still loves me but her dad hates me.  How do I deal with him?"

My goal : create my startup. I've got a few solid business ideas. I know I could pick one and take time to build something.

Problem : I'm receiving an offer from a very successful company ( an ex startup thats now ~150 people ). The pay is very good, the team is made of bright people, I'll be working as an engineer.

Should I work there for a while or is the experience not s? I've already had internships so I know already about how a company works from the inside. I have around 2000€ on my bank account and I'm debt free ( I live in France, where engineering degrees are free :). 
I feel like working for another startup would be taking the easiest way and I want to take risks while I still can...

Any other redditor had the same deicion to make ? Any help would be very appreciated :)

Thanks"
cu76i,3,2010-07-27,Hey engineers - I'm starting the grad courses of my joint CE degree and am having second thoughts for various reasons.  I need advice/encouragement.,christoph8_21,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/cu76i/hey_engineers_im_starting_the_grad_courses_of_my/,"Hey guys.  21 years old here and going into my 4th year of a joint masters/bachelors CE degree.  I love civil engineering but I'm running into a problem as my grad course date start draws nearer.  I'm going to be at college for 5 years no matter what to get my bachelors and by that time, if I stay on my current path, will have about 21 credits of 30 of a master's degree done (or I could take a semester off and just get bachelor's).  That is great and all, but I'm really unsure what I want to do after college.  While working for a top-notch firm and all that *is* appealing, I have so many other interests in so many things.  I feel as though getting a master's right away is smart, but I believe I would feel a significant amount of guilt **not** using it and going to work right away.  Additionally, the excess debt that the last year or year and half might cause me is also unattractive if I were to *not* use my degree.  My original plan before I started college was to work hard for a degree as a backup plan while pursuing things like music and other endeavors (like every other student probably).  I find that with the pressures of getting internships (which I do have, over a years worth) and making connections, I'm getting channeled more and more into a career right away out of college. 

This is pure madness right? I'm supposed to be grateful for my good fortune yeah?  I am though, believe me.  I switched from EE and have had everything fall in my favor seemingly with CE.

cuhdr,2,2010-07-27,Take an internship position even with a degree?  (Software/web development),f0xmulder,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cuhdr/take_an_internship_position_even_with_a_degree/,"I'll try to be as succinct as possible:

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in May.  I currently live in Michigan but have been looking to move elsewhere because of the ridiculously bad job outlook here.  I've had a phone interview with a company in California a few weeks ago but they decided to ""hire internally"".  

There is a company about 10 minutes from my apartment that has an internship in web development/software engineering and I easily meet all of the requirements and the work seems genuinely interesting.  I'm confident enough in my resume and interviewing skills that if I get a call, I could get the job.  

This isn't a money issue but a practicality issue for me.  I'm getting to the point where I'm worried that I won't find a ""real"" job soon (I currently work for slightly above minimum wage position with near full-time hours) and that I should just get all of the directly related work experience that I can get (though I do have some from a self-started company, but I don't know how convincing that looks on a resume).  

A big part of the decision for me is the fact that my apartment lease ends in a little less than a month and if I don't find anything in that time, I'll move in with my parents to save money on rent.

If you were in my shoes, would you try for an internship, especially with it being in my neighborhood?  Furthermore, if I could get an internship across the country, should I go for it, even with the hike in moving and living costs?  At least here, I can fall back on moving back in with my parents if things turn really sour but if I moved across the country I'd probably be locked in a lease, somewhat frantic, having lost a lot of money due to moving.

Maybe this sounds like a silly question, but I guess I just don't know how realistic my chances are of getting a job.  I don't want to have taken an internship and then realized that I should have gotten a job offer somewhere had I just stuck it out a little longer.

Thanks!



tl;dr: Take an internship even though I have a degree just for some relevant work experience?"

Does anyone have suggestions? I'm located in Northern California in the East Bay, and I've been skimming craig's list and some other sites, but without many results. Would I be better off improving my skillz on my own? doing both? Your input is appreciated."
cvlbo,3,2010-07-30,"Reddit, would you read my resume after reading my cover letter?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cvlbo/reddit_would_you_read_my_resume_after_reading_my/,"Dear Hiring Staff,


I am writing in response on Company Name department Co-op position (Engineering Co-op ####). I believe that I have most requirements necessary for the job opening. I am interested in an engineering position this upcoming fall (after August 21 2010).


I currently am junior at the University of ########### and enrolled as a Mechanical Engineer student. I have completed the basic mechanical engineering classes (statics, dynamics, mechanics of material, science of material, fluids mechanics and thermodynamics). I have also taken three classes of drafting and computer aided design and engineering. Part of my degree has also made me take electrical and manufacturing classes. One of the larger aspects of the University ###########’s curriculum is that students get hands on experience and testing during laboratories. 


On my previews co-op I work with my mentor and CEO (of ###########) to design, develop and manufacture a “Load Limiter”. I have also worked with in a team of students and also work by myself. I am skill in two 3D CAD programs (AutoCAD Inventor and Dassault CATIA). I understand mechanical and electrical diagrams and I am capable of machining and wiring/soldering electrical component. 


I am a self-problem solver. During my free time I has develop my electronics, microcontrollers, and programing skills to develop an all-around engineering knowledge. My computer skills are higher than average and I am capable of picking up a new engineering drafting or 3D modeling software within a couple of days. I am specially skill with CATIA and AutoCAD inventor, but I have previously used Solidworks and Pro/E. 


I have worked both in an office environment and a machine shop environment. I understand all the aspects of designing, developing, manufacturing during my co-op and internships. Working in both the office and in a machine shop has given me better all-around knowledge of what is possible for a machinist to do and what engineer designer can produce. I also have great organizing and efficient work skills. 


I have attached my resume for your assessment. I would appreciate having the chance of talking with you about my chances of getting employed. I thank you for your time and would look forward to and opportunity of talking to you about a internship job this Fall 2010. 


Sincerely, 

FirstName Lastname
