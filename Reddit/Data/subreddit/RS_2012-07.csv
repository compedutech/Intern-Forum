vvpwo,1,2012-07-01,How do I get things better? My Uncle and his family are a pack of douche bags and my Dad just takes it.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vvpwo/how_do_i_get_things_better_my_uncle_and_his/,"My Dad and his brother and Sister in law who are conservative Catholics last year we went camping at this stupid campground that the family goes to year after year and it's basically a crowded shit hole. The only reason he really goes there is because he wants to use his boat there (We live in Michigan there's more than one place to have fun with the boat)
Anycase last year and years before Dad could never get family to come over or have guests. It's always up to him to take care of my grandmother. My Grandmother should in all honesty be placed in a assisted living home) But Uncle will not stand for it. and basically says he will take care of her big surprise my Dad who is retired is obligated to do the heavy work by him. Dad has said to me countless times he's sick of driving her to doctors appointments and such. He won't stand up for himself at all or even me. My Dad when i was five years old went to Illinois to live and work and left me with my grandmother coming back to see me every other weekend. I just wanted to live with my Dad I never even visited his home in all the eight years he was away. He has gotten to the point where some days all he does is sit and play computer chess and surf online and drown himself with watching t.v. it was why we got rid of cable tv. He was watching so much tv to escape the house got put into shambles there are repairs to the house that need to be done and they won't be because he doesn't want to do them and when I do it he gets pissed.  
A little back story here since I was forming my own opinions. My uncle would basically verbally attack me for having another P.O.V. besides his. MY aunt would put pressures on me to become a baker. Why? I still don't know why. Yes I baked and decorated cakes before but that hobby made me fatter and quite frankly I enjoyed the digital arts and sciences better. I still struggle with my weight.  
I was a great college student at first. But later on when I was just going and going and going more to escape the crisis at home. I got caught in this viscus cycle of college classes at the community college that never took me anywhere. I tried to get work locally but i soon gave up because my skills in using digital editing software and Photoshop were all but depleted till I got a copy on Ebay of Adobe CS 5.5 now I'm working on an online career. 

But back to the campground last summer. No one wanted to come to our sight for a bonfire and after basically begging Aunt and Uncle came and so did my 88 year old Grandma. I was never more happy to have people visit us! But my happiness turned into sadness when no one wanted to roast marsh mellows or do anything they just sat and didn't stay longer than 15 minutes my Dad drove my Grandma back to her site at the campground. My Aunt left soon after and my Uncle stayed behind. The weird thing was my Uncle was really unnerved when he was alone with me he and I talked about sci-fi books and about Star Trek. Then as my dad slowly returned he started to get angrier and started to attack what I believed in he verbally attacked President Obama claiming he was a member of the tea party. He talked about how gays were ruining the American family on PBS and NPR where at one point I was an intern at. Then he said something that ripped my soul asunder.
He said me and my Dad were not a family because my Dad didn't remarry. 
I am trained in martial arts to control my anger and at that moment I wanted to grab my poker stick and skewer him. I at some point told him I was Bisexual and he got pissed off blamed me for the argument and grabbed his chair and ran off. I told Dad I didn't want to come out that way but it was the only way to get him to stop. 

But this afternoon was a low, low, low, blow to my Dad. My grandma's birthday was this afternoon and Uncle and aunt came over with my cousin with cake and ice cream. They called and said come at 12 we'll be here. 
We arrived earlier than we were expected as soon as we came they left. They had eaten almost all of the cake and sang Happy Birthday to my grandmother. 
I want to know what do I need to tell my Dad to make him realize these people are assholes and how can I get out of this mess? I'm pretty much running out of hope for myself. "

&gt;I'm from a town in the country where all we had was cows, chickens and, by chance, an internet connection (a bit dramatic but you get the idea :D )
&gt;
&gt;so i spent most of my early life on the internet where i learned to program, operative systems and all i could about computers
&gt;i had no up to date hardware so all i know about electrical engineering is from what I've read or heard, but as soon as it gets to software i feel at home
&gt;
&gt;it's useless to say that my parents were so disappointed that i didn't like the farm life but since my mother died (10 years ago) my dad would talk to me only to ask for help with the machines and stuff, we even ate at two different times!
&gt;(as today I'm not sure he understand the difference between a TV and computer)
&gt;
&gt;i graduated from High school with nearly minimum of grades but managed to get into the best university of my nation acing the admission &gt;test and studying as much as i could
&gt;
&gt;this first year has been a radical change in my life
&gt;
&gt;on the social side i had to learn to relate with new people which while it might seem easy..for me it has been madness
&gt;BUT i managed to keep a GPA of 4.00 (A+) (according to http://www.foreigncredits.com/Resources/GPA-Calculator/)
&gt;which will allows me to keep my scholarship so i won't have to work to pay living and university 


**TL;DR for the quoted text:** I'm totally lost in this environment and but i managed to pass the first year with very good grades


I've always dreamed about attending MIT as graduate since to me it always looked a boiling pot of amazing technology and people
and more importantly most of the papers/publications I've been reading in the last years were from there

during the last months i started to get interested in BCI (brain computer interfaces) and after talking about it to a few professors one of them pointed me to one of his students who has a start-up about BCIs
he suggested me to start hacking with some of those interfaces, which i will do as soon as I'll be done with my exams (a week).
i started to study how it works and already ordered the needed hardware


**what could i do to improve my university career?** i feel like aiming for A+ is a waste of time if i can work on side projects or internships and still get good grades but i noticed i have no real idea of what I'm expected/should do and how things work in academia


I'm studying biomedical engineering but considering to switch to EE"

Let me give you some background on my job, and my history.


I graduated college with a BS degree in Information Systems Management last November.  I started working for a big company in January under the title ""Software Engineer"".  


I work mostly in a perl enviornment, (lots of database based programming to be done), as well as SQL, and even write some web apps for internal use.
My previous expeirience consists of a 3 month internship as a student system adminatrator (at college), and some retail expierience (Best Buy, etc.).


My salary is 30k.  Is this low? After looking around on various websites, I see that the LOW end for software engineers in my area, is around 60k.  I know I am still in a somwehat entry level position, but half of the lowest bound seems unfair.


Can someone put this into perspective for me?



Let me know if you need more clarification to help out as well.



Thank you!"

This winter I tried to get an internship but I never passed the psychometric tests stage. I am simply scared that I will never get a job in my industry (accounting, all the applications are for a charted accountant training contract) just because I can't seem to be able to improve my score on these tests (especially the numerical ones).

I have a good math background, but obviously I am doing something wrong  when approaching these type of tests since I can't seem to finish them on time.

I know that I should ""practice, practice, practice"", but apart from this do you have any experience or advice/tips how to approach them when practicing? Do you know any good books I should read or any particular tests I should practice?

For example, for standard SHL test of 20 questions in 20 minutes (or 15 question in 20 minutes, I don't remember exactly) how do you get to do one question in 1 minute? Sometimes there is too much to calculate or you don't get the question from the first reading. Any tips or shortcuts I should know?

I'm 22 and I'll finish my bachelor's degree in Statistical Sciences by the end of the year and I found out I pretty much hate it (I mean, I like the mathematical and the programming parts, but, as I found out, it is near impossible to find a job where I'll use it). Because I won't be hired in the place where I'm an intern I started thinking what the fuck I'm going to do with my life. I have a great interest in CS, and I actually was accepted in a university in this course, bud I didn't register because...well, because I was a rebel, I guess.

So I guess I have 2 options:

1. Pursue a master's degree in Statistics, maybe trying to find a intersection between CS and Statistics (while I do realise this intersection exists, and is a quite big one, I'm not in the US nor Europe (I'm in Brazil, if that matters), so finding a place where I can pursue this area of research is hard, especially coming form the Statisticas side).

2. Try to pursue a second bachelor's degree, this time in CS, starting it  at 23, probably finishing at 27, 28 (I would be able to cut many math credits). I would be damn afraid to start job hunting at this age in a field that I have no professional experience.

I am actually considering doing both at the same time, but maybe that's too much.

I don't know, can anybody give me any insight?"

I grew up in the church, a faith-based family, and was very active in my youth group during middle school and high school. Late in my high school years, I decided upon college and my vocation choice.

I also have a wide variety of experience in this field, especially for my age. My entire church and family is supportive and excited for my future plans, it'd really stink to go out at all, let alone with the reason that I don't believe in anything anymore. 

On the flip side, I just recently (few months) got broken up with by my long-term girlfriend who also shares my faith values. Am I maybe just going through a phase right now with all that's going on? I would rather I didn't feel like this, and would choose so if I could. However, I know I need to deal with all of this: I just don't know how.

Of those few people, I feel that 100% of them would be disappointed in my unintentional doubts. On top of all this, I currently am IN an internship, in charge of discipling and teaching others. It feels wrong, but what else can I do? I feel stuck.

I understand that some of you (or most of you) may not know where I'm coming from or have ill conceptions about faith, but I would appreciate your positive advice in anyway you can give it.

So Reddit, what do you think? Do I stay in school? Switch my major? What would I tell my family and others? Do you think what I'm feeling is a real switch in my beliefs? Or will time wash this over? Or do I need more time to tell one way or the other?"

After zero success with my first degree (English) I humbly ask for any and all advice on how best to return to school and begin a new degree, computer science. Since I'm bound by my area, I'd like to attend [Villanova University.](http://csc.villanova.edu/)

There are a few things I'd like to address:

1. **Previous Credits:** I am not an incoming freshman. I'm not a transferring student either. And, since I'm trying for something completely outside of my first major, there's no way I'd go straight into a Graduate Program. How, exactly, does someone apply for a second degree?

2. **Computer Science Major:** I'm immensely intrigued by programming. I see it as its own language, the only one that literally transforms words and imagination into products. It's like talking things into existence. Is my excitement justified, or merely glorified? Could I be on the cutting edge of innovation, or will I likely be shoved onto a stuffy cubicle farm?

3. **Computer Science Job Market:** I hear the statistics. Unemployment is up and corporations are outsourcing. I get it. What, though, could I realistically expect coming out of school? Assuming I intern while taking classes, how good are my chances to land a decent job?

4. **The College Experience:** I feel like I ""missed out"" on something my first round at college. I didn't join a sorority or participate in any of the activities I love, like singing and swimming. Part of me wants to return to school for strictly business, but the other part wants to try these things out too. Mind, I'm almost 25-- would that matter/ be creepy?

5. **Financial Aid:** Since I've already attended a four-year college (and racked up a decent sum in loans, &gt;20k), how likely am I to receive financial aid? How and when would I begin requesting assistance? To those who kept a part-time job during school, was it worth it? Or should someone concentrate solely on school?

So this is my first post. I don't really even know where to begin. I just know I've read countless threads like these, and I see a lot of people get genuine help from them. So here it goes... (sorry if it's boring/long/stupid)

I'm a 23 year old d00d who recently graduated from college and am currently working a steady job doing stuff (not important what.) I met my girlfriend through an infamous dating website, but we realized we had a lot of mutual friends and went to a lot of the same things, just never having met or bumped into each other at those times, so we usually don't tell people that, as it is believable that we would have met in our own time. She is a 19 year old current college student. Our first date we went to a metal show at a DIY spot. Everything turned up Milhouse, and she spent the night at my place. I took her to work the next morning, because I was actually feeling ""it."" She is super cute, has a great sense of humor and is a blast to be around. I fell pretty quickly for her, and pursued things hard.

A sort of a side, it should be mentioned, that up until this time, I was on a 2 year period of not dating anyone, mostly by choice. I had a slew on continuous relationships that I jumped into too eagerly and ended up regretting it, and hurting the other party. However, this was as a direct result of being in a extremely emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years through high school. I felt pretty insecure for years following, and jumped at the chance to be in a relationship with pretty much anyone that would return the interest. After breaking enough hearts, and having mine broken a few times as well, I decided I just need some time to figure out what I wanted and what I needed. 

Anyways, Fast forward a month after we meet, and things are official. This is surprisingly long for me, considering I would usually jump into relationships within a week or so of dating someone for the most part. This took an incredible amount of patience on my part. However, she was expecting to score an internship over the summer, and didn't. She had to move back home as opposed to staying in the city we live in. However, she only lives an hour away, and we tell ourselves we'll make it work. And it has been, or it was. She was making it down about once a week for the first month, and I only saw her twice really in the second month. 

See, when we met, I had just moved to this city. I had already hooked up with a few girls around the area, and felt that maybe I was ready to just go the distance with someone. She was really the first person I felt like I could have a relationship with after the thought occurred. While we text everyday and occasionally will call or skype each other, I pretty much fill up the rest of my free time here with my hobbies (playing music, in a somewhat serious fashion, hanging out with my new and old friends) and work, which takes up way more than just full time hours. I barely have time for myself with her not even in the same town as me. 

And here's the kicker, it feels as if things have just sizzled and my feelings aren't going anywhere. I'm still attracted to her and I enjoy the time we spend together, but as time goes on, I can tell she is falling deeply for me, and I'm just...indifferent. I care for her, and all of this has absolutely nothing to do with her. She's great. And that makes me feel worse. I feel like I should keep trying because I had not felt this way about a girl in a very long time and I was so sure going into this that it would be for a long time. But now, 2 months into it, and I feel exactly as I did the last time I was in a relationship at this period; ready to bail and disinterested. 

I don't know what to do reddit. I don't want to hurt this girl because she's awesome and doesn't deserve that. But she doesn't deserve some dude stringing her along waiting for his feelings to catch up. I also don't want to regret this decision only to find out that this was some sort of mental/emotional episode that ends up passing and I truly did have real feelings for her. 

This make's me feel like complete shit. I'm a super nice guy other than the turmoil and distress relationships cause me. Maybe I'm doomed to be single forever. And maybe that's what I deserve for getting myself into situations like this. 

She's moving back to the city in the beginning of september to start school again. She'll have her own place and her own friends again, but at home, where she currently is, she has no friends, a shitty family, and a shitty 40+ hour/week job at a pizza place. I'm her only haven this entire summer. If I'm going to break up with her, how should I do it? If she comes into town, it's to spend the night with me. Breaking up over the phone or through text isn't an option, but I don't want to break things off when she has no where else to go for the evening. 

Sorry for the wall of needlessly boring text. Just need some help sorting this out. 

TL;DR Moved to a new city. found a girl I liked, after not having dated anyone for a few years, mostly by choice. She moved away for the summer, rarely see each other. 2 months in, and I'm disinterested, but not because of anything she did, or because of her at all. HAve literally zero clue as to how I should handle this. "

I've always wanted to learn to program, and have been involved with computers since I was ~7 (Now, 20).  I roughly taught myself VB/Java when I was around 14/15 and was involved in making some programs in a tight knit community online.  Loved it.  Fast forward to where I am now - the last 3 yrs of my college career I've been focused on Investment Banking, and breaking into the industry.  As it stands, I've gotten internships done so far at a few investment banks and a one bulge bracket (think JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, BAML) doing PWM.  I'm pretty well set up for a career in the industry, and know I will have no problem getting interviews for that type of job.  However, I'm a transfer student and got all these opportunities on my own at a local school getting an Associates in Math.

I've been accepted to 2 schools as a transfer student for the fall - an Ivy league school majoring in Finance, and Georgetown, where I could undertake a BS in Math, or, if I can handle the senior year courseload of ALL CS courses (I haven't even taken Intro), I can get a BS in CS.  The problem that I feel, however, is that GTown is not a big CS school, and as such, I won't really be considered for top jobs in the CS industry and will most likely be looking at IT...  Also, I'm going to be a junior and I fear if I start from scratch now with CS, I won't land a notable internship next summer as I won't have the skills necessary down pat by then, whereas if I went Ivy, I could realistically expect to get a Summer Analyst position at Goldman Sachs (not far out of my reach...).  

What is your take on it?  What should I do?  I enjoy finance, and am heavily considering just accepted the ivy, but CS has been a love of mine since I was young and it would be a shame if I gave it all up for something I might not want to do wit hthe rest of my life (Investment banking wears you out...).

Any ideas?  Thanks!"

The directed study is broadly termed 'Distributed Databases' but I've generally been looking into NoSQL technologies - with an emphasis on biological/medical data.

I need to do an implementation project for the course some-how related to distributed databases, this can mean implementation of a database or use of (data mining) a database. 

One idea I had was looking into [bio4j](http://www.bio4j.com/) to see if there are any cool visualizations or something neat I can *mine* for. 

I don't have a lot of biological background so I was wondering if anyone here might have some ideas that I could look into either for using bio4j or something else related. I'd like to attack this more on the computational end of things.

If some one has I particular project that may be of use to them I'd be happy to work on something like that too. 
Or if there is a student of biology/bioinformatics that is lacking in computational skills but has some ideas I'd possibly be happy to collaborate.

* I am so much less stressed and actually enjoying myself at work. 
* I am much more able to nap if I need to due to my thoughts not racing as much.
* My ability to articulate my points has improved.
* I even look better. When I am on medication, my sinuses are less clogged, which helps with allergy-related eye puffiness.

The only downsides I can think of are having to drink more water to stay hydrated and, if I forget to ask for decaf in the morning, I feel uncomfortable. I basically feel like everything is buzzing. It is weird because caffeine on it's own makes me tired and adderall on it's own makes me calmer and slightly more subdued. 

TLDR: I feel like I am finally becoming the person I want to be."

So, I know that most of the jobs are located in the San Francisco and New York City areas. Unfortunately, I live in North Carolina. We do have the research triangle but last time I checked they are not very involved in the gaming field. I also know that getting an entry level in the gaming industry is very competitive and the job itself is not what most people think it is, but I am still very interested in getting into the field.

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a BS in Psychology and am currently unemployed. I did work study as an IT in which I helped the faculty and staff with technical problems such as moving data or removing viruses. I only took one introductory course in JAVA but am teaching myself C from Carl Herold's ""Higher computing for everyone"". I know that these will probably not be good enough to appear attractive.

So, I was looking into QA positions or internships from over 30 companies but so far no luck. I was wondering if you guys had any tips or could possibly look at my resume. Anything would be greatly appreciated."

w3gsn,1,2012-07-05,How to create a table that is sized based on user input in Excel VBA?,TheTreeMan,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/w3gsn/how_to_create_a_table_that_is_sized_based_on_user/,"For the record, I'm using Excel 2010.

I'm trying to teach myself VBA for a job at work (they give the interns the VBA stuff...), and I'm getting stuck on the simplest of things.

I am trying to make a bordered table that is three columns wide. The amount of rows in the table has to be based on the amount of inputs the user has. In my crappy code, that is the value given for ""Count"" by the user.

My issue is that I have no idea how to select the range I need. The only way I know how to select a range is using:

    ActiveCell.Range(""Top left cell:Bottom right cell"").Select

If it were from A1 to C8, how do I make that work? I wish it would just work like:

    ActiveCell.Range(""A1:C(count)"").Select

This is what I have so far:


    Option Explicit

    Dim Count As Long

    Dim CFLArray() As Variant

    Sub TableCreation1()

        Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""Time (days)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""CFL (measured)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""De (estimated)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, -2).Range(""A1:C1"").Select

        Selection.Font.Bold = True

        ActiveCell.Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

        ActiveCell.Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

    
        ActiveCell.Offset(0,1).Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

    
        ActiveCell.Offset(0,2).Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

        ActiveCell.Select

    End Sub



    Sub FindRange()

        Range(""A2"").Select

        Count = InputBox(""How many pairs of data do you have? "")
    
    End Sub

I taught myself VBA a day or so ago using a book my work had, but I couldn't find anything along these lines in there. My internet searches failed as well. The worst part is I know it's going to be incredibly simple.

Also, if my code is awful, it's probably because I have zero programming experience before this, haha. Sorry.

Thanks for your help!"
w3efu,3,2012-07-05,"What to name a ""resume"" github repo",mxmm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w3efu/what_to_name_a_resume_github_repo/,"For background, I am a rising sophomore in college currently working a summer job in programming. I have been tossing a few ideas around with friends of programming projects we could embark on, and I especially want to do these so I can have some personal projects to bolster a resume for internships next summer (I would have done them anyway, but perhaps just another prodding reason.)

I guess what I'm asking is if I should name the github repository I use something related to my name or a common internet alias. I feel like using my name would be better, because then the rest of my internet footprint (I don't know of anything negative, but there are certainly political/religious views espoused) separate from an internship application. But I still find myself wanting to use my alias because I'm used to it and I feel like I'd be more a part of the github community if it didn't look like a linkedin profile.

So what would you guys recommend?

EDIT: In case it wasn't clear, I want to include the location of this repo on my resume."

w3a2c,0,2012-07-05,I have too much confidence. Its becoming a problem. Need advice.,confidence_galore,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w3a2c/i_have_too_much_confidence_its_becoming_a_problem/,"Made a throwaway for this because a lot of you will burn me for saying this but here it goes.

 I'm 23, male and i've always had a lot of confidence. Mostly because of the way I was raised. My dad always used to make me walk straight, head high. Our family has ""good genes"" as we always said and I was raised to believe I'm capable of anything.

Other people don't seem to like that. Friends, some of my family, co-workers are all appalled by my confidence. Even my girlfriend tells me to tone it down. People around me tend to feel insecure and ""less than me"" which is of course never my intention. 

To be honest I have my insecurities, but the confidence just masks that and noone notices. I also realise that it is kind of a luxury position; lack of confidence is way worse than what i'm displaying here but hear me out. 

Its really becoming a problem for the people around me. My ex-gf developed anorexia (not entirely because of me but I can't shake the idea that i somehow imposed an inferiority complex), my current GF is super confident and of course I'm the only one that made her feel insecure ever. People at my internship are interpreting it as arrogance and a ""wrong attitude"", making it a problem for me as well. 

Note: My confidence is always limited to what I can do. I do not boast about being able to do stuff that I can't and I'm always willing to admit if i'm incapable of things. I just know i'm capable of great stuff and so is everyone else. I try to convince my gf that she can do anything if she just puts her mind to it but she just shrugs it off and becomes annoyed.

I don't know what to do, how to change this, where the problem lies. Is it wrong for me to be too confident? I don't want to bother other people but I don't want to be less confident about myself because I know how lucky I am.

Any advice, Reddit?

Part of my duties included being sort of an internal help desk guy because my co-workers found out I was smarter than the average bear with computers. It was easier to call me than the firm we used for tech support. Also, I knew the tax and accounting software better.

Anyways, one time we upgraded my boss' Palm Treo 700p to a Blackberry. Our tech support firm set up BES on our Exchange server, we got the Blackberry registered and everything seemed to be set to go.

One problem: one habit he developed was relying on AutoComplete in Outlook basically as his address book. Because Blackberry doesn't use ActiveSync like Palm OS did, there was no way we were going to get that functionality on his Blackberry. Also, we're talking about hundreds of e-mail addresses, so it was infeasible to import them into his Address Book.

No matter how many times I tried to explain that to him, I would get called into his office every few weeks and get the whole rundown again about how it wasn't suggesting e-mail addresses like it does in Outlook or his old phone.

Eventually the firm decided to hire one of the interns and lay me off because my billable hours were low due to all my computer work, so the problem eventually went away.

A little background for proper understanding: I am a fresh graduate of a business and economics university in a small country in Europe. After my second year of education I have found an internship at a local corporate finance advisory which later lead to a full-time contract starting from my last semester in spring and up to now.  

The conflict: I was not entirely happy with how things were going at the office in June and during that time our school's alumni network has sent an internship offer from one of the largest UK's banks. I thought ""what the heck, I'll apply, will never make it anyway"". Not more than three days ago I had a one-hour interview with their office and today I received an e-mail that confirmed my participation in stage two. Though still slim, the chances are getting higher now and I may be getting into a tough situation with my current employer.

My thoughts: I really want to go to London for that internship. It is two months without guarantee of future employment, yet a powerful experience and CV booster. However, on my current job I've just been handed a rather large project to do (information memorandum) which will take at least three weeks to prepare and overall suddenly quitting on them would be a pretty shitty move.  
  
The grand question: how do I prepare for such a situation? Is it possible to come out clean? How do I minimize the damage with my current employer in case I do get that internship offer.  
  
Using a throwaway account. Would really like to hear out the thoughts from people that have been in such situation from both sides. Any other thoughts are welcome as well.

________________________________________________________
I feel like a spectacular bottle-rocket whose fuse was a dud. And I'm hoping that isn't reality.

I feel bad for feeling bad, because my life is great by all indicators. 

I just graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in English-Lit. I am well clothed. I am well fed. I have an awesome dog. I have fresh water. I don't have cancer. I don't have AIDs. I have amazing parents who are willing to support me while I figure out my shit and get a job/compensated internship in my field of study or interests.

I feel like I'm not doing anything good with myself though. Sure, I'm growing food to send into the city schools in Memphis. But, it isn't paid, and I'm quickly realizing that money is a lot more important than I thought it used to be. And that makes me feel stupid.
I want so so so badly to be on my own and living in an apartment or house or tent where I don't have to have my parents caring so friggin much about me all the time, because when I was at college, I really bloomed into being introverted and not always having a support system. I'm not used to that level of care. It almost makes me feel like a caged animal. 

 I also turned into an atheist, casual pot smoker, and very independent thinker. My parents raised me to be Christian, not a pot smoker, and to trust church authority. I'm also active in my local Kink/BDSM club, so hiding that from the parents is hard as hell, and tense at times. I can't even bring a girl home to make out, much less do all of the fun sexy-time things that I like doing.

I want to get into the green living/small scale agriculture scale of things, so I want to get an internship on a farm somewhere and learn how to do that. I want to be more connected with the world around me, and never get into the rat race.

I also feel like I should be adventuring while I'm young and without children, and frankly, still can before I go into the farming thing. But I don't have a job because of my internship right now, and don't know what the fuck to do with myself. I want to see Montana, and ride a motorcycle, and try and flirt with pretty girls at bars, and see all that America and the world has to offer me. But how the fuck am I gonna do that right now? I'm not gonna just travel around the country on my parents funds. For one, that would make me a douche-nozzle to the 100th degree, and for two, my parents already paid for my college and did so much for me already that I can't possibly ask them for anything more even though they love me so much that they would probably do that for me.

I miss Colorado. I miss Boulder. I want to wake up and see the mountains every morning, but all I see is the dismal, muggy, urban reality of Memphis and its shitty racial division. I wish that I had tubed on the Boulder creek, just once. I wish I had hit on one girl at a bar and gotten over my shyness and introversion. I wish I hadn't told my best friend at school that I was too tired to go out, when really I just wanted to be selfish and enjoy some time to myself.

I wish that I could have my lady friend sleeping by my side right now, when in reality she is still in Boulder and not coming to visit for another 12 days. I wish that when she got to Memphis, she and I could sleep in the same goddamn bed, but we wont be able to because my parents love Jesus just a little too much.

I wish that I could run away, but I feel like I can't just run away, because I don't even know where to run away to. I feel like a goddamn compass with a rusted out, bent needle, and I'm just so fucking tired of it.

I feel like a spectacular bottle-rocket whose fuse was a dud. And I'm hoping that isn't reality.

Any advice, whether it's just ""hang in there, kid"" to ""you should do X, Y, and Z"" to ""quite being an entitled little brat"" would be appreciated. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and that just makes me more depressed because by all indicators, my life is awesome, and I shouldn't feel that way right now. "

For the first 5 semesters of college I was actually a Graphic Design &amp; Illustration major. The reason for the change was mostly due to my search for the right career. I didn't actually feel like I would enjoy a career in straight-up design, even though I was actually quite good at it (compared to the majority of my peers). I knew I was good at programming and the Computer Science way of thinking due to high school classes, and I knew that there were more opportunities, as well as more profitable opportunities, in that major. Plus, I enjoy programming!

Here's the thing, though: I just started an internship at an internationally recognized company that I'm really proud of, but the bureaucracy might be slowly killing me. It pays great, and it offers a really good employment opportunity after I graduate, but I just don't think I can do the grey cubicle thing... at least I'd rather not. 

I don't think I made the wrong decision in switching majors. I've enjoyed my last semester (the first in CS) enough to entirely justify the switch. I do, however, miss the creativity of design. I really think I need to find a career path the lies somewhere between Computer Science and Design. I've always been interested in web design (as well as the general idea of ""user experience"" but I'm not sure how to approach something that abstract). I know the basic web languages like HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, but I've yet to use them in a scenario outside of class. I also know a whole lot about design and creating a good experience for a user. 

My question to you, Reddit, is how do I mesh my too passions successfully? What do I do know? Where do I go? Where do I start? I've never really been that great at learning things on my own but I'm a whiz in a classroom or business environment. I really hope to get an internship in a smaller, more creatively focused company next summer. But until then, does anyone have any suggestions?

Sorry if this is too lengthy to generate valuable responses, but thanks to anyone who read through and to anyone who might give me some guidance!

ALSO: I'm fairly new to Reddit. Is it in bad taste to repost this in the ""User Experience"" subreddit? I feel like I'd really value that input as well."

I would would appreciate any and all advice concerning these two career paths!  

About Me:
This upcoming semester I will be a junior at PSU working towards a double major of Cmpsci and Mathematics, and I will be attempting to minor in MIS if I can get the classes to align.  This year I was accepted to the Schreyers Honors College which grants me some serious research power for an undergrad.  Naturally, I'd like to incorporate one of these two topics into my project, but my lack of experience in both subjects leads me to believe I would be biting off more than I can chew.  Aside from classes and working as a TA, I really have no other experience with computer science.  I was unable to find an internship in my area this summer and for various reasons, traveling was not an option (it will be this year however!).  

So, what exactly is a career in each option like? What can I do/read to bolster my knowledge of each topic? (I've tried to read journals and other subreddits but it is another language thus far)  Where can I look for internships in these two fields? And finally, any ideas on a research project? I have a few, but the more I analyze them, the more I think, ""Jesus, how the hell could I complete that by myself in two years with the knowledge I have?!""

Thanks for any help...first post from a long time lurker.

w3wag,1,2012-07-05,Help me find the culprit. ,[deleted],techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/w3wag/help_me_find_the_culprit/,"Okay so I consider myself technologically literate. I have been employed (internship but whatever) as a programmer. I have worked with all the major operating systems. I make sure to have real time antivirus, a firewall, and updates.  I am so careful, that when I got a virus and got my password + credit card stolen. I did a virus scan, found the virus, and decided to low level format my computer just to be safe. I do not trust any sort of password storage, I use CCleaner one a daily basis. I also not the type of click on anything phishing emails/links. I dont even click on links, I just type out the url character by character even if it looks safe. I am borderline paranoid.

So today I get an email from Gmail (legitimate email) that says:
Someone recently tried to sign in to your Google Account, __________. We prevented the sign-in attempt in case this was a hijacker trying to access your account. Please review the details of the sign-in attempt:

Being super cautious, I bypass the email and scroll to the bottom of my gmail where I click on details to see login history and sure enough, someone with an IP address from India tried to login to my computer. (It definitely was not me via my phone/proxy because I was fast asleep at that hour)

So I run the full scan on both my computers (Microsoft security essentials) and come up with nothing. I do a virus scan with Norton on my android phone, nothing. I then install Malwarebytes on both computers, full scan, and come up with nothing.

Now I changed the passwords using an itouch I got for my birthday but never even opened (the guy who gave it to me regifted a brand new first generation itouch, I thought it was hilarious), so I know my new passwords are safe. But I am scared to use my current computers for anything.

 Its like living on an island with 50 other people, finding out there has been a homicide, and then being told ""police scanned the area, didnt find anyone, carry on"". Well then how the hell did it happen? 

Based on your opinion which one of these options would you go with:
1. One of your devices is infected, keep looking. (In which case HOW to keep looking would be nice to know)
2. Your password was probably leaked months ago when you went on a friends computer to check your email (To the best of my knowledge I have never done this and certainly have not been on a friends computer for at least a couple months, let alone to check my email. 
3. Something I havent thought of.

What do I do?,shibbyboi182,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w744e/our_rescue_dog_is_afraid_of_me_what_do_i_do/,"Between June 2011 and December 2011, both of our childhood dogs died while I was away at school. We weren't really planning on getting a new dog, but my sister had a friend who's neighbor was known to be abusing a relatively young dog (&lt;1 year old) so she offered to adopt it, and we unofficially ""rescued"" the dog into our home. This was about 10 months ago, after our first dog had died, but while the second one was still alive. 

Whenever I was home from school, I noticed that the dog was weary/cautious of me. I always figured it was because I was still some stranger (between school, work, internships, etc, I was usually only home from school for a day or 2 at time, sporadically).  

Indicators of his fear:

* If I walk by too closely and too suddenly, he urinates on the floor.
* If I get too close, his tail is down
* If i try to pet him, he starts shaking/shivering

It's not just me, it's men for the most part he's afraid of. But he's significantly less afraid of my dad than myself (my parents think it's because I'm significantly ""taller"" and still a stranger). I have done NOTHING to harm this dog in any way. I know he had a rough puppy-hood and since he's still uncomfortable around me, for the most part I try to stay out of his way just because I feel really bad for him.  It sucks because I used to be really attached to our old dogs, and now I know this one is terrified of me. I recently moved home, and we've made *slight* improvements. He will now cautiously accept food and table scraps if I offer it to him.  However, since the dog and I see each other everyday, it's kind of difficult to just ""give him space.""

Since neither of us is going anywhere anytime soon, what can I do to make this better?"
w6uu1,0,2012-07-07,"Spent 4.5 of the last 5 years homeless. I earned my degree in that time, have a home and am taking care of my sick mom. The only job I can get is where a co-worker is discriminating against me. What should I do?",ThatSinkingFeel,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w6uu1/spent_45_of_the_last_5_years_homeless_i_earned_my/,"**Feel free to jump down to the tl;dr - this is long, but has to be to explain some things**

In 2007, my family lived with my sister and her then-boyfriend. I was going to school at a community college. My family didn't have money, and it was when I won a state scholarship and notified of a Pell Grant that I started college in 2005. I have 3 disabilities that I couldn't afford to get diagnosed (Central Auditory Processing, dylexia, and ADHD...I don't give much credence to that last one.) No diagnosis meant zero accommodations. At the time, I was okay with that.

Sister kicked my brother out, while also taking what little paycheck I earned (federal work-study at a community college - low-wage) and didn't provide much in the way of food. I got hot dogs while she and bf got steak 3x/week.

The boyfriend revealed himself to be a nazi; apparently his dad was Hitler youth, and he thought it was 'rad.' 

My sister assaulted my mom that July and kicked us out shortly after. When the police were called, they could not determine who started the fight (sister walked away with only a black eye). No one got arrested and we had to leave.

I was very lucky - a friend I barely knew talked her family into letting me and mom stay with them. Mom was there until the day before my birthday (Dec 10). She got sick and I had to send her to my grandmother. That was its own headache. The short version was that she was terribly mistreated.

During that initial period, I was accepted into University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). This wasn't my first choice, it was merely a choice that got me out of Harford County. My major was political science.

UMBC wasn't too bad. Exceptions include the admissions office that couldn't verify where I lived, and threatened to expel me for lying on my admission application (I used a UPS mailbox), the professor who insisted that the Department of Agriculture had the most federal employees and that Judicial Review came from ""Plessey v. Maryland,"" and the ""Christian"" fraternity that had a person nearly die from alcohol poisoning and successfully did not get kicked off of campus.

While at UMBC, I was able to get a little cheap therapy (though it took me nearly all day to use the bus to get to the Loyola psych clinic, no regrets though). I also got diagnosed, so that was good.

Honestly, I would have accepted being a transfer student with almost zero scholarship support (grades are good enough), but in August 2009, my entire financial aid package was pulled with ZERO explanation.

I busted my tail and was accepted into American University. I majored in Political Science and [CLEG](http://www.american.edu/spa/gov/degrees/BA-CLEG.cfm). I graduated without TOO much difficulty. I had to take whatever work I could get, much of that was 'under the table,' but I couldn't afford to do a free Capitol Hill/WH internship - I needed the money: mom was still sick and was not getting help from her family. Dad couldn't (or wouldn't, I'm not sure) help me - I know his wife freaked out every time he bought some groceries. Point is, I couldn't do the one internship every PoliSci student essentially needs to do when you go to school in DC.
Upon graduation, a friend let me stay in her empty apartment while I worked out a housing solution. I tried looking for other options, but I couldn't find anything. The apartment was in Towson, MD, and my work was in Ft. Belvoir, VA. That equates to a 4-hour commute EACH WAY.

The original agreement was 10 months in that apartment. She kept winding back her agreement, and the deadlines became March, then Christmas, then end of November, end of September, then September 1, then GET OUT. This was mostly due to her deteriorating relationship with her crazy boyfriend.

If she had been patient, I would have been out of her hair in mid-August. Instead a fraternity Brother allowed me to stay two weeks with him. I now live in north VA.

The Ft. Belvoir job was with Defense Logistics Agency's Equal Employment Opportunity Office. I was hired as a disabled student. Over my 16 weeks there, I was given maybe 5 assignment by my boss. Then barred anyone else from giving me extra work. She used my 'lack of productivity' as a reason to not hire me permanently.

I was jobless from October until this May, when the Workforce Recruitment Program got me a post with Defense Contract Management Agency. It took 3.5 months to get me in (not complaining, just a fact). Even though I am a receptionist, I liked the job, despite it being completely mind-numbing. I like a challenge.

Until a new GS-09 arrived. This woman is mentally slower than molasses in January, this woman openly called me 'retarded,' and the boss spoke to her - which is really all you can do in government for a first offense. Since then, she consistently reminds me that she makes a bunch more money than I, and insists that her degree in Business Administration from University of Phoenix is better than my degree, and I can't say anything to shut her up. The Boss already wants NOTHING to with this situation.

My problem is that my Boss wants to make me permanent. He has given that task to the woman who called me 'retard.' There will be no hope for advancement past GS-07 for at least a year, but there is no guarantee I'd get the first position made available. Additionally, he likes me as a receptionist because I'm good at it (personal philosophy: do a job, and do it well, and do it well the first time if possible).

This job bores me to tears, I'll be stuck taking care of my mother at an unideal salary with little hope for advancement. I have no official job duties - which essentially makes me the office's 'donkey.' 

I don't want to work in an office where I am regularly dressed down, but I'm darn lucky to even have a job.

NOTE 1: I already complained to the EEO office about the situation. Because I'm WRP, it goes to the agency contact for that program. This gent is slow to respond in general and has not addressed this complaint...it's been 3 weeks.

I'm hoping redditors have some input for me. Help?

tl;dr - Terrible last 5 years. Finally have job. Senior employee is discriminatory. Staying is bad, leaving would be worse."

w5wyg,0,2012-07-06,A little help with Second-Year Degree Choices. (Please read-respond if you are in either sciences or computer science). Thank You in Advanced. ,labeebk,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w5wyg/a_little_help_with_secondyear_degree_choices/,"Hi Reddit, 

I am a Student who completed first year Life - Sciences at a well known University with a decent B+ Average.

For my Electives, I took two extra math courses (in addition to my calculus I course I was required to take in sciences) Because i am passionate about math, and have always been.

So for your better judgement here were my grades:

Biology (1 and 2) : B+ and B
Math (Calc 1 and Calc 2) A and A
Math (Linear Algebra) A
Psych (Behavior and Neuroscience) A and A-
Chem (1 and 2): B- C+

(yeah i suck at chemistry, dislike it too)


So lately I have been thinking a lot. Getting a job in science is practically impossible. I did my research, asked around. Nobody gets jobs. (Post-undergrad or co-op jobs). And I'm a person who has been working since I was 12. I love the idea of being in a work environment and making money. My grade 12 Job was a personal trainer (obtained through networking) after completing the Canfit Pro. I loved it. 

Now its been a year later, and I have not worked. - note I am 19. 

Not only that, but when you graduate, finding a career in the field is also very difficult. Most would require some research/work experience, in which the next four years in science, i would see myself unable to find one.

I tried hard. I really did. I called up everybody i possibly could. Every doctor in our university hospital, every firm who could hire, and even recruit interns! I called up my family who are in similar fields hoping for a positive response. Nothing.

So its not something where I'm ""assuming"" i can't find a job. Ive seen the difficulty first hand.

Now lets look at a few more things before the question is proposed:

I am currently taking 2 math courses over the summer term (for fun, love math). Linear Algebra II, and Diffrential Equations.

Now I also live with 6 friends who study engineering, whom all have nice jobs. In addition, my brother and cousin are both in computer science. They both are also on co-op at the moment. Brother making 25$/hour, and cousin making 35$/hour (cousin is in year 3, brother in year 2). 

So you can get a nice idea on where my influences are coming from. The pressure from lack of work + the pressure from all my friends having jobs. Now that seems very immature to say ""pressure from friends"", but it really does get to you. When your holding onto the last $100 you have in ur bank account, while watching ur brother take the family out for dinner, or cousin buying a $1500 computer.


Lets keep going. Almost done. Thank you so much.

Now in my university, first year is very general. You take general courses, preparing you for specific degrees you can go into for second year.

I applied to two that really caught my attention.

1. Biology and Mathematics

- I love biology, and i love mathematics. This seems perfect for me. But again, considering the lack of jobs, I've been slowly shying away.

2. Mathematics and Computer Science

- Math? Yes! But Computer Science? Everybody who studies computer science tells me its amazing. I have very little experience, but I do work with python sometimes. Make myself short fun codes (taught by my brother). They seem interesting to a certain extent. 


So i got admitted to both, and now i have to make my choice. Math and Computer Science is a program that involves co-op. So I would be working in-between semesters. Now I'm not sure what to do. Im leaning for math and computer science only because (math is there, so I'm safe with interest), and money is good during my undergrad.

I don't want to take on a huge amount of debt and end up struggling to get a job. 

So please reddit, let me know what you think. Feel free to share your opinions. I would love it if some science and computer science post their opinions so i can have a better understanding of both sides of the story.

Thanks Again!"

I am currently a computer science student at a pretty well known college. I am doing a year long internship at the moment before I go into my final year. 

Comp Sci wasn't my first choice. I switched plans many times. Then I took an introductory programming class, and I was good at it, so I decided I'd go into comp sci.

However, over the last 4 years and now in my internship, I have found that I do not enjoy programming. It's mind-numbingly dull for me, and it terrifies me that I am setting myself up to this for the rest of my life. The reason I find it boring is because I feel confined to my desk. There is limited social interaction, since programming is largely solitary. Sure, you have meetings to discuss features, but then you sit behind your computer for a few more hours, wondering what the heck the guy who programmed the program before you was thinking.

I know I want to finish my degree. I've worked too hard at it not to, and I wouldn't be able to afford more years of college. But I also know I do not want to do this for the rest of my life. But I don't know what else I would or could do. I enjoy photography, but mostly nature and landscapes, which don't provide a lot of job opportunities. I like travelling, but fat chance I can make money with that. I do want to teach abroad for a year after graduating, though. I also like writing, and I'm good at it if I take my time; this post was made in about 10 minutes, so some grammar might be off.

However, I have no long term plan right now. Everyone in my program has their plans of going straight to work after school, and coding for the rest of their lives. 

I'm not even sure what kind of advice I'm looking for other than, what are my options? "

Since I was younger, I've always wanted to create things and be on the cutting edge of new technologies. The idea of working with a company like Google that lets you spend time independently creating sounds amazing. Seeing projects like Google Glass excites me. I can see myself somewhere in the future working with a start up company. 

This summer, I've taken on an internship working with high-end database systems. I spend every day working on emerging technologies and working close to hardware systems, but I can't help but feel like the application of it to the client is abstracted from me. I still do programming in the job, but it's to interface with the databases rather than to a living human being.

Being a database administrator obviously pays really well, and it's nice that I have my foot in the door working in this field. I was hoping someone could provide some advice though. Is this a job that will let me be creative? Is there a niche of computer science and more specifically programming that will let me use my skills in databases to bring exciting technologies to consumers? What is there to be excited about? I'm learning so much right now but I'm having troubles deciding if this is a direction I really want to be headed in."

I currently about to start my second year at Iowa State University as a Computer Engineering major.  I love everything about the school except for one thing, my tuition bill.  I am attending as an out-of state-student due to the fact that the state I live in is shit broke and the University system is suffering from it.  That being said, I have to pay around 31K a year to attend.

About me:  I am a white, middle-class, male.  These three attributes make it nearly impossible for me to receive any real federal aid.  Now many of you may be thinking, ""Why can't your parents pay for you?"".  To this I have a very simple answer, my dad is an asshole and my mom is not financially able to.  Oh, and f.y.i, my parents are divorced which makes things that much harder.  I know this does not make me special, it just make me apart of the majority (sadly enough).

What I have done: A HUGE expense for any undergrad is living expenses.  Last year is cost me around $1000 a month to live in a dorm.  Yes that number includes food, but still.  After looking at this number, I decided to get an apartment for the upcoming school year.  In doing so, I was able to find a place for around $500 including utilities which the only variable would be food.  So I have been able to cut down my living expense nearly by half.

This probably should of been said first but I do not care.  I do not have good grades.  I fucked around a lot my first year making it that much more difficult to receive aid.  Since returning home, I have talking with a company that would like to hire me as an intern (just because I fucked around does not mean I am an idiot) and hire me after I graduate.  This internship will solve all my financial worries; they are willing to pay for my tuition, housing, and on top of that, they were going to pay me a yearly salary.   The only requirement I do not meet is my GPA (I need at least a 3.0).

Now I have come to my problem.  Since I fucked around to much this last year, I do not qualify for federal aid.  I really want this internship, so I have been looking at private loans.  Remember when I said my dad being an asshole?  Well, like most students I needed a cosigner for my loans.  So I reached out to my father.  I told him my predicament and basically told me that I should drop out and go to a CC since he will not cosign.  Let me tell you something about my dad, he would rather buy a BMW then help his own son.  Since my dad will not help me and my mom can not, I have been asking my extended family for help.  Everyone on my mom's side is more then willing to help me out any way that they can.  My dad's side, nothing.

Sorry for ranting, but this helps me vent my frustrations.

Down to the questions.  Has anyone been in a similar position, and if so, what have you done to pay for school?

I am not looking for handouts, just advice as to where I should look next.  Ideally I would like to find a place where I can get a student loan without a cosigner but I know that is unlikely. 

tl;dr I need help paying for school and I do not know where to look."

Earlier this year I took my first steps into game development for a game dev contest with a pet simulator called [Mini Morphs](https://www.pokki.com/app/Mini-Morphs) (think tamagotchi, but for the pc with active badge notifications and such such)

I was given the really awesome opportunity to intern at the company that held the contest, and for the past two months, have been working on my game to increase the scope of my game -- ultimately turning a little tech demo into something that was actually, you know, fun (games are supposed to be fun right?)

This community really helped me out during development and onward, giving me pointers, suggestions, bug testing, you name it and the people here didn't even think twice about spending their time on me. For that, I say thank you all.

[Here's a direct link for PC users who want to play my game](http://cdn.pokki.com/download/Pokki_Mini_MorphsSetup.exe)

What I really wanted to talk about though is expanding your game, and knowing when to add to new features and when the strip stuff away. As I said before, I only began coding and such earlier this year and because of this, am very limited in what I am capable of. The problem is that I have so many ideas for my game, I tend to get wrapped up in features that take much longer to develop than initially planned.

**How do others deal with this?** Is there a good sort of method for knowing when to add on that extra month of development in lue of spending the time bug fixing and polishing? Even now I am still incredibly dissatisfied as to the level of quality to my game. 

I remember listening to a speech given by an EA games dev who said that games we play are almost always wood versions, compared to the gold versions we have in our head. Does this ring true with everyone else, and if not, how do you ensure that your game is at a level you are happy with?

I know this ended up being a bit longer than I intended, but these were just some things I've been thinking about over the past few months of development. If it just seems like incoherent ramblings, then I apologize XD

I feel like such a fake.,foreverwhoknows,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wamib/i_just_found_out_im_graduating_from_university_at/,"Maybe I'm looking for more comfort than advice, but I feel terrible.  I just got a letter saying I'll be *summa cum laude* in the college of computer science and engineering.  This was followed by a letter saying I'm getting a medallion presented ""to the students with the highest grade point average in each college.""  This sounds like I'm being singled out as having *the* best GPA.  

Here's what I hate: I'm a terrible engineer.  I'm a great student, but an embarrassment of a person.  I've done no research outside of classes.  I've gotten no internships.  I don't even really like engineering.  I'm in  a place in my life where I'm really trying to figure out who I am and I know I don't deserve to be put on stage as ""the ideal engineer.""  It's making me sick to think about.  I feel like such a phony.  I'll be lauded in front of thousands of people and I don't deserve it at all.  

With any luck, it'll turn out that I've read this wrong and I'm only *one* of the medallion recipients, but it's hard to tell and the chance of being singled out is horrible to me."

I was the only IT in the company. We have six locations, and will soon have eight. I attempted to make the case a few times, that we needed another full-time IT person to help with the day-to-day user issues, if they want me to keep working on all these projects for all the departments.

The CEO decided to hire his friend's son for the position of IT intern. He went to college for some business degree, has no computer experience outside Facebook and a technology class he took in college, and is only really interested in the job because he had a hard time getting a job after his college baseball career tanked. He has been with us for a few months now. I've given him some simple maintenance tasks (taking care of medical thin client carts mostly), but mostly, he's been kind of my ""remote arm"" for taking care of things at other sites. He does things I can't do remotely, under my instruction, so we can cover more ground faster.

The CEO wants him trained up to be full-time, now that they've finally realized we need a second IT, and the status of his internship has come into question. They've sent me skills checklists from other departments, such as secretarial, to use as a template for his training. What I'm really wondering here is, can IT skills be taught with a checklist? It's not like it's a field where we have very specific, routine duties (outside bi-monthly desktop maintenance, or server maintenance that I definitely would not trust a padawan with). We fix things as they break, have several dozen applications that have all kinds of problems that are interrelated to other applications or operating systems. PC, networking, and computer troubleshooting all require a soft skill that I can't just teach with a checklist.

Because of the nepotism that goes on around here (in all departments), I don't see them letting the intern go. Have any of you had to train a layman from the ground up? I mean, the guy needed my help installing Adobe Reader."

Long post, sorry in advance. 22 years old, from the beautiful state of Colorado. I left the state to attend a top university on the east coast. I studied international business and Spanish. After my junior year, I got an internship back home. Worked through the summer, liked it decently, did well and was offered a job. Unfortunately they required an answer by November, and through parents and others’ advice I took the job offer, thinking that if I wanted to I could find something later. In this economy, it’s hard to turn a job down. Start date is mid-August. After graduating this past May, I decided to do an internship program in Chile working as a financial research analyst in an investment bank.

The problem is that in August I have to make the decision to either return home or stay and continue working at the bank, where I know that I will have a position. At this point I literally cannot make up my mind. I’ll give a rundown of the pros and cons of both.

Pros of staying in Chile: * Spanish minor in university, the best way to become fluent in the language is through immersion * It’s a great opportunity at the bank to learn a lot and gain experience * I love the city/people, met a girl who I just started seeing who seems to be really cool and I’m into her, she’s helping teach me Spanish and it would kind of suck to cut it short

Cons of staying in Chile: *The city is expensive as fuck and my projected salary would not be close to what I would earn in my job at the states *Sick of living off my parents dollar and want some independence; not sure if I can live completely separate from the parents w/ staying down here *I would have to go through the awkward process of declining my job offer a few weeks before I start, the company having thought that I would be working there for months now

Pros of coming back home: *Colorado is an awesome place to live, and its hard being away from family and friends and certain aspects of the States (music, food, great weather, Chipotle! ect.) *Good paying job at a good company, could save/make a lot more money there 

Cons of coming home: *My job isn’t something I see myself doing for a career, don’t see much upward mobility *A big corporation, and not sure that type of thing is for me to climb the corporate ladder *Not sure if I would get a realistic chance to come back if I leave, I’ve got no responsibilities now

This is just a quick overview of the different aspects of the decision I am struggling with. I know that I am extremely fortunate and blessed to even be in this situation. My grandparents paid for my education and I am almost completely debt free. At the same time, I am a very motivated and dedicated person, and I am trying to not take these opportunities for granted.

What do I do?",questionedaccount,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9rqv/fresh_out_of_college_and_totally_worthless_what/,"This question came into my mind when I saw the “Colbert on Colleges” post. (http://i.imgur.com/Ka9Pr.png) .  I realized that I am not the only individual who is experiencing this problem.  Some backstory, if you please.

I graduated six months ago with a degree in English Education for High School.  I did well in my courses and my student teaching process went well. I enjoyed working with the students to a degree. However, since graduating and completing my internship I realized one terrible error to my entire college experience… I don’t think I like or want to teach. 

I like working with people and I love taking leadership roles.  I was in marching band my entire student life (high school, college).  To those of you who don’t know, marching band allows students to step up and take leadership roles with their various sections. I interviewed for those roles and I achieved them and succeeded at them. I truly enjoyed my time working with people and an organization.

Everything in my resume says I should be great for teaching. I am resistant towards it and frankly, there are no teaching positions available to me in my area. I look every week and I get more and more depressed when even the janitorial positions start disappearing.  

Now, with a degree behind me and no teaching jobs ahead of me- I am at a crossroads. I’ve dabbled with the idea of going back to school, getting my masters, and looking for a different job.

My question is… What would you do?  What should I do?  If I go back to school, how ill that benefit me other than putting me in more debt?  How do I go about finding another job with my skill sets?  I’ve navigated Monster.com with absolute failure. I have no idea what I am qualified for or not… I’d like to try my hand and writing, but where does that lead me?

What would you say to us college graduates who are sitting around going, “Well, fuck…. What can I do now?”

Sorry if this is confusing, ranting, raving, bitching, moaning or whatever you perceive. I just saw what a vast expanse of knowledge Reddit has to offer and I figured I’d pick your brains for help.

Thanks!

Tl;dr: You got me, I am long winded. I graduated college for teaching. No jobs available. Do I go back to school? How do I find other jobs? What should I do?

Edit: As someone mentioned, I think I am at the point where I want to re-evaluate myself.  What else do I want to do and how do I do that?"

w9pro,0,2012-07-09,I have a brother who lives and argues like Bill O'Reilly. Being home is hell. How do you handle people like this?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9pro/i_have_a_brother_who_lives_and_argues_like_bill/,"I've tried absolutely everything. Fighting back, ignoring it, staying calm and trying to rationalize, literally nothing works.

He lies, steals, exaggerates and picks a fight about absolutely everything. He plays the victim in nearly every situation and can't go a single day without bringing up how unfair everything is because he was in the army and how dare we treat him like shit? He blatantly lies during arguments, stretches facts and covers it up by just screaming at you after he asks (screams at) you to explain yourself. 

The minute you try to talk back, you get told to shut the fuck up and that you're wrong. He uses middle school playground tactics and even goes as far as teasing like an 8 year old might. He's a huge hypocrite and, somehow, REFUSES TO SEE ANY OF THIS. He says straight up ""I'm right, you're wrong, I don't care what you say"".

He's in his mid twenties and lives at home, hasn't had a job since he left the army (3 years ago) and is above getting one (""I'm not working at a fucking McDonalds, I was in the army."" [while simultaneously bashing people like Wall Street protesters for being too proud to get a job at McDonalds, supposedly]), hasn't EVER held a job for more than a month, refuses to get one because he gets unemployment money (which he spends on drugs and expensive shit he doesn't use, all the while never paying our parents back for money he's stolen over the years) and is ""above"" minimum wage, sits in his room all day playing video games and watching movies with the door shut and screams at everyone else for all the shit ""they're doing wrong"".

I work a 40 hr/wk unpaid internship right now and go to school full time, I'm highly involved at a million things at school, I have a lot of interests and I'm really active throughout my day every day. He still finds any way he can to tear me down and call me worthless, and that anything I do doesn't really matter because he was in the army and I wasn't. We could be arguing about whether peanut butter or jelly goes on a sandwich first, and it would inevitably end with ""YOU WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER STOOD UP FOR ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE, I DEFENDED MY COUNTRY AND THIS IS WHAT I GET?!"" Then, he'll take to Facebook and twist, mangle and completely fabricate anything I said and put it up in a status in hopes of garnering sympathy from his army buddies.

It kills me because our parents did everything for us. They passed us off in hallways when we were younger while they worked opposite shifts, but still tried to give us absolutely everything in their power. My father is one of the most incredible, giving and selfless people I know, and all my brother can do is fake having daddy issues and start monstrous fights with him while making him feel worthless. My father will never say anything back and is absolutely miserable lately. Neither of my parents deserve this.

I know everyone knows someone like this, but this is to an absolute extreme. He's tearing the family apart. He has gotten into physical altercations with both parents and been told to move out, but somehow everything is slowly forgotten about and I seem to be the only one who remembers and stays angry (which he then flips out about).

I'm not looking for sympathy, I really genuinely want to know how you deal with people like this. Nothing works and I'm going insane with frustration. I feel like I see WHY he's acting the way he is and that it's incredibly predictable, but nobody else seems to want to do anything about it. I feel alone on this.

TL;DR: My brother is a selfish, arrogant, lying, hypocritical waste of space who is ripping my family apart and it feels like there's nothing to be done. At the end of my rope. Those with experience, please help.

Edit: I know the obvious answer would be ""Don't talk to him"", but as I mentioned above, I have already tried that and all it does is send him into a rage where he'll stand outside/pound on my door screaming condescending things about me until I come out."

I am 2 years into a CS major and I am almost done with my 2nd internship. However, I've enjoyed the work I do at school much more than in my internships. It seems like at school I'm always learning something interesting, whether it be trying to reverse engineer a C program given some assembly code, learning and implementing some cool machine learning algorithm, or working in a team where we make our own database from scratch. On the other hand, in my internships I'm making web apps that query some database or trying to sift through a ton of Java code that doesn't seem to do much to find some obscure bug. When I talk to my other friends with internships I get similar vibes from them. My question is, how can I find a job where I work on the cool stuff that I learn about in school? Something where I'd be challenged in a ""problem-solving"" sense, like writing a compiler or implementing some crazy algorithms. I don't really know what I want specifically, but I know I definitely don't want to design web apps for a living"

Ive got myself a summer internship and I was thinking about investing the money i will make into the stock market. I have a particular company in mind that i think is really going to do well in the future. I want to invest now so possibly I can make lots of moneys when im older.

I was thinkin id take a couple thousand of the money Im makin this summer and buy as many shares as that will get me of this company. I figure id hold on to it for awhile and maybe in a few years ill make some decent cash out of it (better then if i left it in a bank), or maybe ill just buy more shares. My logic is ""wow everyone loves apple, I would be willing to bet they come out with some crazy new product / everyone will be spending money on their products somehow that their stocks are going to go up."" Apple isnt really the company im lookin at but its the same idea. ""this company is going to be huge, everyone will buy what they are selling, i buy stock now, 10 yrs go by, ????, profit."" 

It be like when the TV was first invented and all of a sudden there is this new company called NBC. I think theyre gonna be huge so i decide to buy stock. next thing you know everyone watches NBC and im rich

What do i need to know before I go along with this plan and is it worth it if im only getting $2000 worth of shares. AND is my logic for buying this stock good or clearly coming from someone who has no idea how the stock market works.

I had planned to leave early around 12 noon to head on over to a hangout with some high school friends (I've just graduated this year).

At about 9AM, I went up to my boss and told him that I wanted to leave work early. He asked, ""You doin' anything fun?""

I responded with, ""I'm going to a party."" 

""Well have fun then,"" he said as I headed back to my desk.

As 12AM approached, I started getting a feeling of impending doom, because just one week earlier I had planned to go on a trip to the Sand Dunes in Michigan with some friends, but, unfortunately, a storm hit last Sunday, and our trip was cancelled.

That wasn't the problem though. The real problem was the communication between myself (a guy) and a ""friend,"" who happened to be a girl. She has a boyfriend, which is my only guess as to why she never responded to my messages leading up to our scheduled departure time. She left me hanging like a broken doorknob waiting to be fixed. To make things worse, I got wind that she actually ended up going without me later in the week. Feels pretty damn bad, man.

As you've probably guessed already, when I left my internship to go over another girl's house for the ""hangout"" at 12AM and finally arrived at her house for the ""hangout's"" scheduled starting time of 1PM, not a soul was at home. Mind you, I had messaged her the night before to confirm the party's starting time, and whether or not it was still planned to go on. On her empty doorstep I messaged her saying, ""You're not at home, are you? Thanks for wasting my time and money."" (Because I could still be at work still making money as I type THIS!) 


On my way home, driving past my old high school, adrenaline started coursing through my blood, and I floored it!!! I zoomed dangerously in my dad's 2008 Cadillac CTS at 60 mph in a 35, and I honestly didn't care if I had endangered anyone. I haven't been this mad in FOUR YEARS.

In time the curtain-edges will grow light.  
Till then I see what's really always there:  
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,  
Making all thought impossible but how  
And where and when I shall myself die.  
Arid interrogation: yet the dread  
Of dying, and being dead,  
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.  
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse  
- The good not done, the love not given, time  
Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because  
An only life can take so long to climb  
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;  
But at the total emptiness for ever,  
The sure extinction that we travel to  
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,  
Not to be anywhere,  
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.  
  
  
This is a special way of being afraid  
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,  
That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade  
Created to pretend we never die,  
And specious stuff that says No rational being  
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing  
That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,  
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,  
Nothing to love or link with,  
The anasthetic from which none come round.  
  

And so it stays just on the edge of vision,  
A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill  
That slows each impulse down to indecision.  
Most things may never happen: this one will,  
And realisation of it rages out  
In furnace-fear when we are caught without  
People or drink. Courage is no good:  
It means not scaring others. Being brave  
Lets no one off the grave.  
Death is no different whined at than withstood.  
  

Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.  
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,  
Have always known, know that we can't escape,  
Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.  
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring  
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring  
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.  
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.  
Work has to be done.  
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.
  
It's hard to describe how much meaning this poem has for me, but I'll just say it meant a lot that there was someone out there who felt the same things I did and was able to write them so beautifully and succinctly.  

So, please share! Happy, sad, whatever. I'd love to see some poems that have meaning for you, Redditors, and maybe an explanation of why you love them.

wdzsi,1,2012-07-11,"Employed Redditors, what are some tips you can give our soon-to be graduating Redditors to improve their odds of landing a job out of College. Ill Start",SOLUNAR,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wdzsi/employed_redditors_what_are_some_tips_you_can/,"I graduated with a double Major in Management and Finance, i can tell you that Management is a bit of a broad major and if you plan on doing so, i would highly suggest finding a concentration. Its not going to be as easy as getting a management role because of your degree.

For my Finance peers, i would suggest learning basic software ( although this is a bit of a duh..... i often see people with little to no skills ). I would recommend learning Excel in and out, no matter what type of business you go into, Excel is a great thing to know, it can be used for almost any type of office task and can land you a job.

I always like to ask friends in college, ""what do you want to do when you graduate? Where would you like to work?"" , if they are not sure about it, i can tell they might have a tough time. I would suggest reading up on careers you find interesting, and start learning what type of knowledge you will need, its surprising but, Youtube tutorials can prepare you for an interview if you know what to search.


If you want to get into Investment Banking, or Wall-Street, its often suggested you look for an internship as early as sophomore year. As many of the hot shot firms will only hire from their internship programs, i found this out the hard way.


Most importantly, please figure out what the jobs available to your major are, and start aligning your skill sets for those jobs. You might want to start thinking of getting series licenses if you want to go into investing.


Good luck to everyone!"
wdg4y,8,2012-07-11,Anyone else lose interest in engineering near the end of school?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wdg4y/anyone_else_lose_interest_in_engineering_near_the/,"97% of the way to getting my BS in ME. Recently decided that I don't want to be an engineer anymore. While I do really well in school (3.8 gpa) I don't feel that it's because I am a good engineer or have strong interest, but because I've simply learned how to get good grades efficiently (absorbing information and regurgitating it). 


I feel like I have been disillusioned as far as what real world engineering is actually like. I've had several internships in all kinds of companies and have come to realize that I hate it. It's all business and money games. And I don't really have to drive to go to graduate school and do real technical engineering. 


While there are parts of engineering school that I like, for example I sometimes enjoy grinding out complex calculations -- dicking with equations and computer programs when there is a clear goal -- but in reality it is just a lot of ambiguity and dealing with people and going to meetings and phone calls and excel spreadsheets and endless powerpoints just to find some cheap company in China that will manufacture a boring pointless piece of equipment.


Anyone out there going through/have gone through similar frustrations?"
wdar7,6,2012-07-11,At a crossroads... Hoping to make a decision to become happy. ,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wdar7/at_a_crossroads_hoping_to_make_a_decision_to/,"Hi,

The title says it all. I am a college graduate as of December 2010 (BSc in Economics) and am unemployed. I had a decent GPA and found a job quickly once I graduated... which I quickly began to hate due to the fact that it made me miserable... and I quit shortly after a year. 

I took some time off to recharge my batteries and temporarily moved back in with my parents to get my feet back under me (I still am there). I have spent the past 1.5 months actively applying for jobs, and while I have a few leads, I'm having a hard time becoming enthusiastic about any prospects due to the negative impact my first professional position had on me and I'm really at odds as to where I want to take my life from this point forward. 

Part of me regrets the major that I chose in college... While there are opportunities available to an economics degree holder, I feel as if many of them are for general and generic ""business"" positions and I'm undecided how I feel about gaining another one of these positions. I have the fear that it will end up like my first position and I will hate my life. Part of me regrets choosing the major I did over another major in an engineering-related field or a major that could lead to some sort of healthcare-related position. 

At the same time, I look back on some of the decisions I made in college and I regret not taking hold of the opportunities available to me. I never held an internship and was never particularly close with any of my professors in college (although I was a grader and the prof has agreed to let me use him as a reference)... These are things I regret and if I had a chance to go back I would want to try to become more involved in the academic aspect of college to try to forge some of these connections. I feel like because of the fact that I never held an internship, I lost out on valuable experience that could have helped me determine what type of job I should be looking for and now it's too late. 

More than anything else in life, I just want to find a career that I'm happy with. I'm not exactly a type ""A"" person, as I'm more easygoing and relaxed (I guess type ""B""), and I really feel as if the corporate rat race may not be right for me. 

How does one know what to devote their life to and what kind of job is right for them? Should I try going back to school for a different degree? How will I even know if I'm making the right job choice? I know that there are never two of the same paths to success, but I just want to make a choice that will make me happiest in the long run.

EDIT: TL;DR - Graduated college, got a job, hated life, was miserable, and quit. Now deciding between going back to school for a different (undecided) major or getting another corporate slave job. How do people know what career is best for them? "
wd99o,1,2012-07-11,"Dear Reddit, I am in a rather difficult situation and I need some serious help. I don't know what to do.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wd99o/dear_reddit_i_am_in_a_rather_difficult_situation/,"Hi Reddit.

I am a closeted gay son to a devout Christian father. Some crazy situation happened lately and I need some help because I am so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.

There will be a giant wall of text so please bare with me while I write the entire story.

Some background story on my family:

Ever since I could remember, my parents have been divorced because my dad cheated on my mom. When she found out, she went insane and locked my two sisters and I in the bathroom with her tried to commit suicide by ingesting pills. That failed miserably. When my dad wasn't around, she packed all our belongings and took us to Korea, where her family resided. My dad filed a police report and since then, she's been on the FBI's wanted list as a kidnapper and is unable to return to USA. This all happened when I was three years old.

Growing up, she told me that my dad died of a cancer. I always believed her and my sisters who knew everything didn't tell me a thing. We lived a slightly destitute life. My mom became an alcoholic and smoked cigarettes everyday. She did some stocks to earn money, but by the time I became ten years old, she couldn't support all three of us anymore and decided to send us back to US under our dad's care. The entire time we were going back, my mom told us that we should avenge for her and ruin dad's life because he ruined hers. I didn't really know what was going on back then so I just simply nodded and listened to her like a good kid.

When I met my dad, he was remarried to a tall Caucasian women. Listening to my mom's orders, I thought it'd be the best to show disrespect to his new wife in order to avenge for my mom. About a half year passed and she couldn't take it anymore. One night, my dad and his wife got into an argument and dad ended up sleeping on my bed. That night, my stepmom stormed into my room and argued with dad once more, I pretended to be asleep. She then proceeded to pull the blanket on the bed and tried to throw it on the floor, and I flew off the bed with the blanket. Enraged, my dad got furious at my stepmom and she left the morning after. I never saw her ever again after that.

About a half year passed and I was finally enrolled into an elementary school and I lived a fine life where dad worked all week long and came home late night. My sisters were busy adjusting to their new school life and my dad was never around, so I learned to occupy my time on the computer playing games. No kids lived in my neighborhood either for some reason so I became glued to computer games. My dad didn't approve of my behavior most of the time because he didn't see merits of computer gaming and always yelled at me. But he didn't give me other things to do- he didn't let me sign up for any sports or activities even when I asked.

Fast forward about 6 years, I began to realize that I was a homosexual man and I was extremely disgusted at myself. I couldn't accept myself and I hated myself- I resorted to slitting my wrists and spending all my time online on how to 'fix' myself. I got extremely depressed and my relationship with my dad grew worse. I think he saw my depression as unacceptable and everyday he would get upset with me for every little thing I did. My sisters went off to college and I was mostly left home everyday by myself. There would be times when my dad went off to business trips and I had to stay home alone for months at times. I was extremely lonely. One day, I swallowed a bunch of my dad's sleeping pills in hopes of killing myself, but after calling a friend and coming out to her, I saw that I wanted to live. I stuck a finger down my throat because I wanted to live again and I threw up some of the pills. Then I passed out for an entire day. And since then, I've been learning to accept myself albeit only to myself, I haven't admitted it to anyone yet at this point.

When my dad came back, I did my best to amend our relationship. But every time it improved and my I felt closer to my dad, he would push me away from him and give himself a reason to be mad at me. He would get mad at me for the way I ate my food, the friends I hung out with (all A+ students!), being glued to the computer, staying up late night, and other normal teenage behaviors. I learned to keep things to myself and stopped complaining about menial things. I learned to behave the way my dad wanted me to behave, but I was still ignored by my dad. 

He retired during my senior year and began to stay home every day. He began regularly attending churches and became a devout Christian. He'd get mad at me for not going to church with him. When I did go to church with him, he got mad because I wouldn't dress properly (shorts weren't acceptable to him) or be on my phone. I tried to get out more to avoid his presence, but he got furious if I went out too much. If I stayed home, I became a victim of his emotional abuse as well as coupe incidences of physical abuse.

I finally graduated my high school as a valedictorian (but our school had several valedictorians cuz they gave it to top xyz% of the class based on their gpa). Even then I was an eyesore to my dad and he didn't approve of my grades because I had couple Bs. I got accepted into University of Virginia, where one of my sister had attended, and I told my dad expecting him to be proud- but he just complained that everyone gets into UVA. I was disappointed since only twenty people from my school got accepted into UVA and it's considered very prestigious in my area.

When I started college, relationship between dad I grew worse because he told me I am unable to communicate well with him. He complained that I use him because I always ask him for money but I needed money to eat and get by in the school. I found a paradise in school where people accepted me for who I am and more so showed respect for me. I became very outgoing and made many friendships. Of course, my grades plummeted my first year because I'd been going out too much. My dad scolded for my behavior and called all my friends losers. 

It was around this time when he decided to kick my sister out for disobeying him. She was on her last year of school and she had to get her wisdom teeth extracted. Dad wanted her to drive while she was on anesthetics in order to return home from her surgery but she refused to drive under the influence and asked her friend to drive her. My dad got upset and cut all financial support to her. My sister and I pooled our allowance together to support my sister during her last semester and she eventually graduated and moved to Korea to reside with my mother.

That summer, Home became something of a nightmare for me. My other sister had been living home after graduating and my dad became a tyranny. The house became home to constant dissonance and fury. I got a job to stay out of the house as much as I could.

The following year is when all the shit went down. I started seeing a counselor regarding my family harmony and also seek help to accept myself. I also met a long distance boyfriend and fell in love with him. I saved up as much money as I could and visited him once a month in NY. One day, he decided to visit down but I had to pick him up from DC. I told dad that I was coming home to see the family because I miss them and I also wanted to take the car. I took the car and picked my boyfriend up, and headed down to school. We stopped at a red light and I leaned over to give him a peck on the cheek. A police officer was behind us and he stopped us when the light turned green, and he gave me a reckless driving ticket. I was appalled but I didn't know what to do, I knew I was driving under the speed limit because that's one thing I can do right. I told my dad that I'd gotten a reckless ticket and he was extremely upset. I defended myself in the court, but the judge wouldn't hear it and sentenced me guilty the second I finished speaking. I appealed the case and my dad hired a lawyer for the next hearing which is in august. Shortly after, my boyfriend and I made travel plans to Toronto to visit friends. He left for NY couple days later.

Short info about my boyfriend, he graduated from NYU that semester and got accepted into an internship in San Francisco. He insisted that we break up once he moves to San Francisco because we are at a different stage of life. Bitter but without a choice, I agreed. I figured I couldn't do anything if he already set his mind and staying together wouldn't be healthy at that point. We planned the Toronto trip to be our last trip together before we part.

Feeling pretty crappy about my future.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wd6m2/senior_bsee_candidate_feeling_pretty_crappy_about/,"I will be graduating this fall with a B.S. in Electronics Engineering. The school I go to is well known, but the engineering program completely sucks and I feel like I know just the basics (if that). I feel I could have read a rudimentary electronics book from amazon.com in a few weeks and be where I'm at now. 

My biggest concern is finding a job. Like I said, I graduate this November. I'm going to be moving from the Boston area to Fort Lauderdale, because I hate life up here and I've lived down there before. 

All of the jobs I've searched online have very stringent minimum requirements. In many cases, 5+ or 10+ years experience, proficiency in certain programming languages, very specialized experience (I mean, how many people have 10 years of Airbua A320 avionic experience?), a PE license, etc. 

I have none of those. No experience. No specialization. No programming knowledge aside from one C programming class I took. No internship... 

I got into Florida Atlantic University's graduate program for MSEE, but I already have a HUGE student loan debt. 

I'm moving to Florida December 1st no matter what. Can anyone give me any guidance? Grad school? Try to find a job? Become an Air Force officer?  I'm feeling pretty pessimistic right now..."

wcz1h,20,2012-07-10,"Recent CS graduate, can't get a job and not sure what I am doing wrong.",tooodels,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wcz1h/recent_cs_graduate_cant_get_a_job_and_not_sure/,"I'm trying to stay optimistic, but its hard when you get rejected from so many places.

I graduated in May with a BS in Computer Science.  Since I graduated in May, I have been applying to 5-7 places every week. I have applied to over 100 places, which isn't that many at all but I usually take some time to apply to places that feel like a good fit for me instead of just blindly applying to every job I find.  Should I be applying to more places, even ones I might not be qualified for?

For the most part, I have been finding jobs via linkedin, indeed.com, dice.com, and my schools job board.  For almost all of these I am sending an email with a cover letter and my resume attached.

I have been getting some interviews, maybe 1 every week though all of them have been phone or skype interviews.  I tend to do well in interviews except for algorithms questions.  I try my best to talk through my problem solving process but I tend to blank out and then have the solution come to me the second the interview is over which is really frustrating. So far I have only had one offer and it was only for 45k, which I am going to reject because that is way too low.

What else should I be doing?  Is sending emails a waste of time? I do a little bit of programming in my free time and I have a few things I can show but its nothing that special.  I could probably find some open source project to contribute to but I have no idea what I want to do or what is going to help me the most.  My specialization for my degree was in computer graphics so I have tried applying to game development jobs.  I have built a few games as part of my undergraduate course work which I show to them, but I haven't gotten interviews with any game development studios which I applied to.  On the other hand, I hear so many negative things about the game industry and I don't know if its for me.  I just don't care about video games anymore as well.

Most places that have rejected me and gave a reason said that I just didn't have enough experience.  I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months so I have something but I don't really want to do web development.  I also worked as a intern at a pretty big company, but it was such a terrible experience that I wouldn't want to pursue a career there. 

tl:dr basically, I feel like I am at square one and I am not sure what I should be doing.  I keep applying to places, getting an interviews here and there, but I am getting no where.  I am not sure what I want to do with CS or if I even want to do software development.  I feel stuck because I have this degree and its my best chance at finding a job and i'm getting no where.

Edit:  Thanks for everyone's input I really appreciate it.  I have a lot to think about it seems.

I just called the firm handling the foreclosure, I am having my dad who is in a retirement community get a signed authorization letter faxed to them so they will talk to me about everything and give me figures on paying these people.

We have never  been late or problematic paying the monthly payments, Dad has a pension and SS that more than covered monthly bills, but the last time he went from the nursing home to living at home again (which only lasted 2 weeks) he kicked out the two men I had living in and maintaining the house. It fell into disrepair got robbed more than once and mail started piling up. Monthly checks always got sent, though it is possible the March or April payment did not go through, the May and June payments were sent back when the account had more than enough funds so we were behind by multiple months all of a sudden. Last friday my friend took my father to his bank and they spoke with the mortgage company and my friend misinterpreted the situation telling me the house would not get foreclosed on, but the manager canceled the follow up meeting monday and after calling him yesterday and having my friend and father go back this is the situation I find myself in now.

SO, I know there have to be plenty of people here that have gone through the foreclosure process and could give me some advice. **Important details:**



My house is in California in LA county

I am in Paris doing an internship and have one month left to go, if I leave now I have 0% of graduating on time

We have the money to pay the loan to current no problem

My friends have been everything from clutch to irresponsible whenever I reach out for help with talking to my dad, doing things at my house like GOING THROUGH THE MAIL for things like payment collections! Overall they have been unreliable.

My mother is deceased I have no brothers or sisters, my dads family is spread out and has not offered up any assistance in the last few years when we could have used it

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Where do you stand on in on the whole pro life/choice argument?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmoxn?context=5)|I definitely understand why someone would be against abortion, but I just don't sympathize with them trying to control the choice. It's hard for someone to be forced into an abortion, that's why we have a solo counseling session with them. But after working with so many different women, I can clearly see how abortions being legal affects their lives. Shit happens, people get pregnant when they didn't want to, and not everyone can handle going through a pregnancy.
 |But yes, I understand their argument, I just think their argument is a personal choice, not a political ideology.
[*""forced into an abortion""*  For medical reasons I'm guessing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d01tj?context=5)|No I mean being forced by someone to have abortion. We don't allow any one other than he patient in counseling sessions to ensure that she is making the decision herself and no one is forcing her.
[But whose choice does that become? Shouldn't women and men be held responsible for their promiscuity?  Would you say that allowing abortions leads to more irresponsible behavior? The child certainly doesn't get to choose whether or not it gets to be born. If the child had a choice I would think it would choose life over not being born at all. People use the argument that a fertilized embryo is not the beginning of life but if you were to live it unharmed would it not develop to the stage of life we consider the ""beginning"". I believe in pro choice and that a woman should be allowed to do whatever she wants with her body, but for me the problem becomes when does it become her body and not another human's body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvxu?context=5)|Yeah it's a hard debate. I don't think it adds to promiscuity, that's similar to arguing that teaching comprehensive sex ed makes more high schoolers have sex--when statistics show pushing abstinence leads to more teen pregnancy. I think abortions is one of those things that people change their minds when they are put in the situation, a lot of women were pro life, but that changes when they accidentally get pregnant. Also, abortions are pretty expensive (obviously cheaper than raising a child though) so it's not something anyone really uses for birth control, at least I haven't come across that.
[What's the hardest type of situation you've had to work with? Like do you get young patients or the woman trying to keep it from her abusive husband, that kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvps?context=5)|My hardest situation was a woman that had to abort because she was recently diagnosed with cancer. Had she been healthy, she would have kept it, but she need chemo and it's not something you should do when you're pregnant. I also worked with a women in an abusive relationship, it was very violent. Fortunately her partner was in jail (last I heard) so she is safe.
[Do you ever run into past patients in situations elsewhere? How is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvps?context=5)|The city I live in is fairly small, so yes I have run into some of my patients. It's weird. I just let them lead on whether or not they want to acknowledge me. 
[I recently spoke with someone who cited the protestors yelling at/doing things to her as one of her fears about going to a clinic. I had no idea how to respond as I can imagine that would be extremely traumatizing. What advice would you give someone who had similar fears?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d65cq?context=5)|Put on a game face. Or smile and wave. You don't have to talk to them, and if the parking lot is privately owned by the clinic, they cannot approach you. The best thing is just not engaging them, they are anticipating a reaction from you, and giving them that makes them satisfied.
[Thank you for doing this AMAA. I am quite fascinated with all of this. What is it like to accompany someone during the procedure? Was it difficult for you at first? Do women cry often? Do you still accompany the woman in the room if the father is there? And do you often get women who have no choice but to abort (i.e. medical reasons\)? If so, do their emotional reactions differ from those who are choosing to abort for other reasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cph18?context=5)|So many questions! Firstly, yes it was pretty weird at first to go into procedures with women. I trained a lot by shadowing other counselors though, so that actually became the part I caught on to faster. When they have fathers or friends I still accompany them, but in those cases it's more to assist the doctor and make sure the patient is doing fine. We have an optional anti anxiety med if they are super nervous for the procedure, and if they choose to be doped up, it's important to have someone there checking their vitals that knows what the side affects are.
 |Some women cry. It can be pretty painful for some people, everyone's bodies are different like that so we can't really predict what their pain levels will be. But it is a pretty weird experience to have someone prodding around your uterus when you are conscience, not to mention all the varying levels of emotions they have on just making their decision.
 |I have had a few patients that really had no choice. Those are by far the most sad. I had a patient that had been trying to get pregnant for years, she finally got pregnant right after finding out she had cancer. Those patients have it hard, especially if they wanted children. We usually recommend regular therapy after the procedure for those patients. We also had someone call us from a local Catholic hospital; she was on the waiting list for an organ donation and she accidentally got pregnant, you can't get organs donated when you are pregnant and the hospital she was at refused to give her one. There was nothing we could do, since it's not our hospital. 
[I've always wondered...what's the actual process of getting an abortion like? Is there anesthetic? Do the patients feel sore afterwards? Does it take long? I'm sorry if these are ignorant/already answered questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cqsca?context=5)|The process nowadays is mostly suction. So it's a process of dilation and then using a small suction device to remove everything. There is also a medical abortion that is an option when the gestational age is 8 weeks or under, that is basically a mixture of meds that induce a miscarriage. For procedures that we do, there is an option for anti anxiety medication given through IV and we have an anti pain med used for severe pain, which is pretty rare, would be more for someone that has an ovarian cyst. A whole procedure (at my clinic) is about 15 minutes, including set up and confirming that he abortion was complete. Those all change though the farther along in pregnancy you are, I think it's an overnight hospitalization thing if you go farther than what we do.
[Can anything go wrong with it , is it 100% safe or can the ""Abortee"" suffer some horrible death or altercations later in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dfj63?context=5)|I know in the state I'm in, we've never had a death since abortion has been legal. There are always possibilities of side affects though. Like someone could have an allergic reaction to the numbing agent we use on their cervix. When we did emergency response training, it was all like worst case scenarios; like someone shoots up with heroin, opts for the anti anxiety med we can do, and that mixed could make an overdose. After the procedure, women have specific care instructions; take all the antibiotics we give them, no sex, no tampons, etc. Those instructions are to prevent infection, which more than anything would be the only thing that could potentially cause severe side affects. If you get an infection and let it go untreated, it can turn in pelvic inflammatory disease, so it's similar to not treating an STD. PID can cause infertility and I think death if it goes untreated, however if women are following our instructions, their chances of an infection are very low and if they show any signs of infection we have them call us and we will treat it before it turns into PID. I've never had anyone even get an infection though.
[As a counselor do you have many women who regret their decision later? how do you help the cope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5co2no?context=5)|I actually don't work as much with aftercare patients. We definitely have people that do that at our clinic though. I have honestly never heard of anyone regretting it more than ""I wish I didn't get pregnant"" though. Most women feel more relieved than anything. Of course, if someone is mentally unstable before the abortion, they will most likely still be unstable after the procedure. 
[Other than obvious mental instability, is there anything else that would come out during a counseling session that would indicate that a patient would have emotional or psychological fallout after the procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d619q?context=5)|Well most women will just tell me if they are worried of how they will do after. We always discuss how they think they will feel after the procedure. Obviously if someone is in an abusive situation we make sure that they have a restraining order or something to keep them safe.
[So theres no sense of regret at all for most, its just completely casual to them :/  thats sad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cubeo?context=5)|Or it's a good thing because they thought it out before they did it. Abortions (and unplanned pregnancies in general) have actually gone down in the last year or so in the US.
[My question: Are there steps that you take with minors who are getting an abortion that are vastly different from an adult?  If so, what are they?  How do you deal with minors in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cr6y4?context=5)|Hope that answered it for you! Supportive partners are the best.
[*At 8 weeks it is not a fetus!! It's still an embryo.*  Who are you trying to convince, me or you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cwz5v?context=5)|I just hate that propaganda says it is. Science says otherwise.
[I am 100% pro-choice, but kind of curious: What do they do with the fetus after they abort it? Has anyone requested it be buried? Why can't they put someone under for an abortion? How painful are they? How many people were using BC and had it fail? That is my nightmare.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cuoej?context=5)|Fetuses are sent away with human waste and needles, you know the red boxes they have at doctor's offices. It's currently illegal to send fetuses in for stem cell research, because that would make it beneficial to abortion clinics and it would look like we were encouraging abortions in order to make more for stem cells. I've never had anyone request to bury it, but I'm sure it's been done before.
 |Putting someone under for any procedure adds a significant amount of risk. It's a 15 minute procedure, and one of the most common outpatient surgeries. I believe in later pregnancy abortions they do need to be put under, but I have no experience with that.
 |It's crazy how many people get pregnant when they are on birth control. It's definitely made me more paranoid about it. For the most part it's user error though, like taking a pill late or something. Specifically progesterone only pills need to be on a tighter schedule for taking pills, that kind is fairly common for someone to pregnant on. It really kills me when someone comes in that got pregnant with an IUD in, those are so affective, but shit still happens.
[How much fetal matter is there for a 6 week pregnancy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dsp96?context=5)|Very little. For pregnancies that young, the lab tech looks for the embryotic sack, which is very small, to confirm the pregnancy was terminated.
[As someone who fully defends a woman's right to get an abortion, a counter argument I hear sometimes is that people use abortion clinics as their form of birth control instead of condoms, the pill, etc.  My question is: do you see many/any returning patients?  Do you think this counter argument holds water? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czdhb?context=5)|No I think that argument is pretty dumb. Just logically speaking, who would want to spend $600+ every month or every few months on birth control? Abortions aren't  cheap. Usually if someone comes in for a repeated abortion it's birth control failure or they had an abortion at 16 but now they are in their 30's. And no one is comfortable wih someone putting all that equipment in their vagina, not a common birth control. 
[What is the youngest person you've counselled?  How did that go? Was it especially emotionally draining on you or them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5coqro?context=5)|My youngest patient was 16. Surprisingly though, in my experience, the younger women handle abortions much better than older women. In general, younger girls more willingly open up with me in counseling sessions and handle the actual procedure much better. Most older women (I'm talking 30's ish) don't really open up and are more upset with and during the procedure. It could also be that they don't want to open up to me about their abortions because I do look pretty young. I've probably only counseled women under 20 around 4 times, so it's actually more rare than people think. And I think all of them came in with their moms too.
[Have the protesters ever done something really bad, or gone too far? Have women ever entered crying or upset over what the protesters have been saying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cqbly?context=5)|Not since I have worked here. Our clinic was bombed about 20 years ago, it was on a weekend though so no one was hurt. But there were 3 years after that that there was no clinic because they had to come up with the money to rebuild. 
[Odd - did they not have insurance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cwnjk?context=5)|Oh I never really thought of that. From what I know, they were renting space for the clinic before, but after that they had to build their own because no one would rent to them.
[Do you ever feel like you are doing something wrong? Not necessarily the actual abortion, but like if it isn't right for that person to get one in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmph4?context=5)|I have actually sent women home if I don't think they can handle an abortion. My clinic can do procedures up to 16 weeks gestation, most women find out they are pregnant at about 8 weeks. So if I feel like someone is indecisive about it, I'll tell them to go home and think about it more. The counseling session is there so that we can be sure women are confident in their decision. And most women have already thought about it a lot before even coming into the clinic. Only twice have I had to repeatedly go back and forth with a patient about whether or not they want it, which sucks because it's not my choice, but sometimes they just need someone to tell them it's okay.
[How often have you done an abortion at 16 weeks?is that more disturbing... Yikes :(     ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cspu8?context=5)|Never. The oldest gestational age I've worked with is 13 weeks.
[Do you find it hard not to be judgmental? Ever had a patient who you thought was being selfish or doing the wrong thing by aborting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpmz5?context=5)|Sometimes yes. My job is to be non judgmental though, so it's just a matter of turning off that voice. We have a good system at the clinic I'm at though, we can talk to each other if we've had a hard day and we can trade patient's if we are uncomfortable with the person we get or find it hard not to judge them.  I don't think I've ever felt anyone was being particularly selfish, I just think some women should be more responsible and just get some birth control. 
[Do the fathers ever attend the procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmpxl?context=5)|Yes, quite often actually. Sometimes they react more severely to medical terms and procedures though, more men pass out watching a procedure than any patients I've had. Another counselor had a boyfriend pass out when she was explaining the procedure, they weren't even in the abortion room yet!
[In Germany some abortions (e.g. the child will be disabled\) are still legal in the 8th month. What is your opinion on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmwux?context=5)|Well an abortion that far along would be a huuuuge process. Like they would be in a hospital overnight kind of thing. And you can test for down syndrome when the fetus is pretty young, so the need for an 8 month abortion seems minimal. But it still comes down to choice I guess. I don't think I could abort a baby for the sole reason of birth defects, but everyone's different.
[Has this experience changed your attitude toward sex education? If you had one minute in front of a class of high school students, what is the most important message you would give them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cyuqy?context=5)|Use birth control!! I think people should learn more about birth control at a younger age, so in high school. And this job makes talking about sex and vaginas so easy, I need to turn that off sometimes because not everyone is comfortable with talking about sex.
[I was taught about birth control in middle school/junior high. They were stressing the importance of the pill/condoms/other forms of contraceptives to students around 11-13.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d7385?context=5)|Good for you! I don't think I knew all about the forms of birth control until college.
[Why did you chose to be an abortion counselor?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cn17r?context=5)|I wanted to get into women's health and I did my nonprofit admin internship at an abortion clinic. They were hiring for counselors when I finished and I've always wanted to get into women's health. 
[How exactly do they perform the procedure these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmoqr?context=5)|Whew. Well there are two methods. The surgical is the kind I usually work with. For that it starts out like a pap, the duck lips and everything. First the cervix is numbed, we use a medication similar to what a dentist would use. To dilate the cervix, we use dilation rods, which are these blunt tipped stick things. We dilate it according to how far along they are, so for 8 weeks gestation it's 8 millimeters. After it's dilated, the doctor uses a flexible straw thing connected to a little vacuum or suction device. After that it's basically just cleaning up. The doctor checks the contents to confirm that they are not pregnant anymore.
 |The option is a medical abortion, only available when it is 8 weeks or under in gestation. That's when the doctor will prescribe two medications and when they are taken they basically induce a miscarriage. Women get to be at home for this one, and it's a lot cheaper, but it can be pretty painful for up to three days.
[What's your educational background / how'd you get the job? I'm curious about this kind of thing but have no idea how I'd get into it.  Also, thanks for all that you do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cuoqt?context=5)|My job title is technically an abortion peer counselor, so not something you need a degree for. I got into it by doing nonprofit admin, with intentions of getting into women's health. But actually nursing is a great way to get into it, some nurses will help when we are understaffed for counselors, they do the ultrasounds and see patients for aftercare. 
[Have you ever had an abortion? If so does this help you relate to your patients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cserh?context=5)|No, but it's a question a lot of women ask me in counseling sessions. I think they could potentially relate to me more if I had though. But working in an abortion clinic just makes me extra paranoid about pregnancies so I am pretty tedious when it comes to my own birth control.
[Where are you generally?  Being an abortion counsellor working in the Vatican or in the southern US would probably be a pretty different experience than working in Canada or whatever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmpv3?context=5)|I'm in the US, not the South. My city is pretty liberal, but the surrounding state is very rural and conservative-- we get our fair share of protesters.
[Can a parent make their child under 18 have an abortion?? Even if the daughter wants to keep the baby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dp5sv?context=5)|Nope. No matter the age, the ultimate decision is with the pregnant woman.
[Have you ever counseled rape victims?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5ctivw?context=5)|Maybe? It's not really something most women want to elaborate about. I've suspected it, but it's not necessary for them for tell me that on order to get an abortion.
[What do you say to people you meet who are completely against abortion, and they ask you your occupation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5co3jc?context=5)|I actually just don't tell them about it. I have family members that don't even know (I live far away from them, so they just think I am a medical assistant). It's a part time job though, and I've been on a constant search for a good second job, my resume just says I'm a medical assistant because I don't want that to affect whether or not I'll be hired somewhere else.
[What would you say is the average age of the women who come into the clinic?  Do more women come in by themselves or with a significant other/family member/friend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5criey?context=5)|The age range I've worked with has been between 16 and 37. Average would probably be mid to late twenties. Most women do come in wih some kind of support group, I've seen entire families come in. They usually come in with their mothers, no matter the age. 
[What tends to be the demographic of women who come to your clinic? Age? Race? Economic background? I have no preconceptions (that's why I'm asking\) but I know what most people think and I wonder how accurate it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d0vo5?context=5)|Mostly white, age range from 16 to 37, but average age is probably mid to late 20's. We have to keep stats of everyone, including their level of education, mostly college grads or someone who's taken some college level classes. Economically...we don't really ask what their occupation is.
[Do you turn people away? If so how often does it happen?  You said the sessions are to make sure they are not being forced. How often do you suspect this is happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czb9j?context=5)|Only twice have I felt iffy about patients. But never have I felt like they were being forced, they were just super undecided and unsure about what they wanted to do. They had time, since we go up to 16 weeks and most women realize they are pregnant at 8 weeks, so they just went home to think more to decide what they want. They ended up coming back wayore confident.
[Do you even discuss adoption as a potential option ?.  I am trying to adopt and it seems like I will be forced to go overseas which seems a shame when pregnancy terminations occur in this country daily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cnkw1?context=5)|When most women make the appointment, they have pretty much already made up their minds. Our counseling sessions are based around them just telling us their thought process on how they made their decision, which is usually them explaining why they don't want to do parenting and adoption. For people that ask though, we have a few local resources to find someone to parent their children.
[A second question, where do you stand on abortion as a choice in gender selection ?.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cnkw1?context=5)|On gender...no way. But you can't tell the gender before 16 (I think) and so our clinic doesn't even have the potential to do that. I don't think that has ever been an issue in the US, I believe it is in other parts of the world though. But no, I definitely don't stand for that.
[What percentage of people that you counsel decide not to get an abortion? Any last minute run-outs that you never see again?  Do you get a lot of ""I think abortion is absolutely wrong! But in my (daughter's\) case.....""?  Do you do the counseling individually, or are they allowed to have a SO or family member with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d62fk?context=5)|Counseling is individual, no one else can come to make sure they aren't being forced. So many pro lifers get abortions. We have a separate consent form for them pointing out that the abortion is against their morals but they still want it. It's the belief that abortions are not okay, but my case is different. And yes, every reason for getting an abortion is different, but that doesn't mean you are the only one that gets a choice. 
[Hi - what is your job position? are you a medical assistant?  This sounds like a field that i'd like to get into - i am already a medical assistant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmsny?context=5)|I am an abortion peer counselor. I think all abortion clinics are required to have counseling sessions before a procedure.
[Was it posted by the IAmA poster?  If it was deleted then it probably was not posted by the same person, based on their ""scoring system"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cone0?context=5)|No it wasn't posted by me. I was a little confused by the original comment though, I'm a little new to reddit.
[What's the most common reason women give for wanting an abortion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czfdj?context=5)|Because they got pregnant accidentally and they don't want to have a baby or can't afford it. Think of the average age here: mid to late twenties, I have plenty of friends that age, I am in that age range, I sure as hell don't have enough money to afford a baby.
[My ex-girlfriend once told me that it is her body so she can decide what she wants. She wasn't pregnant but I still thought the man should have some say in the matter too. Have you also counseled the men in the relationships? If so, what are their usual stands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cygy0?context=5)|Most men are supportive of he decision, but they are not allowed in the initial counseling session, to make sure that they are not forcing the procedure. It sucks, and I agree that's it's a sticky issue, but if men were always allowed to make part of the decision we wouldn't be able to stop any abusive situations.
[What's your gender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmkvx?context=5)|Female.

[Do you ever have couples that come in, where the woman wants the abortion but the man doesn't? If so, how do you deal with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d1h4r?context=5)|No, in that case the man probably just wouldn't come. The only time something like that happened was a woman in a very abusive relationship, her significant other was recently put in jail for nearly killing her. He didn't want her to abort, she told him she was doing it anyway, last I heard he was still in jail.
[Have you ever been confronted by a potential (no longer potential\) father after the abortion, when he was unaware it was happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d01au?context=5)|No, I've actually never had a significant other unaware, at least from what my patients have said. Most people talk to heir partners.
[Are you required to encourage communication if the scenario does arise? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5demqv?context=5)|No, because it is ultimately the woman's choice and I would have no way of knowing how sensitive the situation is and/or if it is abusive. No one likes to be undermined, we just talk about they, the women, feel in this situation.
[Why are abortions so damn expensive?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cv6kb?context=5)|Places like planned parenthood are not allowed to use state money for abortions, so that's why they aren't cheaper there. But it comes to paying he doctor, sanitization, etc. Some insurance covers it and some clinics have funds put away to help women that can't afford it.
[In my state, minors are required to obtain parental consent. Interestingly enough, one of the staff members on my high school newspaper knew a girl who managed to get an abortion without telling her parents. At the time, we were thinking about doing stories about minors who had gotten pregnant, but in the end, we decided not to run with the idea. Anyhow, this girl had an abortion in the basement of a doctor's house, which is supposedly run as some sort of secret abortion clinic. I'm not sure how well-equipped/staffed it is, but what is your opinion about such clinics in states that require minors to obtain parental consent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cvljx?context=5)|Parental consent can be very wrong. I understand it, but the girls hat choose not to tell their parents do so for a reason. Honestly most girls come in with their moms or their parents help them afford it. We had a study at our clinic (don't know how they did it honestly) that in our state if parental notification were to pass this year (it's on the ballot) it would put ten girls a year in an abusive situation. That's not a ton considering the whole state, but those ten lives are changed forever.
[Do you support the idea of getting ab abortion because the child will have special needs? Where is ""the line"" between a special needs child that should be aborted and one that should not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d3dc9?context=5)|Well at the gestational age I work with, it's not really possible to know that yet, so I don't directly work with that kind of situation. I don't think it's something I would personally stand for, but who am I to decide that for someone else. If someone already had three kids with down syndrome and found out their forth pregnancy had it too, I don't think I would stop them. Every situation is different.
[What about partial birth abortions? Are those readily performed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czxal?context=5)|Not at my clinic, we go up to 16 week gestation. I think in San Fran they do partial birth? Not sure though. But those cases are generally more abuse related pregnancies or homelessness. 
[To use framing cooked up by a National Right to Life Committee lobbyist is to agree with the National Right to Life Committee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5delje?context=5)|Yes. I am not sure how that relates to what I said...?
[HOW you said it reinforces the anti-abortion framing of abortion as killing babies.  If you don't think early third-trimester abortions are killing babies, then make your framing consistent with your sentiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5egtvu?context=5)|I really don't know what you're talking about. When did I agree with the National Right to Life Committee and when did my sentiments not make sense?
[In the debate about abortion, one of the common points made is that it would be wrong to deny abortion to victims of rape or incest.  In your experience, how often are your patients victims of those crimes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d3cj0?context=5)|They don't usually elaborate it. I've suspected it a few times, but it's not something people usually want to talk about.
[Probably too late with this, but if the woman is expressing any level of doubt about going through with the abortion, do you advise against it? Thanks for your work and doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cyuti?context=5)|Yes. We tell them to go home and think on it more, since they usually have time before our cut off.
[How many patients do you see daily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cxfzl?context=5)|The clinic does abortions once a week, we'll have between 5 and 8 patients on that day, I'll work with 3 to 4.
[Have you had any patients who have had some horrific experiences from PTSD or other mental horrors after the surgery? I know the doctors use anesthetics with medicines to knock you out and sometimes forget it, but it's never something you forget. Most councilors don't keep I'm contact with the patients after they leave the clinic from what I've seen, but after, if you have, have any of their post surgery stories stuck out to you? And if so, what happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dusbr?context=5)|I don't work with patients after, but the nurses do follow up exams and would hear from them weeks after the procedure, I've never heard anything bad from that. I have had PTSD patients, they are hard to work with, and usually get our anti anxiety meds, which is basically like half ""being under"", their memories would be fuzzy, but they are conscience during the procedure.
[How do you feel about Virginia's new law of mandatory external imaging being a requirement prior to abortions?  Personally, I think its ridiculous ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d8unh?context=5)|Does that mean mandatory ultrasounds? Or mandatory viewing of the ultrasound? Anytime you do an abortion, you have to do an ultrasound to accurately date the pregnancy. And it is hard to get a clear image from the abdomin when the pregnancy isn't very far along, so we always do vaginal ultrasounds. But when patients fill out paperwork, we have the ultrasound consent form, where they can check off whether or not they want to see the image. So ultrasounds are necessary, but women viewing them is not needed and just a tactic into guilting people.

wg1zy,6,2012-07-12,CS Majors: Have a few questions about internships,johnnyvrotten,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/wg1zy/cs_majors_have_a_few_questions_about_internships/,"Hello everyone: hoping some people currently in or have graduated in CS who've had internships to answer a few questions of mine. I'm currently a sophomore in CS who's planning on applying for a summer internship this fall. I'm currently working on a resume and getting on LinkedIn and have been asking around for advice. I mainly use Windows and have experience working in Linux from classes. I know Java and PHP well, worked with MySQL quite a bit, am familiar with C from 240 and learned Python in the past and could probably pick it up quickly again. I don't have much work experience except I am involved in EPICS and attended an engineering camp in the past. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with CS but am interested in web development or some career in software engineering.

1. How do you go about applying for one? Should I just attend as many job fairs as possible and hand out my resume, and wait for a call? Which job fairs?
2. Any particular companies I should look at? Should I do my research about them before attending a job fair or the interview? I hear that's a popular question.
3. What were the interviews like? What questions did you have (programming/non-programming related)? I know in a resources seminar some recruiter from Microsoft recommended books for us but I didn't know if the practice problems/tips would suit other companies.
4. How much are you expected to know/what tech skills did your company look for? For most of the skills you needed for your job, did you learn them at the company or at Purdue?
5. What was your job like each day? What did you do? Who did you work with?

Thanks a million! Kind of excited to begin the search for a CS job."

She started the procedure on me and was actually very gentle so it didn’t hurt at all, it was actually one of the most gentle check-ups I’ve ever had. Ofcourse at one point she started to clean up a little bit of tartar I had at the back of my teeth. While she was cleaning my teeth and ofcourse its an annoying feeling and sometimes I tiny bit painfull and I for some reason thought it was a good idea to all of a sudden yell out “AARGGH FUCK!” and give a very painfull expression on my face.

She instantly pulls out and starts apologising instantly “Oh I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you sorry sorry sorry” ofcourse immediately my dentist who was observing comes to check up what happened, at this point is by the way felt kinda guilty for pulling the joke on her’ and I just turned to face her with a sheepish grin on my face “I’m sorry I did that I couldn’t resist, to be fair you are alot gentler then my dentist is’ so my dentist couldn’t help but slightly laugh while she stood there with the tool still in hand not really knowing how to respond, I just laid back and let her continue the procedure.

After 2 minutes or so she was done cleaning and I washed my mount with some water and made sure to thank her and told her she did a really good job and I was sure she would become a great dentist.
Luckily at this point she was able to laugh and told me “Yea but I am never gonna treat you again” I smiled and replied that I would love to get threated by her and walked out.

I must say that girl actually made going to the dentist fun.

The only field I have any specific interest in is AI, and that's pretty broad.

Do I even have a chance at getting a decent job?",TailoredChaos,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wf6mk/im_a_senior_ee_and_i_have_an_extremely_low_gpa/,"Reddit, 

I have a horribly low GPA (2.13).  I have struggled through all of my classes and had to retake a good deal of them.  

I've also worked 25+ hours/week throughout my entire college career. By the time I graduate (May 2013) I will have worked at a HVAC engineering company for two years as a Line Engineer and Electrical Engineer in training (I have been trained, but not yet promoted but they are hinting at a promotion soon).  I got the job as a summer internship, but since it is located in the same town as my univeristy I managed to make myself indespensible and they allowed me to work there on night shift while i finish my degree.  I currently work directly under the vice president of the company and have a good working relationship with him.

I don't want to stay at the company I'm at because they have a complete lack of fucks to give to any and all of their employees. Because a large portion of their manufacturing employees are unskilled workers or worse (many are ex-convicts) they treat everyone like drugged up teenagers who have to be babysat non-stop.  I see huge issues in their business practices and engineering practices, but I've also seen people point out those issues and find themselves fired. 

I come from a family who has no technically capable people in it other than me and my younger brother and from a high school that barely taught the basics, so I found that many of the things that came naturally to my classmates were a struggle to me. Combine that with a complete lack of time due to having to work so much just to stay in school and I have my shitty GPA.  Every job I have ever been at I have been bored out of my skull (including my current job as a line engineer) due to lack of challenging things to work on.  I have always excelled at work and try very hard to be the best at my job (whether it was carhopping at sonic or designing a wire mapping system for large HVAC systems).  I was taught that the way to ensure that you are never fired is to make yourself indespensible.  

I'm overwhelmingly afraid that companies will look at my GPA and pass me over for jobs that I would be awesome at!

Our university is rather small, so there won't be as many companies there that I'd like, but I have a game plan for the career fair coming in October:
1. Have my resume primed and ready. Know it inside and out. It will be unique, but readable.  I will have it printed on a nifty folder and hand it out as swag for the recruiters to use to hold all of the resumes they collect for the day.  On the outside will a diagram outlining why I would be a good employee. On the inside will be lists of my skills and job experiences.
2.  Apply ahead of time for every electrical or software related job I can find on the job sites for all engineering companies on the list for the career fair.
3. Create and have on hand a portfolio of past work and experiences to show at the career fair if necessary (I'd like to save it for the interview, but hell if I have to whip it out at the fair I'll do it to get an interview).  
4.  Firm Handshake (I've been complimented for mine).
5.  Have questions ready ahead of time for each and every company that might be interested in me. I will overlook no company and, if possible, will know what each company's future goals are. (Many companies post press releases with such information).  
If I am not offered an interview by the time the career fair recruiter is wrapping up our conversation I will ask outright.  

Do I even have a chance at a decent job with my GPA, though, or should I be lucky that I got the job I have?

EDIT: Thanks so much for the responses! I have never actually gotten this many people to respond to anything on reddit before.  Its really encouraging that I still have a shot. Without trying to be egotistical, I can say that I know that I am a very good employee and all of my project experience points to me also being a good engineer. I have been project leader before and on the work-front I am currently in charge of engineering issues for two production lines (with the ability to cover all of the other lines if necessary). "

I focused on Windows machines but have experience with OSX as well. Our team was outsourced to a company and we were changed to helpdesk. Even towards the end of our teams lifespan, I was getting to where I didn't see anything new. I am struggling to break into the network/security field. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Studies and I am looking for an entry level job into network, security or systems administration. I've worked with networks before including having a short internship that allowed me to interact with the OU and other parts of Active Directory. 

I am determined, catch on firmly to concepts and would leap at the chance to be a shadow/understudy as long as I could still make ends meet regarding pay. I work well with teams or on my own and do flourish if given a project that requires some thought on my part. My problem solving skills are excellent and I have been told that my solutions are often creative. I've also been doing various jobs since I was 12 and thus have a good work ethic that only improves as I know what needs done. My communication skills are generally excellent and I have the ability to be both direct and tactful. 

I am more than willing to relocate for this and would welcome the chance to get out of the midwest, but I am currently in Oklahoma. If I am to stay in the area I am hoping to earn about 40k. Leaving the area would influence that and have to take cost of living into account.

I will gladly furnish my resume on request as I would rather not put it on here with all my personal info readily obtainable.

---------

As you know I am (was) in training to be a Coroner. My education was almost complete and I had been working a paid internship with a well-known medical examiner in the Washington D.C. area.  All that changed a few hours ago when I was fired from the office for refusing to participate in, what I believe to be, a cover up. Even though they ‘warned me’ about ‘consequences’ for leaking any information about this case, my conscience wouldn’t be clear if I kept quiet. This is something people need to know.

A few days ago we received a call from the Metro police about a possible body discovered on the redline. Since working here we’ve responded to a few calls in the subway system. The first time it was a woman who tripped over someone’s rolling suitcase while trying to pass by on the escalators. She ended up with a broken neck. Twice we went out there for a heart attack. Once for a late night mugging that went bad. The poor guy was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach even though he handed over his watch and wallet like the mugger requested. So far I haven’t seen anything especially gory and it was a bit of a let down when the dispatch officer said the man was found just sitting on the train. (Is it wrong that I’ve been looking forward to a call about someone either jumping or being pushed in front of a train?) The interesting thing is the wording of the dispatch request. “Possible body.” If the word ‘possible’ is in front of body, maybe it’s the paramedics that should be responding and not the coroner’s office.

When we arrived, the paramedics actually were on the scene so we figured it was just a miscommunication and we were called out prematurely. Police tape blocked off the whole entire station platform. From our view at the top of the escalators we could tell something wasn’t right. The paramedics stood outside the door to the train car and they weren’t actually doing anything except arguing and pointing at a body slumped up against a window inside. We could have left, but since it was a slow evening we decided to take a look anyway just to see what was going on.

As we approached I overheard some of the conversation between the two paramedics. “He’s dead, right?” said the older of the two. “Dead people don’t do…that.” Do what? I thought. Once they saw us, they quickly agreed that the man was dead and promptly left the scene to us. Clearly this wasn’t a call they wanted to handle, I can understand that.

The police weren’t much help either. I chatted with the officers on the scene while the doc went in to take a look at the man on the train. One of the detectives commented that there weren’t any clear signs of foul play. The witnesses all claimed the guy just sat down like everyone else and then he stopped breathing. Natural causes, I thought, seemed like a pretty cut and dry case, but when I looked over my shoulder at the Doc, he seemed… confused.

“Look at this.” He said to me as I walked into the train. As I approached, it seemed like the man was just napping like a lot of the train riders do when they know their stop won’t be coming up for awhile.
“Look at what?” I asked.

“His eyes.”

The man’s head was forward with his chin to his chest so that I had to kneel down to get a good look at his face. As I’m doing this, the doc is talking out loud like he tends to do, just going over his mental checklist. “Not breathing. No pulse. His skin is cold to the touch. Approximate time of death 6 to 8 hours ago.”

I’m in the isle of train trying to make due with a pin flashlight since the dim lighting on the train wasn’t helping things much. The man’s eyes were open and they seemed to be staring at me. It’s not uncommon, so I lean in closer hoping to figure out what it is the doc wanted me to see so that I don’t look like an idiot and then… he blinked.

I jump back as quick as a mongoose would jump away from a cobra.

“What the fu…” I tried to say.

“Exactly.” The doc said.

“Got’ta be just a muscle spasm, right?”

“You would think,” he says, “but watch this.” He grabs the guy by the hair and pulls his head back. With his other hand he waves a finger in front of the man’s open eyes, which then began to follow along as the doc moves his finger left and right. Then the man looked at me and blinked again.

“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” I ask.

“Nope.”

“And he’s dead?”

“As a doornail.”

We let the officer in charge know that we couldn’t determine the cause of death on site. A full autopsy would need to be preformed to make any kind of determination. She made a note in the report that this body had a tendency to follow you with its eyes and occasionally blink. Off the record she told me the whole case bothered her. The man, she said, didn’t have any identification, credit cards, watch, jewelry, a phone, or even money. All they found on him was a train ticket and a napkin.

Once we had him back at the office we changed into our examination coveralls.  I was asked to deal with his clothing. The man watched me the whole time as I stripped off his business suit. He even winked at me once. Also a few odd things were noted about the clothing. First, he wasn’t wearing any under garments. Normally people wear a tee shirt, boxers or briefs, and socks. This guy wore none of those things but for some reason he had on two belts, one over the other. 

The doc switched on his tape recorder and then turned on the buzz saw. I watched as he preformed the Y-incision, and I made a mental note of his perfect technique so that I could try and do it better next time. I’m telling you the doc is a real artist.  Next came the enjoyable cracking sound as the ribcage was pried open. All while this was happening the man’s eyes watched us. I could almost swear he was smiling too.

Over the next hour the doc made notes as he did the exam. He handed me each organ to be weighed and cataloged. There was nothing strange or out of the ordinary about any of the internal organs. 

“Okay.” The doc said, “Lets take a look inside his head. I want to see what’s causing the eye movement.”

“Listen, do you mind if we tape the eyes shut first?” 

I’m trying to remain as professional as I can but the constant blinking is unnerving me. The doc didn’t mind so I took some suture tape and worked up the courage to manually close the guy’s eyelids and taped them down. Immediately they started moving fast. His whole face was convulsing and contorting itself, trying to break free of the tape.

“I don’t think he like’s that.” The doc said and then he removed the tape from the man’s eyes. The violent motions stopped right away and he winked at the doc.

“This isn’t natural.” I said.

“There’s a scientific reason for everything. It’s our job to find it.” The doc replied.

“But he actually fought to get the tape off his eyes.”

“I guess he wants to watch. Now do you want to remove the skull, or should I?”

I’m too shaken to handle the equipment so I watch as the doc works the saw around the man’s skull. The bastard is smiling. I’m sure of it. He’s staring at me and blinking his left eye then his right eye back in forth. I hear the familiar popping sound caused by the top of a skull being pulled off.

“Whoa. Okay….” The doctor says.

“What is it?” I ask as I’m walking around to see what he’s seeing. The man’s eyes follow me of course.

“I think I might have to call this one in.” 

Dear god. 

The brain was missing. 

“Doc?” I ask

“Not now. Pack up and go home. I’ll finish cleaning this up.” He’s saying this as he’s already dialing a number on the phone.

“But…”

“Just go. I’ll call you later.” It isn’t a request. I know when to shut up and listen. I make my way to the door knowing that the man is still staring at me. “And don’t say anything to anyone.”

The Doc never called me back. Each time I tried to reach him it went to voicemail. I tried to go back the next day security wouldn’t let me in the building. They said I was to await further instructions while on paid leave. That was four days ago.

This morning I hear a knock at my door. It’s a man who said he was with the medical examiners officer but he looks as if he’s with the CIA, FBI, NSA, or some other 3-letter agency. He asks if he can come in to talk. I open the door to let him in and as I do I notice two other similarly dressed men sitting in a black suburban across the street.

The folder he hands me is a case file for the John Doe that was found on the train. All of the notes about the eye movement and the blinking were removed. There was no mention of anything out of the ordinary, let alone a missing brain. It’s already got the Doc’s signature on it and this man is asking for me to sign it as well.

I try to tell him the files wrong but he holds up a hand to stop me from speaking. “This is how it happened. Sign it.” He said. I ask about the doc. I want to know why I haven’t heard from him. He says the doc has been ‘let go.’ The way he says it makes me think the worst. I refuse to sign it and ask to speak to the director of the medical examiners office. The man informs me that would be impossible and that I am to be fired. But fired isn’t the word he used. The word he used was ‘terminated’. 

He leaves when I ask him to go but he warns me that mentioning this to anyone would have serious consequences. As soon as the door closed behind him I packed a bag and took off. I saw that a black suburban was parked at the end of my street and I might just be paranoid but I think it pulled out after I did. Just in case I was being followed I changed direction several times. When I felt safe enough I pulled into a nearby residential neighborhood and found an open WIFI signal. 

I think something strange is going on in D.C. maybe elsewhere as well. I don’t know what it could be but I feel like the doc and I stumbled onto something we weren’t supposed to know about and now we’re in danger. I found the doc’s home number online. When I called it went straight to voicemail. I tried to leave a message for him but the line went dead once I began talking. If someone is monitoring my phone calls it’s possible my car is bugged too and they already know exactly where I am. 

Again, maybe I’m just paranoid (or crazy). Maybe there is a completely logical explanation for the scarecrow corpse that stares and blinks and winks and smiles. I can't imagine how anything like that could exist or why. I’m scared, really, really scared. I decided the only thing to do would be to write this and email it out to everyone I know. Hopefully this information will make it to someone…

If you’ve received this and haven’t heard back from me by tomorrow then I’m probably dead and you’ll know what I’ve written is true."

During my internship, I was encouraged by my supervisor to apply for a full-time position in the company that had very similar responsibilities to those I would have later on as an intern. I had a few ""interviews"" with my supervisor and have continued to work my ass off as an intern to show how dedicated and motivated I am.

Recently, my supervisor told me that I am one of the final candidates for this position and he/she has asked me to disclose my ""salary proposal"" to make sure ""we are on the same page."" He/she made very clear that even after this discussion, it may be a few more weeks before a final decision is made regarding the full-time position.

How do I go about having this conversation? I have a meeting set up this week with someone even higher-up than my supervisor so we can discuss the position in more detail and my ideal salary.

All the advice I see online is to never be the first person to put out a number. Wait for the other person to put out a number first. Part of the reason for this is that you could ""out-price"" yourself if you say something too high but could this really be a problem if they already know how hard I work and how good of a fit I could be for this position?

I have other thoughts but I think I've written enough here already."

Has anyone been in this situation before? Does anyone have any suggestions?

I have been networking recently to try and get some work experience of any kind. I know its late but I got a final rejection rather late and so I am a bit unprepared.

I have also thought of teaching myself a completely new skill like programming.

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the responses, it's a lot more than I expected from such a small subreddit.

I think I will also look into doing some charity work as others have suggested and learn programming in my other spare time. I am also still looking at getting some time doing work experience for free in an engineering company if I can.

I'm an EE major, and I haven't really done anything outside of class. My immediate goals are to put together an Arduino project of medium difficulty, an Android application, and looking to get my HAM license. Other than that, I haven't really done jack for the past year, something I now regret.

My major GPA is around 3.0 or 73%.

My aim is to get an internship for September. That or the coming January; just need something before I graduate next Summer.

I am not sure if I should take a shotgun approach and apply for all kinds of jobs, including the software ones. I am trying to do a quick brush up on all the CS side of things, but theres also a lot of material to cover if I want broad EE knowledge.

Not too keen on what kind of internship I get, as this will be my first one and a foot in the door for me.

I applied to as many scholarships as possible throughout my college life and its worked out so far. I just got a good internship at a fortune 500 company trying to save every dollar I have so I can go to London my last semester and do an internship to expand my skillset and explore my birthplace. This has been everything I've been working for over the last 18 months. I put in extra hours at work (2 hour commute) at a shitty jimmy buffet restaurant while going to school full time. I didn't mind. Whenever I was on the train back home at midnight I just thought about the pay off.... All the sacrifices I was making would be worth it in the fall.... why I was doing all this. 

Then today I got some soul-crunching news. My parents were in a jam and had to pay off some debt collectors this week or they were going to be evicted. I don't have much money, but I gave it to them. Even though they weren't the most financially savvy parents in the world they tried as hard as they fucking could to provide me and my brother with a happy childhood. What was I supposed to do?

But now I sit here just crushed..... 18 months of work, blood, and sweat gone. Going to london in the fall was the only thing keeping me going in some of my darker moments. The thought of escaping from all of my BS was a real motivator for me.... Now thats its gone I don't know what to do. I've given my parents everything (~$8k). Now I can't go to London, and have to figure out online classes while I work full time in a minimum wage job.

I intern at a hospital's IT Department, and we basically run off an ""RFS Ticket System"" where nurses around the hospital send in a ticket if they're having issues with their computer/software, whatever the case may be. 

Now in this program, the nurses can specify how urgent the issue is. So I got this ticket which was specified as a ""Priority Level 1 - Severely Urgent"" which means we have to resolve the issue within one hour upon reading.

I opened up the ticket, and read the description....sure enough palms were met with the forehead...

The ticket stated ""Mouse unplugged, need assistance in reconnecting mouse."" Completely dumbfounded, I gave the nurse, who sent in the ticket, a call. 

Me: ""Hi, I recently received your ticket about a mouse issue? Could you give me more information about it?""

Nurse: ""Yeah I dunno it just won't work, someone said that it might have been unplugged but could you please come down and take a look at it?""

Me: ""Ma'am could you please turn the mouse over and tell me if so you see a red light on the bottom of the mouse""

Nurse: ""Yeah, there's no red light""

Me: ""Okay, could you go to the back of your computer and tell me if you see an unplugged USB cable""

Nurse: ""I don't see anything, just a thick black cable and a blue cable going into the computer""

**At this point I'm pulling a ""Jean-Luc Picard"" facepalm as I've spent 5 1/2 minutes trying to get this lady to plug in a mouse**

Me: ""No Ma'am that's the monitor, can you look behind the...big black box...next to the monitor""

Nurse: ""Oh yes, I see it""

Me: ""Ok, now plug it in to the USB port in the back of the computer""

**I can obviously hear she's struggling, and she says it won't fit**

Nurse: ""I'm trying, but it just won't go in to the hole"" 
(Sincerely,
- She)

Me: ""Alright I'll be right over so we can get this issue resolved""

**After about 10 minutes, walking over and waiting for the elevator to get to the 10th floor, I ask her to show me where she was plugging the USB cable in, and low-and-behold she was attempting to put it into the HDMI port**

I showed her where the USB ports were, and plugged it in for her. 

Nurse: ""Now the monitor won't turn on""

Me: ""Push the power button on the monitor""

**She reaches for the power button on the computer**

wm2k9,2,2012-07-15,"I'm a college student living at home. My grandmother had a stroke recently, and a few hours ago, a large portion of her care was made my responsibility. I have no idea how to handle this. What do I do?",amaira,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wm2k9/im_a_college_student_living_at_home_my/,"I've known that my grandma wasn't feeling very well for the past week, but had no idea of the details of it. She had been staying with extended family a few towns away, which I thought was because the a/c at her house is broken, and today my parents had planned to bring her over to our house for the day.

This morning, the extended family called my mom and told her that they were just overwhelmed with caring for my grandma and needed my family to take a primary role in it. When my mom brought my grandma over, I discovered that she can barely walk (needs a walker, will fall over if not wearing shoes), can't stand up from a sitting position, etc. It's pretty severe.

So, when my grandma was napping this afternoon, my mom and I sat down to make a schedule of who could take care of her at what times. I've just started the summer quarter of classes, and nearly ANY time that I'm not in class, I'll have to be home to care for my grandma. Responsibilities will include helping her move from point A to point B, lifting her up when she needs to stand, cooking her meals, making sure she takes her medicine, helping her use the bathroom, and possibly driving her to and from doctor's appointments and extended family's house. I'll have to start caring for my grandma tomorrow morning, and I won't have anyone around to help me.

I'm a senior in college and taking 16 hours of very project-intense major classes, and my available homework time has pretty much vanished during arguably the most important period in my schooling. I'm supposed to be looking for internships now, but I won't have the time or portfolio to do so.

Between seeing my grandma in such terrible shape, and having my life essentially turned on its side to care for her, I'm having a hard time trying not to just break down sobbing.

My mom is gone from the house about 12 hours a day for work. My dad is the supervisor of his office and they're short several employees, so he can't take much time off of work to help.

Extended family runs their own business and can work from home. Their kids are home for the summer since they're still in high school or middle school (can't remember).

My grandma can't climb stairs, and our only showers/bathtubs are on the second floor. We have no spare bedroom, so she'll probably be sleeping either on a couch or a mattress we put in the living room.

I love my grandma, but as a person, I am not equipped to be a caregiver at all. I'm pretty well convinced that she would do far better in an assisted living home staffed with medical professionals than she would do in my family's home staffed by me.

How do I even go about bringing up this conversation with my family? I don't want to be such a major caregiver but I feel like I have no choice. I can't force my extended family back into taking care of my grandma, but the other option is that I sacrifice the time I'd planned to spend building my future.

TL;DR: I just found out that my grandma had a stroke and I have to spend large portions of each day (basically, when I'm not in class) caring for her, to the extent that it will negatively impact my classwork, and I start being a caregiver tomorrow morning. Our house is not set up to be accessible to her, and I don't want this responsibility. How do I negotiate this with the immediate and extended family?

UPDATE: I talked to my dad and he agrees with me, since he would be doing the other major chunk of caretaking and does not feel even close to comfortable with it. It looks like he's going to lead the charge of finding a better situation for my grandma, so any advice on what to look for in assisted living or something similar would be very appreciated!

UPDATE 2: My grandma does not want to stay with us tonight, and probably not any night, because we don't have a bed for her. Looks like the parents will be sorting out what to do and hopefully it'll work out for the best."

wlkt6,11,2012-07-15,It has to be tomorrow. This is my final farewell.,throwaway261985,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wlkt6/it_has_to_be_tomorrow_this_is_my_final_farewell/,"I posted nearly 2 weeks back fixing the day I was going to end it. But I somehow could not get around to it. Feeling scared, lonely and also unsure of how to say the goodbyes. But I have been pushing myself in a deeper corner where the joy and the sunshine of life seem distant and almost dream-like. I thought getting few extra days would help me finish arranging my affairs, but now I can see that it has not. Things are as bad as ever. They might have even gotten worse since I now have exactly 5 euros on me, enough to get to where I need to go. But it also makes me sad. Not only the thought of never hugging my parents again but also the idea of never sharing secrets with my brother, never seeing my friends and never again wondering at the absurdity of life.

It was a short life. And a life that I wish I had lived with more gumption. I was scared of many things and in the quest to appear braver, smarter and tougher, I pushed myself away from the simpler joys in life. And that I will regret. I will also regret not taking risks like my brother and not having his tenacity to truly believe in his ideas and follow them through. I regret not being more compassionate like my parents who put my and my brother's wishes above everything and taught us to think for ourselves. I regret not living in the present due to the stress of the future. 

But I am also thankful for many things. I feel like I have lived through a plethora of emotions, places and ideas. I am thankful for the love of books, cinema and the arts. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful to the many friends I made in my life. I am thankful for the kind of person I turned out to be. 

But I am sorry too. Unlike others here, I do not have a moment in my childhood that I or others could point out and identify as the moment that scarred my mental health. I just have a sense of despair. I felt trapped by history and the political struggle of my people. I felt the brunt of being in exile. When your identity derives first from your political history, you are caught in the churning of history. It is a fate that you cannot escape; yet, I never thought that I would be here today. This sadness is not people-induced. It is not a sadness that stems from others behavior towards me, but rather from a self-realisation of failure. I will never be able to match the high standards and the harsh self criticism that I inflect upon myself. 

So, in all, I have had a good life. I feel very guilty knowing that I will be upsetting the lives of all the people close to me and especially my family. But I want them to remember me the way I was and not the weak broken person that I have become now. I want them to know that I am sorry that I did not tell them or confide in them my state of depression and nervous breakdown. 

Often I have seen or heard people say, ""Could I have foreseen this? Could I have stopped this if I just paid more attention?"". I want you to not be like me that way. I want you to forgive yourself. There is nothing that you could have done. Please do not live with this burden. I live with all my regrets and what-ifs bludgeoning my self-esteem at all moments. I do not want you to go through the same.

I love you. I really do. But I cannot see myself living another day more.  Remember I told you that even in my dreams I could never see myself aging. Maybe I was meant to join the 27 club. Maybe. If you miss me, know that I am around with you at every step. In that song by the velvet underground, in that chance you took in learning something new, in that extra smile at the new person in the room: I am there with you.

So, I have to leave now. I wish you happiness and the best of life. Hope you forgive me for this. It will be hard but one day you will get over this. Please don't forget me. 

love,
T

EDIT 1: I wrote this yesterday as I was desperately looking for a place to crash for the night. I woke up today and I really want to believe that things will solve themselves and that I don't have to do it. But I am running out of places to crash at and the chance to end on a high note. I fear that if I draw it out, I along with many others would suffer more. I am saving the last 5 euros I have for the bus that will take me to the end. But I hesitate. I really do. I saw my family last fall. I would be dead in an unfamiliar country and that does make me worried. Worried that they will get the news over the phone and imagine their failings, even when there are none. I wrote this not only as a farewell that I needed to get off my chest, but also as a place where my brother can find some answers. I created an account with deathswitch and he will get my account details. I hope that being on reddit and meeting some of the amazing people I did will help him through his loss of me, and then he would be strong enough for my parents. I wish for reddit's kindness and tenacity to get my family through this. 

EDIT 2: chatted with brother a little on facebook. He says he is proud of me. Nearly broke my heart. In library now in tears. It is 1.30 pm. Have to board the train at 1.57 to reach my final destination. So scared. Really want to talk to somebody and hear their voice and just tell them to tell my brother that I am sorry. But dont have a phone anymore, and might not be able to access free wifi once I get there. 

EDIT 3: Could not write out individual messages. But **thank you**. I hid in the library bathroom and cried a lot today, probably for the first time in three months. I came clean to a friend who is not in the city at the moment. She is arranging for me to stay over at her place. I will try to reconstruct my life. Going to see a counselor asap. Next week will talk to academic advisor and ask what to do. Finally asked my parents for money. Looking for paid internships for next six months. Still troubled, but I so want to live. Thank you for listening to my whining. I am not done yet. Not giving up on life just yet."
wl77r,3,2012-07-15,"Really want to go to therapy and see a doctor for possible depression/eating disorder issues, but am currently overseas living with parents.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime until I go back to school in September?",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wl77r/really_want_to_go_to_therapy_and_see_a_doctor_for/,"&gt;**TL;DR: I am currently in my parents' homeland in which I do not speak the language.  The system is also so that every transaction at the hospital/clinic is recorded.  I don't want my parents to know I went to the doctor on my own.  I can't talk to them about these issues because 1) we do not have a close relationship, and 2) I've seen from the past that they do not react well nor act supportive (both sisters had eating disorders and had to seek treatment on their own).  I feel like my symptoms are getting worse, and worried that by September, things will be much harder to fix.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime?  Like-- are there online professionals who can have online sessions or something?  I'm getting desperate.**
*Also don't want to tell sisters (both at least 10 yrs older, by the way) about these issues because I'm worried they'll tell my parents.*

**Details**

A few months ago I was happy, motivated, feeling optimistic about my future and slowly gaining confidence in the way I looked.  I don't know what happened but now I'm just completely apathetic, I'm kind of becoming an asshole which is upsetting to me because before I was probably one of the nicest, most Zen people you'd ever meet; now I'm totally withdrawn and haven't seen any friends in weeks nor do I want to.  I don't talk to my parents and I spend most of my time in my room when I'm not at my cubicle at my internship.  **I notice I've become quite snappy and short-tempered and it's a complete 180 degree change from who I was just a few months back, where I was laid-back and chill all the time, just enjoying life and appreciating the world.**  For example, I'll become very irritable and easily angered in the kitchen and my parents talk to me about food.  It's very upsetting because I love them and I feel like it's not **me** saying those snappish responses back to them.

I'm also struggling big time with food and body issues.  **I think about food all day and it's what my day, and thus life, revolves around.**  I'm 5'2"" and as of this morning 79 lbs, and although I still feel gargantuan, I know it's not a good idea to eat as little as I have been eating.  But whenever I try to eat the way other people do, I just can't seem to do it.  I really want to because maybe it might help my recent mood swings and drastic personality change, but I can't!  **Eating more than half a normal portion floods me with anxiety** and sends me into panic mode, and I either don't eat the next day while exercising, or I end up throwing it up...something I never wanted to do, because my older sister was bulimic.  Needless to say I don't want bulimia in my life in any way, shape or form ever again.

I'm really concerned about my physical health because 1) my head hurts all the time and 2) I have been seriously constipated despite exercising plenty and consuming plenty of water and foods that aid digestion.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm simply not eating enough mass to produce a bowel movement, or because my colon has grown dependent on the laxatives and/or artificial sweeteners I may excessively consume in the form of gum and low-calorie candies that can produce laxative effects.  At this point, it is easier for me, and often more frequent, to throw up food than it is for me to pass a bowel movement.  I also find I can't enjoy life in general because food, calories, and negative feelings about myself have invaded my mind.  So I'm not getting as much out of this fantastic internship that I've gotten over the summer as I could.  And I avoid going out because I feel like people shouldn't have to be exposed to someone as ugly as me.  Despite everyone telling me how thin I've gotten and how pretty and doll-like I look, I still feel like a monster who is too ugly to be seen and everyone is conspiring to fool me into thinking I'm not, while they're all laughing behind my back.  Irrational, I know.

**I really, really want help.**  I've struggled with food and body issues the past two years.  Some parts were ""restricting"", some parts were ""overeating"", and some parts just ""obsessed"".  I never realized I might have an eating disorder, or a serious issue with food, but in retrospect I've probably had one for a long time now.  I'm also wondering if I have PMDD, because my sister has it as well and I wouldn't be surprised if I had it as well."

I'm currently a CS major living at home with my parents during the semester, and living in a nearby city every summer to intern for a software company (which pays rather well).  Working this internship during the school semester is not an option, as the drive between the city where I go to school and the city I work is over an hour.  I'd like to have some income during the semester that doesn't involve flipping burgers.

My school holds a CS job fair twice a year, and I've been to two of them so far to find possible semester jobs, however every company I talk to is mainly looking for summer interns or interns who can work year round.  My current summer gig pays a lot more than these companies are offering, so I don't plan on leaving it.  They also intend to hire me when I finally graduate, so I don't think it would be smart to take a different internship over the summer.

Is freelancing a viable option here, or would it be better to keep looking for companies who are willing to hire me solely during the semester?  As far as I can tell, freelance gigs can be kind of sketchy and may be offered by people with little experience hiring programmers.  I've briefly checked out sites like elance and odesk, however a lot of the jobs seem ridiculous (I want to make the next facebook, lolz!), or the developers offering public quotes seem to undercutting each other left and right to the point that there doesn't seem to be a point in pursuing such jobs.

Is there a more legitimate avenue for freelancing, or is finding a normal job/internship the best option?  Some guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated."

wnlyl,4,2012-07-16,What was the time frame for your first real job?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wnlyl/what_was_the_time_frame_for_your_first_real_job/,"I am a recent (within the last 6 months) graduate from College with a BS in IT and a minor in business (not that it apparently matters).

During my schooling I started and sold my own tech firm (high school) and was a program manager of a prestigious program within my college that allowed non-profits to have ""interns"" that could mess up and do basic functions so that they wouldn't have to hire someone that they couldn't afford with myself as a failsafe and teacher (some of these kids didn't even know how to use ipconfig let alone what linux was). I was recruited into this role because the program adviser saw that I was going through the motions of college (which I was just to have a piece of paper) and that I knew what I was doing %99 of the time. I was in charge of roughly 30 ""interns"" at around 10 installations on 24/7 on call and no pay for about a year.

My question and frustration I guess is how are the kids that I taught how to do the jobs they're getting hired for (anywhere between $40-60k/yr jobs) when they couldn't find their own feet? Am I overqualified already to be a recent graduate? I feel like I shouldn't have even tried at all now as I keep seeing posts of these kids getting these jobs and being like ""if only they knew how retarded he really is...""

wnde9,2,2012-07-16,I won concert tickets after a ridiculous series of events. What were the most ridiculous things you did for a contest?,tenentenen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wnde9/i_won_concert_tickets_after_a_ridiculous_series/,"So I was at work one day (Just some desk job where I sit at a computer all day), when for some reason my ""supervisor"" (only kind of. Also she's about 20 years older than me) was looking on Facebook for some reason. I get out of my seat and go walk up to see that she's on the fanpage of a country radio station (not really what I listen to). She also had headphones in. I ask her whats up, and she lets me know that this radio station was giving away concert tickets, and to get them, you had to follow a series clues (on Facebook) and locate the intern IRL.

She wanted these tickets badly, but strangely enough, she already had tickets that she had bought, but she was looking to upgrade to these, as they were much better seats. I agreed to help If I could.

So the first clue appears on FB and it tells us we need to go to a shopping center about 15 minutes away from where we work. So we just looked arround, and up and left work at like 10:00 AM. We got in my van (without AC on a really hot day) and  began to drive there.

On the way there, the next clue was revealed. It said ""One of the colors is red."" Immediatley I think Rainbow Foods (A grocery store in that shopping center) as red is in the rainbow. So we immediatley go into rainbow, and begin asking numerous employees if they were the Intern (I forgot to mention that the intern could be in disguise, and that it could be a worker or a customer or anybody.) We asked so many people, and none of them had the tickets, so we reasoned that it must not be in Rainbow Foods after all. 

So we left, asking other people around the store if they were the intern, including some window washers at Jimmy Johns, who were really confused. Then the next clue came. ""Another of the colors is blue."" So now were are.looking for things that are red and blue, or had red and blue associated with them. We also saw many other people also looking for the intern. All of them were teenage girls.

We went into resturaunts, nail salons, movie theaters, banks, and nobody seemed to know what was up. Then I had a Brain Blast (see Jimmy Neutron) and realized that parking ramps were often color coded. So we checked the parking garages, most of which were not color coded, but one was, and guess what? It had red and blue, but also green. So we looked in every single car and asked everyone we saw. Nobody fucking new ANYTHING about this contest, or the intern.

At this point we had spent an hour and a half looking, when we should have been at work. As we exit the parking ramp, we see a girl in a red shirt standing with her friend listening to a portable radio. They then informed us tgat the tickets had just been found, and they said so on the radio. So they get in their car, and we wqlk to my car, feeling shitty as shit, cause we lost.

As we are driving back, I realize that we never actually confirmed that these girls were telling the truth. They seemed really sincere, and sad that THEY lost, so we dismissed the idea that they were lying.

But upon arrival to the office where we work, we checked Facebook, only to find that the tickets HAD NOT been fucking found at all. I was honestly really upset. So I was like FUCK THAT SHIT, IMMA GOING BACK! So I leave work a SECOND time, by myself, and race back to the shopping center.

On the way there, I get a call fromy supervisor with another clue. ""Plenty of food to eat."" And I'm all like, I FUCKING KNEW IT WAS MOTHERFUCKING RAINBOW FOODS! And as I'm distracted by this phone call, I accidentally took the wrong exit. So mow im trying to reroute while freaking out that someone will get the tickets before me. I finally get there and park, and begin to jog up to the building. And guess who I see run into the store? MOTHERFUCKING RED SHIRT BITCH! So I start sprinting, and I run past the door she went in to the other door, thinking Ill have a better chance if im in the other half of the store. 

I run into the first isle I see, and ask this youngish girl, who was wearing a UofM shirt, shopping cart full of food, ""Do you have k102 tickets to see Kenny and Tim?"" And she hesitates for a second, and a smile creeps upon her face as she says ""I do."" At this point im hufging and puffing and super happy. I fall back onto some Uncle Ben's minute rice to rest. Then RED SHIRT Cunty McCunt turns and runs down the isle, and sees me with tickets in my hand and horror fills her face as she realized her evil plot had failed, and she had lost. 

I returned to the office in triumph with tickets in hand. I ended up keeping the tickets, because the very next morning, there was another hunt for the intern, and my ""supervisor"" and her husband found them on their way to work. Go figure. I gave the tickets to my sisters instead of selling them for like 200 bucks, cause thats just how I roll, motherfuckers.

TL;DR: I beat out the bitch, without profit.

* I have a summer internship that is guaranteed for 3 years in a row.
* I have a full ride through college as long as I maintain a 3.5 gpa or above.
* My roommates seem okay...

What I'm concerned about is that I can't find something to be concerned about. What problems will I face in college? Learning has always come easy to me and I haven't really developed any study habits but that doesn't really throw me off since I have 2 semesters of courses that I would find easy or simple to build up a decent study habit (my hardest course would be computer architecture or discrete computational mathematics).

I'm a CS major, and I'm terrified of not knowing what to be terrified about.

A friend of mine recently got a decent degree in web development at 35 and said he has the hardest time fitting in at his new job since most of his co-workers are 10 or even 15 years younger than he is, and they like to make snide remarks now and then about his age and when he finally got a degree.

I've got some experience with startups, I spent almost a full year in startup mode trying to start a social networking company with some friends &amp; we even got some money. Before that tried to start two other companies and I have done a ton of freelancing.

Skills: PHP, Ajax, C, SQL, Assembly, Coldfusion, Java, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Bash and Wordpress.

My main interests are:

1. Web Development (lots of jQuery, PHP &amp; Coldfusion) 2. Mobile Development (No experience) 3. Security (No experience) 4. Parellel Programming (No experience)

Beyond course work my internships entirely consisted of web development and IT support, I've done lots with OOP and MVC (building a CMS for the USDA), YII, Coldfusion etc... but I am not sure how I can tailor that to applying for jobs.

My main questions are:

1. How do I find a job before I graduate that will start after I graduate?

2. I'm going on a fantastic honeymoon, and won't be able to start for 1 month after graduation. Will this be a problem? Graduation is around May 10, I won't be able to start until after June 10. Will most employer's care?

3. When do I start applying for jobs?

4. I have lots of experience, lots of people have told me to come talk to them at the career fair when I'm ready to graduate--How do I sell myself to them?

5. I'm looking at Continental United States, but will prioritize companies in Arizona (Phoenix area), Colorado (anywhere), Dallas or Austin or somewhere without beaches or snow. What's the job market like for Web Developers across the country?

6. How hard will it be for me to get a job given 6 years IT/Web experience + a 4 year degree @ 24?

I was recently offered an internship by a guy at a company I've known quite awhile. Officially, I don't know if the position is technically ""web development"", but I figured given what I'll be working with it would be close. My primary duties would include:

Source Code management (Git, SVN, JIRA)

Bug ticket management

HTML5

Learning stuff by playing with code

CSS/JS/AJAX

Python

Linux/Puppet admin

Cloud stuff (Amazon EC2, Linode, Heroku)

NoSQL databases

RDBMS

Documentation, diagramming, flowcharting

In addition to some more ""interny"" jobs such as taking the office dogs out for a walk, picking up lunch, and listening in on client meetings just to get a feel of what the company and I will be working on.

The job requires no prior knowledge of any of the above languages or frameworks. It's really a great opportunity I want to get involved in, but how much should it pay? 

Looking at [this](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-developer-intern-salaries-SRCH_KO0,20_IP2.htm) site reveals somehwere in the 12-20 dollar range, but I feel anything above maybe 13 is too high. I do know some people currrently in internships getting paid $15-$20.

I actually inherited all of her past SQL tasks and maintenance in the companies data base. Since she has left my boss is looking for me to continue to do these tasks and develop the database more and create new automations. Well this is well and fine, but I was hired on as a help desk employee. I *am* the help desk, I work along side one other person in the IT dept. and he is the sysadmin. 

Some background on myself, I actually have experience on both sides of technology. I went to school for programming (Associates Degree in Web/Application development) and I have always done IT work for outside customers. I have been doing software/hardware troubleshooting for about 6 years now. I did two internships during college, one was an IT job in a school system and the other was a programming/project manager job for a non-profit. My last position I was a project manager for web development for about a year. I have not done a lot of SQL work outside of college but I am pretty fluent in there pulling information and reading/changing stored procedures.

So as you can see I am all over the place, and I didnt even mention that I have worked in many different fields other than technology. We wont get into that though.

Before my IT manager left I had a talk with her about the company and how much power I have behind position changes and salary compensation. She mentioned that since its a smaller department and a medium size company that I could basically present my research and work my way into anything I want. Since then, my boss has asked me to look into some SQL classes for a refresher in the ""language"", and I will be starting one in the next few weeks. Now for the questions:

1. I am trying to figure out what my title will be. I will basically be doing SQL procedures every morning, adding new procedures to the database for new clients, maintaining the current procedures, and creating new automation. What sort of title might this be?
2. As far as salary goes, after these next few weeks I will be deep within their database and I know they will not want to train another person in there. So I know I have some leverage, so I know that I will be seen as an asset. With my education and experience, what salary range should I be looking into here?

I will also mention that I am working on the state line between NH and MA if this helps.

I am therefore interested in a paid internship or an entry level position as Software Engineer in an English speaking country.

What I can offer: I have some experience with a broad range of languages. However, most larger projects I have worked on so far were written in Java, Scala, Matlab or C/C++. I know basic technologies like ER, UML and have the theoretical background in Algorithms, Maths (Linear Algebra, Discrete Maths, Statistics etc.), Object Oriented Programming, Concurrency, Functional Programming and so forth. Unfortunately, I have little experience with specific frameworks (e.g. .NET). I have put a few code samples up on my [github page](https://github.com/dkgi/).

What I am looking for: A chance to get some practical programming experience within a motivated team working on challenging problems. My primary interests are in software architecture, software engineering, formal verification, concurrency, simulations and computer graphics. I am, however, always eager to broaden my horizon.

In short, I have a solid theoretical foundation and I am a quick and eager learner looking to get some practical experience.

Please pm me if your interested in working with me. If not, feedback about what put you off is welcome as well.


* I'm fluent but not as fluent as I'd like to be. Since I am a Swiss citizen, immigration should not be a problem in most countries except for the US. However, Switzerland has treaties that would allow easy immigration for internships for up to 18 months.

I gave them some ideas and also kind of talked them through how we theoretically would implement some of their grand ideas. Well they basically gave me a green light and told me to do my thing. Recently I designed a SCADA package for their equipment them that does everything their old system did but for cheaper and over cellular networks instead of expensive satellite. I even made it controllable and modifiable on iPads and iphones which the marketing team loved.

Who is right? [Details inside]",I_hate_alot_a_lot,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wsyq1/i_told_my_girlfriend_if_i_ever_buy_a_house_with/,"I'll put a little insight in everything.

Okay, so when I was 18 I started a venture in online advertising, I didn't make millions but I made enough to be able to invest in a very bull market and accumulate $100,000, along with setting aside enough to live off of and pay for college.

About two years ago, my ex-girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me while I was trying to grow my business, go to school full time, and work various management-related internships. It killed me, my heart was broke (I stayed in bed for a full day, dry heaving and not eating a single parcel of food). And she even took my dog (A beautiful red Doberman named Ella). I told myself I would never be fucked with like that again. Ever.

Cue to today, my girlfriend of almost two years now, and I, click. I don't know how to explain it but we just get along very well. We don't plan on getting married any time soon but are very comfortable talking about it. Mostly in a joking manner, with *very* little serious talk.

But, I told her, in a serious manner, that if I bought a house 100% with my money, that I would request she sign a prenup on the house (and it's equity) because I don't believe I should have to give something up I paid for 100%, just in case shit does hit the fan. But I said everything else like my savings, retirement, etc. would go through divorce court as per usual and as per Michigan law, she would still get a shitload of stuff. She says that it isn't fair because she would have to leave her place of residence for years, uproot all her belongings, find an apartment or house of her own, and leave all her memories behind, etc. I cited that if we loved eachother, we shouldn't worry about a divorce any way, and that a prenup on 1 asset is nothing.

We both really disagreed with eachother but stopped arguing about it because I don't own a house, nor have I proposed to her. Plus, we were just sick of arguing and went out for ice cream. But, it has been bothering me. I just don't think there is anything wrong with not wanting to get fucked over and protecting yourself a little bit.

Am I right or is she? If anyone could offer some thought or insight, that would be greatly appreciated. It's 2AM and I'm usually in a dead sleep but it's been bothering me so much I have to post this question here."

God forbid that we ask them to describe Domain Name Service as it applies to a non-Microsoft based operating system.

In my opinion, the colleges are not teaching these folks anything that will help them in their careers except if they plan on working in very specific fields (Windows, Cisco...) and even then they have no practical knowledge of any related area's or how to apply the little knowledge they do get to anything beyond a lab project.

wvbtw,8,2012-07-20,Personal victory leading to awesome chocolate orientation-internship.,Zylll,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wvbtw/personal_victory_leading_to_awesome_chocolate/,"Heyy guys, 

A while back I've posted in a win-wednesday (or whatever it was) that I threw my application for school in the mail. After some long weeks of waiting around I finally got an intake for becoming a pastry baker. 

I'm at the intake with the same person who gave me some info at the information evening some weeks back, but apperantly she somewhat changed her mind. While she said I knew what I was getting into and had a realistic view of my jobchances and what not, she decided that now I don't. 

I felt they focused very much on the stuff I ""can't"". I'm a bit older (25 in august), while most first years for this degree (somewhat of an associate degree) are around 16. I know it's quite the age-diffrence, but I already have another degree, even a bit higher, but I want to do something that I wouldn't choose because I ""had too"", but because I want to. 

Besides the age, which could cause some problems in terms of working experience when I'm eventually looking for a job, they focused very much on my ADD. My ADD expresses itself in me being easily tired. I sleep around 10-12 hours a day and I can't maintain a fulltime (five days a week) schedule. 

Seeing as I've already gotten a degree at the same level and doing a lot of the theory at home, I didn't think this would be much of a problem. I've managed before, I'll do it again. They weren't so convinced and it all ended in a negative review. That means I'm not ""allowed"" to start (YET). In theory a school here is required to just hire any possible student who wishes to join and has the level to start (a.k.a. you need to have a highschooldiploma). 

They told me I should do an orientation internship, but even then they saw small chances. A negative review automaticly leads to a conversation with someone of the ""succes centre"" to perhaps give you other options that might be more suitable. They came up with the most insane ""solutions"" that didn't suit me at all. 

So stubborn, old, ADD impared me (or how I felt they viewed me) planned to walk in some bakeries this morning to ask for a possible orientation internship. The first one also was the last one. For the next three weeks, I'm going to do two days a week at an awesome chocolate/bonbon/icecream store that also makes weddingcakes on order. I'm SOO much looking forward to it and even though it might not be huge, I'm very excited and it feels like a personal victory. 

After I've completed the orientation, I can just re-apply again, have another intake and the whole thing starts again, but I do feel I'll be more confident with the orientation behind me. I'm really looking forward to making the most amazing stuff and I just had to share my good news of the day. I truely feel I'm on a roll again :)

Thanks so much for reading (if you still are, haha)! And please, feel free to share your moment of personal victory. I love reading feel good stories :D"
wuzxi,15,2012-07-20,Davis from the Institution ,randomfiction,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wuzxi/davis_from_the_institution/,"A friend of mine had to intern at an asylum to qualify for her CNA degree, she told me a few creepy stories, one of which sticks out.



There was this patient named Davis, she couldn't say whether that was his first or last name, as that was the only name she ever saw on his charts.  His incident record was all but blank, save for a note from the admitting physician that Davis was extremely dangerous.  She said he was always quiet and well behaved, but that his eyes had some sort of vacant look in them, likely due to the drugs he was on.


Davis had the highest prescription dose of haldol of anyone in the facility, as well as a heavy tranquilizer regiment at night.  The nurses in the medication line always took special care to ensure he always swallowed his pills, as he tried to hide them in the past.


During a particularly bad flu season, several members of the nursing staff were out sick, including a lot of the senior staff.  They managed to get some extra help during the days but the night shift was left understaffed for a few days.  

My friend was working the night shift when another patient noticed that Davis hadn't been seen in awhile.  She went to his room and found it empty, save a small pile of pills in the middle of his unmade bed.


She called up to the nursing desk and requested an orderly or two to help find Davis and forcibly medicate him if needed.  They sent two orderlies, one huge black guy who apparently looked like a parolee and a tall husky white guy who was in some sort of motorcycle club.
She said she felt more than safe with the two huge guys, so they went room to room, searching for Davis.  


After checking each room in the ward, then made their way to the end of the hall near the bathrooms and heard a noise.  She said it was splashing, following by furious sounds of eating.  Like a hungry dog eating wet food, wolfing it down.  They found Davis.

He was on his knees in front of a toilet deliriously eating the contents inside.  Either one of the other patients or Davis himself, had shit in the toilet and he was eating it.  Grossed out the white orderly grabbed Davis by the waistband of his pants and pulled him away.  Davis responded with a inhuman roar, and with one hand pushed the orderly hard into the bathroom wall.  Hard enough to break some of the tiles on the wall and knock the wind out of the guy.  

The black orderly straight up ran at the guy to tackle him, but Davis batted him down like he was nothing.  The dude just slumped to the ground, out cold.


My friend was screaming at this point and tried to run to the nurses station but Davis was on her too quick.  He grabbed her by the throat and pinned her against the door.

Then he became still, relaxed almost, yet his grip on her neck was firm.  He began to sing, so soft and gently, from a mouth covered in shit.  He sang her a Celine Dion song, the one from Titanic.  


Near the end of the song people started banging on the door, other nurses and concerned patients, brought by her scream.  He started laughing through the end of the song, as if the pounding on the door was bringing him a lot of joy.  He then leaned in close to her ear, and frantically whispered something to her as the door was forced open.


In the end it took 5 men to subdue Davis.  A mishmash of patients and staff.  It took 3 times the normal dosage of their strongest tranquilizer, injected into his shoulder muscles, to finally drop him.


She quit that night and enrolled in a dental assistant program offered by one of those for profit schools, and is now a happily employed dental assistant.


I asked her what Davis whispered to her.  She never told me.

wuvr1,6,2012-07-20,My girlfriend of 3 years has cheated on me twice in the span of the 2 months when she moved in with me. Please tell me this shit gets better.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wuvr1/my_girlfriend_of_3_years_has_cheated_on_me_twice/,"So a little back story. I met her while I was living in Florida 3 years ago, We instantly hit it off. According to her it was love at first sight. And it really was great, after about a year of us being together and happy and awesome, she moved to Chicago and I moved to Washington state (because of parents) this caused a little rift. But we did the long distance thing and it worked. We flew any little chance we could to see each other. Skype every night you know the works. 

During that year, I was 19 and started working. I worked 2 jobs, Macy's and Panera. So I would open Macy's 5 days a week and closed at panera  5 days a week. I still barely made friends because I was focused on moving to Chicago, and starting school in Chicago.

And I did it, exactly 1 year later (btw still together) I moved to Chicago leased an apartment July 1st and started possibly the coolest experience ever. My girlfriend was close to me, I worked at Panera (ended up eventually quitting that and working at an Apple Store, best job yet) 

Although she was close to me, she still lived out in the suburbs which took a 1 hour long train ride but fuck it was great. After a while she finally had enough money and had finished school so she could move in with me. In retrospect: what the fuck am I doing why did I do this. 

I have a little studio but the space has not been an issue, the issue's started with her job search. She was feeling down and Looking for a job, as you can guess it took her a good long 2 months to finally land something. During this time I was stretching myself financially to feed us and still pay for the apartment. Eventually she finally had 2 offers on the table, My Apple Store actually called her for an interview, as well as the Lego Store. I wanted her to work at apple, I new she would love it and it payed more as well. But because she knew it would take another month for the interview process with them she chose the Lego Store. I mean I can't control her so that was that. Now I was really happy because that means I was gonna have some money for myself finally. But little by little stuff started changing. She never payed for half of the apartment. she helped me with as little as she could because she knew I made more money. which although not that bad a problem, it took its toll on me. I was starting to become unhappy, I was wanting a break, some money for myself. At that time I started to have some feelings for one of the girls at work, She reminded me of My Girlfriend so much. But that went to nothing because I did not want to cheat on her, I felt like she may have had an interest but I killed it by playing dumb. 

I felt horrible for even having a crush on someone else. And decided to tell her, she was hurt and I understood why. But I did not do anything, I have always been the best boyfriend I could be, Treated her to the best I could do. But because of this we took a little ""break"" 3 days tops. On this break she ended up visiting and fucking someone at her work place. The asshole, as any good asshole would do, fucked her and dumped her easy as that. She thought he liked her, she thought it wouldn't be this way. But it happened. because of the circumstances. and because dammit I love this girl, I forgave her (Another huge mistake.) I mostly forgave her, because she felt horrible for it, she came crying to me that night when she got home and told me everything. But here is the kicker, she had sex with me before she told me anything.

So whatever that was that, I forgave her I felt she deserved it, I did not help the whole situation with my little crush. But as time progressed, she still had a crush on this asshole, she told me so, she hated it but she wanted him. But he was done with her, the last time they saw each other was when she STAYED OVER HIS HOUSE about 2 weeks later. She tells me that she did not do anything but I don't know if I believe that anymore. 

So meanwhile this is happening there is another asshole lets call him #2, now this one was not too bad, he would just text her constantly. And I mean constantly there would be times when we are at home or hanging out somewhere, and he would text and she would text back and it would be like that the whole night. It infuriated me, but like a dumbass I let it slide because I did not want to hold her down (Because I was afraid that might push her away... I know I am a fucking dumbass anyway) Eventually, after many a seen text by mistake on her phone. that's right she did not care enough to hide them, and to clarify I did not go through her phone. I saw that #2 was calling her babe and she was sending him pictures in some lego tshirt he bought him. GOD DAMN IT I was so mad. So I confronted her about it, and I told her I saw the picture and she got mad, she said it wasn't what it seemed like. But she eventually dissented and stopped talking to him.

And life was finally starting to take an upturn, it was great for a short while, it was me and her. she was finally happy with me. until 2 days ago. Now during the summer she has been working as an intern at United Airlines, causing a lot of travel for her. Which is great. but 2 days ago on the weekend she had an office at Lego (she is keeping the FUCKING job when she starts school since her internship ends after the summer) and proceeds to tell me she is going to hangout with the crew and go to TGIF which is cool whatever. That was the last I heard until the next morning. I stayed up waiting for her, Called her once and texted her twice, and nothing, I was already expecting the worst. 

And in comes asshole #3 that is correct folks #3. So when she finally got home that day she told me what happened. she left TGIF with about half the group to #3's house and did some hooka and proceeded to spend the night making out and staying over at his place. Yep she made out with asshole #3. 

But the worst part about all of this is that. I still want to be with her. What is wrong with me Reddit? She has hurt me so many damn times in such a short span. But I still love her, of course we broke up. But damn it I act like such a little bitch and want her back.


 But I am still so angry about all of this. I don't fucking deserve this. I just don't, in fact right now she is staying over at #3's house again. And she wont be moving out, to dorm into her new college. until august. I can possibly take this shit anymore. 

Edit 1: sorry for the wall of text.

wx1xm,3,2012-07-21,Should I tell my girlfriend's boyfriend about me before I dump her?,anotherschmuck221,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wx1xm/should_i_tell_my_girlfriends_boyfriend_about_me/,"I'm 21/m, my girlfriend is 21/f, and her other boyfriend is probably 20 or 21.

So last summer I meet this girl who goes to Harvard. I'm in Portland. We dated last summer for a few months and things seemed to go well, but I'd never really consider getting serious with her - she's kind of inexperienced and annoying and scatterbrained in a way that isn't cute, but she's also a fucking genius and an enthusiastic lover.

Summer ends, she goes back to school and we talk pretty rarely because neither of us really initiates it. Towards the end of the school year we pick back up and we've been dating since she got back in town.

Flash forward to tonight. I come over for a dinner party she's having with some other interns at her company who she knows from school. Her roommate seems eminently surprised to see me - I haven't come over in a few weeks, we mostly meet elsewhere - and her friends seem to have never heard of me, which is weird because last summer all her intern buddies knew probably more about me than I'd have liked.

The night goes pretty normally. She's as into me as ever, and after she falls asleep I (with permission) hop on her laptop. She's automatically logged into Skype when I start up the computer, and this dude messages me like ""Hey babe, you free tomorrow?""

and I was like Whaaaaaaaaat is this?

So I do some snooping and find out two things.
1. She's been dating this guy for like four months. I'm reading chat logs and they seem to talk every night. He flew out to Portland last week to see her and spend the night on Wednesday (roommate must think this girl is super classy amirite).
2. My girlfriend has more issues than I realized. I did some more snooping, and she keeps a daily journal on a word document which is one of like two things on her desktop. Shitty security if you ask me, but that's kind of her style. Apparently she's pretty seriously bulimic, which I guessed, and cuts/self injures in various other ways. I knew she cut because I'm not a fucking idiot and I know what it looks like when you fall down some stairs, which she used to explain her injuries.

I'd like to make my exit as gracefully as possible. I'm typing this on her laptop and plan to bounce in the morning and not look back, but I'm wondering if I should tell homeboy that he's getting fucked around on, too. On the one hand, from reading the chats he actually seems like a nice guy and I can tell he really cares about her. She's been open with him about her issues and from reading her journal it seems like he's a huge support to her. I don't really blame her for having no social skills - I think either she doesn't realize that what she's doing is wrong, or that she's narcissistic enough not to care. She needs a support system other than her mother, and I don't want to fuck up the only good thing she has going for her. On the other hand, I feel bad for this dude. If I were him, I'd want to be told about the situation and know that I was getting played.

For the record I've been having unprotected sex with this girl and so has he. She's got an IUD so pregnancy isn't really an issue, but now she's exposing me to potential STI's from other people without my knowlege or consent.

I've also considered testing her a little bit to see how far she's willing to take it. Maybe dropping the L word and talking about moving in together. That seems kinda immature and not really worth the trouble but it'd be amusing.

**tl;dr Girlfriend has been in two relationships for the past few months without either of us knowing about it. He's the only person she talks to about her mental issues and I'm not sure whether telling him that he's been getting played is worth screwing her out of her only support system.**

However now when I apply to jobs Lower end lab jobs look at my experience and last job and think I am to overqualified/will leave at any chance I get, however on the other hand Higher end jobs will look at my Degree and say that it is not enough.

My interviews for job ranges between £14,000 and £26,000pa. So a large spectrum and each one keeps telling me the same thing. No one wants to hire a lab assistant/tech who 'can' leave for a job 10 grand more and no one wants to hire me for the higher jobs because there are people out there with more experience and are higher qualified. 

I have tried to get internships for more experience but no one is willing to take on an extra body. Any advice or help?"

x1e0g,6,2012-07-23,Can I make this function better ?,cyberbemon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/x1e0g/can_i_make_this_function_better/,"I'm currently doing my internship, today I had a code review, one thing I was told during this was there are too many for loops and if statements. The code is written in python and for the task I thought what I did was good, I'm fairly new to python, but I picked it up faster than other languages and I'm very comfortable with it. My task was to test installation of a particular program(SCons), in order to do that I have to compile few .cpp files using this program.


There are about 6 .cpp files, the first test uses the default compiler in the system, the second set uses visual studio.

Here is how I approached this problem

* I made 4 lists that contain 1) files for default compiler, 2)files for Visual Studio, 3)names of .exe file from default compiler, 4) names of files from VS

* I have 2 functions, one for the default compiler and one for VS
* I use a for loop to Iterate through the list and compile each file 
* once that's done I look for the path where the compiled exes are saved, I can't hard code this because the folder names depends on few settings, so they are different each time!
* So I look for two keywords one at the start and the other at the end (it ends with an exe file ), based on the info I get from using 'tree=all' 
* then I iterate over each line and use if statement so look for the keywords, then add them to a separate list and run it at  the end.

So here is that in code 

**List 1**
[file1,file2,file3]

**List2**
[file4,file5,file6]

**exelist**
[exe1,exe2,exe3]

**exelist2**
[exe4,exe5,exe6]


**keywords**
dir_key = ""/out""


    def fun1():
         for f in list1:
		try:
			treeinfo = 
    subprocess.check_output(['C:\Python27\Scripts\scons.bat','-f' ,f,'--tree=all']).splitlines()	
			for afile in exelist:
				for line in treeinfo:
					if dir_key in line and afile in line: #Parsing scons output looking for 'out' AND and 'exe' file
						exe= line.split('-',1)[1]
						print ""Compiled file %s "" %afile
						print exe

						try:
							with open(exe) as f:
								exe_paths.append(exe)
						except (IOError)as e:
							print""File %s doesn't exist""%afile
					else:
						pass		
			print ""\n""

I learned how to program the month before college so I could pass placement exams, so I don't have the experience that many of my peers do. I am immensely interested in the subject and have surpassed most of my peers who are only casually interested, but there remain those intimidating few who have a very large knowledge base. I know that knowledge isn't nearly as important as creativity, but when it comes around to applying for top-notch internships for next summer, I feel slightly insecure with my relatively limited resume of knowledge. Also, when I sometimes see someone mention an interview question unfamiliar to me, I immediately research it and understand, but I'm not sure I'd be able to hold my own in an interview.

All this to say, I want to know how to best spend my time over the next 6 or so months before I apply for internships and have these interviews. I plan to create personal projects in the languages I do know, and r/programming and related subreddits have really expanded my knowledge. However, I don't know the best ways to learn Linux, web programming, and the intricacies of operating systems (specific system calls and all) within such a brief time.

I hope all of this came off sounding the way I intended, but the interview processes of Google, Microsoft, etc. really seem intimidating from my perspective right now, and I want to figure out how to best prepare.

I've been looking to build a PC to complement my Late 2011 i7 Macbook Air. It's an awesome machine, just too slow for some applications. I'll be using it mostly for software development and hopefully in the near-future some bioinformatics, computational neuroscience stuff (I'll be starting my MSc. in September). 

The Intel Xeon E5-2620 was chosen because it's the cheapest (reasonable) 6-core Intel, and although a lot slower (and without OC capabilities) than its i7 counterpart it does come with the perk of ECC. 

I'm Dutch so some of the parts are more commonly held in stores than in the US I've noticed. 

What do you guys think?"

While idling sitting in the back of the room as every intern does, the meeting started to heat up and some of the sales team were getting quite animated about their commission not being appropriately distributed.

And it hit me, their commission isn't being properly distributed because of an internal database error on our program we use to log sales. Everybody knows that the territories are mixed up and do nothing about it other than vehemently complaining.

After 45 minutes or so of this complaining, I had mustered up enough courage to speak up about their problem. My solution verbatim : "" Could I interrupt for moment please? I was just wondering if (company name) had ever thought of hiring a computer programmer/ scientist to simply write some code and fix this problem"". ""I mean I took basic computer science programming in college, and this code would not be entirely far fetched, plus it would save hundreds of hours.""

The room quiets down....

And then erupts into laughter. FUCK THIS. These old school internal sales people fucking laugh at my suggestion to fix their fucking problems. I can't even begin to tell you my pure frustration, I wish I had a massive barbell that I could just smash windows with here. 

Companies like this deserve to fail if they fail to see a clear solution for a problem like this.

I am of Indian descent, but I'm 100% American(born and raised here).  I'm an INTERN, and only get paid hourly, so I do not make money off of the people I connect with.

I send emails to candidates that we have contacted in the past(2 of my colleagues have connected with him in the past 3 years), to reconnect and see if they're interested in finding a new job, or not.  It's pretty simple, if they're interested, I send them a job description and forward their resume to a Sr. Recruiter.  If not, they normally just don't reply. 

But, last friday, I received a response email that kinda made me tick.  As always, I take my time writing emails, and I make sure they are carefully worded not to offend anyone, or present false information.


**Below is the response from Kevin, and my initial email below that:**

Subject: Reconnecting - New Job Opportunity

*Kevin,* 

*I am writing to you today in hopes of reconnecting and introducing you to a new opportunity that may interest you.  Your experience as a project manager and business analyst is very relevant, and I was wondering if you are interested in a position to work as a PM/BA at a major consulting services firm located in Secaucus, NJ. 
Also, it has been a several years since we last connected, so if you could please send a current resume, we will more accurately match you to your desired position. 
Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this, and future opportunities.*

*I hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
ME*



So, I have drafted a response, but I wanted to know if you think I should respond to him with all the reasons he's wrong, or just forget about it?  **Below is the draft i want to send to him:**



*Kevin,*

*First of all, nowhere in my email did I say or imply ""we did business"".  All I said is that we were connected at one point, inferring that myself or one of my colleagues contacted you in the past.  In this case, my co-worker M. contacted you last year, and another colleague, P. received your resume through Dice in 2009.  You are also connected with her on LinkedIn.  Calling me a liar is impetuous and completely false.*

*Secondly, there's no need for arrogant, hateful racist comments.  If you don't want to do business with me that’s fine, but bringing race into a professional place of work is out of line.  Also, I was born and raised by my legitimate parents, in America, so unless you're calling me a 'bastard' in the slang term, indicating that you think I'm a vicious, despicable, thoroughly disliked person (which could also be seen as racist, and absolutely hateful since you don't even know me), you are foolish and presumptuous.  Either way, I can confirm that, yes, you are an arrogant prick.*

*Thirdly, learn how to spell.  It's 'lying' not 'lieing'.*

*Finally, I would be happy to 'reconnect your ass', since dealing with racist, ignorant assholes like you isn't part of my job description.*

*Have a great day!*
*Me*


**Is this response appropriate?  Do you think I should respond with everything but the profanities(calling him a prick and asshole etc.), and just tell him why he's wrong and ignorant. Or just drop it :(**

Thanks in advance, racism makes my blood boil, so I want to call him out, but I also don't want to become the bad guy. HELP PLEASE!


**EDIT:  Thanks for all the responses; It seems we have come to a conclusive decision.**

I guess i posted to see if his comment warrented a response, and the consensus seems to be NO.  

So thanks for the responses, I will take everyone's advice and just forward it to my boss, without responding to Kevin.  


I appreciate your input and I'm glad I asked Reddit before doing something stupid lol.

Also i'll probably delete this soon, just a heads up.


**EDIT 2:**  So I added him to our 'do not call list' as he requested, and responded (with permission from my boss) saying:

*Check your grammar.* 

*Regards,*
*Lying Indian Bastard*

I'm 23 years old and halfway through a dual degree in International Business/International Relations. My main areas of focus are foreign affairs, trade and finance. I'll be finished by June 2014, so two years down, two years to go. 

I worked in a really well paying job from ages 18-21 but hit a bit of an income ceiling with that and decided to go to university to further my career opportunities. I was making great money for a young adult, but there wasn't much room for more and I wasn't happy to be on that money for the rest of my life. Now I've gone back to study after those years, and I'm having a lot of trouble finding work. Internships and Cadetships tend to want people who are in their last or second last year of study, which I am not as of yet. Simple unskilled casual jobs are also hard to come by because they're either going to younger people or to people wanting full-time work. Furthermore, I can't really get back into anything like my old job, and because I worked that job during ages 18-21, I haven't got much experienced in lower-level casual jobs that the average 23 year old might have (barista, warehouse work, hospitality etc.) 

So I'm at this real crossroads where I want to get a job that furthers my career but I can't. I also can't really find an unskilled casual job because I haven't been suitable for the role due to my previous work experience and age. Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? How did you react? I'm still trying extremely hard to get any sort of job or internship, but I've had countless knockbacks even with good work references and a GPA of 6.0 (out of 7). 

I'm not really looking for an all-encompassing solution to this, just wondering if you have experienced similar issues and if so, how did you deal with them? "

Hey everyone! I promised I'd come back for you, unlike Kate did for Jack. I don't even know what that means.

Sorry for being a little later than planned, I had a mini emergency that I had to tend to before I could get back here. Here's the update, and the thread in case you missed it yesterday:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/

So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry. Oh, especially thank you to all those that called me a hypocrite for going on reddit at work. Please read more. Browsing is fine, as long as you get work done.

**tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here.**

Edit: I'm still getting tons of messages about how evil we are for taking an unpaid intern, and how I have *no* right to make him do any work. If you'd read the damn thread and original post, he makes around $18 an hour! Also, plenty of people are chiming that this is fake because no intern makes $18 an hour, that's unheard of. That's the going average rate for internships in this area for the major (CS) and pretty much all engineering majors."

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May 2010, and landed a job with a local company starting the Monday after graduation.  Compared to my internship, I've got a dream job. Working with C#/.NET, Android, 

A little background: The company was founded 15 years ago, and sells management software to the public sector. We've got a flagship product that's just as old, and within the past 12 months, the company has began development on our next-generation web application. Only one person on our team (of 20 developers) has had prior JavaScript experience, so I took it upon myself to start learning web development including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  In the 12 month since we've started this project, I have become the go-to guy regarding anything JS/CSS/HTML. We've already built a large part of the system's core, and it's just adding more and more domain-specific functionality from here on out.  

The problem:  I'm getting tired of the Business Analysts, UX Designer, and Product Managers telling us that we need this software out the door yesterday.  I feel as if they spend all of their time conceiving this ""game-changing"" product, but when it comes to the developers, we're simply the construction monkeys and we have no say in anything. Throwing 20 developers with no JavaScript experience at a 3-year project the powers-that-be want complete in 1 year has left us with a mountain of technical debt, and some parts of the architecture are shaky, to say the least. 

Because the BAs and the PMs order our backlog, we're constantly struggling to squeeze in refactoring stories so that we can try and keep the architecture as scalable as possible.  My immediate superiors have responded to this by 'assuring' us that the leadership team 'knows' that they 'will have to pay for this technical debt', but I'm not so sure that they know how much actually is there, or that they'll ever actually allow us to address it. 

The lead PM has, to say the least, been less than inspiring to the development team, even going as far as to announce to the entire company that ""Yes, development has hit every milestone so far, BUT there's still a lot to do."" at our most recent milestone celebration. I get the feeling that these BAs and PMs feel like they're the ""rockstars"" developing this new product, while we're nothing but the expendable labor they can boss around. Combine this with the recent rumors that these BAs/PMs are receiving sporadic bonuses while we get $25 gift cards for working a month's worth of Saturdays, and I'm just not as happy as I was when I walked through the door. 

For the average developer, I think that this place is a dream come true. The hours are super-flexible, and the pay is pretty decent for the Midwest, we aren't micro-managed by our immediate superiors, but I'm just tired of dealing with all of the politics between development and product management. I'm not afraid to say that I'm an above-average developer, and even with only two years on the job, I'm ready for something more challenging. I want to ask for a raise and promotion, as my manager has repeatedly said that I'm one of the most productive employees she has, and my advanced knowledge of JavaScript has made me a crucial component to this project being delivered on time.  Every 3 weeks for the past 6 months or so, I have been giving 1-hour JavaScript training sessions at lunch to the rest of the development team, which has been the only education on JavaScript provided to our team. 

I feel that at one point, this company really did value their engineers, but now just wants to give bonuses to people that aren't us. 

TL;DR I loved my job until they stopped appreciating their developers. I think I'm ready for a new challenge, but could very easily get a raise and promotion at the end of the year.  Burning out and not sure what to do.

Just looking for thoughts. "

x1pzm,0,2012-07-23,What is a professional way to deal with a student/intern plagiarist?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x1pzm/what_is_a_professional_way_to_deal_with_a/,"Of whom, I am not their supervisor and I’m certainly not the head of any department.  Because the last time I confronted one of our students I was far too angry to go about it gracefully. (/TL;DR)  

I work in a healthcare facility and we have students come in for different types of internships.  Some require they observe for a week, others require months of participation as members of a department under the supervision of a licensed professional.  The students who are with us for two to three months are required to complete a project and give a presentation to most or all of the relevant department(s) during a mutual break (sometimes we’d get fed too!).  

Please note, first of all, the student was in a doctoral program (not MD, but PhD kind of doctorate.)

What I watched, as fellow member of the department, was the student plagiarize his PowerPoint presentation, and present it as his own work without any sources.  How did I know, you ask? 

I became suspicious when the presentation didn’t appear to be cohesive, but that could’ve just been a sign of working to the last minute. I wasn’t happy to see large chunks of texts without any citation, but maybe there would be credit at the end.  Sloppy work, but not worth vilifying the presenter.  

Then the font size occasionally changed without any apparent reason, and text appeared out of line.  Finally, the double bullets were the unambiguous sign that he had copied and pasted from another list somewhere.  I took out my smart phone and wrote a sentence into google closed in quotes.  LO AND BEHOLD, the same chunk of text appeared on an advocacy/education site.  I do it again when he advanced slides, and more information from the web shows up word-for-word in the top google result.  

I am vibrating with anger at this point.  I look around at my colleagues to see if anyone else has noticed, but they are all placidly watching the student talk.

Finally it ends.  No slide citing of any sources.  He asks if there are any questions.

I do not remember exactly what I asked, but it was about where he got his information.  Things went downhill from there.  He attempted to brush off my question, saying everything was his own work.  He wouldn’t plagiarize, NEVER.  I was mistaken.  I remember him asking why I was so angry, like it wasn’t a big deal.  

I showed him what I found and had saved to my phone.  That I could tell by the shoddy formatting. That it is a violation of academic and professional ethics to present someone else’s words as your own.

That’s when he started complaining about the time frame for the project and being given very little direction on how to proceed.   He apologized.  He’d spoken with a previous student who did practically the same thing he just did.  He apologized and apologized.  He would never do this, normally.  It was only this once, and had no bearing on his character.  I shouldn’t think so badly of him. This was a one-time thing.

In my mind, and I told him so, nothing excused plagiarizing, and it certainly didn’t excuse presenting the whole thing to a room full of people.  He showed an utter lack of respect by plagiarizing, and doing it so obviously.  What he did here made all of his other coursework suspect.  What would we see if we put his presentation through TurnItIn?  This could cost him the passing grade, and get him into a great deal of trouble with his supervisor and his school.  Students have failed courses and been expelled from schools for plagiarism.  This should not be taken lightly.

This went on for a good fifteen minutes.  I was riding on the adrenaline rush of anger.  I’m sure I looked scary to the people watching.

The end of the lunch hour brought an awkward end to the whole thing.  No one spoke, neither to me nor to him.  His supervisor, watching in the back of the room said nothing.  Everyone cleaned up, and I went up to the computer/projector to show him the evidence against him (he really, really didn’t understand the double bullet thing).  The rest of the day was largely quiet, and I was tired.

What could I have done differently?

I ask you about this, Reddit, because I have gotten a WIDE range of reactions to the incident.  Healthcare professionals outside my department and facility have defended my actions to one degree or another.  Non-healthcare workers think it’s hilarious.  A few colleagues gave me a thumbs up, while others I work with quietly took me aside and said I should have handled it differently, taking him aside and out of public space as they did me.  I embarrassed the student in front of his supervisor and the department.  I left a good student with a negative experience, and he may not want to work with us in the future. 

The student’s actual supervisor never once spoke to me about it.  I was so thrown by pulling a Bruce Banner --&gt; Hulk I shied away from asking about their take on it.

On the one hand, yes that wasn’t the best way to go about it…  However, I can’t help but feel that telling him one-to-one would have let him think “oh, only one person noticed, and it wasn’t my supervisor. Meh.”  I honestly don’t know if taking it straight to his supervisor would have changed anything, especially since it’s clear he passed the internship and graduated from his school.  Public shaming seems to have been the extent of his punishment.

But as far as efficacy goes, I think I gave him a good scare and showed him he’s not as good at BSing as he thinks he is.  

Ultimately, what I did was unprofessional, no matter how justified my actions.  I need to do better in the future.  So, the question is, what’s the better thing to do professionally?"

The fan has to be functional between 12 and 48V. Most of the examples I've seen just draw power from a Molex connector or something similar, but This particular application (because of confidentiality I can't be much more specific) needs to draw power from outside the device and its not always the same amount of power.
Most of the microcontrollers that I've looked at have much narrower ranges.  Even if I used a simple resistor voltage-divider, no combination could shape these voltages to fit in a 2.2:5V or similar range.

    2) Do you know if there is a computer security company that would hire me (even as an intern) and pay for my certifications?

x3yzg,6,2012-07-24,"I'm feeling really lost and shitty. I need some real talk right now. TL,DR at end of post",fabul0uslyfoxxy,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x3yzg/im_feeling_really_lost_and_shitty_i_need_some/,"Hey guys. So, I'm feeling really, really down right now, and I'm not really sure who to talk to, so I figured I'll give this subreddit a shot. I don't necessarily expect any pity talk, but just real constructive advice if anything.

BASICALLY, I wanted to pursue a career in financial services, something more in investment management/ advisory, but this desire only surfaced in the past 15 months. I just graduated from a non-target undergrad, doubling in Econ &amp; Lingusitics with no prior internships. I work(ed) part time at the MFE office in the business school, but obviously that's not really any finance experience. 

Anyway, I studied abroad in China last spring semester in a business/econ focused program, and that's when I got bitten by the financial career bug. I came back in late August looking for internships, didn't find anything, began full-time recruiting, &amp; signed up for the CFA Level 1 to take in June. Of course, without any prior experience, I was nowhere near competitive to the other candidates at my school, but I tried anyway.

During winter break, I had a super short ""internship"" at a M&amp;A advisory firm. I didn't get any quantitative/ modeling experience or anything. It was more like reading Marketwatch &amp; Businessweek and discussing/ reporting any interesting stories/ trends in the morning (more educational), and then in the afternoon, I spent my time contacting boutique banks and business brokers to find companies to acquire (so I guess I was technically on the buy-side of this particular transaction). In terms of learning, I became a lot more knowledgeable on financial news in general.

When I came back to school, I made a feeble search for internships, but by this time, most places were looking for underclassmen, and so I started to study for the CFA. I somehow managed to get an interview with a registered independent advisory (RIA) firm (they were a boutique investment advisory firm). The 1st round was exhilarating, just talking the news and I actually really enjoyed it. There were no behavioral questions, and I knew I did a great job. I got a call for Round 2 about two hours after my interview. The 2nd round was a case interview along with a couple ""get to know you"" interviews with the VP that I'd be working under. Finally, I get called back to the final round, and I talk to all 6 partners via phone or in person. I think I did pretty well overall, except when I talked to a 2-partner team interview in which they ripped apart my econ gpa/transcript, and I caved under that pressure. Also, I talked to the partner under whom I'd be working, and he pretty much told me that I had no idea what I was doing/ talking about/ getting into. Therefore, how could he expect me to work well for him? Needless to say, I didn't get the full-time offer. Apparently some other guy did a much better case interview in round 2 than the other 3 candidates (including myself).

My final quarter was dedicated to studying like full time for the CFA, and if you don't already know, results for Levels 1 and 2 came out today. Despite my efforts, I didn't pass. I know I should've studied even more than I already did, but I didn't slack off. As expected, my weakest section was accounting/ financial reporting standards because I had only taken beginning accounting at school. 

So, the thing is I had put CFA Level 1 candidate on my resume, and THAT alone had given me some kind of a leg up. Recruiters and professionals that I talked to were somewhat impressed and encouraged me to study and do well. Now, I don't even have that. I'm really at a loss of what to do. 

Summary of academic background: beginning accounting, micro/macro economic theory, investment theory, finance. I have no financial modeling experience, proficient in Excel (but not like super, I just learned how to do pivot tables.. kind of), and my accounting is really weak.

I really apologize for the long post, but I really needed to just get it off my chest and possibly get some real feedback. Is it possible for me to even fathom getting into investment management/ advisory? Or is it just not possible/ maybe I'm just better fit for something else?

Shift is an internship programme; disguised as an innovation lab, ran like a creative agency. Over the next few months the team will have their heads down, underpaid and malnourished challenging traditional methods of creativity and encouraging cross-discipline collaboration to explore and uncover new ways of thinking. But we're not doing this for ourselves, we want to share it with you and the world as much as possible!

To do so we're planning on holding a one of a kind event to showcase this new thinking, streamed live across the web from a leading UK venue, exhibits and a mass workshop will engage those lucky enough to attend and others interacting online. Guest speakers, unique collaborative performances and an after party to end all after parties will complete a night to remember. 

For those who can't attend we will be producing the 1st edition of 'white paper' a must have publication documenting our early trails, tribulations and triumphs. Acompanying that will be a DVD featuring our findings, exclusive interviews, coverage of our event and much more. But we need your support to help make this a success, help invest in the future of the creative industry, get involved and help us take creativity forward.

All you have to do to show your support is treat yourself to one of our perks! &gt;&gt;&gt;

Please Note: We'll be updating this page regurlarly with more information on our perks, so keep popping back.


**What should I expect...**

Expect something different, expect unusual, insightful and the embarrasingly obvios, from rap battling to develop slogans or uncovering methods on how to thought shower with the world - this is fun, it works and we call it 'new thinking'.


**What exactly is Shift then...**

Shift is an open studio that provides internship and placement opportunities to emerging creative talent. Providing an inspirational co-working environment for a dynamic mix of emerging talent to create, innovate and collaborate on live projects. The studio shares skill sets, excitement, resources, ambition and the simple requirements of a creative studio.

Its output will include work from its founding partner Studio Precept, undertake community lead projects, competition briefs, culture shift research and independent projects commissioned to the studio. It's mission is to explore new working methods in branding, emerging technologies and multi-channel media as an ever evolving agency model. Its findings will be used to inspire creativity and encourage innovation - in turn becoming a catalyst for improving education, inspiring entrepreneurship and creating jobs.


**Right, so who's behind it...**

Shift was founded by Nick Johnson, MD of creative agency, Studio Precept. Driven by a niggling urge to take projects beyond the brief, his desire to empathise and to do the right thing in giving something back and creating opportunities. Shift was born from good morals and it's ethos is not to do things right - but to do the right thing.

Nick truly believes that innovation begins with people having fun and that aspiration breeds innovation. Through pairing vivid imagination with a collective vision we believe we can create and define a brighter future. Shift it is not at all about productivity but impact, not excellence but significance and unearthing something new.

Alongside Nick you'll find co-founder and Shift Studio Manager Andrew Kilburn and the studio's current trio of team leaders; James McCaughan (New Media), David Carr (Copywriter) and Carl Storey (Art Director). Followed by our current army of change makers; Mark (Creative), Josh (Creative), Wes (Editorial), Rachel (Product), Sam P (Designer), Sam H (Graphics) and Alex (Illustrator/Animator).

Shift will evolve organically as we look to expand and as our interns one by one move on into full time employment. So much so we're currently in the process of building a diverse team of interns, collaborators and mentors to get involved with our projects and our up and coming event. If that could be you, please don't hesitate to contact Andrew andy(at)studioprecept.co.uk to get involved. You can also keep up to date with our progress and help us spread the word on twitter, follow us @weare_shift


**Great, so where will the money go...**

The $15,000 (or whatever we raise) will help make our vision for the 'Taking Creativity Forward' event a reality and allow us to produce and amazing publication in our first edition of 'white label'. We're not in this to make a profit, but any remaining proceeds from the event will simply go towards the running costs of the Shift studio, it's tech needs and basic office equipment. If we exceed our expectations and we raise more than our target, we’ll reinvest back into the internship programme to give further opportunities to emerging creative talent.


**Finally, what does the future hold for Shift...**

As well as an innovation lab Shift is available to clients and brands just like any other agency; however, they will be getting something completely new and often unexpected - and becasue it's ran by interns it's really cost effective too. Through this unique approach we hope to build a finanically stable internship programme, offering a fantastic service that covers it's costs and continues to provide fantastic opportunities to emerging talent. In addition we want to continue to showcase this talent and our findings through running more events and producing further 'white paper' publications.

We’re 100% committed to making Shift a huge sucess over the coming months, and have put a lot of blood, sweat and tears in to get this far. We see a future where Shift is self funded but first we need your help to get Shift off the ground!

So please get involved, do your bit to support new thinking and for the future of the creative industries - help us take creativity forward.

If the perks don't work for you then contact andy(at)studioprecept.co.uk to offer alternitive forms of support. Every little counts and a 'Good Luck' message will go a long way.

x76cc,1,2012-07-26,"Can any Redditors going to, or currently at, Disney World EPCOT help me out with a project ?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x76cc/can_any_redditors_going_to_or_currently_at_disney/,"Thanks for stopping by. This takes a little explaining. 

TL:DR I need someone to take a few good photos of the piggy bank object from the ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at EPCOT Innoventions so I can 3D print it for my 3 year old who has been begging for it for a solid week. I'm not kidding. He is that obsessed and the pig is apparently that cute. Read on.


I was at EPCOT with my 9 year old and 3 year old boys last week. Long story long, the 3 year old's favorite thing on the planet was the T Rowe Price sponsored ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at Innoventions 'cause you get to carry around this football sized piggy bank and put it in these machines and it animates on screen and you get to push and pull things and go wheee ! He loved it more than anything else we did all day... yeah... But then the last machine kept the pig and the game was over and there was a 3 second beat as the look of bewilderment spread across his face and he turned to me with wide teary eyes and asked : ""Wah piggy go?"" (Translation: ""Where's mah muhfuggin PIG ?) To which my only possible response was ""Piggy went bye bye""... This was evidently not the correct answer. Bewilderment led to anger, hate, tears and the dark side... Total elapsed time 4 seconds. Result, 30 mins of all out, nuclear powered, steam driven rage face on this kid which simmered and boiled off into a tarry, black, 60 year reserve supply of resentment and bitterness which you can still see lurking just behind his eyes when they catch the light just right.

Meanwhile, 10 seconds after the occurence of the great pig disappearance of 2012, the look of bewilderment was on my face as well because that game character appears to be the only one at Disney that's not on sale. (With the exception of the live ""Ariel"" character. It is NOT ok to ask. Different story. Moving on.)

Anyway, fast forward a week later and I have a 3 year old who's waking up in tears every morning asking where piggy went because he's still DREAMING about the T Rowe Price Pig EVERY night. This bears repeating... out of ALL the damn Disney characters we saw, every one of which can be bought within a 5 minute walking distance of any geographical location in the continental United States, he wants the friggin piggy bank character made out of mil-spec, platinum plated Unobtanium. And he will-not-let-it-go. Accept no substitutes... yadda, yadda.

So I have a solution. I am a 3D modeler (and intern architect). I can 3D model this pig. I also have access to a 3D printer... Yay me !

  I have no reference photos to work from however. I didn't take any pictures during that game. I would need a couple of decent front, side and top views to model from traditionally, or a series of shots taken all around the object to use photogrammetry software (like Agisoft Photoscan http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/ )

So if anyone who is going to EPCOT can stop by Innoventions and manage to find the time to take a few pictures of the Piggy Adventure piggy bank character you have no idea how happy that would make me. As well as this future Darth Bundy currently residing in my house. Think of it as saving the Galaxy from evil. Lots of karma involved.

Meanwhile, for those of you who don't have a 3 year old at home yet ... be advised that reproduction potentially leads to a dramatic increase in ""Maker"" skills with an associated dramatic loss of any free time you might have had left to spare.

Many thanks for taking the time out of your lives to read this far. Protip: If you are at work and still reading this you're going to have a bad time..."
x70l0,0,2012-07-26,"Finally left my job of 2 1/2 years, and I feel great! Reddit, what is the worst job you've had, and why? ",BenFalvey,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x70l0/finally_left_my_job_of_2_12_years_and_i_feel/,"I worked for a chain supermarket for about a half year before they switched me to the Dairy Dept. I did really well, but, to simplify, they hired 3 new people who made a mess of the dairy products in the case (Didn't rotate the case) and I had to clean it all up one night. Every time I went to put anything out, I would have to rotate the case, which is time consuming. On top of that, I was training one of the three new people who recently came to the department, and at the end of the night didn't have time to put out the milk. However, I put out some anyways, and left a note for my manager. It didn't matter. The next day, the store manager decided that I didn't deserve to be there anymore and moved me. I called my Union, and they never got back to me. The next day, they put me in Grocery, and I sliced through my finger with a box cutter that slipped on the edge of a box. I called the Union that day, and they didn't get back to me then either. They took the money for that day and the rest of the weekend out of my sick pay. 

I went back to the front end, (Carts, Cashier, Bagger) and started to really not mind the job. I then moved and transferred to another store, where I stayed as cashier until June. During that time, I was harassed by my manager over the phone for calling out for my uncle's funeral. I suppose I could've skipped it, but he was my godfather, his wife is my godmother, and I was a pallbearer. I called the Union, and they didn't show up, they sent the store steward, who was the front manager's buddy. The steward was also the meat manager. The front manager acted like it didn't matter what was going on outside of work, and that I had to be at work when I was scheduled. I protested, since this was an emergency, but all three managers in the room, agreed that I was being unreasonable. I settled with them, and didn't really care so much about it, as I wasn't getting fired. 

I continued to work there from Sept. 2011, to June 2012, when I asked to be switched to another department, due to a customer telling me to ""Go fuck yourself"" after I asked for her ""Fuckin (Store Name) card."" The people at my store were scum, and I had four bad customers in a row that day. I didn't want to work up front anymore, and the managers said that there was an opening in Meat. I always heard that Meat came with a pay raise and all sorts of perks, so I jumped on it. I was then ignored, never properly trained, and left alone. They expected me to clean the machines at night, which I was taught, but not right. I was taught four different ways that all conflicted and did things completely different. I cleaned for the first week and a half, and then got yelled at for not putting any meat in the case at the end of the night. I was never even told that I had to do that, and it made everything a lot more rushed. 

The first Sunday I worked in the department, (Sundays are the worst days due to high volume of people) I was harassed by another employee, which I made clear to my supervisors. They didn't do anything about it, and put me on the next Sunday with someone even newer than me. They expected me to work Seafood that night, which I had never been trained for. The night was a disaster and a mess. We did what we could, but the other guy in the meat dept. didn't start on the machines until way too late. I left a note stating that I was putting in my two weeks. It wasn't worth it anymore. The next day, I came in, and the guy who harassed me two Sundays ago told me that ""He knew I didn't give a shit..."" and I walked away to talk to a manager. The manager ignored the harassment again, and apologized for the situation. I told him that I wanted to finish out my two weeks and leave. The following Friday, my harasser was working with me alone. He refused to take customers he was supposed to serve and called a manager on me. This is a guy who smoked pot, came back reeking of it, and did nothing for an hour, which I made clear to my supervisors who didn't care. 

A manager came down, and I told him that I was focused on cleaning the machines, because if I didn't someone could get salmonella. He left and came back later, after I had finished. After finishing everything I went home. I came in the next day and a manager told me that yesterday should have been my last day. I protested, called the union, and after typing up a full report for my union rep even longer than this, my union rep told me that I didn't need to do anything. It was company policy that an outside company handled all the HR now, and that my reference from the company would consist of my date of hire and the date that I left, and a list of my company duties. When I found that out, I threw the Union meeting. I didn't go, and let my rep know that he should cancel it. 
The next day, I found out that the Seafood manager ratted out the Meat manager (I had never seen or heard from either of them for the whole month I worked in the department) about a separate harassment case. The Meat guy touched some girl in an abusive way at work, and was now getting fired. The manager who ignored me, was getting moved over the incident. The store had the health department called on them for not using the right chemical to clean the machines for weeks. I didn't do any of those things, and when I heard through my (Retired from the same union) father's contact in the higher up of the union, I laughed really hard. 

The next day, I got called by a TV show that I love for an internship opportunity, after I sent them a resume with some fan mail. I have an interview at another job, and while it's not guarenteed, I know the head manager there, and a lot of the employees, so I have a decent shot. I have never felt better in my life as the day I walked out of that building and never looked back. I'm really excited for the future now. The question I have for you, reddit, is what is the worst job you've ever worked, and why? 

TL;DR I was harassed and screwed around by my job for two and a half years without ever being able to defend myself. When I did, I felt great and left the job. What is the worst job you ever worked, and why?"

After she spent about 15 mintues complaining about the CD and the program my boss told her ""Make a copy of it*(the CD)* and leave the copy in my mailbox in the lounge. So I can see what's wrong."" Later on that day my boss comes in laughing with a sheet of paper in one hand.  The piece of paper had a photo copied black and white picture of the CD and the words ""Thanks"" written on the bottom. And then he goes ""I guess she doesn't know what 'make a copy of it' means..."" So he goes into Google and prints out a picture of a cockroach and writes ""No problem, I found it"" and places that picture in her mailbox in the lounge.  After that I never heard anything about her again. 

I don't know if she realized how silly it was of her to send in a photocopied picture of the CD and was embarrassed to really ask for help again OR if she thought that he found the bug and it was somehow fixed. o_o"

I currently have a CompTia A+ certification and two Cisco Systems program completer certificates. Suffice to say, I spent a lot of time in the computer lab and had a pretty good plan worked out.

Then, I took AP Literature and Composition. 

My love for books and the English language was one I had acknowledged from an early age; I devoured books and consistently did well in my humanities classes. But it was always a hobby beside my ""work"", that being IT. As I progressed through my senior year, my true loves and passions began to show themselves, and I found myself at a crossroads. Pay for college and learn something to make money, or pay for college and learn something I truly loved and wanted to learn. 

I chose the latter, and now I am 100% set in my decision. I have one IT internship lined up and an interview for a second one(At my college) coming up soon. I'm getting a Liberal Arts degree, I know the consequences, and I am fully prepared for it because it's something I love.

I had to turn down the offer because my father didn't agree to co-sign my loans on top of my student loans and the chances of funding were not likely.

So, I've decided to pay off my loans a bit further and see if I can build more research experience *and* potentially raise my GPA/GRE scores a bit. But in order for me to accept admission to anywhere (assuming I'd get accepted), I need funding so that's why I'm posting this here.

*My stats:*

* GPA: 3.1/4.0--I graduated from UW-Madison which is a leader in the subfield I'm interested in. I intend on raising this and building my academic strengths by taking a statistics course and a biology course or two.

* GRE: (old scores): 630V (91%), 500Q (27%), and 5.0/6.0 (84%). I intend on retaking it to raise my quant score because it is embarrassingly low.

* Research experience: field school (top of the class), original research project (which I'll be presenting at an academic meeting in September), and lab work in a neuropsych lab

* One of my LOR writers is an expert in the field and another is pretty well known too.

I'm going to be applying for a paid internship where I'd like to get further work for a year. Then, apply to UIUC and a few other places. But in order to do so, I really, really need funding.

With that said, **what makes a candidate very competitive for funding?** Is it the entire package or what in particular do schools look for when providing funding to entering students?"
x5ydw,4,2012-07-25,What was it like when you finally realized you suffer from ADHD?,paradoxcontrol,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/x5ydw/what_was_it_like_when_you_finally_realized_you/,"I'm beginning to believe I'm going through this process right now. After reading the post about the lazy intern that hit the front page, and reading that the OP suffered from ADHD, I too was confronted by my superior about my lack of productivity. After the talk I thought back to that thread, remembering that the OP had sympathized with his employee because his ADHD made it hard for him to focus at times as well. 

The more I thought about it, the more I started to notice that this isn't the first time I've been talked to about my lack of focus. Going all the way back to Elementary School I could think of dozens of times that this exact conversation had happened. 

Currently, I have not actually been diagnosed with anything. I did however schedule an appointment with my doctor so that I can discuss it with them. **(edit: I actually can't even remember what the date was for this appointment! Thankfully they will call the day before...)**  I've spent most of my night reading about ADHD and what effects it has on people. I keep finding my self doing a lot of what is listed. 

I have almost no care towards the consequences of not getting important and long term tasks done. This was part of the issue brought up today with my boss. I work in IT at a school district and we have a limited time table to get a lot of things done before the school year starts again. However, I realize now that each day I come in, I have an extremely low sense of urgency about the summer months. As if putting things off wasn't going to cause chaos later in the year. I honestly can't think of a time where I was worried about anything more then a week or two out. 

When it comes to large tasks I find my self easily pulled away from what I'm doing. This could be anything from opening up Reddit (kind of ironic at the moment) to having someone come in to our office to talk with one of my Co-Workers. This is clearly because my task at hand (be it unboxing large quantities of computers/laptops to calling support lines for tech support on software) has fallen to the lowest part of my interest level, and everything else around me becomes way more interesting and rewarding. Sure unboxing 110 computers means that it'll be easier to image them later, but this link about video games on Reddit is just fascinating!

My memory is also vary poor. I have a really hard time remembering people by name, even if I've worked with them recently. If I've just talked to someone on the phone I can instantly forget their name after I hang up leaving me wondering who I was even talking to. It takes frequent interaction with a person before I can know who they are if someone else is talking to me about them. I can't count how many times a co-worker has asked / said something about ""so and so"" only for me to go ""who is that?"" and have them give me a funny look in return because I should clearly know them. Even things I do every day, or every few weeks, I'll have to ask someone how to do it. Simple example, The DNS setting on just about ANYTHING in our network. I should know that, we use it for everything, and even now I'm having a hard time remembering what it is. 

My room is a mess, I've never been an organized person. My desk at work is also a mess (though to be fare so is everyone else's desk) and I never have an urge to put it in any kind of order. 

I also find my self having to ask someone to repeat something to me, even though they just said it. Its as if the words go in my head and never get anywhere. 

This turned in to a really long post... But its helped me feel better about my situation. I used to think I was just a lazy idiot and never thought about WHY. Now everything seems to make sense. I almost feel angry (at the least annoyed) that I didn't have this realization sooner. Maybe I would have done better in school, stuck it out through collage, continued drawing or pod-casting like I used too. 

I don't expect anyone to upvote this, but if you've ever been where I am now, you know how to show it. 

**TLDR: While unconfirmed, I think I might be suffering from ADHD. Anxiously awaiting a doctor visit to see if my suspicions are correct.**"

So far, I've had one meaningful internship with.. lets say.. Company A, that I really enjoyed. This fall, I will also be studying abroad in europe.

My decision now is what to do with the year and a half that I have when I return from europe. With the number of hours I will have, I will basically have room to do one of these things:

**1.** intern for the second time next summer and get a minor in a subject I enjoy
**2.** study abroad for the second time next summer in Asia and intern next fall
**3.** study abroad for the second time next summer in Asia and get a minor

Regarding the internship, I would probably aim for working for Company A again, except this time in a different city and a different department. I'm very interested in gaining experience in the department I would be interning with. Regarding the minor, it would probably be a liberal arts subject that's not directly related to my desired career, it would just be fun.

Basically, what are your recommendations? I need to find a good balance between what is a fun experience and what is a good experience. Honestly, I'd love to intern again, study abroad again, and get a minor, but I don't really have the time.

x9red,1,2012-07-27,Engineering Graduate in Seattle wanting hands-on job--should I consider manufacturing positions?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9red/engineering_graduate_in_seattle_wanting_handson/,"I am a recent Engineering Master's graduate in the Seattle area. I remember at a time I was worried I would have too many job offers, due to my three degrees and international and domestic internship and research positions. However, it has been 3 months with only a couple of interviews and no job offers. The main complaint I have heard, from those who have given me any feedback, is my lack of hands-on experience with certain manufacturing methods or materials. Most of my experience is all theoretical and academic.

I am in the Seattle area. There are a lot of engineering positions, but also a lot of manufacturing jobs.

I am wondering if I should seek out an entry-level manufacturing or assembly position in the industry I would like to work: in aerospace, composites or plastics. Perhaps I could work a year on the floor to give me a feel for the industry and get my foot in the door at those companies.

My concerns are:

* Will it look bad to the manufacturing hiring manager? Would they avoid hiring somebody who is over-educated for the job and likely to want to move up?
* Would it look bad to the engineering team at the place I find a floor-position?  I hope not, since I would hope to make connections with them.

* Will it add any value to my experience? I have a heavy theoretical background which may be valuable on its own, and may be incompatible with this plan.

I am a computer science major and have basic programming skills, but nothing really noteworthy. The way the company is set up, people that can contribute something usually stick around long-term.

x9jzc,1,2012-07-27,Leaving an internship one week early,Ilurk23,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x9jzc/leaving_an_internship_one_week_early/,"So I'm just finishing week 6 out of 10 of an internship  and I'm looking for a little advice. Before I applied for this internship, my parents scheduled our annual week long summer vacation for the 21st of August, the last week of this internship.

Last week I finish the main project that I was assigned, and figured it couldn't hurt to ask if I could head out a week early to join my family, since I was doing very little. Both of my 'mentors' (we'll call them mentor 1 and 2) said that they would be okay with that, but mentor 2 said he'd have to check with the internship higher ups. 

The higher ups said that I would have to return a minimum of $600, and I don't have a final amount yet, but I am fine giving that up. I figure if I start choosing family over money now, it will be easier to continue doing it. But now mentor 2 is urging me to reconsider, because it could affect my reputation if other employers find out about my leaving.

So which option would you choose? I'm leaning toward leaving.

Here's a little bit about my situation and the internship in general:

* Mentor 1 is my main mentor, but he lives about 7 states away. We email occasionally, but I'm mostly on my own. Mentor 2 rarely comes by to check on me and doesn't really know about my project in any way.

* I know for a fact that nothing of any importance is going to happen that last week. I'm staying two weeks later than the other interns here so no special intern party or anything, and my project is already done

* I am basically responsible for myself. I don't check in or out. Honestly I probably could easily just not show up for the last week and no one would notice, but it's become an issue because I went through the proper channels.

* My roommate situation is less than stellar here and I'm homesick as hell. I'd love to be home asap.

* I already have another internship lined up for next summer through a program at my school.

* I like to think of myself as a person who fulfills any commitment he agrees to.

So what should I do reddit?"

It may be because getting results that positively impact the world takes way too long for my attention span but I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards doing graduate studies in EE but I have a bunch of questions - some of which I have answers to but not very thorough ones. So here goes:

* Are there any exams I need to take? (e.g. GRE)
* Are there courses I should/need to prepare with? I've already taken an electric networks class and I'm starting circuits with lab in the fall.
* Are there any skills I should learn? What resources should I use? I already have a bit of programming experience.
* Do most schools offer stipends/fellowships? How much are they and how hard are they to get? I have a very good GPA but from an almost unknown school.
* How should I decide what schools to apply to?
* Does school 'prestige' matter much?
* How do I find out which schools are 'good'?
* What should I look for in schools I apply to?
* How do I determine whether I want to get a masters or a PhD?
* How is research in EE different from research in physics?
* Can I apply to a masters program and then switch to PhD later on? Can I do the reverse?
* I'm mainly interested in studying signals, communications and networking but also possibly circuits, security, and quantum computing. How do I find out more about these areas and which I am most interested in?
* If you have any other advice or suggestions, I'm all ears!

It was a blast to build and I have been loving it since may when I built it.  I had my share of dumb moments like the time where I forgot to plug in the cpu power and couldn't figure out why it wasn't turning on and when I forgot to put in the standoffs on the motherboard :p but all in all, it came out pretty well.  

I have done some updating since I built like adding in the 750w psu and the gelid silent fans which really do live up to their claim of silence.  I also started with a shitty mouse and a microsoft ergonomic 4000 keyboard which I hated so I splurged on a mechanical which I love so much that I take it to my internship and back every day :)  

But anyway, it runs bf3 on ultra at 1080p pretty well with an average fps of ~50.  I wish I didn't get an ocz ssd and I wish I got a larger one because I have been strapped for space on it.  The boot times are very sub par for a ssd clocking in at 42 seconds when I check the event log :(  It gets from power button to the password screen in 28 though which is better but still nowhere near great.  but here's the specs and special thanks to a redditor by the username of ComancheCorps who provided me quite a few things free of charge despite never even meeting me in his life.

",1nterlude,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xb4yi/looking_for_some_career_advice_sysadmin_i_just/,"I obtained an advanced diploma (3 years) in Computer System Technology in Canada, with the focus of networking. Those classes were certified Cisco classes, and gave me experience to obtain my CCNP if I wanted to.  I live in a small town, and IT jobs here are scarce. I might see one posted somewhere in a month, that's if I'm lucky. For the time being I'm working a retail job full time, minimum wage. I'm in debt from school, and I do not own a car, so moving somewhere else is out of the question for the next six months to a year. My first step is to start saving money to obtain some certifications.

I'm very worried I'm losing potential work experience. I feel the longer I work a regular job, the harder it's going to be to find an actual IT job later. This worries me a lot, but maybe I'm worried for nothing.

I'm eager to work, and I love networking. Before I didn't like it a lot, but now it's something I really, really enjoy. I feel like a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" kind of person. 

I guess I can just ask my questions now. 

* Should I be worried about losing potential work experience? I graduated this summer. 
* Should my main focus be to obtain certifications right now?
* Is there a site to practice or do small networking/IT projects? I want to keep my skills up and learn new things, I'd love to use a site that had weekly projects. Sort of like what you'd expect from a classroom. I'd probably need to learn linux the most.
* Is there work I can do remotely? Obviously I wouldn't expect a full time job working from home in IT, but are there places that require small projects that could be done remotely? 
* Anything I should know or do in the meantime?

I want to work badly, but I just feel lost. I'd love to be an unpaid intern for an IT department, but I just can't afford to not make money. 

Any help or advice would be amazing :) "

I'm 29 years old.

I'm twenty or thirty pounds overweight.

I got an Associate's degree in Computer Science from an accredited technical college back in November.

I had to quit my (night) job in October in order to complete my mandatory (unpaid) internship.

Since then, the only job I've had was a two-month temporary position working at an IT help desk. That helped me get caught up on my bills, but money slips away pretty quickly.

In June, right after my birthday, my girlfriend of 3+ years left me.

I live in a trailer with with Dad and my sister.

I believe that I suffer from depression. I'm pretty sure it's why I let my girlfriend leave. She would probably even get back together with me now, but... I can't do it.

I've alienated most of my friends by working nights and then working nights while going to school. They've all moved on in the last few years, while I haven't, really.

I'm not even really sure what advice I'm looking for, Reddit. I'm trying to get a job and I'm working on losing weight(lost 20 pounds since June!), but I just can't muster up the motivation to actually TRY. I put forth a half-assed effort at pretty much everything I do, because nothing seems worth the effort.

For example, getting into shape is fine and all, but I'm not really doing it for myself. I'm doing it to impress whichever shallow girl I meet next.

Working is fine, too, but I'm not doing it for myself. No job I've ever held has ever paid enough to justify all of the work I've had to do.

In college, I graduated with a 3.95 GPA, I had Perfect Attendance and made Dean's List throughout my entire academic career, but... so what? I'm still unemployed nine months later! It seems like all of my hard work was wasted.

I guess what I really want is advice about what to do differently, Reddit. I'm just really, really unhappy with my life.

(note: And don't worry, I'd never commit suicide, I know better than *that*.)"

I'm a 23 year old college graduate. I've got a steady part-time job that pays me just barely enough to cover all my bills. I use my days off at an unpaid internship at the company of my dreams - I won't say where for privacy reasons, but in my field they are a very big name and I'm doing real work in the internship so I'm hoping this will let me break into the industry after my internship concludes in October. It's not an ideal situation, but I'm only 2 years out of college in a shit economy and I've been working really hard with what I have. With a $1,200/month income, I pay my $550 rent, $200 in public transportation to and from work and internship, and use the remaining $300 for food, expenses, etc. Even living on the edge like this, I managed to save up an emergency fund and pay down my credit, though the latter has been slowly creeping back up. I have worked very, very hard to become a financially responsible person with the little I have. But I had one blind spot, and it turns out it was a doozy. The only bill I wasn't paying was my student loans, as my parents said they would make payments for awhile until I got a real full-time job. My parents are horrendous about money even though my dad is a fucking accountant, and I realize now I should have been more vigilant - calling the banks to confirm, etc. I have been asking about my student loans - how much are the payments? how much do I owe? who do I owe it to? but my dad doesn't. talk. about. money. I even tried getting around him to figure out what phone number to call to speak to somebody else so I could get the answers, but I didn't know where to start. They assured me it was fine, so I let myself believe that it was, despite their utterly irresponsible attitude towards money. I told myself it would only be a short while longer until I got a real job and became financially independent and would not need to worry about them anymore.

Well, I stopped by my parents' house yesterday to hang out while they were on vacation (since they have a tv and I wanted to watch the Olympics). There was an unopened letter addressed to me sitting on the steps. I opened it up and it was a letter from a collections agency letting me know that my federal student loans are in default. I was completely floored. There had never even been a hint that they weren't making a payment - I have enough emergency money in my savings that I would happily have dipped in to make it if they were having a hard month, but they didn't say a word. I dug around and found an entire stack of unopened letters, clearly bills from the Department of Education, dating back over a year, complaining of late payments and missed payments. I'm thousands of dollars past due.

What can I do? Who do I talk to? What are my options, if any? I don't know where to turn. I live exactly on the edge of my income right now. Originally my student loan payments were around $200 which would be really fucking hard to make, but maybe if I dipped into my savings for a few months I could make it - but as it stands now, I can't possibly make the huge past due payments. How will this affect finding another apartment in the future? My credit is ruined, I'm sure.

Worst of all, while I can rebuild my credit over time with hard work, I don't know if I can ever rebuild my trust in my parents. This is not the first time they've done something of this kind to me. They are so irresponsible they're on the verge of losing their house. They've stuck their head in the sand about money for the last year, and not only are they sinking into an abyss of their own making, now they're willingly pulling me in with them. I could have done something about the payments *if only I had known* but they didn't say a word, even when I asked them point blank about it. I've always loved my parents, so the thought that I can't trust them is rocking my universe and I don't even know what the right choices are anymore. If anybody has advice, I would really appreciate it. Obviously in this economy I'm not the only person having problems with student loans, so hopefully any advice you have would be of use to them as well. Thank you. "

I'm currently an undergrad college student and was wondering if anyone had any input on good places to apply for internships during the summer break months. 

I'm going into my sophomore year of college and am pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS) through my university's School of Business. I want to get a jump start on my future and see what options are available for places to work at in my near future and I tried to apply for internships this summer through career fairs which the School of Business held my freshman year, but was unsuccessful in my attempts. Each potential employer found that while my grades were good and I had valuable work experience toward my major (I work as an IT guy for the library on my campus during the school year) I was too young for what they were looking for as they wanted to give more opportunities for upperclassmen who were nearing graduation.

I didn't think much of not obtaining an internship at the time. I figured I would just work at a place locally during the summer to help with college expenses and try again next year so I took up a job as a lifeguard at a local water amusement park around where I live. This is my final day working at said water park, and I can easily say it has been one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, I try to keep an optimistic outlook on whatever job I have and put my best foot forward. I realize that every job has bad days and you might not always work fore the most tasteful of people, but I can easily say that working as a lifeguard this summer has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had and has made me appreciate my college education and the importance of finding a REAL job astronomically more. 

So I am heading back to my university in 3 weeks, excited as ever to continue my education and am ready to put in my best effort to obtain a job that I am happy working at. 

Once again, if you have any recommendations for good places to intern for as an undergraduate MIS student (or any undergrad student for that matter) or have had any good experiences working at at internship, please let me and any other college redditors know!

Much appreciation,

Jackie Molasses

**TL;DR:** Worked at a terrible job this summer. Looking for recommendations for good places to intern at in the future for an undergrad college student."

I remember not too long ago, I was a silly little freshman starting high school. The only things important to me at that times were video games, tech, and many of the first world problems we all encounter on a daily basis.  

Now, I look at myself, and it's hitting me. I'm not a little **** anymore. I start my sophomore year of college in about 3 weeks. By this time next year, I'm going to be a 20 year old, looking for internships at some (hopefully) big name tech companies... and I'll be looking for a place that I can truly call my own down in Austin. I really have looked myself and noticed just how different freshman-year me and current me is, and to me, it's amazing just how much I've changed.  

Partly because of this place and college, I've become... I suppose a bit wiser.  If I'm going through some rough situation, I am now able to think about people who could be going through much worse, and put it in perspective to kinda keep myself going.  I can say that after becoming atheist more than a year ago, I've learned to take many things I see with a grain of salt -- by that, I mean that I'll go out of my way to verify any claim/point/whatever it is that is presented to me, as opposed to just accepting it at face value.  On top of this, I'm finding that, if I work hard enough... I'm capable of whatever it is that I put my mind to, mundane as this sounds.  While these are just a few things that I'm mentioning, I mention them because these changes are the ones that are very important to me, if that makes sense.

I'm really genuinely curious to know if any of you have had the same thoughts cross your mind in any way.  How much have you guys changed over the years?  Are you at all surprised by just how much you've changed?"

Is there anything we can do?",Jombozeus,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/xbo8e/police_forced_so_to_take_the_ambulance_by/,"My girlfriend (under 21), was intercepted on university campus by police on her way home while heavily intoxicated but not to the point of needing paramedics. The police called the paramedics and demanded that she gets on the stretcher despite her refusal. Then the police immediately threatened to take her to jail if she didn't go.

This is pretty obviously extortion but I know there is no likelihood of suing. Especially because in California, state law allows paramedics to treat a patient under implied consent when the patient is intoxicated.

However, forking out $1400 for a &gt;2 mile ride while being forced to is ridiculous and however we can reduce this amount would be the ideal.

What can we do the challenge the bill? Can she write to the hospital and challenge the amount with a combination of her low income (intern) and the fact that she was forced by a police?

Thanks."

Now mind you he isn't always like this, it goes for a week then will come back for a week. He says that I'm the only one who cares about him in this world and that he loves me so much, but he's afraid that he won't make me happy because he is depressed. It's hard to get him to open up, but he does he just cries and cries. It hurts my heart.

For the first time he has not been beside me, he's gone to do an internship a couple hours away but this is when I noticed it getting worse. When we are together he says he's fine fine, but when he's alone he gets anxious and feels like he will lose me or fail at something. All these things are what he has told me. Recently he wanted to break up because he thought his depression would ruin this relationship eventually, I was very hurt. I love him a lot, but I told him I had to move out then. Essentially I was heart broken, still am a little. The second I tried to leave he just cried and begged me to stay. I want to help him, but he refuses to go to therapy. I am afraid he will continue to feel this way."

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xeleb/i_need_to_move_but_im_literally_stuck_what_should/,"Hi Redditors -- I'll be 22 next month, heading to graduate school in D.C. this fall. It's something I've worked toward for as long as I can imagine, and the reason I pushed myself so hard during college. D.C. is also where I've gotten to experience my first taste of independence (through an internship), so it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to live out a dream, permanently.

Some background: My family is extremely oppressive, likely suffering from a combination of personality disorders, control issues, and trouble accepting my adulthood. For example, I've been obstructed from getting my license, can't drive with friends, or do much of anything by myself. (I'm an only child.) They consistently mock, taunt, and disapprove of my education, relationships, and even emotions. In the past, they've called the police to 'parent' my ways and knock 'sense' into me, threatened to sabotage relationships, and destroy my property. On the night before my graduation this past May, my father left a voicemail ""disowning"" me and telling me that he doesn't care if I'm dead or alive. It's abusive, to say the least.

I've been living at home for the summer, in a guest room, tolerating this for the past two months after graduating college. I've also been working remotely, and making money to support basic things for myself financially. I've signed a lease that starts on August 20th. About $150,000 in student loans begin the same day. Where my parents offer to make themselves available to help, they revoke their offer from one day to the next and hold it over my head in a very manipulative way. Because I don't have a license, the $700+ to pay professional movers, or friends who are available to help on moving day, I'm not sure what to do. I've got about 8-10 medium sized boxes to move, and not much else besides that. I'm scared that I'll miss the boat on something I want so badly.

I'm considering bargaining with movers next, and agreeing to pay them once I get to D.C. (and have access to the disbursed loans, even if it eats into my budget). Other than that, do you have any suggestions for what I can possibly do to get unstuck and moved on with (no pun intended) my life? 



Sincerely,

Stressed Like Sisyphus "

Can someone with a knowledge of mental health give me some insight on what could be happening?,throwawaybootymeat,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xdle7/my_friend_has_been_acting_very_weird_lately_and/,"Sorry for the vague title, but I didn't really know how to word what is going on. This is going to be a pretty long post, but I would love some insight as to what might be going on.


So this guy has been my friend since preschool. He has always been well liked, fun to be around, and just an all around good guy. He comes from a good home, got good grades, was good at sports, and seemed to be doing perfectly fine until now. He is 22 and in college, and some very odd things have been happening lately. Me and my friends have been racking our brains trying to figure it out, but it is just too strange to figure out.


I will start in December which is the last time I saw him functioning normally. He was doing very well in school and didn't seem like there was anything bugging him. He partied quite often but it didn't interfere with school at all. Where things start getting odd is around spring break. On the first night around 5, he got drunk and managed to get separated from everyone, and misplaced his phone. No one heard from him until the next afternoon. It looked like something was bothering him and everyone was wondering what it is. He said that he cleaned his bank account out at a strip club (which is true), and then some people let him sleep at their place that night (unconfirmed). After that night, he was still functioning somewhat normally, but still seemed like something was bugging him. He was in this state for about a month and a half, but then things got a lot worse. 

Around the end of the school year, he just seemed brain dead. He would hardly talk, he would stare off into space, and he was extremely anti-social. We would go out to eat, and he would sit at the table and not say anything, and would randomly walk to bar and sit down and not order anything. He would just stare at the tv. And I'm telling you, he used to be the most outgoing and social person I have ever met. But he just became detached from reality. 


When the school year ended, he began a new internship out of state. No one was really in contact with him, except for one mutual acquaintance from high school that was doing an internship at the same place. This girl did not know my friend, but she knew of him and knew who he hung out with. She called me and a couple of my other friends and asked what was wrong with him, because he seemed like he was just ""not all there."" At this point, me and my other friends have talked to our parents asking for advice, and they all suggested we talk to this guy's parents. We took their advice, and they said they had noticed some things too. We left, and within the next hour or so, this guy called his parent's and told them that he was detoxing from painkillers, relapsed, and needed to go to rehab. 


His parents flew to the place he was working and took him to the hospital. At the hospital, they gave him a blood test and a urine test. Both came back negative. They did the test again and got the same results. This was peculiar, but they still checked him into rehab anyways. 


A little over a week into rehab, his parents got a call from the treatment center he was at. They said that he went out for a walk by himself, and came back all cut up and bruised. When they asked him what happened, he told them that he took a large dose of benzos and fell into a bush. The treatment center was baffled that he was able to get drugs in there, and they wanted to see if he brought any other drugs with him. They gave him a hair follicle test, which can detect any drug use in the last 90 days. When they read the results, they were shocked to see that the results came back negative for every single drug they tested for. That is where this is at now. His parents are confused, me and my friends are trying to put the pieces together to have some sort of clarity. What we think is going on is that he has a very deep, dark secret that has been eating at him for a while, and he just completely lost it. So anyone have any idea what could be wrong with him? 


**TL;DR- Friend of mine who used to be very social has become quiet, distant, and seemingly brain dead. It kept getting worse and worse until he claimed to have a drug problem and needed to go to rehab. In rehab, they drug tested him and showed no signs of any drug use in the last 90 days.**

* IPv6 Silver Forum Seal
* 1 Microsoft Cert (Not sure which one)


I will also have had 1 semester minimum of required internship, as well as any other internships/coops that I can get. On top of all of that, I am in the top 5% of my class, consistent Dean's List, as well as founder/president of one of the east coast's top eSports clubs. 

I was just curious, do you think I will be in a good position when I graduate? I know that experience is a really big factor in everything, but just going off my degree, the certs I'll have, and the expected internship experience, how do you think I will be? Any chance someone might possibly know a round-about number for a starting salary?

I look forward to being able to contribute more into this subreddit soon!

My grades are above the median, which puts me in a good (not great) place for landing interviews later on. I am currently taking a leave of absence from school to make sure law is for me. I got an unpaid six-month internship at a small law firm doing mostly paralegal work. I hate it. I've disliked studying law my entire first year at school, and now I realize I dislike practicing. It's not that it's too difficult - I just don't enjoy it. I tell myself that if I could do it all over again, I'd go into computer science. The idea of coding and creating a program from nothing appeals to me. Plus, there's a better market for CS grads than JDs. 
Problem is, I've never taken any real math courses in college. I've never taken a programming class. I'll probably need to audit some courses at a community college in basic programming to make sure it's for me. 
My question for you, members of this sub, is this: if I find out I like it, what should my next steps be? I have $40k in debt from my first year of law school and no background in math. Should I go back to school for a BS in Comp Sci? Should I start with an Associate's from a community college? Full time or part time? I'm single with no real obligations other than my debt. Are there any other options for someone in my position who wants to program someday? 
Finally, if I do go back to school, I'm torn between Boston (where I go to law school), Chicago (my friends/family), and Los Angeles (some family/where I'm working now at the unpaid internship). From an employment standpoint, which of these three is the best? Or is that even the right question to ask?
Thanks, all. I could really use some direction. "

My job this summer was to go to every computer (about 250-300) that the company owns, join them all the the new domain, and transfer all their data from their old profile, to the new one that is added after joining them to the domain.
My company has 3 different buildings, all within about a 1 mile radius. The building that I work in had no serious problems joining the domain. Everything went according to plan. But the central administration building, about a mile away, is having some serious problems joining Windows XP machines to the domain.
Basically whats happening is I'll join the PC to the domain, enter my admin credentials, and it will take about 5 minutes to actually connect to the domain. Now this wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that now if I try to log into any domain account at all, it takes about 30-45 minutes JUST TO LOG IN. I figured it would be only the first login attempt that would take that long because it has to configure all the files and settings, but I tried it again and again and it still won't speed up at all.
I've tried ipconfig /flushdns, and updating and disabling our firewall and got nothing. Any help would be greatly appriciated. Thanks!"

me: 25 years old virgin female not waiting till marriage but until i find myself a healthy loving mutually fulfilling relationship with a great thoughtful guy.  working as a part time intern. muslim background but lived in the u.s for 10 years now.

him. 23 year old grad student also working as an intern at the same company. southern white preppy background with no previous history of dating someone ""brown"".

background:
so i met this guy through a mutual friend about a month and a half ago at an after work happy hour. i was in a relationship at the time and didn't think much of it when he casually said that i was ""a lovely pakistani girl"" and asked me for my number so he could ask me to hang out with him and our other friends. we did have a good conversation and i recall finding myself intrigued that even though he was a rich sheltered white preppy kid, he was passionate about the middle east and spoke farsi and arabic. i love intellectually curious people and certainly thought he was the kind of person i'd like to keep in my friendship circle.

two weeks later i was still reeling from my bf breaking up with me and met up with my friends for a farewell happy hour for an intern who was leaving for a new job. he was there and arrives late and finds a seat next to me.  we got to talking and in our drunken-ness flirt mildly back and forth. after a couple hours later everyone else leaves except for our mutual friend and his girlfriend and the boy and i. we decided to take the party to his apartment. once there he serves us wine and puts on amazing music and we sit back and hang out. sometime during the night he starts telling me how beautiful he thinks i am. i don't think much of it seeing as how he was piss drunk, and just laugh it off. he keeps telling me how gorgeous and beautiful i am. and just came on so strong. i was flattered and was very attracted to him as well but didn't indulge him too much. around midnight i tried i realized it was too late to metro home and he asks us to crash at his place. he gets me a pair of his pjs to change into seeing as how my work clothes were very uncomfy. i slip into his pjs and crawl onto his bed with a headache and wanting to sleep. sometime during the evening i find him curled up next to me and he starts kissing my neck...it feels great but i recall that he has a long distance gf. and pull back and tell him to stop.  he says that he isn't into his gf and she makes him so miserable. i say he should break up with him then. he says he wants to but he is so scared to hurt her and how it sucks breaking up with her. he tries to kiss me and i push him away. he says im beautiful and i say if he thinks so he should break up with his gf wine me and dine me and then he would even have a chance to kiss me. he stares at me and goes ""you're a good one aren't you?""

i turn around and fall asleep. in the morning the rest of us sneak out leaving him alone since he was deep asleep. the week that follows i recall being charmed and thinking he was sexy and wishing he was single. mid week our mutual friend IMs me to tell me that the boy broke up with his gf. i was horrified but he said it had nothing to do with me and was a long time coming. meeting me made him realize there were other women out there. a couple days later i get a text from the boy asking me if id be free to meet him for dinner/drinks after work.  i figure...whats the harm?

we meet for drinks/food. he is SO nervous. it is pretty evident he hasnt officially been on a ""date"" for a very long time. we have a pretty fun time and he regales me with stories about his crazy stunts from college. i find his boyish sense of mischief endearing and his intelligence mesmerizing.

needless to say we continue hanging out and after work. either getting drinks and/or dinner and then coming to his place to make out and cuddle. for fourth of july he hosts a party and invites me and says i should get to know his sister.i was nervous since it is WAAYYYY tooo soon for an official family meet but then was surprised how casual it was. 

a couple days later. he got sick and i cancelled our plans to watch star wars and insisted i drop off some soup. when i got to his apartment he was a bit aloof and more distant than usual.i was a bit put off but didn't want to jump to any conclusions. the day after he texts me saying it was very sweet of me to bring by soup. the following monday i texted him asking if he was free to hang out for a while that evening. he said he has some food at home and will be cooking. i go over and he prepares this lovely plate of bbq chicken with wine and hors d'oeuvres and cookies for dessert. it was pretty unexpected and i made sure to thank him for going all out. i slept over that night and in the morning he asked me to help him pick out his suit for work. after he insisted i stay as long as i like and shouldn't rush out with him. i browsed job boards on his laptop and munched on a pop tart before leaving two hours later. he texted me later that evening thanking me for the ""sweet"" thank you note i left on his table.

the week before he had asked if i wanted to go to the portrait gallery this weds after work. so come tuesday evening i text him to tell him that the gallery will be closed by the time we get around.he says he is on the phone and that it's ""lame"" that its closed. no mention of changing plans or canceling them.

weds evening i email him at work about if he still wants to hang out and do something else. he says he has had a bad day and was planning to just go home but i was welcome to join him. i get a bit irked at him canceling plans without having consulted/told me and say its okay and that we can reschedule. i do feel embarrassed and hurt for having been blown off so thoughtlessly.if i hadnt emailed him to inquire...would he have just left for home without letting me know plans were cancelled? i run into him in the lobby after and actually tell him that it wasnt cool that he blew me off last minute. he seemed aloof ""oh? you want to go to the gallery? lets go to the gallery!"" i was like...""weren't you listening? the gallery is closed"" and then i just say ""forget it. you're fine. its okay"" and say good bye and leave. 

i expect an apology text/call that evening seeing as how i was upset. but i dont get any. he doesnt contact me on friday either. when i ask him to get coffee at work he comes with but is pretty distant and aloof and makes no mention of future plans or apologizes for weds. 

sat afternoon i call him to ask whats up but he doesnt respond. i then call sunday but get no response either. i text him saying "" hi havent heard from you lately so just wanted to ask if you were okay"". he says ""sorry couldnt answer. having lunch with my folks. im ok how're you?"" i text ""oh thats good to know. im great."" he texts back ""good""

monday morning we run into each other at the printer. he makes a comment about my hair and then i ask if he is mad at me since i havent heard from him. he says ""no. why would i be mad at you? we're good"" and then says he has to go to the bathroom and says ""See you around the office"" without making any indication of hanging out.

at this point i stop contacting him and realize he isnt going to text or call or come by my desk to initiate a date. its been three weeks now since the initial cancellation of plans on weds and im not sure if i should pop by his desk to ask to meet up and ask him what happened.


what did i do wrong? did he lose interest or does he think i lost interest or am mad at him for being too tired to hang out? im so confused and any insight would be so helpful

I will be applying for a winter internship/co-op during the fall while also taking courses. I'm wondering whether I can include the subjects and material covered in these courses on my resume. The problem is that although I do not know the material very well right now, I will know it by the time I begin the internship. However, I also don't want the interviewer to start grilling me on these subjects since after all I will be still currently learning them. The reason I want to include them is because I want a job in those areas (low-level/embedded software) rather than another web-dev job.

How can I include material I am currently learning on my resume?
Do 3rd year co-op/intern interviewers generally ask hardcore coding questions and will they grill me on this material?

Edit: Can I also include a personal project (I am making a video game over summer) even if it is not yet complete and may not be complete by the end of the interview?"

tl;dr: I'm trying to make a good impression at work but they threw this new software at me and I am drowning.  I have asked for help and they keep encouraging me to 'figure it out' with no guidance.  Please help me!

edit: I am studying Mechanical Engineering but my boss has given me this programming assignment. I am tying my best to wrap my  mind around it, but I am having a lot of trouble thinking in ladder logic.

xfh2d,0,2012-07-30,Is my becoming friend a douchebag or am I over-reacting? ,weedledum,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xfh2d/is_my_becoming_friend_a_douchebag_or_am_i/,"Hello my fellow redditors,



One of my friends from high school went up to college the same college as me (coincidence) so we decided to room together during our 2nd year with 2 other people that we know. At the beginning of the year my friend (lets call him Sugar Sparkles from now on) would like to do talk to us all of the time and make plans with us. We got along perfectly. However, the 3 of us were not exactly happy with Sugar Sparkles because during freshmen year he planned on living with the track team he was a part of (before they kicked him off the lease) so he came to us at the last minute. I see this as his back-up plan. Then when we were looking for houses for our Junior year he decided to sign a lease with someone from his dorm from Freshmen year. Okay, whatever, we were expecting this. I mean he really didn't want to live with us the first time, right? Anyways this other person (lets call them Jackal...his facial bone structure is identical to one) came to one of our parties. Cool, I'm always down to meeting new people. Well, Jackal, invites a whole bunch of random ass people to our party (not cool, should ask the host first) then he proceeds to go to the fridge when he is drunk and eats all of the food. This is where I am starting to dislike him.



Fast-forward to spring quarter, Sugar Sparkles has proceeded to go out every Thursday, Friday and Saturday with Jackal (I like going out too but holy crap I do have priorities). I had this huge physiology exam on Friday (they were going out Thursday night) and Jackal brings 2 of his other friends. Okay, whatever, I dislike him but as long as Jackal and Sugar Sparkles are not too loud it is okay. Well, of course the music gets blasting so me and my other roommates put our earphones in to muffle the noise. They leave, finally at 11:30! Great! I did the usual where I texted Sugar Sparkles to call me if I am not awake he is too drunk to walk home and I will pick him up (I do this every time my friends go out). Wake up the next morning there is a mother fucking beer can that was opened purposely to be shoved into our toilet. Then there was piss in it too. So, Jackal or one of his friends must of done it. This is where I went from disliking him to me thinking he is the biggest douchebag around. 




Well, now I think Jackal is rubbing too much on Sugar Sparkles. The last 7 months Sugar Sparkles only wants to hangout with me when there is absolutely nothing else going on or nobody else can hangout. Then, he just keeps talking about how awesome Jackal is (all of Sugar Sparkle's stories involves Jackal. Every. Single. One) and how he can't wait to live with him next year and his 2 other friends. Gee, thanks. I invited Sugar Sparkles to go to lunch with me today (this is kinda where I drew the last straw). So, he came to the restaurant. I tried to talk to him but he barely responded. He is leaving for his internship tomorrow. I got him a Starbucks Gift Card (he is going to need the coffee) and a good luck card for his internship.




So redditors, I come to you. I really do like Sugar Sparkles and he has been a great friend to me in the past but I'm honestly just fed up putting all of the effort in to this relationship with barely any effort on his part. Even worse, I just feel like being a back-up friend is the biggest insult you can give to someone. I don't know if I should write a long letter and stick it with the card of all the things that Sugar Sparkles has done to piss me off recently (by writing a letter I can form everything I need to write, correct details and all of the other wrong this he has done to me and our other roommates) or if I should tell him to his face how much I have started to grown to hate him (where I risk offending him the most, possibly). I really want to stay good friends with him like in the past if at all possible but he really needs to put in the effort. Or am I just over-reacting/jealous that he has made a lot of new friends recently? I really do want him to be happy but not at the sake of my happiness too. Any advice on how to save this friendship if possible or what should I do? Also, does anyone know an assassin/ninja to take care of Jackal?



Sorry that is so long but I felt like I needed to put in a lot of details. Thank you very much reddit :) "
